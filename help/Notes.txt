Use bash function 'glff xx' to create file 'xx_FreeFonts.lst' where xx is one of the Language Codes in file 'ISOLanguageCodes.tsv' derived from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes

Use command 'combine xx_FreeFonts.lst and yy_FreeFonts.lst' (from moreurils Ubuntu package) to output common fonts for Language Codes xx amd yy

Run typst fonts to see the fonts that Typst has discovered on your system. Note that you can pass the --ignore-system-fonts parameter to the CLI to ensure Typst won't search for system fonts.
