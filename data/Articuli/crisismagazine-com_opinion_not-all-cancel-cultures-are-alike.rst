Not All Cancel Cultures Are Alike

In the wake of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, we are hearing prominent conservatives agree with the "both sides" narrative. But are things really the same on both sides? * Andrea Madrigal

The shot that assassinated Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk could very well be considered this generation’s version of “the shot heard ’round the world.” No sooner did the news of his shooting spread than chaos descended upon the United States and the world, and not unreasonably so. One of the reasons for this was the way many people on the Left decided to react to Charlie Kirk’s murder in cold blood: with open jubilation, completely disregarding decency.

Had this been a phenomenon only among criminals or gang members, one would not have been surprised. But videos and posts celebrating Charlie Kirk’s death could be found on the online profiles of people who belong to professions once considered to be among the most learned and respected—from doctors, to teachers, and everything else in between. Some conservatives had one response to this: to call for the termination of all of these people from their jobs. They did this not only in a verbal fashion; they also took action in order to bring the terminations about.

This generated even more controversy, not only on the Left but on the Right also, as many expressed their opinion that the Right was now “creating their own cancel culture” or “imitating everything they had first condemned from the Left” prior to tragedy befalling them. In other words, the faction of the Right who thought they were securing justice was accused by their own of having double standards; of playing by the rules so long as the matter did not affect them. Conservatives stood against the injustice that is cancel culture until it related to one of their own, and then they joined the Left, critics said.

The way in which this argument was framed was against the trademark American—or, should I say, liberal and Freemasonic?—cry of freedom of speech.

Founded as it has been upon the Freemasonic principles of “freedom, equality, and fraternity,” it is quite difficult for modern society to understand that error has no rights. We have been taught that free speech protects everyone. Everyone has a right to express himself, regardless of which side of the political aisle he stands on. In fact, we do not even consider whether what we speak is right or wrong. Founded as it has been upon the Freemasonic principles of “freedom, equality, and fraternity,” it is quite difficult for modern society to understand that error has no rights.Tweet This

Prior to this week, I would have thought that many people on the Right still possessed the ability to recognize when something is right or wrong. That is why we fight against the mutilation of children, isn’t it? However, considering how some people have rushed to defend those celebrating the murder of Mr. Kirk, or even those calling for more violence against those who hold the “wrong beliefs,” has me thinking that Charlie Kirk’s death has revealed more than just the hate on the Left (that part of it which had not yet been revealed, at least). It has also revealed the level of moral incompetence on the Right.

We are falling for the argument being foisted on us by the Left: that people have the right to express how they feel politically, and that to curtail this right is to violate their freedom of speech. And we are doing so quite idiotically. What is it that has made it so difficult for a person to know that it is immoral for someone to call for another person’s death, or to cheer when it happens? Apparently, all that our enemies had to do was pull out the “freedom of speech” card for us to reach into the honey like a bear in the woods.

People are put in jail when they commit a crime because it is wrong. Children must be punished when they do something wrong because we recognize they have transgressed the bounds of morality. It is the same thing with celebrating the murder of someone, regardless of whether you agree with his views or not. Why should these people not be punished by society, then? This is why the so-called value of free speech fails miserably if you want to have a society that is moral. If error has no rights, you cannot allow someone to have rights to proclaim that error. It is absurd; it is illogical.

To compare the “cancellation” of those who are celebrating Kirk’s murder and calling for more violence against conservatives to the Left’s cancel culture is like comparing apples and oranges. We are not the same. The Left cancelled people for upholding traditional values and believing in God, whereas the Right is “cancelling” people for the opposite: for glorifying murder and wrongdoing, for idolizing violence and atheism.

If you believe that error has no rights, you will see nothing wrong with people being punished for promoting it. It is only a logical consequence, especially if these people work in institutions such as schools where they are tasked with the formation of young minds. Glorifying murder is inhuman and the action of an uncivilized society. It is barbaric. To allow people with this mindset to form other minds would be wrong.

We also live in a society that is not used to consequences. We can see this when we examine how lax the laws surrounding crime have become. This is why it seems so alien to modern America to see people suffering for actions that are clearly reprehensible. If killing a human being in the womb is acceptable, why is it not acceptable to cheer for the murder of a 31-year-old man when he is outside of the womb?

The Right must understand that what the Left is doing following the death of Charlie Kirk is not expressing their disagreement with his ideas, or protesting his campus debates. They are celebrating his death. That is not disagreement; that is not expressing your opinion which is different from that of your fellow man.

And to those Catholics who are in agreement with the faction of the Right standing with the Left’s cry for “free speech,” may I remind you that cold-blooded murder is a sin that cries to heaven for vengeance in the eyes of God? A woman has been left without her husband; two children have been left fatherless while people cheer; and all you can do is consider how “cruel” it is that these people are losing their position in society for actions more fit for barbarians than a civilized nation?

The only explanation I can find for what is going on in America following the death of Charlie Kirk is that we have abandoned God. Abandon God, and there is no morality. Forget God, and everything becomes acceptable. We have done so, and we have reaped our reward.

There is no political solution to this other than for the nation to return to God. But we first arrived here only because those who still believed in God did not believe in Him enough to take action in society but, instead, were ashamed of their beliefs and decided to sit down with folded hands and watch the consequences unravel; because we are cowardly enough to see error and not call it out to its face; because we make concession after concession, thinking that if we only allow so much then they will leave us alone. What we don’t realize is that we have conceded so much of the pie that they have taken it whole and left us with the pan.

If we are to try and restore sanity to society, it means that we must punish evil—that there must be consequences for committing wrong. There is a place for mercy, but mercy without justice is nothing. It is a lie, a falsehood that is damaging as well as unjust to those who are just.

I never thought I would hear myself saying this, but I support cancel culture. I support the cancel culture that punishes hatred of God. I support the cancel culture that punishes those who do reprehensible evil. I support the cancel culture that cancels those who commit murder and those who support it. I support the cancel culture that allows error the rights it has: no rights at all.

The Right must stop falling for the lies of the Left. This is not an issue of free speech but a matter of what is right and wrong, decent and indecent. Let us not allow them to convince us that a decent person would be capable of cheering for the murder of a good man. Those who would cheer upon the political assassination of a man like Charlie Kirk and the plight of his widow and fatherless children are monsters who are a menace to civilized society.

We must not allow the lines between good and evil to become blurred anymore. If Charles J. Kirk’s assassination is not enough for conservatives to stand up and say “enough is enough” without consideration to the Left, they deserve what is coming to them—and it will not be pretty.

1. Marsha Livingston September 22, 2025 at 10:46 am Error has no rights. I agree with you! BUT this is EXACTLY the argument the original cancel culture uses. If we refuse to submit to their rule, we are evil. Evil has no rights, including the right to life. Take another step in this thoughtful article and show how our obedience to the Commandments is what makes us different. You’re not evil because you disagree with ME. What you’re DOING is evil because it disagrees with civilization, with God.
