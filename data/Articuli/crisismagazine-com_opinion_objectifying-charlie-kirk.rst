Objectifying Charlie Kirk

Charlie Kirk and many others died because they were no longer human to
their killers. They had become nothing more than an object.

I have a little bit of murderer in me. I have a little bit of
perversion in me. I have a little bit of a sadist in me as well. I know
I am not alone in this. I do not believe that these parts of me are
genetic. I am not a Natural Born Killer, as the title of the Oliver
Stone movie suggests that some of us are.

I believe I am a product of the environment in which I grew up, as
Stone’s film shows. It is an environment that is convinced that
vengeance, or “karma” as many online have taken to calling it, is good;
that violence is an acceptable form of entertainment with no impact on
our minds and souls; that legalized porn and normalized, in many
places, prostitution are forms of freedom of expression or speech,
thinking they play no part in the collapse of cultures and society.
Ours is a world in a deep, violent sleep—one so deep that brutal murder
won’t even wake it up.

While scrolling through social media recently, I came across a video
that had as part of its title the words “Instant Karma.” The video was
relatively mild and showed various examples of people “getting what
they deserve” for their bad behavior. I found myself entertained and
watched more. My being entertained wasn’t surprising considering that I
had been bullied as a tween and teen.

I watched a few more, and then other videos started appearing in my
feed: videos of car crashes, people fighting, violent confrontations
with police, and then of war. I realized that I was enjoying watching
people suffer, and I kept hearing myself say, “Good, that’s what they
get.” After watching this content, I noticed a difference in both the
way I drove and my reaction to other drivers, as well as my ability to
interact with people and resolve disagreements without becoming angry
and irritable. Therefore, I cut off my social media use.

My first video game was Pong, back in the late 1970s, and my first
movie was Star Wars, around the same time. I was 7 or 8 years old.
These two forms of entertainment stirred something in me that hadn’t
previously been stirred, as I discuss in my upcoming book Becoming a
Good Man. Pong was the first time I remember wanting to smash something
that I wasn’t good at. I’d been bad at sports that I played with my
family before playing this video game. I would get frustrated but not
violent. Star Wars had an entertaining story, but it was the “action”
that appealed to me—the violence of shooting and fighting.

Pong led me to The Legend of Zelda, which led to Mortal Kombat, which
led to Grand Theft Auto III, where I sat in my living room pretending
to sell drugs, sleep with hookers, and then kill them along with many
others in the game. Star Wars led me to 9 to 5, which led to Fatal
Attraction, which led to Friday the 13th, which led to The Last House
on the Left and The Accused, where women were raped and men were
brutally murdered. My fantasy life began to become more twisted, So,
after a long dark spell, I left the entertainment industry behind.

A Playboy magazine of unknown origin was my first exposure to nudity
and sexuality at age 8 or 9. I knew something was wrong with looking at
women this way, but two women in my life told me that there was nothing
wrong with it, so I kept looking and eventually began to act out
sexually. Playboy led to another more explicit magazine, which led to
straight porn videos, then to gay porn videos, then to phone sex, and
then to a few hookups with people of the same sex.

People became a collection of body parts to be used for pleasure.
During this time, I found it increasingly difficult to maintain my
familial and platonic relationships as well as establish new ones. I
recognized porn as part of my problem. So I threw out my porn stash,
then later deleted the porn I downloaded, then later blocked porn with
a filter. Then I got a cell phone for teens to block apps and chat
lines. This battle is ongoing.

Video games and entertainment normalized violence for me. Porn taught
me that people are objects: a collection of body parts. Social media
brought these two false realities together in my life. The videos I
watched show real people who suffered real consequences and experienced
real suffering. The space in my heart that should hold love,
compassion, mercy, and forgiveness was filled with the desire for
revenge and punishment on those whom I felt deserved it. I was deadened
to seeing people as deserving of dignity, respect, compassion, and
protection from harm. As I filtered humans as objects, my anger—and, in
many cases, hatred for them—grew. This is the environment in which the
assassination of Charlie Kirk occurred.

Revenge cannot be nurtured, violence used as entertainment, and human
beings objectified without terrible impacts on society. If we do not
turn away from these poisons, the wars, school shootings, rapes, and
murders will continue to proliferate and become more brutal and
barbaric. The time for a moderate response has passed. Taking down the
videos of Charlie Kirk’s murder and banning hate speech are not enough.
We can’t “govern” and censor our way out of this.
Revenge cannot be nurtured, violence used as entertainment, and

We as individuals have to choose to step out of the stream of
vengeance, violence, and objectification we live in. We can only change
society by changing ourselves. All three of these are connected. One
abandoned while the others are indulged will not solve the problem. We
have tried the “can we dehumanize each other without consequences”
experiment, and the bloody results are in. Human beings cannot live
this way without self-destructing. Will we step away, or will we
continue to live the lie that says we can objectify people and watch
their suffering and death as entertainment and have no consequences?

Charlie Kirk and many others died because they were no longer human to
their killers. They had become nothing more than an object. Large
numbers of Americans who would never think of killing or purposely
injuring someone physically have varying degrees of murderer, sadist,
and sexual deviant in them. We are a nation of objectifiers. We
participate in assassinations, rapes, and other brutalities without
being aware because we are deadened inside to the little bits of
monster we carry around in us. Will we continue to nurture these sick
parts of us, or will we say enough and turn to the Divine Physician? By
stepping away from what ails us, we say to Him, “Heal me, O Lord, and I
will be healed” (Jeremiah 17:14).
