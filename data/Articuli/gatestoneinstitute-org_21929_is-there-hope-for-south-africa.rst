* South Africa has regressed into an ideologically-driven
socialist-communist abyss of poverty, crime, corruption and
systemic dysfunction at all levels: local, state and national – all
in 30 years since the end of Apartheid.
* Once the leading economic power in all of Africa, South Africa is
now regarded as the most corrupt country on the continent. It
resembles a typical "banana republic" in some ways -- little
different from other failed or collapsing states in the region,
particularly its northern neighbour of Zimbabwe -- a Marxist
dictatorial hellhole.
* The result of draconian labour laws is that the official
unemployment rate exceeds 33% (more than 8 million potential
workers), while the rate for unemployed younger workers exceeds
60%. These figures consistently rate among the world's highest and
confirm for millions that they have little or no future prospects
in their country of birth.
* As the deindustrialisation of Africa's most industrialised country
accelerates, the unemployment rate will increase accordingly and
even more people, to survive, will become reliant on government
grants. The centralized ANC state then has citizens exactly where
they want them – under their control and dependent upon the
government for daily living. In this way future votes are secured,
leading to the perpetuation of the ANC -- a typical seditious
device to remain in power indefinitely, like other nations in
Africa.
* Even the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a radical far-leftist
political party – that of "Kill the farmer, kill the Boer" fame –
lament this economic catastrophe: "What we are witnessing is the
destruction of the little industry South Africa has left, a
collapse that will hollow out communities and deepen mass
unemployment... The government cannot continue to wash its hands
while South Africa's industrial backbone is dismantled."
* The irony of their complaint is seemingly lost on the EFF: it was
their policies that significantly contributed to the economic
demise and deindustrialisation of the country. The party's leader,
Julius Malema, calls for supporters to "cut the throat of
whiteness" and "shoot the Boer," while advocating land-grabs
without compensation, particularly of white-owned farmland.
* The ANC's statement of intent sadly reveals that they will not
waver from their ideological stance despite threat of sanctions and
punitive US trade tariffs. The spokesman for the Institute of Race
Relations, John Endres, commented about the ANC: "The party misses
no opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to the National
Democratic Revolution, a programme designed to turn South Africa
first into a socialist and then into a communist state."
* "Instead of renewal, [the ANC] has chosen entrenchment. Instead of
pragmatism, dogma. Instead of growth, redistribution without
production. Instead of survival, an overdose of toxic ideology." –
Hermann Pretorius, political commentator, September 7, 2025.
* The ANC is reportedly trying to forge a "deal" with Trump, to
enlist deeper US involvement in South Africa. Its future should be
of serious concern to its citizens and the West.

Located at the tip of southern Africa and at a strategic junction of
trade routes, South Africa has regressed into an ideologically-driven
socialist-communist abyss of poverty, crime, corruption and systemic
dysfunction at all levels: local, state and national – all in 30 years
since the end of Apartheid.

Once the leading economic power in all of Africa, South Africa is now
regarded as the most corrupt country on the continent. It resembles
a typical "banana republic" in some ways -- little different from other
failed or collapsing states in the region, particularly its northern
neighbour of Zimbabwe -- a Marxist dictatorial hellhole.

An independent body, the South African Institution of Civil
Engineering, "ten years ago rated South Africa's infrastructure as
C, and now it has deteriorated to a D rating. On its current path, the
country is heading towards an E, meaning unfit for purpose."

As reporter Shaun Jacobs notes, "South Africa's infrastructure is
collapsing in front of everyone's eyes." The basis of any economy is
infrastructure. It is what allows trade and workers to travel. With
"unfit" infrastructure: roads, ports, airports, and bridges and so on,
the economy will eventually fail.

Even so, powered by its Marxist-themed National Democratic
Revolution (NDR) charter, the leading political party, the African
National Congress (ANC), has been accelerating its collectivist program
to control all aspects of the economy, whether public or private. While
the private sector still has some freedoms, these rights diminish by
the day.

History indicates that the inevitable consequence of radical
socialist-communist policies is economic collapse and social discord.
This outcome should not be surprising when it is realized the ANC's
strategy is fully within the Marxist playbook: res delenda est –
everything must be destroyed, refabricated, and brought to fulfilment
into a communist state, a new order for the nation.

The demise of major private sector companies, most with a long history
there, appears to be a direct result of nationalistic government
policies coupled to aggressive and ideologically-driven trade
unions who, presumably, would rather see companies closed down than
accept a lesser wage for their allegedly "oppressed" workers.

Unionized South African workers are among the best paid in Africa,
due to unions contending for above-inflation wage growth, ostensibly to
narrow the long-term large inequality gap. At the same time, the ANC
government has enacted detrimental labour laws that make it hard for
companies to hire and fire. This has a dampening effect on hiring in
the private sector and thus escalates unemployment.

The result of draconian labour laws is that the official
unemployment rate exceeds 33% (more than 8 million potential
workers), while the rate for unemployed younger workers exceeds
60%. These figures consistently rate among the world's highest and
confirm for millions that they have little or no future prospects in
their country of birth.

In the past 25 years, more than 70,000 important companies entered
liquidation with more than 2.8 million jobs lost directly due to
adverse government policies. According to Haroon Bhorat, director
of the Development Policy Research Unit at the University of Cape Town,
these figures are an "underlying indicator of de-industrialization."

As the deindustrialisation of Africa's most industrialised country
accelerates, the unemployment rate will increase accordingly and even
more people, to survive, will become reliant on government grants. The
centralized ANC state then has citizens exactly where they want them –
under their control and dependent upon the government for daily living.
In this way future votes are secured, leading to the perpetuation of
the ANC -- a typical seditious device to remain in power indefinitely,
like other nations in Africa.

Even the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a radical far-leftist
political party – that of "Kill the farmer, kill the Boer" fame –
lament this economic catastrophe:

"What we are witnessing is the destruction of the little industry
South Africa has left, a collapse that will hollow out communities
and deepen mass unemployment... The government cannot continue to
wash its hands while South Africa's industrial backbone is
dismantled."

The irony of their complaint is seemingly lost on the EFF: it was their
policies that significantly contributed to the economic demise and
deindustrialisation of the country. The party's leader, Julius Malema,
calls for supporters to "cut the throat of whiteness" and "shoot
the Boer," while advocating land-grabs without compensation,
particularly of white-owned farmland.

In 2022 Malema's revolutionary slogans, such as "Kill the Farmer" were
ruled by the Equality Court not as hate speech, but simply an
exercise in freedom of speech. However, in August this year a High
Court did find Malema guilty of hate speech.

This issue was raised by US President Donald Trump at the White House
meeting in May 2025 when South African President Cyril Ramaphosa
dismissed allegations of hate speech directed at whites.

In addition to the closing or restructuring of corporate stalwarts such
as Goodyear, Dunlop Tyres, Glencore, Mango Airlines, supermarket chain
Pick n Pay, Group Five Construction, MultiChoice media, the South
African Broadcasting Corporation, Cell C, the South African Post
Office, Stefanutti Stocks construction, the analytic and data group
Nielsen, other notable entities in financial distress include:

Murray & Roberts, a construction giant with an international
footprint and an icon in South Africa for over 120 years, went into
receivership this year, laying-off some 1,400 workers. As there are
very few, if any, openings for these workers elsewhere, and given that
one worker supports at least four others, more than 5,000 people will
go hungry.

ArcelorMittal, a major steel company - the largest and oldest
(since 1928) in the nation - is in the process of closing various
plants. As CEO Kobus Verster explained:

"Around 3,500 jobs would be lost directly, while studies estimate
that as many as 80,000 people could be affected indirectly as
downstream businesses, mines, quarries, schools, and small
guesthouses dependent on the industry."

Collateral damage includes leading iron ore mines due to the fact
that ArcelorMittal is their main customer.

Ford Motor Company in South Africa advises the public that it will
be firing nearly 500 workers due to slowing demand. Ford is a major
manufacturer of motor vehicles in the country and has had a presence
there for over 100 years. A spokesman for the Solidarity trade
union commented:

"When an automotive giant like Ford takes such drastic steps, it is
a warning to the entire industry... We fear that further
retrenchments may be inevitable if conditions do not improve
quickly."

The sad upshot is that the economy is "imploding, with key industries
falling one by one like a set of dominoes, after 15 years of
mismanagement and poor government policy," notes journalist Shaun
Jacobs.

Concerningly, there are no internal indications whatsoever that the
socialist-driven centralized economy will improve "quickly" or at all.
In fact, it will probably continue to deteriorate -- unless Trump
intervenes. If there is to be hope for South Africa, and the ANC is to
relinquish power or remedy their destructive policies, this hope
lies largely with the current US administration.

To bring about fundamental change in South Africa, there has to be a
change from its alliance with totalitarian regimes to one closer to
those nations reflecting Western interests and the liberal democratic
tradition. The country is too important to the West for it to remain
aligned with anti-Western powers of China, Russia, Iran and North
Korea, and for these despotic nations to take advantage of America's
absence of influence in southern Africa.

The West has long been sympathetic to South Africa -- arguably, at
times, too sympathetic -- and has mainly treated it gently despite its
recent alignment with BRICS, a group of 11 emerging economies --
Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia -- that bonded
together on economic and geopolitical issues presumably as a
counterbalance to the West, and purportedly to increase development.

Despite much international criticism, Ramaphosa declared in
February that, "We are not daunted. We will not be deterred. We will
speak in defense of our national interests." Despite being the US's
largest trade partner in Africa, he was clearly verbalizing the
ANC's defiant attitude towards the West.

South Africa has also cosied up to totalitarian nations. South Africa's
anti-Western stance, however, was made clear at the United Nations when
supporting resolutions contrary to Western interests. Trump noticed
this contrary stance and decided to take action.

On May 21, 2025, when Ramaphosa met Trump at the White House, the US
deemed it a suitable occasion to confront him with South Africa's
radical policies, including the 140 racist employment and business
restrictions on white males.

Other issues raised in Washington included hate speech against
minorities, which has resulted in a mass exodus of the white educated
class. Assaults on white farmers have also forced many farmers to take
advantage of America's refugee program to relocate in the US. A further
contentious issue was the ANC decision to expropriate private
property without compensation – a disastrous policy that crippled
neighbouring Zimbabwe -- creating much uncertainty, and likely
resulting in a dearth of foreign investment.

Also of concern was South Africa's military co-operation with
ideological "soulmates" such as Iran, Russia, and Communist China --
with which the ANC has "one of the strongest party-to-party
relationships in Africa." It is a policy that has surely led to the
country being further ostracised by western investors.

The televised meeting at the White House was a calamity for South
Africa. Ramaphosa was unable to explain to a global audience why such
racist policies are not only permitted, but enacted into law. After
all, the West supported the liberation struggle against Apartheid
policies -- to end racial discrimination in the country against blacks
-- and enabled the ANC to take power. A situation of reverse-Apartheid,
of apparent revenge, against whites seems to have emerged in its
place.

Upon Ramaphosa's return home -- despite being criticised in front of a
wide audience, and at risk of the ANC and its leaders being
sanctioned by the US -- an ANC spokesperson [96]doubled-down on
their radical agenda:

"We hear there is a good lobby around sanctions, but throughout our
struggle we know that leaders and members of the liberation movement
had to sacrifice. Even in this particular period, we will continue
to pay the price of standing for justice, humanity, equality and
respect for the rule of law."

These are commendable words but misleading. The ANC's contraventions of
human rights and their blatant racism against minorities contradict
their fine words.

The ANC's statement of intent sadly reveals that they will not
waver from their ideological stance despite threat of sanctions and
punitive US trade tariffs. The spokesman for the Institute of Race
Relations, John Endres, commented about the ANC:

"The party misses no opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to the
National Democratic Revolution, a programme designed to turn South
Africa first into a socialist and then into a communist state."

Facing US sanctions, the ANC is fast losing political support both
domestically. Political commentator Hermann Pretorius predicts
that, due to its contrarian ideological stance, the ANC is on a "death
spiral". Its share of votes is estimated to have fallen from some
70% in 2004, to 40% in 2024, and in 2025 is estimated to be around
30%. Pretorius says of the ANC:

"Instead of renewal, it has chosen entrenchment. Instead of
pragmatism, dogma. Instead of growth, redistribution without
production. Instead of survival, an overdose of toxic ideology."

Determining what the next dominant political party will be is fraught
with complexities. The main contenders are the Democratic Alliance
(DA), a centrist party supported by 22% of the electorate but
limited appeal to a black majority; the far-left and vehemently
anti-White EFF that commanded only 9% at the 2024 national
election, and the MK Party, a Zulu ethnic-focused group polling at
15%, based mainly in one state. The outcome will probably be a
coalition of convenience, not of ideology, and thus subject to early
fracture.

The weakening of the ANC's authority might lead to other challenges.
Endres predicts:

"The party would resort to ever more extreme versions of the NDR –
more state intervention, more regulation, more race-based laws, more
threats to property rights – in an effort to reassert its power. It
would be more tempted to get into bed with the EFF and MK to shore
up its support."

In this scenario, extreme leftist parties would dominate politics and
the centrist DA would be left in the backwaters of irrelevance.

A possible alternative to the current constitutional structure is the
implementation of a federalised system with independence of the nine
states, much like the US. But this too is unlikely as voters might
prefer to splinter according to tribal or ethnic affiliation.

With the looming demise of ANC dominance, a power vacuum might
also result, and the chances of social conflict accelerate. With the
nation's enormously high unemployment rate and endemic poverty, it
might only take a spark to set mass social discord alight.

In such an event, the ANC's close relationship with the military might
see a development whereby the latter is asked to take control, or
simply takes over, in order to reinstate ANC dominance by force – a
typical communist ploy has been used in Zimbabwe and other countries.

As it is, the military has recently engaged in activities outside the
scope of its neutral position and accountability to the executive. A
few weeks ago, General Rudzani Maphwanya, chief of the South African
National Defence Force (SANDF), apparently took it upon himself to pay
an official visit to Iran. Respected political commentator William
Saunderson-Meyer commented:

"In Tehran, Maphwanya blatantly entered the civilian arena of
governance to punt military and diplomatic cooperation. Emphasising
that his trip was 'not only a military one' but had been 'carried
out at the best possible time' to convey 'a political message',
Maphwanya delivered personal greetings from Ramaphosa and Motshekga
to the 'peace-loving nation of Iran' with which, he said, South
Africa shares 'common goals.'"

Ramaphosa should have been outraged at this usurpation of the
executive's role and fired Maphwanya. In an ominous development for
South Africa's democracy and separation of powers, Ramaphosa instead
called a meeting of no consequence with the Maphwanya, not even a
"slap on the wrist." Along the same lines, Rear Admiral Prince
Tshabalala, the SANDF's director of Defence Corporate Communication,
"made it clear that the SANDF sees a political role for itself."

Saunderson-Meyer therefore believes "the ANC might not be able to
prevent the military from acting as it sees fit."

The ANC is reportedly trying to forge a "deal" with Trump, to
enlist deeper US involvement in South Africa. Its future should be of
serious concern to its citizens and the West.
