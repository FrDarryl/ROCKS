* St. Ignatius of Antioch—Letter to the Trallians & Letter to the Philadelphians: Obey Your Bishop

The Church celebrates the Memorial of St. Ignatius of Antioch (50-107),
who was one of the great bishops of the early Church. He was the
successor of St. Peter as Bishop of Antioch. He was condemned to death
by wild beasts during the Emperor Trajan's persecution. On his way to
Rome, he wrote seven magnificent letters, which we still have today,
concerning the Person of Christ, his love for Christ, his desire for
martyrdom and on the constitution of the Church and Christian life. His
sentiments before his approaching martyrdom are summed in his word in
the Communion antiphon, "I am the wheat of Christ, ground by the teeth
of beasts to become pure bread."

In the Martyrology we read: "At Rome,
the holy bishop and martyr Ignatius. He was the second successor to the
apostle Peter in the see of Antioch. In the persecution of Trajan he
was condemned to the wild beasts and sent in chains to Rome. There, by
the emperor's order, he was subjected to most cruel tortures in the
presence of the Senate and then thrown to the lions. Torn to pieces by
their teeth, he became a victim for Christ."

The bishop and martyr Ignatius occupies a foremost place among the
heroes of Christian antiquity. His final journey from Antioch to Rome
was like a nuptial procession and a Way of the Cross. For the letters
he wrote along the way resemble seven stations of the Cross; they may
also be called seven nuptial hymns overflowing with the saint's intense
love for Christ Jesus and his longing to be united with Him. These
letters are seven most precious jewels in the heirloom bequeathed to us
by the Church of sub-apostolic times.

The year of St. Ignatius' death is unknown; perhaps it occurred during
the victory festivities in which the Emperor Trajan sacrificed the
lives of 10,000 gladiators and 11,000 wild beasts for the amusement of
the bloodthirsty populace. The scene of his glorious triumph and
martyrdom was most likely the Colosseum; that mammoth structure,
glittering with gold and marble, had then been just completed.

"From Syria to Rome I must do battle with beasts on land and sea. For
day and night I am chained to ten leopards, that is, the soldiers who
guard me and grow more ferocious the better they are treated. Their
mistreatment is good instruction for me, yet am I still far from
justified. Oh, that I may meet the wild beasts now kept in readiness
for me. I shall implore them to give me death promptly and to hasten my
departure. I shall invite them to devour me so that they will not leave
my body unharmed as already has happened to other witnesses. If they
refuse to pounce upon me, I shall impel them to eat me. My little
children, forgive me these words. Surely I know what is good for me.
From things visible I no longer desire anything; I want to find Jesus.
Fire and cross, wild beasts, broken bones, lacerated members, a body
wholly crushed, and Satan's every torment, let them all overwhelm me,
if only I reach Christ."

The saint, now condemned to fight the wild beasts, burned with desire
for martyrdom. On hearing the roar of the lions he cried out: "I am a
kernel of wheat for Christ. I must be ground by the teeth of beasts to
be found bread (of Christ) wholly pure".

* Meditate on the words of St. Ignatius in the Communion Antiphon: "I
am the wheat of Christ to be ground by the teeth of beasts, that I
may be found to be pure bread." Are we able to accept martyrdom,
either bodily death, or "white martyrdom"? Jesus Himself was the
Grain of wheat who had to die to bear fruit. The fruit produced is
the Mystical Body, the Church. Pius Parsch explains that: "In turn
each Christian becomes a grain of wheat that matures for the mill
of martyrdom! Read the Communion as if it were your own
composition. I, a kernel of wheat! I, too, am destined for the mill
of suffering, to be ground — not only was it true of Ignatius. What
type of beasts' teeth will crush me? Persecution? Pain and
suffering? Other people? It makes no difference, the kernel must
die, either buried in the ground to produce another stalk or
crushed to become bread. Is not this our destiny in life, to die to
self or to lose ourselves in service to others?" (The Church's Year
of Grace, Advent to Candlemas, The Liturgical Press, 1964)
