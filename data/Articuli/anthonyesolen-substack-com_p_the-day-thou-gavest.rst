Hymn of the Week

The Day Thou Gavest

John Ellerton, 1870

“Quiet lives may make but quiet reading,” says the author of a grateful
and wistful book about the life of John Ellerton, who wrote our
Hymn of the Week, one of the most beloved among the English, and
long loved by my family too here across the waters. Such lives, he
says, may lack “the excitement of stirring scenes and startling
actions; still, there are times when it is a relief to turn from the
study of those who lived in the full glare of the world’s observation
to the simple narrative of some favorite poet who sang, so to speak, in
the shade. In fact, the one is as necessary as the other if we are to
form an adequate conception of all the minds which mold an age. A work
on birds, to be complete, must include the nightingale as well as the
eagle, or one on flowers must not, while it describes the rose, despise
the violet.”
I’ve seen many an eagle. In Nova Scotia, whence I am writing these
words, the bald eagle occupies the place of the turkey vulture farther
south. I’ve never seen or heard a nightingale, not that I know of,
because that’s a European bird, but I have seen and heard the wood
thrush, and I’d dearly love to have a pair of them, shy as they
sometimes are, hiding among the shrubbery behind our house, but singing
now and again, especially in the evening — when their cousins the
robins also sing. And though roses are bold and brash, the small wild
violet is dearer to my heart, and I can say with Wordsworth,

To me the meanest flower that blows can give
Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

Indeed, if you went to Windermere in the summer of 1847 or 1848, you
might have found the young John Ellerton there, on holiday from
Cambridge, on the same lake where Wordsworth himself loved to row on an
evening, alone. John would be reading the poetry of Wordsworth and
Tennyson — filling himself with it, hours on end. That’s what the lad
was like. His father, full of merry and kindly tales, had passed away
when John was a boy. So John wasn’t much for the bold outdoor sports
that roused the spirit of public Cambridge. But he did join a literary
society, called “The Attic,” where the young men read their own essays
and their poetry to each other. I can’t resist giving you the final
passage of a poem that John Ellerton wrote then, called “The Death of
Baldur.” Some of you may know that the story of Baldur moved the boy
“Jack” Lewis, whom we know better by his initials C. S., to tears — not
of sadness exactly, but of longing, and of wistfulness before the
mystery of what is good and beautiful, even when, or especially when,
it has passed away. For the evil Loki had tricked the goddess Frigga
into revealing the only thing on earth that might harm Baldur. It was
the mistletoe. So Loki, as a trick, gave a mistletoe arrow to the blind
Hodur, to shoot at Baldur. For Baldur that day, brave and happy, was
taking all the arrows of the gods, themselves happy too, confident that
nothing could hurt him. But Baldur was slain by this trickery. Here is
how Ellerton’s poem ends, with Frigga sadly calming the spirits of the
gods of Valhalla, all of them weeping because Baldur, Baldur the Good,
was dead:

“ Weep on, for we have lost him; nevermore
The sunshine of his smile shall lighten up
Asgard for us. But unto us, not him,
The hurt is. Not for ever must we dwell
In this our kingdom, but the Sons of Fire
Must quell us, and the Evil Ones be strong,
Till we and they have fallen. Then once again,
Scatheless and bright, shall Baldur fare from Hel,
And here for ever under a clear sky
Talk of old tales, and all these baleful times,
As of a troublous dream long past away.”

“But what of your Hymn of the Week?” you cry out. Well, I hope I’ve
shown that the feelings Ellerton expresses in “The Day Thou Gavest” are
such as he had all his life long, and that he knew, too, that such
feelings are universal to mankind. They suggest that we all do long for
what we have not seen, except maybe through a glass, dimly; that we
have the sense, as two of us walk down a quiet road, that a third is
nearby; that there is a land beyond the sunset, where they have taken
King Arthur. The risen Lord assures us that these are not mere dreams.
The day slopes down toward night, but “Beloved,” says the Apostle, “now
we are the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be:
but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we
shall see him as he is.” The day that God gave us is gone; but it is
not night for the Church; and we await the morning star that rises, and
never sets.
