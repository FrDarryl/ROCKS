**The Illusion of Self-Creation**

Can mankind circumvent God's punishment from Original Sin—namely,
death—with humanoid AI's to "resurrect" our loved ones who have passed
away?

In 2023, beloved actress Suzanne Somers succumbed to breast cancer. She
was best known for her starring roles as Chrissy Snow in Three’s
Company and Carol Foster Lambert in Step by Step. She also authored a
number of books and was known for advertising the legendary ThighMaster
device.

This October, her husband, Alan Hamel, announced something both
astonishing and quite unsettling: he had created an
artificial-intelligence “clone” of his late wife. According to reports,
this digital and robotic re-creation mimics Somers’ voice, appearance,
and even her conversational habits with eerie precision. Day by day,
what we once thought was science fiction is becoming more and more a
reality. Hamel’s experiment is a sad attempt to keep a loved one alive
through data and circuitry. Some have referred to this concept as
“digital necromancy.”

Although the very notion of this may seem tempting, it could also be
viewed as a harmless devotion or even a form of technological
curiosity. In my mind, however, it reveals a deep spiritual malaise of
our age: humanity’s growing belief that technology can redeem what only
God can restore. The project of transhumanism, the attempt to overcome
mortality and perfect human nature through technology, has quietly
moved from the speculative to the domestic. What Hamel calls love is,
at its core, an act of self-creation: the belief that human ingenuity
can somehow transcend death.

In one of my recent essays for Crisis Magazine, “Gender Ideology
and Violence: Cultural Confusion and the Spiritual Battle,” I argued
that gender ideology denies the created order by rejecting biological
dimorphism and the givenness of both maleness and femaleness.
Transhumanism represents the logical progression of this same
rebellion. The transgender movement begins with the conviction that
identity can be reconstructed at one’s will. Transhumanism radicalizes
this idea into the dream of reengineering not just the body but also
the species itself into what can be called a humanoid.

Not unrelated, over the past years, there have been many flirtations
with the concept of transspeciesism. This concept bears a strong
connection to Greek mythological creatures like the Chimera and
the Minotaur. Deepfake AI is creating plenty of videos of this sort.
Transgenderism, transspeciesism, and transhumanism rely on the
metaphysical lie: namely, that man can define his own essence apart
from God.

Recently, on my flight to Spain, I watched with fascination a deeply
disturbing film titled Companion. The movie depicts a near-future
world in which artificial beings are programmed with adaptive memories
and simulated emotions and begin to blur the line between servant and
master. These AI humanoid robots serve as friends or even romantic and
sexual partners. The film exposes the ethical nightmare of tampering
with consciousness and memory—of creating machines that can mimic
remorse, affection, deception, and manipulation. These “companions”
illustrate the danger inherent in the extreme application of
non-reductive functionalism: the notion that consciousness can be
duplicated solely through informational structures.

However, functionalism fails to account for the irreducible
first-person perspective of conscious experience. Even the so-called
non-reductive version unravels upon closer thought. It argues that
consciousness can emerge from matter, ignoring the ontological chasm
between being self-aware and being mechanical. The interior life of a
person, the ability to know, to choose, and to love, transcends any web
of functions or algorithms.

No pattern of physical causes can give rise to an immaterial soul. In
turn, when memory becomes programmable, the very notion of moral
responsibility is extinguished. Make no mistake: this is not a triumph
of reason but a mechanization of evil, where empathy itself can be
simulated for Machiavellian ends; it is a chilling reflection of
humanity’s own capacity to imitate empathy while erasing the soul.

Long before Frankenstein, Greek mythology warned of unnatural
procreation. Creations like the Minotaur and Chimera were born of
transgressive unions that blurred the boundaries between man and beast.
Later, H.G. Wells’ The Island of Dr. Moreau reimagined this impulse
through grotesque biological experimentation, foreshadowing today’s
biotechnological transgressions. Companion dramatizes that same ancient
fear, echoed from Frankenstein to 2001: A Space Odyssey—the
creature’s revolt against its creator, but with a distinctly modern
twist: the machines inherit not only our intelligence but also our
depravity.

In my 2020 lecture for the Science of Consciousness conference,
“Artificial Intelligence, the Nature of Consciousness, Information,
Reality, and the Possibility of the Afterlife,” I emphasized that
memory is not a database but an act of self-presence. In other words,
memory is a unified integration of intellect, will, and affectivity
within an enduring subject reflecting the “sameness” of the self.
Although replication of neural patterns may reproduce behavioral
outputs, it does not reflect the ontological unity of a person.
Information can store traces, but it cannot restore being.

When the thread of self-awareness and intentionality is severed, what
remains is only an imitation of the person, a mere simulation without
continuity. To think of memory as something that can be copied like
data is to mistake information for identity and programming for the
soul. The film Companion drives this point home by depicting how
programmable, false memories can fabricate an artificial bond between
servant and master. Genuine personhood, however, as Aquinas has
persuasively argued, involves reason ordered toward truth, the ability
to make moral choices, and the capacity for relationship with God.
These gifts arise from the immaterial soul, not from circuitry,
algorithms, or synthetic imitations of thought.

If our minds were uploaded into machines, as transhumanist prophets
like Ray Kurzweil or Klee Irwin, the former of whom
founded Singularity University, imagine, what would survive would
not be the self but a copy, a mere echo without a soul, a hollow spirit
deprived of the divine spark.

It reaches for the promise of eternal life while cutting itself off
from the very soul that makes eternity possible. Even if technology
could map every neuron or capture every thought, it could never
recreate the inner life that makes us unique and irreplicable as human
individuals—individuals who are image bearers of God and capable of
love, grief, and seeking or offering forgiveness. A stored memory is
not a soul reborn; it’s only an imitation of a life that once was. A
person cannot be replicated as a machine or data can be.

Transhumanism, like transgender ideology, is humanity’s attempt to
rewrite its own nature. It is a rebellion against the created order,
the self, and ultimately God. What began as a rejection of biological
reality has evolved into a technological religion. Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin once envisioned humanity converging toward the “Omega
Point,” a supposed unification in Christ. The technocrats of Silicon
Valley have latched onto his mystical vision, promising salvation
through data and neural integration.

Futurist Ray Kurzweil envisions a near future in which human
consciousness fuses with machines, while Klee Irwin maintains that
quantum physics will ultimately reveal consciousness as the universe
becoming aware of itself. In Irwin’s view, God is not the eternal
Creator but an emergent phenomenon, the culmination of cosmic evolution
that will, in turn, re-create the universe. As he once remarked to me
in a lengthy one-on-one conversation at the Science of Consciousness
conference in 2016, “Atheists don’t like me because I talk about the
possibility of God, and theists don’t like me because of my alternative
view of God.” His ideas are imaginative, though they rest on
speculative physics rather than sound metaphysics.

Such speculation is not progress in any genuine sense; it is a
theological caricature. The technological promise of replication has
supplanted the Christian promise of resurrection. Instead of being
transformed by grace, man seeks to upgrade himself through circuitry
and digital codes. Here we have the serpent’s temptation in Genesis,
“You shall be as gods,” but returning in digital form.

The danger of transhumanism is not only its ambition but also its
anthropology. It views the body as obsolete hardware and the soul as
software to be copied or improved. Death becomes not a passage but a
glitch to be corrected. In this worldview, man is no longer a creature
but a creator, worshipping his own algorithms. Indeed, he becomes the
measure of all things, yet again.

The Christian vision stands in stark contrast. Our identity is not
constructed but conferred. Being is a gift, not a project. To be human
is to be finite yet graced, embodied yet destined for transfiguration
through Christ not technology. As Scripture reminds us, “It is he that
hath made us, and not we ourselves” (Psalm 100:3).

Suzanne Somers’ AI double is, in a tragic way, the mirror of this
illusion. Like the artificial companions of film and fiction, it
represents our longing to conquer death through imitation rather than
redemption. But love cannot be coded, and divine resurrection cannot be
engineered. The longing to defeat death without God can never lead to
more life; instead, it leads to a different kind of death, the gradual
but inevitable death of meaning and matter itself in the heat death of
the universe. Indeed, the universe was set to decay into nothingness
from the incipient moment of creation; it is only through God’s act
of creation ex vetera that it will be brought to its intended fruition.

Like gender ideology before it, transhumanism promises freedom but
leaves us emptier and more estranged from who we are, the created
order, and God Himself. It speaks of transcendence without sacrifice,
immortality without resurrection, and identity without the soul that
defines its form. It repeats the oldest deception in human history:
that we can save ourselves.

The Christian path is different. Our calling is to face death in the
light of the Cross. It is where human weakness is united with Christ’s
suffering. This is our doorway to eternal life. It is only here that
our existential longing for transformation finds its true
fulfillment—not in perfecting machines but in being perfected by grace
through self-giving love.
