**'I Got That White Girl': The War Over Racism, America's Ultimate Taboo**

* The attack, lightning-fast and captured on surveillance video,
shocked many, not merely because it was yet another terrible
homicide, but because it has forced Americans to confront the
failure of institutions meant to protect them -- the innocent -- as
well as the cultural paralysis that prevents ordinary people from
intervening, and the ideological narratives that try to erase both
motive and responsibility.

* Multiple reports relate that as he exited the train after the
murder, he said, "I got that white girl." These words, if confirmed
by law enforcement, speak to a motive. At a minimum, they reflect
the lens through which many now see such events -- not only as
homicidal acts by dangerously unstable people, but as anti-white
racist attacks that our culture will bend over backwards not to
name.

* [A] responsible system would never have put him back among
commuters in the first place.

* Zarutska's murder -- and the murders of Laken Riley, Jocelyn
Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Kayla Hamilton, and, most recently, Logan
Federico, among others -- were preventable. They happened because a
constellation of decisions — judicial, bureaucratic, cultural —
favored the ideology of leniency and the comfort of excuses over
the duty to protect the innocent.

* "Bang! Dead. Gone. Why? Because Alexander Devante Dickey — who was
arrested 39 Goddamn times, 25 felonies — was on the street,"
Stephen Federico, Logan Federico's father, testified before the US
House Judiciary Committee.

* These youngsters are ignored by the political class to a degree
that is almost criminal itself – after all youngsters do not vote.
There never seem to be sufficient funds seriously to address
problems of mental health. What our leaders, sadly, appear to be
building are conveyor belts from probation to homicide.

* It is not cruel to confine a dangerous, mentally ill man to a
secure hospital. It is cruel to return him to a city train with a
knife in his pocket and a world of demons in his head.

* One can care about mental health while also insisting that
dangerous people be confined. One can care about civil liberties
while also admitting that leniency can kill.

* In elite discourse, naming or even speaking of anti-white hatred is
now the ultimate taboo. It violates the moral arithmetic of a
worldview that assigns all blame in a single direction.

* [T]he public are entitled to request that, when in doubt regarding
to whom to afford compassion -- the suspect or the public -- in an
ideal world it would be both, but in the real world, there is a
case to be made for protecting the public.

* If compassion for the accused is not balanced by protection for the
public, it is complicity.

* This double standard is not, regrettably, a figment of partisan
imagination. It is a feature of a media ecosystem in which
narrative precedes fact. The victims who count are those who
confirm the story that powerful institutions already want to tell.
Everyone else is an inconvenience. In the case of Zarutska, the
media's hedging confirmed a suspicion deeply rooted in the American
mind: that in the newsroom's moral calculus, and in a
reverse-racism, some lives are still more equal than others.

* These reforms are not revolutionary. They are restorative. They
assume what America once took for granted: that the state's first
duty is for the "common defense;" that rights are matched by
responsibilities, and that the innocent come first.

* Zarutska's murder has helped the country to remember what it had
been taught to forget: that civilization is earned, every day, by
people who make themselves responsible for one another.

* If and when Brown said, "I got that white girl," he did more than
admit hatred. He exposed the obscene double standard at the heart
of elite discourse. For years, we were told that speech could be
violence, that silence could be violence, that thoughts could be
violence — unless one could "relativize" the crimes away. This lie
should now be at an end.

The murder in August of Iryna Zarutska has forced Americans to confront
the failure of institutions meant to protect them -- the innocent -- as
well as the cultural paralysis that prevents ordinary people from
intervening, and the ideological narratives that try to erase both
motive and responsibility. Pictured: Zarutska (at right in black

Transit System surveillance video)

On the evening of August 22, 2025, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee,
Iryna Zarutska, boarded the light rail in Charlotte, North
Carolina, on her way home from work.

She had fled a war to find safety. She believed America would be a
haven where a young woman could rebuild her life, learn English, and
contribute honestly. Minutes later, she lay dying on the floor of that
car, stabbed multiple times, bleeding out. The attack, lightning-fast
and captured on surveillance video, shocked many, not merely because it
was yet another terrible homicide, but because it forced Americans to
confront the failure of institutions meant to protect them -- the
innocent -- as well as the cultural paralysis that prevents ordinary
people from intervening, and the ideological narratives that try to
erase both motive and responsibility.

The suspect, identified by authorities as Decarlos Dejuan Brown
Jr., was no stranger to police or courts. He had been arrested
repeatedly over more than a decade — at least fourteen times — for
crimes including robbery, burglary, assault, theft and more. He had a
long-documented history of mental illness, including schizophrenia,
and a recent paper trail of court-ordered psychiatric evaluations that
somehow never materialized into protection for the public. In a prior
case, a magistrate had released him on nothing more than a written
promise to appear, despite a record that should have alarmed anyone.

Multiple reports relate that as he exited the train after the
murder, he said, "I got that white girl." These words, if confirmed by
law enforcement, speak to a motive. At a minimum, they reflect the lens
through which many now see such events -- not only as homicidal acts by
dangerously unstable people, but as anti-white racist attacks that our
culture will bend over backwards not to name.

How could a repeat offender, who bears responsibility in a system that
routinely values "equity" over innocent life, be free? Why do
bystanders not intervene? Why is there such a stark divergence between
"progressives" and "conservatives"?

Zarutska came from Ukraine, a country where air-raid sirens and
funerals had become part of the daily soundtrack after Russia's
invasion. Like many of her generation, she did what courageous people
do: she moved forward. She found work in Charlotte, studied English,
and apparently spoke about her future with the matter-of-fact resolve
of someone determined to make good on the promise of a new country. She
had training in art and restoration, which hints at the kind of person
she was: someone who repaired what was broken.

She was also the face, like other girls and women needlessly murdered,
often by people who should not have been here in the first place -- of
America's better angels. The US is a nation that opens its doors to the
persecuted. The brutality of Zarutska's murder violates that
vision. It is one thing to read that a hardened gang member with a long
rap sheet is killed in a dark alley by another thug. It is quite
another to watch a young refugee, seated peacefully in a public space,
attacked without warning by a man who should have been unable to reach
her — because a responsible system would never have put him back among
commuters in the first place.

Zarutska's murder -- and the murders of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray,
Rachel Morin, Kayla Hamilton, and, most recently, Logan Federico, among
others -- were preventable. They happened because a constellation of
decisions — judicial, bureaucratic, cultural — favored the ideology of
leniency and the comfort of excuses over the duty to protect the
innocent.

"Bang! Dead. Gone. Why? Because Alexander Devante Dickey — who was
arrested 39 Goddamn times, 25 felonies — was on the street," Stephen
Federico, Logan Federico's father, testified before the US House
Judiciary Committee.

The surveillance video from Zarutska's murder is devastating in its
simplicity. There is no argument, no visible provocation, no mutual
escalation. The killer rises, produces a small knife, and strikes with
stunning speed. Zarutska collapses. The suspect departs. The entire
sequence takes seconds. The camera does not editorialize,
"contextualize" or "both-sides" anything. It simply shows.

The reaction across the country to these images did not resemble the
visceral shock that follows civilizational crimes. The difference here
is intimacy. This is not war abroad; it is peace at home. It is not a
chaotic riot; it is an everyday commute. It is not a confrontation
between adversaries; it is the unilateral butchery of a woman who did
nothing but sit in the wrong place at the wrong time. A girl, lying
murdered on the floor of a train, seemed almost "normal." The public
has been anesthetized.

Why did no one intervene? We see people recoil, shift away, hover,
stare. We see a few tentative steps, a delayed attempt at aid. We also
see what is called the "bystander effect"— the tendency in a crisis to
freeze, to wait for someone else to step forward, to try to absorb the
unreality of the moment. The people who failed to act were not cowards.
The event was not only unexpected and fast, but also a culture that
discourages moral judgment and often punishes decisive action will, in
moments like these, produce paralysis.

The second shock was the suspect's reported words as he exited: "I got
that white girl." They are not on the official silent surveillance clip
but appear in contemporaneous posts that accompany the video and in
subsequent reports. Those words, if as witnesses and reports indicate,
frame the murder not as random madness, but as an act laced with racial
hate —but an inversion of the narrative that American elites have
formalized for years. They also explain the frantic effort, in some
quarters, to minimize, relativize, or "de-racialize" what happened. If
race cuts both ways, the entire ideological scaffolding of selective
outrage collapses.

The killer, Brown, is not an unknown quantity. His adult life reads
like a case study in public-safety malpractice. The facts — long rap
sheet, violent prior crimes, mental-health red flags — were in the
open. In recent months, he had been arrested for misusing the 911
emergency system with delusional claims; in another case, he appeared
before a magistrate who released him on a written promise to return to
court. A judge later ordered a psychiatric evaluation to determine
whether he was competent to stand trial. The evaluation was delayed and
the order ultimately canceled without being completed. What matters is
that the evaluation did not happen. The judicial system released a man
with a track record of instability and violence where he could wander
among the public, riding trains, stewing in fantasies, and waiting for
the next target of opportunity.

If one were to write a manual titled "How to Guarantee the Next
Preventable Murder," it would read like this:
1. Ignore the cumulative weight of a suspect's criminal history.
2. Treat mental illness as a reason to avoid confinement rather than
as a trigger for it.
3. Embrace a philosophy that confuses "mercy" with evasion and
"equity" with abdication.
4. Send the accused to a psychiatric evaluation without ensuring
completion.
5. Let him back into society on a promise and a prayer.

Some will object that due process and civil liberties require patience,
compassion, and, above all, avoidance of "pre-judging." The question,
however, is not whether to abolish rights; the question is whether
public safety is a legitimate state interest when the warning signs are
as bright as the sun. A society that denies public safety out of
ideological scruple is not civilized; it is decadent.

The Motive the Ruling Class Cannot Admit

The words attributed to the suspect as he left the train — "I got
that white girl" — in one way confirm what many Americans seem to have
sensed instantly: that race was part of the mental world in which this
murder occurred. No one claims those words explain everything. We do
not know, for example, how Brown's delusions, rage and personal history
intertwined in the moments before the attack. But it is intellectually
dishonest and morally shameful to pretend that explicit racial language
is irrelevant. Precisely because many elites have spent years arguing
that hate speech and "microaggressions" constitute violence, they now
cannot turn around and say that explicit racial celebration of a murder
means nothing.

Critics of attributing blame immediately tried to attack the evidence:
no audio on the official surveillance clip; posts are "unverified";
witnesses could be mistaken; the phrase is a "right-wing myth."
Yet, as subsequent commentary and reporting in conservative media make
clear, multiple sources treated the quote as credible. Unless we are
prepared to say that the only acceptable truth is the one that flatters
politically correct narratives, we must take seriously that several
members of the public seem to have heard the suspect say those words;
and public anger is built, in part, on the conviction that America's
institutions will do anything to avoid admitting anti-white hatred
exists.

Confirmations will come or they will not. We should be cautious in what
we claim as proven. But the possibility exists that there may be a
double standard in which only certain victims count; only certain
hatreds are named, and only certain lives deserve national mourning.
The murder of Charlie Kirk a few weeks later appears to have been
motivated by policies concerning transsexuality, not race.

The Bench: Who Put These Judges There?

Turning to the judiciary, the question arises: who nominates and
appoints the local judicial officers who made the decisions that freed
this man? In many states, the answer varies. But across many
jurisdictions, judges are not elected but are political appointees. The
result is a hybrid system in which legal culture—especially in large
cities—leans toward the ideological fashions of the day.

For the last decade, those fashions have included:

* Cashless bail or "release on recognizance" as default, even for
repeat offenders;

* A prosecutorial posture that treats jail as a last resort and crime
as a symptom of inequality;

* A judicial demeanor that prizes therapeutic language over physical
deterrence;

* An institutional allergy to public shaming of poor decisions —
unless the accused is a white policeman or was appointed by
"conservatives."

Within this climate, a judge who lets a known repeat offender walk
free based on a promise, or who orders a psychiatric evaluation without
requiring its completion, is simply doing what the legal culture has
told him is "virtuous": lowering the cultural footprint that forbids
"criminalizing mental illness." The result is a bench populated by
people who confuse compassion with negligence. They may genuinely
believe they are building a fairer, gentler system. In many respects,
some children may not be the recipients of ideal parenting -- sometimes
any parenting, apart from the street -- or of mental health care. These
youngsters are ignored by the political class to a degree that is
almost criminal itself – after all youngsters do not vote. There never
seem to be sufficient funds seriously to address problems of mental
health. What our leaders, sadly, appear to be building are conveyor
belts from probation to homicide.

The judiciary does -- or does not -- answer to the public. If a
judge repeatedly prioritizes ideology, no matter how well-intended or
compassionate, it would be better for the physical and mental health of
everyone else if that judge were held accountable. Legislatures might
revise standards for pretrial detention involving violent "priors" and
active mental health flags; prosecutors, under such conditions, might
seek deterrence: incentivizing the offender -- in a serious way -- not
to commit further criminal acts.

The Psychiatric Loop: When Mercy Becomes Evasion

The line between criminal responsibility and psychiatric incapacity
is among criminal law's most difficult conundrums. No serious person
argues for ignoring mental illness. Some defendants are not competent
to stand trial; some offenders genuinely do not understand what they
do. But to cite mental illness as a reason to avoid secure confinement
— especially when a defendant is violent and unpredictable — is to harm
the innocent.

In these cases, if the system could move faster — if orders to
establish mental competence could be enforced, the defendants evaluated
promptly, and held for their own safety and the safety of others
pending the outcome — more innocent people might still be alive.
Instead, bureaucracy and ideology combined to produce a lethal delay.
In the case of Zarutska, after the murder, the suspect was finally
remanded for a full evaluation—sixty days at a state psychiatric
facility -- a process that should have been initiated far earlier.

Regardless of the eventual finding, the public are entitled to request
that, when in doubt regarding to whom to afford compassion -- the
suspect or the public -- in an ideal world it would be both, but in the
real world, there is a case to be made for protecting the public. The
threshold for secure evaluation of violent, delusional repeat offenders
should be lower than the threshold for their release — not the other
way around.

It is not cruel to confine a dangerous, mentally ill man to a secure
hospital. It is cruel to return him to a city train with a knife in his
pocket and a world of demons in his head.

The Bystanders: From Courage Culture to Liability Culture

Why did so few help? Why did so many not transform, in the first
seconds after the attack, into a collective surge? The simplest answer
is fear. The suspect had a weapon; the strike was fast; the shock was
overwhelming. But there also seems to be a problem of cultural
programming. We seem to have taught generations that intervention is
impolite, if not suspect. Physical courage may invite liability. Quick
action could be condemned as "escalation." Additionally, because our
elites have spent years telling citizens that the worst sin is to be on
the "wrong side of virtue," many now choose inaction over the risk of
being judged.

It is not always so. A society that celebrates duty, honor and
responsibility produces different reflexes. An older America, or a
current Israel, might show men and women leaping to restrain the
attacker or taking command with the kind of everyday heroism that does
not count "likes" or litigate exposure. The citizens on that train
seemed simply to be products of a moral climate that has replaced
virtue with liability.

A culture that wants to recover courage must re-teach it. That means
public campaigns on bystander intervention, widespread first-aid
training, and legal reforms that protect good-faith actors from ruinous
lawsuits. It also means celebrating, not stigmatizing, those who step
into danger for strangers. In a moment like the murder of Zarutska,
seconds matter. Courage is a trained instinct.

The Progressive Reaction: Euphemism as a Shield

Among progressive commentators, the dominant response was familiar: "do
not politicize," "avoid racializing," "focus on mental health,"
"remember that surveillance video has no audio," "crime is down," "root
causes." Much of this is not wrong -- in the abstract. One can
acknowledge that the clip lacks audio while also acknowledging that
multiple reports of the suspect's words exist. One can care about
mental health while also insisting that dangerous people be confined.
One can care about civil liberties while also admitting that leniency
can kill.

Why do progressive elites react this way? Perhaps because this case is
devastating to their narratives and the way they regard themselves as
"virtuous." The victim is a young white refugee who loved America. The
suspect is a black man with a long criminal record, released repeatedly
by a system that preaches compassion for the accused and indifference
to victims. The event flips the script on decades of selective outrage.
The bystanders' passivity exposes the spiritual emptiness of a
culture that scorns responsibility, displeasure or having to protect
things worth protecting and the ability to evaluate what those are. So
many reach for their arsenal of euphemisms, hoping to sedate the nation
back to sleep.

Some activists went further, scolding citizens for their anger and
warning of "backlash." Others spotlighted unrelated causes— "equity in
mental health," "poverty reduction" — as if any of these would have
stood between Zarutska and the knife. Perhaps most grotesque were those
who implied that even mentioning the suspect's alleged words was an act
of bigotry. In elite discourse, naming or even speaking of anti-white
hatred is now the ultimate taboo. It violates the moral arithmetic of a
worldview that assigns all blame in a single direction.

The Conservative Response: Law, Order and the Return of Moral Memory

On the "right," the reaction fused grief with fury — and an agenda.
Conservatives emphasized four core demands:
1. Accountability for the judicial decisions that put a dangerous man
back on the street: transparency, review, and removal where
appropriate.
2. Statutory reform to ensure that repeat offenders with violent
histories and active mental-health red flags were detained pending
trial and routed swiftly into secure evaluation if competence were
in doubt.
3. Restoration of policing and transit security, including police
officers on trains, rapid-response protocols, and intelligence
surveillance
4. Cultural renewal: an unapologetic call to revive civic courage,
duty, and the presumption that the innocent must be protected even
if it offends academic theories or media sensibilities.

The conservative argument is not complicated. In any society committed
to the rule of law, the first duty of the state is to protect the
innocent. All other duties are subordinate. Budgets, bureaucracies, and
slogans mean nothing if a young woman cannot ride a train without being
slaughtered by a man who should have been nowhere near people. If
compassion for the accused is not balanced by protection for the
public, it is complicity.

The Numbers and the Narrative: Why "Equity" Cannot Keep You Safe

Supporters of progressive criminal-justice reforms point to charts and
data purporting to show that "crime is down," that "violent incidents
are statistically rare," and that "bail reform does not increase
recidivism." If felonies are suddenly reclassified as misdemeanors, of
course, it will look as if "crime is down." Honest analysts on both
sides, however, know how fragile such claims can be. Crime trends vary
by city; definitions change; reporting lags. Even if one granted every
statistical mercy to reformers, the moral reality would remain
unchanged: statistics do not bury the dead. The many atrocities that
have taken place in the United States and Europe during the past few
years should be enough to re-evaluate the legal assumptions that
permitted them.

Moreover, "aggregates" disguise risk. The question is not whether "on
average" someone released on his own recognizance will offend; the
question is whether this person—with this record, these mental
illnesses, these prior arrests—should have been released. No algorithm
that downplays individualized risk to serve some ideological goal on
paper is worth the blood that is spilled or the families that are
crushed. Any legal system that cannot distinguish between a petty
trespasser and a violent schizophrenic is not fit to govern a free
people.

The Media Double Standard: Who Counts as a Victim?

The coverage patterns around Zarutska's murder followed a now
familiar arc. Initial silence from prestige outlets; denunciations of
"politicization" when conservatives demanded answers; hedging about
motive even as evidence of racial hatred spread; a pivot to
mental-health talking points; and then, finally, a reluctant
acknowledgment that the problem was not going away—especially once
federal charges and high-level political reactions made it hard to
ignore. Had the demographic roles been reversed, the public knows the
arc would have been different: saturation coverage, solemn panel
discussions, front-page editorials, and statewide protests coordinated
within hours.

This double standard is not, regrettably, a figment of partisan
imagination. It is a feature of a media ecosystem in which narrative
precedes fact. The victims who count are those who confirm the story
that powerful institutions already want to tell. Everyone else is an
inconvenience. In the case of Zarutska, the media's hedging confirmed a
suspicion deeply rooted in the American mind: that in the newsroom's
moral calculus, and in a reverse-racism, some lives are still more
equal than others.

The Law That Must Change: Four Reforms

If this case is to mean anything beyond mourning, it must produce law.
Not symbolic resolutions. Not hashtags. Law.
1. Pretrial Detention Standards for Violent Repeat Offenders:
Where a defendant has a demonstrable record of violent acts and
active mental-health flags, the presumption should flip in favor of
detention pending trial. Judges need to be empowered — and expected
— to hold such defendants. Review boards, in fatalities, should
audit release decisions and publicize their findings.
2. Enforceable, Rapid Psychiatric Evaluation Protocols:
If a court orders a competency evaluation for a defendant with a
violent history, that order must be executed immediately in a
secure setting, with strict deadlines and penalties for
noncompliance. Evaluations cannot be open-ended; extensions require
sworn justification; public-safety risk must govern more prominent
placement.
3. Transit Safety and Rapid Response:
Major urban transit systems should combine camera coverage with
human presence—trained officers at high-risk hours stationed on
platforms and cars. A system for conductors to summon immediate
assistance, hemorrhage-control kits, and citizen-training campaigns
need to be required in schools.
4. Judicial Accountability and Transparency:
Release decisions in violent cases should be recorded, with written
rationales and data-collection for independent review. Repeatedly
negligent judges should face consequences with "teeth." Even though
many judicial appointments are for life to avoid possible coercion
or retaliation, public confidence in the bench cannot survive
opacity.

These reforms are not revolutionary. They are restorative. They assume
what America once took for granted: that the state's first duty is for
the "common defense;" that rights are matched by responsibilities,
and that the innocent come first.

Culture: Teaching Courage Again

Law without culture is a brittle shell. Even the best statutes cannot
substitute for the moral formation of citizens. We must therefore ask,
without embarrassment, how to teach courage. Schools can start by
replacing abstract "anti-bullying modules" with practical ethics:
scenarios that demand moral agency, drills for emergency response,
first-aid training, and peer leadership. Faith communities, civic
groups and employers can do the same. We have normalized inaction, and
then wonder, when knives flash, why most people turn away.

Teaching courage also means praising it. In a healthy society, heroes
are known to children by name. They are not only athletes and
entertainers; they are ordinary men and women who risked themselves for
strangers. Cities should honor such people publicly. The media could
tell their stories. When courage is celebrated, it replicates itself.

Finally, we must recover the language of virtue. Terms such as "honor,"
"duty," "sacrifice," and "nobility" have been mocked by decades of
irony -- and probably cowardice -- but those do not stop knives. A
train car can become a sanctuary only when the people inside it believe
they are responsible for one another.

Why This Murder Is also a "Turning Point"

People call certain moments "turning points" not because policy
changes overnight, but because consciousness does. The murder of
Zarutska and others has shifted American consciousness in at least five
ways:
1. It re-centers victims. For years, elite discourse has foregrounded
the accused, the incarcerated, the "system-impacted." The murders
of Zarutska and others bring the focus back where it belongs — on
the innocent.
2. It exposes the lethal costs of judicial leniency. When a man with
fourteen prior arrests and active delusions can ride a train with a
knife, "reform" has become a parody of justice.
3. It forces a reckoning with anti-white hatred. The alleged
words, "I got that white girl," strip away the fiction that
racism runs only in one direction.
4. It breaks the hypnotic spell of euphemism. The images are too stark
for "root-cause" poetry. People want law, order, and courage.
5. It realigns political will. Expect a surge of support for
candidates who promise to detain violent repeat offenders, to hold
judges accountable, to fund police, and to protect citizens without
apology.

For "progressives," this might be devastating. Their entire edifice —
built on selective empathy, linguistic policing and data games — cannot
withstand a single video clip of a young refugee bleeding to death
because to them, their theories take precedence. That may be why they
try to deny reality, to bury the words, to change the subject. It does
not work. The country has seen too much.

Memory and Meaning

There will be more funerals. There will be candles and flowers and
friends speaking about smiles, kindnesses and dreams. Perhaps a
scholarship will be founded. Perhaps a mural will go up, bright with
hope. But the most meaningful memorial is not on a wall or plaque; it
is in the laws we pass, the judges we appoint, the habits we teach, and
the courage we recover.

If we allow the old patterns to reassert themselves — if we let this
murder and the others like it become merely entries in a bureaucratic
ledger — then we will have betrayed the victims twice: first by failing
to protect them, then by refusing to learn from their murders. If we
truly act, however, the last chapter of their stories can yet be one of
rescue -- of countless other lives the next time a man with a knife or
gun sets his sights on a stranger.

No single event "ends" a political movement. But some events can
redefine the battlefield. The murders of Zarutska and the other women
are such events. The core claims of many over the past decade — about
safety, about compassion, about truth — were weighed against blood and
found wanting. The public apparently saw the real meaning of "bail
reform": a knife in a commuter's neck, stealing from shops with
impunity, children sent to rob the public in the streets since their
handlers know minors receive light sentences, and so on. The real
meaning of "de-stigmatizing" mental illness" is a paper order
without a hospital bed. The real meaning of "do not politicize" is a
command to swallow a lie. The real meaning of "equity" is a
politics that counts lives differently depending on who the victim is.

Most devastating of all, the public saw the real meaning of courage
versus cowardice. The first belongs to the ordinary citizen who places
himself between danger and innocence. The second belongs to the
ideologue who places theory between truth and justice. Zarutska's
murder has helped the country to remember what it had been taught to
forget: that civilization is earned, every day, by people who make
themselves responsible for one another.

If and when Brown said, "I got that white girl," he did more than admit
hatred. He exposed the obscene double standard at the heart of elite
discourse. For years, we were told that speech could be violence, that
silence could be violence, that thoughts could be violence — unless one
could "relativize" the crimes away. This lie should now be at an end.

The road back from here begins with naming reality, continues through
law and accountability, and ends in a culture where a train car is
safer not only because a security officer stands on the platform, but
because citizens are determined to stand up for one another. If this
country chooses that road, we will have kept faith with those who
believe in us.

Until then, let us tell the truth without apology and, without delay,
set our hands to the work that could have saved the victims and might,
some day, save you. May this work be the memorial that Zarutska and the
other victims deserve.
