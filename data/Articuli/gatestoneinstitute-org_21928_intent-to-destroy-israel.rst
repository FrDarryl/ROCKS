* Raging against Israel are those hypocritical, self-righteous,
self-seeking, egocentric, cowardly leaders: Emmanuel Macron
(France), Keir Starmer (UK), Anthony Albanese (Australia), Mark
Carney (Canada), Pedro Sanchez (Spain) and their ilk, seemingly
without an ounce of integrity between them, supporting an avowed
genocidal death cult that publicly expresses the desire to murder
all Jews, Christians, and other "infidels," and take down the West.
* If you do not want to fight the invasions in your own countries, at
least stand aside and do not obstruct someone else doing it for
you. These feckless so-called leaders even fail to protect their
own Jewish citizens from domestic terror. By so acting, and by
legalizing Islamic Sharia law, they are oozing toward complete
submission to the Islamist hordes they have encouraged to reside in
their midst. In this way, as Trump cautioned, they are actively
destroying their own nations and Western civilization itself.
* Sadly, suicidally, it is also about appeasing their radical
Islamist voters – who will probably reciprocate, as Trump noted, by
wanting more.

There are no longer gray areas in the implied intent of major Western
nations, such as France, Spain, Portugal, Canada, the UK, Australia and
others, to isolate or destroy Israel.

Hamas and associated jihadist murderers are not Israel's primary
enemies; rather, Israel's real enemies are its purported allies --
those Western powers seeking its demise by [52]legitimizing a
terror-dominated Palestinian state alongside, and within, the borders
of the world's only Jewish homeland. Ironically, these are the
countries Israel is defending as it fights a seven-front war,
sacrificing nearly a thousand of its heroic soldiers. Israel is
defending these Western nations against an invasion that President
Donald J. Trump clearly [53]warned is "not sustainable":

"You're destroying your countries.... Europe is in serious trouble.
They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever
seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe, and nobody's
doing anything to change it, to get them out. It's not sustainable.
And because they choose to be politically correct, they're doing
just absolutely nothing about it....

"Now they want to go to Sharia law, but you're in a different
country, you can't do that. Both the immigration and their suicidal
energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe if something is not
done immediately. This cannot be sustained. What makes the world so
beautiful is that each country is unique, but to stay this way,
every sovereign nation must have the right to control their own
borders.... as we do now, and to limit the sheer numbers of migrants
entering their countries and paid for by the people of that nation
that were there and that built that particular nation at the time.
They put their blood, sweat, tears, money into that country, and now
they're being ruined....

"Proud nations must be allowed to protect their communities and
prevent their societies from being overwhelmed by people they have
never seen before with different customs, religions, with different
everything. Where migrants have violated laws, lodged false asylum
claims or claimed refugee status for illegitimate reasons, they
should, in many cases, be immediately sent home. And while we will
always have a big heart for places and people that are struggling
and truly compassionate, answers will be given. We have to solve the
problem and we have to solve it in their countries, not create new
problems in our countries."

With Europe's major powers [54]recognizing an independent Palestinian
state at the United Nations [55]General Assembly on September 23; and
with the burden of [56]sanctions to various degrees, coupled with a
ban or restrictions on sales of weapons and munitions by hitherto
allies, Israel stands almost alone -- except for the current US
administration.

Raging against Israel are those hypocritical, self-righteous,
self-seeking, egocentric, cowardly leaders: Emmanuel Macron (France),
Keir Starmer (UK), Anthony Albanese (Australia), Mark Carney (Canada),
Pedro Sanchez (Spain) and their ilk, seemingly without an ounce of
integrity between them, supporting an avowed [58]genocidal death cult
that publicly expresses the desire to murder all Jews, Christians, and
other "infidels," and take down the West.

Israel faces enemies from all fronts, not excluding many Israelis. Who
stands against Israel's leaders and elected government? Large numbers
of mainly [59]leftist-elitist Jews, both in Israel and in the diaspora,
who seek to topple Israel's duly elected government, while thousands of
able draft-age [60]haredi men males of the refuse to join the military
– at a time when [61]hundreds of their compatriots have been killed to
protect them, their families, and the nation itself.

Islamists around the world in the millions seek Israel's death and
destruction; Western leaders do not care if Israel survives or not –
and from their recent [62]actions apparently would prefer if it did
not. Western leaders, from their actions in selling out Israel's
security to its enemies, look as if they [63]do not care if any Jews
survive. After all, Europe has [64]few Jews (0.2% of the continent's
population) in the overall scheme of things.

Rather than supporting Israel as it fights not only for its own
survival but to defend the values of the West, Macron, Starmer,
Sanchez, Carney, Albanese and Co. vote for a Palestinian state within
Israel – to the [65]detriment not only of Israel's safety and security,
but their own. If you do not want to fight the invasions in your own
countries, at least stand aside and do not obstruct someone else doing
it for you. These feckless so-called leaders even fail to protect their
own Jewish citizens from [66]domestic terror. By so acting, and by
legalizing Islamic Sharia law, they are oozing toward complete
submission to the Islamist hordes they have encouraged to [68]reside in
their midst. In this way, as Trump cautioned, they are actively
destroying their own nations and Western [69]civilization itself.

The forthright journalist Melanie Phillips [70]queried: "Are these
people wicked or just very, very stupid?" Initially, fair-minded people
gave these "leaders" the benefit of the doubt. However, with their
recent actions against Israel on the world stage, it has become obvious
that they cannot simply be written off as stupid or naive. Some are
highly educated and intelligent. The only explanation is that they
possibly do have evil intent. They did not even bother to make their
recognition of a non-existent Palestinian state conditional on Hamas
releasing the hostages.

At best they might be regarded as worthless. A supine NATO does not
even appear willing to invest anything other than pious words into
helping Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky oppose Russia's outright
acts of war against Estonia, Denmark and Poland. Their actions are
probably designed, as in World War II, just to hunker down against
adversaries and appease domestic Islamists, even though these newcomers
to Europe have [72]publicly sworn to murder Jews and burn them alive if
possible – just as Hamas did to not only to Jews but also to [73]Arabs
and others on October 7, 2023.

Insofar as Jews are concerned, the upshot of the compromised
consciences of these major European leaders is that, as Israel's
Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli made [74]clear:

"The streets of Europe are once again not safe for Jews. Many of its
leaders, instead of showing courage, show cowardice. Instead of
standing with the truth, they stand with Palestinian propaganda
falsehoods. Instead of standing with those who were attacked, they
stand with those who launched a barbaric assault."

Naturally, Hamas and other Islamist fanatics are [75]overjoyed at the
UN resolution recognizing their terror state of Palestine as
independent. In this way they have, in the main, achieved their aims
and been rewarded for the murderous onslaught on October 7, murdering
defenseless babies, boys, girls, the elderly and infirm, while carting
others off to tunnel dungeons as hostages and playthings. The message
sent to the terrorists is: Terrorism works, so keep doing it!

"The Palestinian national movement, Fatah and Hamas wings alike,
largely has shown itself to be committed to Israel's debilitation and
destruction, not to a peaceful two-state solution," [76]notes Israeli
columnist David M. Weinberg.

Whereas the Western leaders in question could, once upon a time, be
excused as having a degree of "moral ambiguity," this excuse can no
longer apply. Obviously, they are [77]not honest brokers. "They want a
Palestinian state," [78]wrote Israeli political analyst Avi Abelow in a
September 22 column, "not because they care about Arabs, but because
they can't stand a proud, strong Jewish state that defends itself."

Turning to address Starmer, Albanese and Carney, Abelow scathingly
writes:

"Thank you for making it crystal clear that the United Kingdom,
Canada and Australia now stand with a genocidal death cult. That
they reward the barbaric atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023, with diplomatic
prizes. That morality, memory and justice have been officially
sacrificed on the altar of Jew-hatred, woke politics and Islamic
appeasement.

"Let's stop pretending this has anything to do with peace, rights or
law. Starmer's plan is not about 'justice.' It's not about a
'two-state solution.' It's not even about Palestinians. It's about
one thing only: Punishing the Jewish people for surviving."

Sadly, suicidally, it is also about appeasing their radical Islamist
voters – who will probably reciprocate, as Trump noted, by wanting
more.

Despite much of the world harboring animosity towards the Jews,
possibly out of envy for having had the audacity, through hard work, to
do so well -- who else has turned deserts and malaria swamps into a
thriving state? -- the Jews and their ancestral homeland of Israel
shall survive.
