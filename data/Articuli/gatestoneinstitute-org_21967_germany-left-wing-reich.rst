Germany today offers the world a disturbing spectacle: a state in its
death throes which, under the guise of democratic virtue, is sinking
into authoritarianism. In today's Germany, the leading opposition party
is not treated as a legitimate actor in the democratic process, but,
without any due process, as an enemy within. Pictured: Alice Weidel,

Germany today offers the world a disturbing spectacle: a state in its
death throes which, under the guise of democratic virtue, is sinking
into authoritarianism. The erosion of civil liberties is not occurring
through a coup d'état, but by the slow accumulation of administrative,
legal and police measures that shape the contours of a dictatorship as
implacable as it is convinced of its own virtue.

1. The Classification of the AfD by an Administrative Agency

In the spring of 2025, the Federal Office for the Protection of the
Constitution (BfV, Germany's domestic intelligence service)
classified the political party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) as
a "right-wing extremist" organization. This classification granted
the authorities the power to place its members and supporters under
police surveillance without prior judicial authorization, including
measures such as intercepting private communications or the BfV
recruiting informants within the party.

This "judgment" was not delivered by an independent court. It was
created by an administrative agency directly under the authority of the
Interior Minister. The BfV is not even an administrative court; it is a
bureaucratic body, issuing reports and recruiting informants without
allowing the parties concerned to present their case. When an
individual or party is labeled "fascist" and consequently excluded from
Germany, is it not desirable that they at least be granted the right to
defend themselves? Well, according to German law in 2025, the answer is
nein.

Worse still, the file justifying this classification has never been
released. There is therefore a complete absence of adversarial
proceedings. The AfD was never consulted, and even after the fact, it
has no right to know why, on what grounds, on the basis of what
evidence and documents, it was excommunicated from the German
"democratic" sphere.

The AfD is therefore reduced to appealing to the courts to
challenge this label. How can the AfD effectively contest a
classification when the documents remain secret so that it cannot even
know what it is contesting? How can it challenge the term "far right"
when it is not defined anywhere? Since the early Middle Ages, the
tradition of the state based on rule of law — Rechtsstaat in German —
has required that convictions be based on precise and strictly defined
charges. Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege. No crime, no punishment
without prior definition. Is the fact that the AfD defends positions
more "right-wing" than other parties sufficient to justify a label?
Given that the AfD's program is, on several points such as the right to
bear arms, more "left-wing" than the U.S. Republican Party, should one
conclude that the current U.S. administration is "super-Nazi"?

This is arbitrariness pure and simple. The issue has never been law,
but power: the determination of the ruling caste to cling to authority
at any cost, even if it means criminalizing a quarter of the German
population. Let us not forget: the former German Democratic Republic
(East Germany) also claimed to be "democratic."

Since May 2025, tens of thousands of activists, local elected officials
and ordinary supporters of the AfD, the leading opposition party, have
been subjected to police surveillance without a court order.

In today's Germany, the leading opposition party is not treated as a
legitimate actor in the democratic process, but, without any due
process, as an enemy within.

2. Repression of Free Speech: The Criminalization of Dissent

This repression not only affects AfD leaders, members and activists. It
extends to ordinary citizens. Pensioners, shopkeepers and students are
now being prosecuted for criticizing government policy on
immigration, climate or healthcare. They are treated as criminals, even
as terrorists or arsonists, on charges of "inciting hatred."

In April 2025, for instance, a Bavarian court sentenced David
Bendels, editor-in-chief of Deutschland-Kurier, to seven months'
suspended imprisonment. His "crime"? Publishing a satirical image
showing Interior Minister Nancy Faeser holding a placard reading "I
hate freedom of opinion." The court convicted him of "abuse, defamation
or slander against persons in political life."

In 2024, a 20-year-old woman appeared before a court for insulting a
convicted rapist in a private WhatsApp exchange. She received a
harsher sentence than the rapist, who was handed only a suspended
sentence.

These repressive measures do not target extremists, but ordinary
citizens who dare to contest the ideology favored by the party in
power. The Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) reinforces this
censorship by forcing internet platforms to delete content under
penalty of fines, thereby further eroding the freedom of expression
"guaranteed" by Article 5 of the German Constitution.

This climate of fear — the dread of a police raid at dawn over a
and devastating in its effects on public opinion. It is turning Germany
into a Potemkin democracy, where only the official monologue is
tolerated.

3. The Quarantined Area: Institutionalized Directed Democracy

Since 2015, an unwritten but inflexible rule has governed the federal
parliament (Bundestag and Bundesrat) and regional parliaments: no
coalition may be formed with the AfD, and no AfD vote will ever be
recognized as legitimate. This Brandmauer (firewall) to relegate
the AfD into a quarantine, has the direct effect of suspending
political competition by freezing the political landscape. Henceforth,
Germany lives under the illusion of alternation between Social
Democrats (SPD) and Greens on one side and the Christian Democrats
(CDU/CSU) on the other, all united in their refusal to open up the
democratic game to its actual winner. With 20% of the vote in the last
federal election — soon to be 26%, according to polls, and
approaching 50% in former East Germany — the AfD is forcing other
parties into unnatural coalitions. Merkel's doctrine reigns supreme:
better for the "right" to govern with the far left than with the AfD.

Even as the German establishment insists this situation is "normal,"
even noble, international observers are mercifully beginning to express
concern. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance recently declared:

"Europe's renunciation of its fundamental values, which are also
those of the United States, is worrying. In a democracy, it is the
voice of the people that matters, and there is no place for cordons
sanitaires."

The quarantining of the AfD ensures that the left will remain in power
indefinitely, regardless of election outcomes. This amounts to rule by
a single "party" and a single ideology — that of the ruling caste.
Democratic change through the ballot box in Germany is no longer
possible.

4. Towards an Outright Ban on the Opposition

As if this were not enough, government circles are now openly
considering banning the AfD altogether, under the fake pretext of
"protecting the constitution." Annalena Baerbock, former foreign
minister from the far-left Greens party, declared in early 2024:
"We must not rule out banning the AfD if evidence of extremism
continues to mount."

Saskia Esken, co-chair of the SPD, added: "The AfD is no longer a
democratic party. It is the duty of our constitutional state to prevent
it from acting."

Even the once-conservative CDU has joined the chorus, with Chancellor
Friedrich Merz affirming that "all constitutional instruments must
be considered" against the AfD."

Criminalizing 25% of the electorate is like placing dynamite beneath a
shared house. To condemn a quarter of the German population to
democratic death — denying them any access to power while repressing
even the polite expression of their opinions on social media — is to
invite desperate and violent reactions. These reactions will inevitably
be seized upon by the ruling caste to justify an even tighter grip on
power.

The Shadow of the Reichstag Fire

One cannot but recall Germany's Reichstag fire on February 27,
1933, set by a Dutch communist, which the Nazi Party instantly used as
a pretext to suspend civil liberties and consolidate its domination of
the German state. The very next day, President Paul von Hindenburg,
responding to Hitler's urgent request, signed the "Decree of the
Reich President for the Protection of the People and the State,"
invoking Article 48 of the Weimar Republic's constitution. The decree
suspended fundamental civil liberties — freedom of expression, freedom
of the press, freedom of assembly and association, privacy of
correspondence and communications, protection against arbitrary
searches and arrests. On this basis, mass arrests of political
opponents were immediately launched. The decree marked a decisive step
in the Nazi Party's seizure of totalitarian power, paving the way for
the elimination of opposition and the establishment of a dictatorship.

Germany today faces a fatal spiral. Either it accepts true pluralism
and freedom of expression — without which democracy cannot exist — or
it succumbs to the temptation of eliminating dissent by judicial and
police means, silencing the only genuine opposition. If that happens,
it will not be the AfD that is destroyed, but German democracy itself.

Any democracy that outlaws its opposition to the ruling party ceases to
exist.

A new "Decree for the Protection of the People and the State" — banning
the AfD — would signal nothing less than the death of German democracy.
