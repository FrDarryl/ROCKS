Voices: Live the Ten Commandments, don’t coerce

Effective Sept. 1, every public-school classroom in Texas was to display “in a conspicuous place” a King James Version inspired listing of the Ten Commandments.

However, a federal judge recently halted implementation of the law in some districts, citing violations of the First Amendment’s Free Exercise and the Establishment Clauses, mirroring the long history Supreme Court jurisprudence which protects conscience and free exercise, while forbidding an establishment of religion by the state.

Historical analysis of the Constitution and judicial precedent would appear to agree that the Texas law is obviously unconstitutional. So, why did Texas pass this law to begin with?

When government is controlled by one particular political and religious viewpoint, these types of laws result.

Engel v Vitale
Consider the words of the Supreme Court in Engel v Vitale (1962) when ruling on compulsory school prayer: “It is an unfortunate fact of history that when some of the very groups which had most strenuously opposed the established Church of England found themselves sufficiently in control of colonial governments in this country to write their own prayers into law, they passed laws making their own religion the official religion of their respective colonies.” In 2025, the same practices still occur.

Although precedent would imply the current Supreme Court will find the law unconstitutional, that is no guarantee. Instead, a broader question to consider beyond the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments law is whether the law is right and good.

Following the recent federal court’s ruling halting the implementation of the law, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is currently running for U.S. Senate, issued a statement from the attorney general’s office requiring schools to proceed with the 16 x 20 displays anyway, writing, “The woke radicals seeking to erase our history will be defeated.”

Public policy intersects with belief
Herein lies an additional problem with this law. What is the purpose? The attorney general’s reasoning seems to suggest partisan politics. Making the motivation of the law to defeat “wokeism” potentially violates one of the very commandments Texas requires be posted: “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.” The culture war sees no problem with using God’s word to score political points.

Mandating that schools post a particular version of the Ten Commandments in every classroom violates the consciences of teachers, administrators, students and parents, strikes a blow against religious pluralism, and establishes one particular faith practice as better than others and certainly preferred over those of no faith.

When public education, which is one of the best gifts the United States has given to the world, infringes upon religious liberty, also one of the best contributions our nation has made to the world, both suffer, which leads to individual rights being trampled by power.

As George Truett, one of the most influential Baptists of the past century, declared: “It is the consistent and insistent contention of our Baptist people, always and everywhere, that religion must be forever voluntary and uncoerced, and that it is not the prerogative of any power, whether civil or ecclesiastical, to compel men to conform to any religious creed or form of worship, or to pay taxes for the support of a religious organization to which they do not believe. God wants free worshipers and no other kind.”

Requiring every public classroom to post the Ten Commandments coerces others to compliance, compels religious conformity to a particular faith, stifles dissent and allows for the usage of public tax dollars to purchase the religious posters. In every way, this law violates Truett’s call, which he based on the gospel of Jesus Christ.

The importance of practicing faith
Recently, I heard a beautiful sermon on the 10th commandment: “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”

The pastor connected this final commandment to our personal jealousies and struggles with contentment. He conveyed that God cares about our hearts, connecting the commandment not only to the first commandment, but also to the rich, young ruler in the New Testament.

That politician, who Jesus challenged to give away everything and follow him, went away sad, because he could not relinquish his wealth and power. We all face that temptation.

I left challenged to live out what had been preached. That is how we share the message of the Bible. We do it through our churches and then live it out in our daily lives. Not through coercion, a violation of conscience, or through governmental fiat.

Ultimately, using the coercive power of government to promote a particular faith reveals a weakness of that faith, not a strength. The problem today is not that the Ten Commandments are not posted in classrooms, it is that so many of us who profess to be believers do not practice them in our own lives.

This law is closer to taking God’s name in vain than practicing faith, teaching history, or assisting children educationally. Simply, this requirement, regardless of the ultimate court decision, is wrong.

We need to get back to our Baptist roots. Roots that value the Constitution, protect individual conscience, champion religious liberty, defend religious pluralism and refrain from forcing the posting of a religious document on a public-school wall.

In the words of George Truett: “Christ’s religion needs no prop of any kind from any worldly source, and to the degree that it is thus supported is a millstone hanged about its neck.”
