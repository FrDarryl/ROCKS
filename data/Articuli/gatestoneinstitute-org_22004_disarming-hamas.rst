* "If we achieve a sovereign and independent Palestinian state that
preserves the rights of the Palestinian people, then these weapons
will be transferred to the Palestinian state and its army." — Abdul
Jabbar Saeed, member of Hamas's political bureau, arabi21.com,
October 16, 2025.

* Saeed dismissed the idea of deploying international forces in the
Gaza Strip.... He also rejected the idea of excluding Hamas from
playing a future role in the governance of the Gaza Strip.
"Completely excluding Hamas from the scene is not possible," he
stressed.

* The involvement of Qatar and Turkey in the Gaza Strip is
problematic because the two countries have always been supportive
of Hamas. Both countries continue to provide shelter to several
Hamas leaders and act as if they are its attorneys by constantly
defending the terror group while condemning Israel.

* The Saudis and Emiratis have reportedly notified the Trump
administration that they would downgrade their level of engagement
in the implementation of the Trump plan. Referring to Qatar, they
warned that increasing the influence of "countries that destabilize
the region" would derail the momentum of prosperity Trump has
touted.

* A Saudi source warned that Qatar was expected to help Hamas
maintain its presence and return at an opportune moment.

* Notably, in 2017 several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE decided to cut their diplomatic ties
with Qatar over the Gulf state's support for Islamist terror
groups, especially the Muslim Brotherhood.

* Saudi Arabia said it made the decision to cut diplomatic ties due
to Qatar's "embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed
at destabilizing the region," including the Muslim Brotherhood, the
Islamic State (ISIS), and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom's
eastern province of Qatif.

* Egypt's Foreign Ministry accused Qatar of taking "an antagonistic
approach" toward Egypt and said "all attempts to stop it from
supporting terrorist groups failed...." Instead of insisting that
Hamas lay down its weapons in compliance with Trump's plan, they
are now talking about the possibility that the terror group would
"freeze" its weapons.... It is worth noting that the Trump plan
does not talk about a "freeze" of Hamas's weapons.

* Bahrain, for its part, blamed Qatar's "media incitement, support
for armed terrorist activities, and funding linked to Iranian
groups to carry out sabotage and spreading chaos in Bahrain" for
its decision to cut diplomatic ties.

* Anyone who believes that Hamas will voluntarily give up its weapons
is living in a dream world. For the terror group, this would be
tantamount to suicide. The terms "demilitarization" and
"deradicalization" do not exist in Hamas's lexicon.

* Worse, anyone who believes that Qatar and Turkey will force Hamas
to dismantle its military infrastructure is also living in fantasy
land.

Anyone who believes that Hamas will voluntarily give up its weapons is
living in a dream world. For the terror group, this would be tantamount
to suicide. The terms "demilitarization" and "deradicalization" do not
exist in Hamas's lexicon. Pictured: A Hamas gunman stands in a crowd of

According to US President Donald Trump's plan for ending the war in
the Gaza Strip, "all military, terror, and offensive infrastructure,
including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed
and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza
under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include
placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of
decommissioning."

Since the announcement of the plan, however, Hamas officials have
repeatedly emphasized that their Iran-backed terror group, which
started the war by attacking Israel on October 7, 2023, has no
intention of laying down its weapons. Hamas evidently wants to hold
onto its weapons so that it can continue its Jihad (holy war) against
Israel and ensure its own continued control of the Gaza Strip.

As far as Hamas is concerned, Trump's plan is apparently nothing but
another temporary ceasefire with Israel that will allow it to rearm and
regroup. Hamas does not believe in any peace process with Israel. Its
primary goal is to kill as many Jews as possible and destroy Israel.

On October 17, Hamas politburo member Mohammed Nazzal told Reuters
that Hamas intends to maintain security control in the Gaza Strip
during an interim period. Hamas, he said, was ready for a ceasefire
of up to five years to rebuild the Gaza Strip, with guarantees for what
happens afterwards, depending on Palestinians being given "horizons and
hope" for statehood.

Asked if Hamas would give up its arms, Nazzal said:

"I can't answer with a yes or no. Frankly, it depends on the nature
of the project. The disarmament project you're talking about, what
does it mean? To whom will the weapons be handed over?"

He added that issues to be discussed in the next phase of
negotiations, including weapons, concerned not only Hamas but other
armed Palestinian groups, and would require Palestinians more broadly
to reach a position.

On October 16, another member of Hamas's political bureau, Abdul Jabbar
Saeed, rejected the idea of disarming his group:

"Disarming the Palestinian resistance under the current
circumstances without the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state and without a government to govern the Gaza Strip,
will inevitably lead to total chaos and create a major and dangerous
vacuum that will be difficult to confront."

"If we achieve a sovereign and independent Palestinian state," Saeed
added, "that preserves the rights of the Palestinian people, then
these weapons will be transferred to the Palestinian state and its
army."

Saeed dismissed the idea of deploying international forces in the
Gaza Strip:

"Trump raised the idea of the presence of international forces, but
this does not necessarily have to be the formula agreed upon by the
Palestinians among themselves, or by the Palestinians and the Arabs.
Hamas absoluletly does not accept a mandate, nor does it accept
military rule by others. We will not replace the military rule of
the Israeli occupation with another foreign rule; this formula is
unacceptable to us. Any formula proposed for governing the Gaza
Strip under so-called international trusteeship or a High
Commissioner, similar to the old colonial model, is unacceptable to
Hamas or all Palestinian resistance factions."

He also rejected the idea of excluding Hamas from playing a future role
in the governance of the Gaza Strip. "Completely excluding Hamas from
the scene is not possible," he stressed.

"We are a movement rooted in the Palestinian people. We have our
presence, our strength, and our existence. We won democratic
elections in 2006. In fact, we have a majority among the Palestinian
people. Therefore, how can we be excluded from determining the fate
of the Palestinian people and from making decisions regarding the
future of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian cause, when we
are an integral part of it, whether you like it or not? Hamas is an
integral part of the Palestinian people, whether in Gaza, the West
Bank, or even in the diaspora outside the country. Its future is
linked to the future of the Palestinian people. It cannot be
separated from it, nor can it be excluded, eliminated, or excluded,
given that it is an ideology linked to resistance and liberation.
Therefore, the movement will continue to exist and contribute to the
future of the Palestinian people, and no one will be able to exclude
it from the scene, even if it accepts not to rule in the Gaza Strip
during the next phase."

An unnamed Hamas official was quoted on October 11 as saying that
"the issue of handing over weapons is out of the question and is not on
the table."

On October 1, the London-based Al-Quds Al-Arabi newspaper quoted a
source close to Hamas as saying that the terror group was seeking
to amend some provisions of Trump's plan, especially the disarmament
clause and the withdrawal of its fighters from the Gaza Strip.

"Consultations are ongoing around the clock within the group's
leadership in Palestine and abroad, and with mediators," the unnamed
source said, adding that four meetings were held in Doha with
Qatari and Egyptian mediators, in the presence of Turkish officials.

The involvement of Qatar and Turkey in the Gaza Strip is problematic
because the two countries have always been supportive of Hamas. Both
countries continue to provide shelter to several Hamas leaders and act
as if they are its attorneys, by constantly defending the terror group
while condemning Israel.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain seem to be
unhappy with the Trump administration's increased reliance on Qatar
and Turkey.

The Saudis and Emiratis have reportedly notified the Trump
administration that they would downgrade their level of engagement in
the implementation of the Trump plan. Referring to Qatar, they warned
that increasing the influence of "countries that destabilize the
region" would derail the momentum of prosperity Trump has touted.

A Saudi source warned that Qatar was expected to help Hamas
maintain its presence and return at an opportune moment.

Notably, in 2017, several Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE decided to cut their diplomatic ties
with Qatar over the Gulf state's support for Islamist terror groups,
especially the Muslim Brotherhood.

Saudi Arabia said it made the decision to cut diplomatic ties due
to Qatar's "embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at
destabilizing the region," including the Muslim Brotherhood, the
Islamic State (ISIS), and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom's
eastern province of Qatif.

Egypt's Foreign Ministry accused Qatar of taking "an antagonistic
approach" toward Egypt and said "all attempts to stop it from
supporting terrorist groups failed."

Bahrain, for its part, blamed Qatar's "media incitement, support
for armed terrorist activities, and funding linked to Iranian groups to
carry out sabotage and spreading chaos in Bahrain" for its decision to
cut diplomatic ties.

Egypt does not appear to take a firm stand on the issue of disarming
Hamas. Instead of insisting that Hamas lay down its weapons in
compliance with Trump's plan, they are now talking about the
possibility that the terror group would "freeze" its weapons.

Diaa Rashwan, director of the Egyptian State Information Service,
claimed that Hamas had agreed to a freeze on its weapons, not
disarmament. He said that the Proposed arms freeze comes within the
framework of the truce the movement had previously proposed with
Israel, which ranges in duration from five to ten years. Rashwan
pointed out that Hamas's weapons would not be handed over to Israel or
any non-Arab party. It is worth noting that the Trump plan does not
talk about a "freeze" of Hamas's weapons.

Palestinian columnist Dr. Ramzi Odeh pointed out that Hamas's recent
actions, including the deployment of militiamen and the extrajudicial
executions of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, prove that the terror
group has not the slightest intention of laying down its weapons.

"Hamas, particularly inside the Gaza Strip, is unwilling to disarm or
hand over power to any other authority, especially the Palestinian
Authority," Odeh wrote. "This is confirmed by the statements made
by field commanders to the Gazan public, who emerged from their tunnels
after a long period of bombardment. They are absolutely unwilling to
hand over power, even if Hamas abroad wanted to. They are determined to
obtain more wealth and more power. If Hamas field leaders insist on
this behavior, it is unlikely that the Gaza Strip will move to advanced
stages of reconstruction, development, and security."

Bassam Barhoum, another Palestinian columnist, warned against
Hamas's "deceit." Hamas, he said, "continues its attempts to
control the Palestinians. Like the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas presents
itself as a believer in democracy. Yet, it carried out a bloody and
brutal military coup [against the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza
Strip in 2007], killing 800 Palestinians. All of Hamas's battles, under
the pretext of resistance, have only benefited Hamas, the Muslim
Brotherhood, and the regional powers allied with them (Iran and Qatar).
By shedding Palestinian blood, Hamas sought to present itself once
again as it did in 2007: as the entity capable of suppressing and
brutalizing with an iron fist. Today, Hamas is prepared to drag the
Palestinian people into a civil war if that serves its interests and
those of the Muslim Brotherhood."

Anyone who believes that Hamas will voluntarily give up its weapons is
living in a dream world. For the terror group, this would be tantamount
to suicide. The terms "demilitarization" and "deradicalization" do not
exist in Hamas's lexicon.

Worse, anyone who believes that Qatar and Turkey will force Hamas to
dismantle its military infrastructure is also living in fantasy land.
