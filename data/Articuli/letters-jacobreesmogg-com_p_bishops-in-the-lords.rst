Bishops in the Lords?

Does the increasing secularisation of the UK mean it is time for a
change?

The appointment of Sarah Mullally as the next Archbishop of Canterbury
naturally raises the question of the role of bishops in the British
constitutional settlement. Even in the few years since Justin Welby was
consecrated, the nation has become more secular and the Church of
England has seen a noticeable decline both in attendance and in
authority.

In English history, only the monarchy itself is an older, continuously
filled post, although in both cases the word continuously needs to be
qualified. In the case of the monarchy by the Cromwellian interregnum
that also affected the role of Archbishop of Canterbury, which has had
additional gaps mainly caused by disagreements between the Canterbury
monks, the King and the Pope. The delay in appointing Mullally is not,
in the historic context, unusual.

This antiquity is important as although Mullally cannot be in the
apostolic succession to St. Augustine, because of the break that took
place at the Reformation, she is in a direct line from him in the post
that she will shortly hold. In that roll call, there are over two dozen
saints and a number of martyrs, including St. Alphege and St. Thomas
Beckett, as well as Simon Sudbury, who was hacked to death by a mob
during the Peasants’ Revolt in 1381, while both Thomas Cranmer and
William Lord were executed following Parliamentary attainders.

It is thus a role that has been of major historic note. It is also of
constitutional significance. St. Dunstan, who crowned Edgar as King of
England in Bath Abbey in 973, used a ceremony that in all essentials
was the same as the one used by Justin Welby to crown the King. The
most notable change is that the liturgy is now in English.
