* Hamas, in short, has decided to eliminate any Palestinian opposed
to terrorism and supportive of coexistence with Israel.

* Hamas's actions also demonstrate that the terror group is
determined to exploit the current ceasefire to reassert its control
over the Gaza Strip.

* The silence, or apathy, of the international community, including
so-called pro-Palestinian groups and individuals, towards Hamas's
crimes only encourages the terror group to proceed with its
crackdown on its own people. The silence of the world, in addition,
sends a message to the Palestinians that they should refrain from
rising against Hamas and other terror groups in the Gaza Strip.

* We have not yet heard of a single Hamas terrorist talking about
recognizing Israel's right to exist. In the eyes of Hamas leaders,
the Trump peace plan is just another temporary ceasefire that
should be used for rearming, regrouping, and preparing for
massacring more Israelis.

* In recent months, Hamas has been quoting a famous statement by its
former leader, the late Ismail Haniyeh, to confirm that the terror
group will never recognize Israel's right to exist: "We said it
five years ago and we say it now... we will never, we will never
recognize Israel."

* No transitional government or "Board of Peace" will ever be able to
enforce law and order as long as Hamas terrorists feel free to
murder any Palestinian who wants peace and coexistence with Israel.

* De-radicalization will happen only after Palestinians see that
Hamas has been totally defeated, disarmed and removed from
power.... Failure to eradicate Hamas will only pave the way for
another October 7 massacre against Israel.

No transitional government or "Board of Peace" will ever be able to
enforce law and order as long as Hamas terrorists feel free to murder
any Palestinian who wants peace and coexistence with Israel. Pictured:

US President Donald Trump's plan for ending the Hamas-Israel war
states that "Gaza will be a de-radicalized terror-free zone that does
not pose a threat to its neighbors." His plan also stipulates that
"Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who
have suffered more than enough" and that "once all [Israeli] hostages
are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to
decommission their weapons will be given amnesty."

Although Hamas has released the 20 living hostages and, since the
announcement of Trump's plan in early October, has handed over the
bodies of some of the fallen, the Gaza Strip remains anything but a
"de-radicalized terror-free zone."

After the ceasefire went into effect, Hamas terrorists began rounding
up dozens of Palestinians as part of a massive crackdown on critics
and opponents of the terror group. At least 32 Palestinians have been
publicly executed and many more otherwise killed by Hamas thugs
under the pretext of "collaboration" with Israel. Fifty-two of
those killed belonged to Hamas's rival Doghmush clan.

Trump's plan specifically notes that Gaza should not "pose a threat to
its [Israeli] neighbors." Hamas's brutal crackdown shows that Gaza is
posing a threat to its own people: Palestinians.

Hamas has not provided any evidence that many of those who were
blindfolded, forced to kneel and executed extrajudicially in the
street, in front of Palestinian children and teenagers, were linked in
any way to the Israeli security forces. By labeling its victims as
"collaborators," Hamas is seeking to justify its crimes to the
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The terror group knows that
Palestinians have no sympathy for anyone accused of treason and working
for the Israeli "enemy."

As Hamas drags Palestinians to the streets to face its firing squads,
the international community appears to be looking the other way. Hamas,
however, is not going after criminals, outlaws and suspected
collaborators, as it claims. Instead, it is targeting those who dared
to speak out against the terror group that brought death and
destruction to the Gaza Strip after its October 7, 2023, invasion of
Israel. Hamas is targeting Palestinian clans and individuals who
dared to publicly challenge its atrocities against both Israelis and
Palestinians.

Even if Hamas's claim that some of these Palestinians were
"collaborators" with Israel is true, it means that these people chose
to help Israel in its war on terrorism. Hamas, in short, has decided to
eliminate any Palestinian opposed to terrorism and supportive of
coexistence with Israel.

If anything, these murders show that the Gaza Strip is still not a
"terror-free zone." Hamas's actions also demonstrate that the terror
group is determined to exploit the current ceasefire to reassert its
control over the Gaza Strip. The silence, or apathy, of the
international community, including so-called pro-Palestinian groups and
individuals, towards Hamas's crimes only encourages the terror group to
proceed with its crackdown on its own people. The silence of the world,
in addition, sends a message to the Palestinians that they should
refrain from rising against Hamas and other terror groups in the Gaza
Strip.

The Trump peace plan assumes that there are Hamas terrorists who might
commit to coexistence with Israel and lay down their weapons. Hamas's
actions and rhetoric in the past two weeks, however, suggest that the
opposite is true. We have not yet heard of a single Hamas terrorist
talking about recognizing Israel's right to exist. In the eyes of Hamas
leaders, the Trump peace plan is just another temporary ceasefire that
should be used for rearming, regrouping, and preparing for
massacring more Israelis.

On October 16, Hamas announced, in a statement marking the first
anniversary of the killing of Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the
October 7 atrocities:

"[T]he martyrdom of leader Yahya Sinwar, and before him the leaders
and symbols of the movement, will only increase the strength,
steadfastness, and determination of the movement, its people and its
resistance to adhere to their approach, continue in their path and
be loyal to their blood and sacrifices...

"[T]he ember of the Al-Aqsa Flood [the name Hamas uses for its
October 7 massacres] will remain burning and the banner of
resistance will not fall until comprehensive liberation and the
establishment of a fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital."

When Hamas talks about "comprehensive liberation," it means conquering
all the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, and
replacing Israel with an Islamist state.

Notably, Hamas is still fully committed to its 1988 charter, which
states:

"The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] believes that the land of
Palestine is an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Muslim
generations until Judgement Day. It, or any part of it, should not
be squandered; it, or any part of it, should not be given up.
Neither a single Arab country nor all Arab countries, neither any
king or president, nor all the kings and presidents, neither any
organization nor all of them, be they Palestinian or Arab, possess
the right to do that." (Article 11).

"There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through
Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all
a waste of time and vain endeavors." (Article 13)

In recent months, Hamas has been quoting a famous statement by its
former leader, the late Ismail Haniyeh, to confirm that the terror
group will never recognize Israel's right to exist: "We said it five
years ago and we say it now... we will never, we will never recognize
Israel."

For Hamas, any Palestinian or Arab who dares to make peace with Israel
is a "collaborator" and "traitor" who deserves the death sentence.
Hamas's public executions of "collaborators" aim to send a warning not
only to Palestinians, but to all Arabs as well: Peace and coexistence
with Israel is an act of treason punishable by death.

The Gaza Strip will never be de-radicalized as long as Hamas continues
to roam the streets and launch violent and ruthless crackdowns on
Palestinians. No transitional government or "Board of Peace" will ever
be able to enforce law and order as long as Hamas terrorists feel free
to murder any Palestinian who wants peace and coexistence with Israel.

De-radicalization will happen only after Palestinians see that Hamas
has been totally defeated, disarmed and removed from power. This is the
only way to ensure the success of the Trump peace plan. The way things
are going in the Gaza Strip these days, it appears that we are
returning to the pre-October 7 era, during which Hamas maintained its
grip on the Gaza Strip with an iron fist. Failure to eradicate Hamas
will only pave the way for another October 7 massacre against Israel.
