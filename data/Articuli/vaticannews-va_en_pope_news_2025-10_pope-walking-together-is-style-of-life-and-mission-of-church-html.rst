Pope: Walking together is the Church's style of life

Pope Leo XIV sends a message, signed by Cardinal Secretary of State
Parolin, to a conference in Camaldoli, Italy on the theme: “What kind
of bishop in a synodal Church?”

By Vatican News

May these days of study inspire “a renewed understanding that walking
together is the style of life and mission of the Church.”

That was the hope Pope Leo XIV expressed to the speakers and
participants in the theological conference ‘What kind of bishop in a
synodal Church?’, currently underway at the Hermitage of Camaldoli,
central Italy.

The four-day event, running from from October 6 to 9, aims to explore
the figure and ministry of the bishop within a synodal Church, seeking
to explore how the Church can develop a synodal style and structure by
rethinking episcopal ministry from a synodal perspective.

The Pope’s Message

In the message - signed by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin
and addressed to Dom Matteo Ferrari, Prior General of the Camaldolese
Congregation of the Order of Saint Benedict - the Pope calls the
gathering “significant”, and adds that he is “spiritually” present.

He expresses appreciation for the initiative, which he says is of
“theological and ecclesial depth.”

His hope, he says, is that the meeting might awaken a new awareness of
“walking together,” as “authentic synodality by its very nature
requires listening and the participation of all the baptized, according
to the vocation of each” – but, Pope Leo emphasised, we “cannot
disregard the authority conferred by Christ on the College of Bishops
with the Successor of Peter as its head.”
