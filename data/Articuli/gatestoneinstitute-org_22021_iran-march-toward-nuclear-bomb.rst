Iran's announcement to the world that it will no longer respect any
laws, treaties, or limits on its nuclear program is, in essence, a
declaration of war. The regime has always wanted nuclear weapons. The
West must tighten sanctions, monitor every step of Iran's program, and
maintain credible military options. Pictured: Iran's President Masoud

Iran's regime has officially declared that it will not abide by any
nuclear limits. It is finally admitting out in the open that its
ultimate objective has always been to become a nuclear-armed state.

Its announcement is not merely a change of rhetoric; it represents the
formal end of Iran's long-standing campaign of deception, in which it
pretended to cooperate with international nuclear agreements while
secretly expanding its program.

Since the Islamic Republic of Iran's establishment in 1979, its
leadership has viewed nuclear weapons as a guarantee of regime survival
and a means of projecting power across the Middle East and further. For
decades, Iran has cloaked its ambitions under the banner of "peaceful
nuclear energy." Now, it has stepped out from behind the curtain. It is
no longer pretending to follow the rules of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty or any agreement that limits its activities.
Iran is signaling to the world that it intends to move forward,
unrestricted and unapologetic, toward the finish line — acquiring
nuclear weapons.

This is not the first time the Iranian regime has defied international
agreements and nuclear limits. Iran has been in violation of its
commitments for years, including under the Obama administration's
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the "Iran
nuclear deal." The JCPOA, which was presented by its architects as a
tool to constrain Iran, in practice provided the regime with
international legitimacy, economic relief, and sufficient time and
resources to strengthen its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
When Iran claims now that the JCPOA is "dead," it is simply
acknowledging that it never had any intention of honoring it in the
first place. While the regime publicly claimed to respect the deal, in
reality, it was quietly expanding its capabilities, building
advanced centrifuges, and enriching uranium far beyond the levels
needed for peaceful nuclear energy. Even as Iran's officials posed as
partners in diplomacy, their scientists were working tirelessly to
bring the country closer to a nuclear weapons threshold.

The Obama-era nuclear deal, hailed by some as a diplomatic
breakthrough, was, in reality, a gift from US President Barack Obama to
the Iranian regime. The deal gave Iran access to billions of
dollars in frozen assets, lifted crippling sanctions, and restored its
access to the global financial system.

Before the deal, Iran was on its knees economically, largely due to the
firm sanctions imposed by the Bush administration. These sanctions
had weakened the regime's economy, restricted its oil exports, and
reduced its ability to fund its regional proxies. The JCPOA reversed
that process. Once sanctions were lifted, Iran began exporting oil
again, receiving foreign investments, and trading with Asia and Europe.

This influx of money not only revived the regime but emboldened it.
Instead of using its newfound wealth to improve the lives of Iranians,
the leadership poured those billions into its military, its nuclear
weapons program and the ballistic missiles to deliver them, and its
network of Middle East terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, the
Houthis, and Hamas.

Years later, the consequences of that deal became tragically clear.
Iran's funding and support for its proxy militias directly
contributed to instability, bloodshed, and the terrorism of Hamas,
Hezbollah and the Houthis. The Iranian regime, enriched and emboldened
by the West's concessions, was able to accelerate its nuclear
advancements while simultaneously fueling violent movements across the
region. Hamas's October 7, 2023 massacre of Israelis was just one of
the many outcomes of Tehran's empowerment after the nuclear deal.

By the time international inspectors raised alarms, Iran was
already only a few weeks away from acquiring the material necessary for
a nuclear weapon — and this happened under the very deal that was
supposed to stop it. This pattern should serve as a powerful lesson for
policymakers everywhere: appeasing tyrannical regimes does not bring
peace; it induces greater danger. Making deals with the Iranian regime
is no different from negotiating with Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler.
It is a fatal illusion to believe that a totalitarian system built on
deceit, violence and religious extremism can overnight become a
trustworthy partner.

Now Iran has made it official — it will not respect international
rules, it will not follow any limits, and it will pursue its
nuclear weapons ambitions with complete disregard for the global order.
Iran has openly stated that it will not honor its obligations, meaning
it is preparing to use everything it has — its uranium stockpiles,
advanced centrifuges, and technical expertise — to build nuclear
weapons. It will not do so alone. Iran has devoted friends in what can
only be described as the "dictators' club": China, Russia, and North
Korea. These regimes have increasingly been cooperating closely,
sharing military technology, intelligence, and political support.
Russia has already declared that it will not recognize the
reimposition of United Nations sanctions — the so-called "snapback"
mechanism — against Iran. In other words, the world's authoritarian
powers are closing ranks, ignoring international law, and giving Iran
the green light to cross the nuclear threshold.

Faced with this reality, the West needs finally to wake up to the
danger of an Iran with nuclear weapons. The idea that Iran can be
persuaded through diplomacy or economic incentives to change its
behavior has failed time and again. The West cannot afford a
nuclear-armed Iran, which would not only endanger Israel and other
Middle East states but destabilize the entire global order. A
nuclear-armed theocracy that sponsors terrorism would trigger a
regional arms race, push Saudi Arabia and Turkey toward developing
their own nuclear weapons, and place the world on the edge of
catastrophe.

The first and most crucial step is to reestablish deterrence. The
United States and its allies must make it clear that the military
option is on the table. Any evidence that Iran is advancing its nuclear
weapons program should be met with decisive action, including targeted
strikes on nuclear facilities if necessary. The regime must understand
that the world will not tolerate its nuclear blackmail.

In addition to deterrence, the West needs immediately to reimpose and
expand sanctions and secondary sanctions -– announcing that countries
that do business with Iran may no longer do business with the United
States. Unfortunately, Europe remains far behind. The European Union
needs to stop providing diplomatic cover for Tehran and instead adopt a
unified strategy of maximum pressure. This means expelling Iranian
diplomats, closing down Iranian cultural centers and embassies that
serve as fronts for intelligence operations, cutting off trade, and
freezing all assets connected to the regime. The message must be clear:
there will be no business, no legitimacy, and no cooperation with a
government that defies international law and threatens global peace.

At the same time, the West would do well to increase its support for
the Iranian people, who continue to resist their dictatorship through
protests and civil disobedience. Moral and political support for the
Iranian population, even in words, can send a strong signal that the
world stands with them, not with their oppressors.

Iran's announcement to the world that it will no longer respect any
laws, treaties, or limits on its nuclear program is, in essence, a
declaration of war. The regime has always wanted nuclear weapons. The
West must tighten sanctions, monitor every step of Iran's program, and
maintain credible military options. Appeasement and indecision will
only embolden Tehran further. The Iranian regime is going full nuclear,
and the West needs to act — swiftly, decisively, and with unity —
before removing Iran's nuclear program becomes difficult.
