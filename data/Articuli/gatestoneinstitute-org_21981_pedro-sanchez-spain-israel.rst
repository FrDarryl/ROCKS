nuke Israel.

that fuels violent protests." -- Alberto Núñez Feijóo, Spanish

most likely helped finance the biggest terrorist attack on Spanish
soil is respected and rewarded by Spain, while Israel, which is
fighting that very same terrorism, is denigrated and its citizens
hounded.

* Already, Spain has prohibited any trade in military equipment with
Israel, banned the use of Spanish ports and airspace to transport
fuel or weapons to the Israeli military, and is introducing an
additional 9 measures against Israel, while throwing many more
millions of euros after the terrorist UNRWA.

doing what all corrupt leaders have always done: blaming the Jews
to deflect attention from his own problems. Sánchez finds himself
in the midst of several corruption scandals and is struggling to
stay in power amidst demands for him to be held accountable and
resign.

Before the extraordinary success of "Phase One" of US President Donald
J. Trump's peace plan yesterday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez
expressed his regret recently that Spain, due to its lack of nuclear
weapons, could not end the war in Gaza – meaning nuke Israel.

"Spain, as you know, doesn't have nuclear bombs, aircraft carriers, or
large oil reserves," Sánchez lamented. "We alone can't stop the
Israeli offensive. But that doesn't mean we won't stop trying. Because
there are causes worth fighting for, even if winning them isn't in our
sole power."

Sánchez's comment -- wishing for the annihilation of Israel -- did not
raise any eyebrows among Western European elites, who are usually quick
to arrest, fine and imprison for alleged "hate speech," anyone who
disagrees with their policies or hurts their sensitive feelings.
Apparently remarks such as that -- wishing for the genocide of the Jews
-- are now normalized, mainstream and socially acceptable for the
leader of an ostensibly civilized European country.

A few days later, Sánchez happily remarked that the violent rioters
who have been disrupting the weeks-long Vuelta cycling race in Spain to
protest the participation of the Israeli cycling team -- a private
team, not a state one -- bring the riders into physical danger. The
Spanish prime minister, far from ensuring the restoration of law and
order at this international sporting event, was praising the
violence and inciting more of it:

Today the Vuelta a España finishes and we show our absolute respect
and recognition for the athletes. But [we also show] our admiration
for the Spanish people who mobilise for just causes such as
Palestine. Today Spain shines as an example and as a source of
pride. It's [giving] an example to the international community by
taking a step forward in defence of human rights."

Targeting Jews, we are given to understand, is now a "defense of human
rights."

Spain's pro-Hamas rioters acted immediately on the prime minister's
incitement. They launched such a violent attack on the last part of the
Vuelta that it had to be cancelled entirely. According to sources
in Spain's police trade union, the police appear to have received
orders not to act against the pro-Hamas rioters as they struck.

"Spain is the only democratic country where it is the government that
fuels violent protests," opposition leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo
said.

Earlier, Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares had done his own
part in fueling the riots by announcing that ordinary Israelis are
no longer welcome in Spain, and advocating for the expulsion of the
Israeli cycling team from the Vuelta race:

"We have to send a message to Israel and the Israeli society that
Europe and Israel can only have normal relations when human rights
are respected."

Israel and Spain are not at war. Nevertheless, Albares, with his
statement, declared Israelis – Jews – beyond the pale of "normal
relations" due to a defensive and existential war that Israel is
fighting - in part also to protect Spain.

Conversely, when Al Qaeda – sponsored by Qatar – launched the
deadliest terrorist attack on European soil in Spain in 2004,
murdering 193 people and wounding 2,000 others, Muslims were not
spoken of this way: that would have been discriminatory. Not only that,
but since then, Spain has welcomed millions of Muslim immigrants into
the country, including a million Moroccans, even though one of the Al
Qaeda terrorists behind the attack on Spain was Moroccan.

What of Qatar, which sponsors Al Qaeda? Spain and Qatar enjoy
excellent relations, and entered into a strategic partnership in
2022 to deepen their economic and political ties. The country that most
likely helped finance the biggest terrorist attack on Spanish soil is
respected and rewarded by Spain, while Israel, which is fighting that
very same terrorism, is denigrated and its citizens hounded.

Already, Spain has prohibited any trade in military equipment with
Israel, banned the use of Spanish ports and airspace to transport fuel
or weapons to the Israeli military, and is introducing an additional 9
measures against Israel, while throwing many more millions of euros
after the terrorist UNRWA.

In May 2024, Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Díaz Pérez vowed
that "Palestine will be free from the river to the sea," so the
genocidal strain in the Spanish government since 1492, when both the
Jews and the "Moors" (Muslims) were expelled, is not new. Apparently
Spanish ministers are too busy threatening the Jewish state with
annihilation to have time to look at people within their own country to
whom they are denying statehood.

Catalonia, for instance, which is a region with its own national
culture and language, has long struggled to be independent, but in
2017, when it tried to hold a referendum for independence, Spanish
national police beat Catalonian voters and threw Catalonian
politicians in jail.

At the end of the day, other than his hatred of Jews, Sánchez is doing
what all corrupt leaders have always done: blaming the Jews to deflect
attention from his own problems. Sánchez finds himself in the midst of
several corruption scandals and is struggling to stay in power
amidst demands for him to be held accountable and resign.

Meanwhile, Spain's Jews pay the price for the Spanish government's
Jew-hate, most recently at the Vuelta. Spanish Jews, who went to see
the Vuelta with Spanish and Israeli flags, were harassed by "hundreds
of people with Palestinian flags and with a tremendously violent and
coercive attitude," despite the fact that they were located where the
police told them to stand to avoid confrontation. The mob even chased
them even though they moved elsewhere "not to provoke anyone."
Meanwhile, the police did nothing.

Ángel Más, president of the Action and Communication for the Middle
East (ACOM), said:

""It was a very sad day in which street terrorism was normalized as
a way to obtain political objectives through coercion, intimidation,
the breaking of the law and fundamental rights.... These people did
not come to protest a cycling tour, or support any team, or
peacefully express an opinion at a public event. They came to lynch
us. Their problem is not the participation of an Israeli team in La
Vuelta; its problem is that we breathe, it is that we exist."

Perhaps it is time for Sánchez and those who voted for him to
reconsider.
