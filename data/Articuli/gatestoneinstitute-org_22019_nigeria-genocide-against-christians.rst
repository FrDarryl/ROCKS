* Since 2011, Islamic violence against Nigerian Christians has
escalated.

* "Our reporters have documented that mass kidnappings of women in
Kaduna state in 2023 were in fact aimed at capturing scores of
women in Southern Kaduna and selling them as sex slaves in the
Fulani bandit community." — Douglas Burton, managing editor of
"Truth Nigeria," interview with Gatestone Institute, October 2025.

* "The chief reason there is so little media attention is that the
Nigerian media themselves have deliberately failed to give a clear
picture of who is doing the violence and why.... Most media appear
to be controlled by cash payments from government spokesmen or
others offering 'courtesy gifts.' When the army holds a presser,
every reporter who shows up gets a cash envelope, the more
influential his paper, the bigger the reward -- still the practice
in many countries, I believe. TV reporters get better incentives,
and TV executives are said to receive parcels of real estate in
Kaduna State. TruthNigeria reporters tell me that in previous years
they used to take those 'courtesy gifts,' too. Our reporters find
it very hard to get Nigerian public affairs officers to answer
their calls...." — Douglas Burton, October 2025.

* U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has introduced the Nigeria Religious Freedom
Accountability Act of 2025.

* "Nigerian Christians are being targeted and executed for their
faith by Islamist terrorist groups, and are being forced to submit
to sharia law and blasphemy laws across Nigeria. It is long past
time to impose real costs on the Nigerian officials who facilitate
these activities, and my Nigeria Religious Freedom Accountability
Act uses new and existing tools to do exactly that. I urge my
colleagues to advance this critical legislation expeditiously." —
Senator Ted Cruz, September 11, 2025.

* Many in the U.S. are urgently expecting the Senate to follow Cruz's
lead.

Tens of thousands of Christians in Nigeria have been murdered in recent
years by Islamic terrorists, in an ongoing genocide. Other than the
massacres, there are also thousands of church burnings, abductions and
forced conversions of Christian children and women to Islam. Pictured:

As the genocide against Christians in Nigeria crashes on, a news
outlet, TruthNigeria.com, continues to courageously shed light on the
atrocities committed by jihadists against Nigerians of all religions.

"Truth Nigeria," according to its website, "had to be launched to
slice through the fog of war and the cloud of false narrative that
bedevils mainstream media reporting of what many call a 'Christian
genocide' in Nigeria that has been spreading like a cancer."

Award-winning journalist Douglas Burton, a former U.S. State Department
official who says, "I serve as managing editor for about 12 freelancers
who risk their lives to lift the veil on the world's most shameful and
still barely reported Christian genocide," was interviewed by
Gatestone:

"TruthNigeria.com is a project of Equipping the Persecuted, a
humanitarian-aid nonprofit, chartered in Sioux City, Iowa since
2019. In Nigeria, our reporters live in or near the war zones of
Kaduna, Plateau, Benue and Adamawa states, and they all have had
dramatic introductions to the conflict. All have lost friends or
relatives to Boko Haram or to attacks by Fulani ethnic militia.
Others were citizen journalists reporting about violence on social
media who had a passion to expose the genocide.

"Some of our reporters have been jailed for months at a time for
trumped up charges simply for telling embarrassing truths about
oligarchs.

"The team usually see photos and videos on messaging services such
as WhatsApp, or by cell phone text from friends. Sometimes the
terrorists themselves make bragworthy videos of themselves in the
bush celebrating by shooting off scores of bullets; sometimes they
send heartbreaking videos of torturing kidnap victims to the
victims' families. But places and locations, and dates are sometimes
figured out. Local hunters and volunteer guards are useful
witnesses, and, with just a small 'courtesy gift,' they often open
up."

Since 2011, Islamic violence against Nigerian Christians has escalated.

"In 2010, Nigeria was widely viewed as a rising regional power. It
was often said to be the only nation where radical Islam was
actively being pushed back. While occasional attacks occurred, they
were infrequent and met with national outrage. Importantly, there
were effectively zero recognized internally displaced persons
(IDPs). That changed dramatically after 2011. There were bloody
riots in several cities and small towns then due to the election
victory of Goodluck Jonathan, an Igbo and a Christian. At the time,
the Boko Haram ('Western learning is forbidden') insurgency was in
its second year and growing. A deadly new phase opened on August 26,
2011, when a terrorist car bombing at the United Nations House in
Abuja claimed the lives of 23 UN employees and civilians and left
over 60 people injured.

"It is rarely mentioned, and even some Nigerians do not seem to
comprehend, that the 28 million Christians living the Middle Belt
states are squeezed between two ethnicities rooted in Islamic
identity and vying with each other for supremacy: the Fulani tribe
that came into Nigeria with the Usman Dan Fodio invasion in 1804 vs.
the historic Caliphate linked to the Kanuri tribe in Lake Chad.

"The Kanuri's number approximately 8.28 million today, whereas there
are possibly 20 million Fulani, and 30 to 40 million Hausa people.
The Fulani Muslim armies that swept over Northern Nigeria in the
first decade of the 19^th Century tried and failed to subjugate the
Caliphate of Bornu in Lake Chad. The British defeated the Fulani
emirs in 1895 and ended the slave trade. But the Fulani Sultan of
Sokoto allowed the British colonials to rule indirectly until
independence in 1960. No similar trade-off was made with the Muslim
Caliph of Bornu. Today there are, by some estimates, 50 million
residents of the Middle Belt states, of which 65% are Christian, 10%
Muslim. Yet most of these states are ruled by Muslims, who gain
office by election, though these are notoriously rigged and tainted
by violence.

"Since independence from Britain in 1960, there was already a
divided nation, with the northern states overwhelmingly Muslim and
the southern states majority Christian. The departing British
colonials had used the northern Muslim elites as top officers in the
Nigerian army, navy and police forces, and key positions of power in
the executive branch were held by Muslims. There is rivalry and bad
blood between the Hausa-Fulani tribes in the north and the Christian
Igbo tribes in the southeastern states. The bloody coup of July 6,
1967, precipitated the civil war of 1967 and the ensuing genocidal
suppression of the breakaway nation of Biafra."

There are, notes Burton, wildly varying estimates of death counts,
including of Muslims, in Nigeria since the emergence of Boko Haram's
violent phase in 2009.

"TruthNigeria considers the most accurate report that of the
Belgium-based Observatory for Religious Freedom in Africa (ORFA).
The quadrennial ORFA study issued in 2024 reported that, between
2019 and 2023, 55,000 citizens were killed by the range of civil
conflict the government calls 'Insecurity'. Of these, ORFA reports
that 19,000 were civilians. This means that 26,000 of the fatalities
were counted either as security personnel or criminals or
insurgents. On average 5,000 plus citizens every year are killed
either by bandits, jihadists or Fulani ethnic militia. That is a big
undercount: many killings and kidnappings go unreported.
TruthNigeria investigators this year did a 9-part series on mass
hostage camps maintained by Fulani bandits in forests south of
Kaduna where many thousands of kidnapped people have been held for
months at a time. We believe virtually none of these people were
noted as kidnapping statistics by government officials, nor were
many of the persons murdered in these camps registered as fatalities
by ORFA.

"ORFA reports show that for every Muslim fatality there are five
Christian or non-Muslims killed. However, much larger numbers have
been cited by the UN, which reported in 2021 that more than
300,000 children had been killed by conflict, disease and starvation
caused by the Boko Haram insurgency."

Other than the massacres, there are also thousands of church burnings,
abductions and forced conversions of Christian children and women to
Islam.

"The NGO called Intersociety claims that 12,000 churches have been
destroyed by terrorists, but we cannot confirm that. TruthNigeria
has documented forced conversion and forced marriages of Christian
teen girls to Muslim men in northern states. Our reporters have
documented that mass kidnappings of women in Kaduna state in 2023
were in fact aimed at capturing scores of women in Southern Kaduna
and selling them as sex slaves in the Fulani bandit community.

"Mass rape of Muslim women belonging to "noncooperative" clans is a
terrorist weapon deployed in bandit gangs in several Western states,
including Sokoto, Zamfara and Niger states. Sexual violence against
women taken by kidnappers is very common but rarely reported. There
is clear evidence of sectarian selection. The Fulani bandit gangs in
the Northwestern states usually attack mosques that are aligned with
Imams who are not aligned with the Wahabbist forms of theology
advocated by the Izala Islamic center in Jos."

"The chief reason there is so little media attention is that the
Nigerian media themselves have deliberately failed to give a clear
picture of who is doing the violence and why. When I started
reporting in 2019, no Nigerian newspaper identified the ethnicity of
the gangs' burning villages in Kaduna State and murdering scores of
people in the middle of the night. The criminals would be called
'unknown gunmen,' or 'herdsmen,' or 'hooligans.' It appears that
obvious obfuscation was in obeisance to Nigerian officials looking
over the shoulders of their bosses. The official ruse has somewhat
worn off in the last year since we have made a point of showcasing
Nigerian mainstream media's dishonesty. Tens of thousands of
Nigerian Christians have been murdered and tortured to death for
years by Fulani tribe ethnic Militia. We broke the taboo from its
first appearance in 2023. Now some are following our lead.

"Besides TruthNigeria and Sahara Reporters, and a couple of
investigative nonprofits, most media appear to be controlled by cash
payments from government spokesmen or others offering 'courtesy
gifts.' When the army holds a presser, every reporter who shows up
gets a cash envelope, the more influential his paper, the bigger the
reward -- still the practice in many countries, I believe. TV
reporters get better incentives, and TV executives are said to
receive parcels of real estate in Kaduna State. TruthNigeria
reporters tell me that in previous years they used to take those
"courtesy gifts," too. Our reporters find it very hard to get
Nigerian public affairs officers to answer their calls, so they must
use other ways to get official statements from office holders.
TruthNigeria called our hardworking Nigerian scribes out for it on
October 22: 'Nigerian Media in Lockstep with Government
No-Genocide Narrative.'"

Meanwhile, Burton said, U.S. Senator. Ted Cruz has introduced the
Nigeria Religious Freedom Accountability Act of 2025.

"Government control of the narrative is on flagrant display since
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and four of his colleagues announced their
bill in November to demand that the U.S. State Department shame
Nigeria as a 'Country of Particular Concern' and sanction Nigerian
officials for enforcing legal punishments for Blasphemy."

"Nigerian Christians," Cruz said, "are being targeted and executed
for their faith by Islamist terrorist groups, and are being forced to
submit to sharia law and blasphemy laws across Nigeria. It is long past
time to impose real costs on the Nigerian officials who facilitate
these activities, and my Nigeria Religious Freedom Accountability Act
uses new and existing tools to do exactly that. I urge my colleagues to
advance this critical legislation expeditiously."

Many in the U.S. are urgently expecting the Senate to follow Cruz's
lead.
