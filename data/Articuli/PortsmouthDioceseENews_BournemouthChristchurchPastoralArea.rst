Bournemouth-Christchurch Pastoral Area

Until now, the parishes of the area of Bournemouth and Christchurch have belonged to three distinct Pastoral Areas (PA): Bournemouth East, Bournemouth South and Bournemouth West. Bournemouth East PA comprised the parishes of The Annunciation and St. Edmund Campion, Charminster, Immaculate Conception and St Joseph, Christchurch, and Holy Redeemer, Highcliffe. Bournemouth South PA comprised the parishes of Corpus Christi, Boscombe, St. Thomas More, Iford, and Our Lady Queen of Peace, Southbourne. Bournemouth West PA comprised the parishes of Sacred Heart (The Oratory) and Our Lady Immaculate, Westbourne. After comments and recommendations from the clergy and parishes concerned and after advice from members of the Bishopâ€™s Council, I have decided to amalgamate these three PAs into one. The new combined area will be called the Bournemouth-Christchurch Pastoral Area and fall under the direction of Fr. Anthony Ikhenoba, as the Coordinating Pastor. I hope that this will assist the mission across the whole area of Christchurch and Bournemouth.
