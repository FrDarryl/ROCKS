It has been said, purportedly by G.K. Chesterton, that when people stop
believing in God, they don’t believe in nothing but in anything. Even
worse is that the things which people believe are not merely godless
but deadly and demonic. Take, for instance, the modern anti-Christian
creeds that led to the French and Russian Revolutions and to the rise
of the Nazis. These monstrous ideologies gave us the guillotine, the
gulag, and the gas chamber, each of which was a means to destroy those
dissidents deemed to be enemies of the state. One such dissident was
Anna Ivanovna Abrikosova, later known as Mother Catherine of Siena.

Mother Catherine was a Russian Catholic religious sister who founded a
convent of Third Order Dominicans in her Moscow apartment and would
spend more than a decade of solitary confinement as a prisoner of
conscience in Joseph Stalin’s concentration camps before dying in
prison.

Born in Moscow in 1882 into a noble Russian family, Anna Abrikosova
studied at Girton College, Cambridge, before moving to France. She was
received into the Catholic Church in the St. Vincent de Paul chapel of
the Church of the Madeline in Paris in 1908.

After her return to Russia and her founding of the Byzantine Catholic
sisters’ community of the Third Order of St. Dominic, she and the other
members vowed in August 1917 to sacrifice themselves to the Holy
Trinity for the salvation of the Russian people. In this dramatic
pledge to lay down their lives for Christ for the conversion of their
country, they were perhaps inspired by the heroic witness of the
Discalced Carmelite Martyrs of Compiègne who were guillotined during
the Reign of Terror following the French Revolution.

Only two months after the sisters had taken their vows, the Bolshevik
Revolution, in October 1917, ushered in more than 70 years of atheist
persecution. In spite of the imminent danger to themselves, Abrikosova
and the sisters continued their religious work, opening an illegal
Catholic school for those who did not want their children brainwashed
by the Marxist indoctrination of the compulsory Soviet public school
system. They also translated many Catholic texts into the Russian
language, in defiance of state censorship, circulating their
translations in secret.

Inevitably, Mother Catherine and the other sisters of her community
were arrested in November 1923. She was sentenced to ten years of
solitary confinement and would be imprisoned at Yaroslavl from 1924 to
1932. Shortly before sentencing, Mother Catherine told the sisters of
her community that

every one of you, having given your love to God and following in His
way, has in your heart more than once asked Christ to grant you the
opportunity to share in His sufferings. And so it is; the moment has
now arrived. Your desire to suffer for His sake is now being
fulfilled.

“Every one of you, having given your love to God and following in
His way, has in your heart more than once asked Christ to grant you the
opportunity to share in His sufferings. And so it is, the moment has
not arrived.” – Mother Catherine

After spending eight years in solitary confinement, Mother Catherine
was diagnosed with breast cancer and was transferred to Butyrka Prison
infirmary for an operation. Her left breast and some of the muscles on
her back and side were removed, leaving her left arm paralyzed. In
August 1932, following the operation, she petitioned to be returned to
her cell in Yaroslavl but was told that she was now free and that her
sentence was over. She walked directly from Butyrka Prison to the
Church of St. Louis des Français, resuming her labors for Christ in the
Soviet vale of tears.

“This woman is a genuine preacher of the Faith and very courageous,”
wrote the underground Catholic bishop Pie Eugène Neveu, in a letter to
Rome. “One feels insignificant beside someone of this moral stature.
She still cannot see well, and she can only use her right hand, since
the left is paralyzed.”

“As for my sister,” wrote her brother Dmitrii Abrikosov,

nothing was heard about her for nine years and even my eldest
brother, who worked for the Soviets and became a prominent
scientist, could do nothing for her. Then suddenly she reappeared in
Moscow. Relatives who saw her wrote to my aunt in Paris that she
gave the impression of a Saint.

Irrespective of the risk of arrest and reimprisonment, Mother Catherine
reestablished connections with the surviving sisters of her order,
intent on taking up once again the task of evangelizing the culture of
death in which she found herself. She was duly arrested, along with 24
other Catholics, and was accused of forming a “terrorist organization”
which was plotting to assassinate Joseph Stalin, overthrow the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and restore the House of Romanov
as a constitutional monarchy in collaboration with “international
fascism” and “Papal theocracy.” It was further alleged that their
“terrorist” activities were being directed by the Vatican’s
Congregation for the Oriental Churches on the orders of Pope Pius XI
himself.

After being declared guilty as charged, Mother Catherine was returned
to the prison at Yaroslavl. She died in prison from spinal cancer in
1936. Her body was cremated unceremoniously, and the ashes were thrown
into a mass grave in the Donskoy Cemetery of central Moscow.

The surviving sisters would finally be released in the mid-1950s. One
of them, Nora Rubashova, would subsequently be interviewed by the great
Soviet dissident and Nobel Prize winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, as part
of his research for The Gulag Archipelago, his bestselling exposé of
the horrors of the Soviet prison system.

Let’s conclude our homage to this courageous dissident damsel who
defied the red dragon of Soviet communism with a poem inspired by her
martyrdom written by Fr. Sergei Solovyov (1885-1942), a Russian poet,
concentration camp survivor, and Byzantine Catholic priest, who had
served as the underground chaplain to Mother Catherine and her convent
of Third Order Dominican Sisters prior to their arrest:

It was no accidental vision
When like a specter in the night
Of Lefortovo’s hellish prison
I watched you rise before my sight.
In prison’s dirty degradation,
Your dignity remained entire
And burned for our illumination,
Transfigured with unearthly fire.
Like to Siena’s Maid Seraphic,
You gazed with unbroken eyes
Upon our prison’s savage traffic;
As on red blooms of paradise.
A swan with poise and grace empowered,
As pure as mountain snow and frost;
Inside my soul your image flowered
And never shall I count it lost.
In habit, without ostentation,
You sensed your looming sacrifice;
Years in chains, dark isolation,
And your reward as bride of Christ.
Confined now by your enemies
With thugs and thieves; it’s for the Creed
Of Christ, crucified by Pharisees,
Who gives His Flesh as food indeed.
The hill of love and crucifixion
Was yours and, in that little spell,
There fell a drop of benediction
Inside my spirit’s dried up well!
