Engineers, Not Immigrants, Will Save America

Importing the solution to the US Workforce problem ensures that the US will never solve the US Workforce problem. * John Mac Ghlionn

A nation’s strength is seen not in words but in works. Roads, bridges, power grids, and factories reveal its character more than any speech or summit. By that measure, China has moved far ahead. High-speed rail links its provinces, solar fields cover its deserts, and factories bring ideas to life with remarkable speed. These are the fruits of engineers, who are honored for their work.

Dan Wang, in his book Breakneck, describes this ascent well. Yet he errs when he argues that America’s answer is to bring in more talent from abroad. No country can build its future on the labor of others. Renewal begins at home—in the classroom, the workshop, and the family. President Trump’s recent order requiring a $100,000 fee for every new H-1B visa application points in the right direction. Critics say it will price out small firms, but the principle is sound. American workers should not be undercut by a pipeline of cheap foreign labor.

For Catholics, this lesson is familiar. A house cannot stand if it rests on borrowed beams. It must be built on its own stones, set firm and secure. The Gospel warns, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” America’s problem is not the absence of foreign talent. It’s the neglect of its own builders.

Once, this nation honored those who worked with hand and mind. Engineers strung telephone wires across mountains, carved highways through plains, and lifted rockets into the heavens. Today, prestige has shifted. The culture crowns financiers, lawyers, and influencers. We have traded the dignity of the builder for the vanity of the brand.

Meanwhile, China now graduates four times as many engineers each year. Yet numbers alone don’t explain the difference. In China, engineers are esteemed. In America, they are often overlooked, their work dismissed as plain or dull. The myth lingers that great breakthroughs come from visionaries with words rather than craftsmen with steel, circuits, and skill. That myth has hobbled the very nation once known for its ingenuity.

Here, Wang’s remedy falls short. Immigration may mask the wound, but it leaves the illness untouched. Worse, it tempts leaders to shirk duty. Rather than reform schools, inspire children, and restore dignity to technical vocations, they rely on borrowed talent. It is outsourcing of a different kind—not factories but minds, trading the long work of cultivating talent at home for the shortcut of importing it from abroad.

What must be done? First, honesty. Without mastery of civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering, America risks surrendering its sovereignty. Chips, bridges, energy systems—these are not luxuries. They are lifelines. A people unable to sustain them will yield to rivals who can.

Second, the culture of engineering must be renewed. Scholarships should favor students who choose circuits over softer alternatives. Universities must be judged not by the novelty of their electives but by the skill of their graduates. High schools should restore shop, robotics, and problem-solving. A boy who wires a motor or a girl who designs a tower deserves the same recognition as one who scores a winning goal.

Third, industry must be engaged. Silicon Valley has poured fortunes into distraction but little into rail, energy, or construction. That balance must change. Federal support should reward firms that offer apprenticeships on a wide scale.

Picture a young man in Michigan learning to restore the strength of aging factories, helping breathe life back into towns decimated by decline. Picture a young woman in Pennsylvania mastering advanced energy systems, carrying forward the state’s long tradition of coal and industry into a more secure future. Envision an apprentice in Arizona rebuilding water infrastructure and power grids, knowledge that will decide the survival of communities in a drying land. Within a decade, debt would shrink, craft would grow, and the dignity of work would be restored in regions too often forgotten.

Yet industry alone cannot restore a culture. Families must take their share. Parents should teach children not only to use devices but to understand them. Communities should celebrate science fairs with the same pride they give to baseball games. Pride in craft must return—not as sentiment but as a sign of renewal.

Catholic teaching points the way. Work is not mere toil but true vocation. St. Joseph the carpenter embodies the quiet dignity of labor. To build is not only to provide but to participate in creation itself. When a young man fixes an engine or a young woman writes code, they echo the Creator who shaped the world with care. A society that scorns such work scorns its own foundation.

This path will be hard to navigate. China has spent decades climbing; America has spent decades drifting. Yet decline is not fate. The United States still holds wealth, fine universities, and a tradition of invention without equal. What it lacks is resolve, direction, and faith.

The temptation is to look outward, to believe strength can come from elsewhere. Yet a house built on another’s foundation will never stand secure. America must turn inward, honor its own children, restore dignity to its builders, and see engineering not as drudgery but as a noble calling.

Only then will it rise again as a nation that builds; and in building, it will endure.
