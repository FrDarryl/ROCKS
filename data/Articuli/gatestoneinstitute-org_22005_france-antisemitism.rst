* Macron did not even have the decency to make his recognition of a
non-existent Palestinian state contingent on Hamas releasing the
hostages.

* Joining Macron in this narcissistic display were other small, soft
leaders with large, hard Islamist constituencies -- Britain's PM
Keir Starmer, Australia's PM Anthony Albanese, and Canada's PM Mark
Carney -- who followed Macron's lead in granting international
legitimacy to a cause dedicated to terrorism.

* The Palestinian Authority continues to operate as an unelected
dictatorship, funneling millions into its infamous pay-for-slay
"jobs" program -- sometimes listed as "welfare" -- which grants
salaries to terrorists and their families based on how many Jews
they succeed in murdering. The more Jews they murder, the higher
the monthly stipend. Palestinian schoolbooks still erase Israel
from maps, depict Jews as usurpers, and teach children that the
ultimate aspiration is martyrdom.

* Macron's recognition, applauded by large sections of Europe and
beyond, was not the action of a statesman seeking peace. It was a
pitiful lunge to hold onto power by a weakened leader, desperate to
posture as a "moral arbiter" abroad while avoiding accountability
at home. Macron is willing to betray the Israelis, who are fighting
not only for the West but for his own people, the French.

* After France's defeat at the hands of Germany in 1940 came
collaboration. France's Vichy regime did not merely submit to
German edicts; it embraced its own homegrown antisemitism. Vichy's
machinery operated with bureaucratic zeal: statutes defining who
was a Jew, the exclusion of Jews from professions, property
seizures, internments, and ultimately deportations to Auschwitz.
The cultivated myth of a France "shielding" Jews while Germany did
the harm has long since been demolished by the historical record.
Vichy was a French government, enacting French laws to persecute
Jews on French soil, and in too many instances, to deliver them to
their deaths.

* ​ The moral cost was enormous. By making stability the overriding
priority, French authorities tacitly normalized contact with
organizations that targeted Jews and Israelis. These back-channel
accommodations blurred the line between counterterrorism and
collusion — and served as an early modern example of a recurring
French pattern: When domestic tranquility and influence in the Arab
world collide with the safety and security of Jews, the balance is
often struck in favor of tranquility.

* President Chirac, during a visit to Israel in October 1996, erupted
at what he called a "provocation" by Israeli plainclothes security
guards during a walk in the Old City of Jerusalem — an incident
that became emblematic of Paris's sensitivity to perceived Israeli
slights and a readiness to dramatize grievances that resonated with
the Arab and Muslim public. Whether the outburst was theatre or
genuine indignation, it fed a narrative: France would hold Israel
to scrutiny in a way that sometimes felt public and punitive, while
remaining discreet, conciliatory, or accommodating toward Arab
regimes.

* [H]ow come, if Mohammad al-Durrah was shot, there was no blood at
the scene? The controversy led to libel suits, heated media debates
in France, and a long war of narratives: for many critics, the
al-Durrah case became a test of whether French media could be
trusted to report dispassionately on Palestine-Israel — or whether
powerful images produced abroad would be turned into instruments of
political mobilization at home.

* For decades, the front pages of Le Monde, Libération, and Le Monde
Diplomatique have provided disproportionate framing that vilifies
Israel while sanitizing Palestinian violence. Headlines portraying
Israeli counter-terrorism as "aggression," while minimizing rocket
fire or suicide bombings, have shaped French public opinion,
sometimes more decisively than presidential speeches.

* The effect of this editorial slant is cumulative: each cover, each
op-ed, each biased image is built into a narrative architecture in
which Israel stands as the perennial aggressor and Palestinians as
the archetypal victims. This distortion is not merely academic. It
affects political choices, emboldens intellectuals who conflate
anti-Zionism with moral virtue, and reinforces a climate where
politicians know they can score points by signaling distance from
Jerusalem. In the long run, media coverage has hardened the double
standard and provided cultural cover for diplomatic betrayals.

* The 21st century has added a more transactional layer to France's
Arab policy: investment in the French economy. Few states have
invested more aggressively in French assets and businesses than
Qatar. The oil-rich emirate poured billions into Parisian real
estate, media holdings, luxury firms, and sports franchises. The
purchase of Paris Saint-Germain football team became a symbol of
how deeply Qatari capital has embedded itself into French public
life. Alongside investment came soft power: television channels,
think tanks, and influence campaigns aimed at projecting Doha's
narratives into French discourse.

* Qatar's record is not benign. For years it has financed Hamas and
sheltered its leadership. That France tolerated -- even courted --
Qatar despite these links testifies to a familiar pattern:
geopolitical expediency trumping moral clarity.

* Macron's post on X insisted on conditionality (Hamas must
relinquish control and the Palestinian Authority must reform), yet
those conditions remain unenforceable in practice. A state without
concrete guarantees risks rewarding the very actors — such as Hamas
and its patrons — who use terrorism as a policy. Macron's
declaration looks less like statesmanship and more like firing
blanks: a symbolic attempt at appeasement to placate vocal
constituencies at home and reclaim the moral high ground abroad by
offering up a state that someone else -- a sovereign nation, far
away -- is supposed to implement, while offering Israel and the
United States nothing at all.

* Domestically, Macron's maneuver landed poorly. Multiple polls
indicate that a large majority of the French public — roughly
three-quarters — opposed immediate, unconditional recognition of a
"Palestine" while Israeli hostages remained in Gaza or while Hamas
remained in power. The disconnect between Macron and his electorate
is striking. While he sought applause abroad, he was being widely
perceived at home as indulging in moral posturing that had little
chance of delivering peace and a lot of chance of making matters
worse.

French President Emmanuel Macron's recognition of the non-existent
state of "Palestine", applauded by large sections of Europe and beyond,
was not the action of a statesman seeking peace. It was a pitiful lunge
to hold onto power by a weakened leader, desperate to posture as a
"moral arbiter" abroad while avoiding accountability at home. Macron is
willing to betray the Israelis, who are fighting not only for the West
but for his own people, the French. Pictured: Macron (center),

On the eve of the Jewish New Year, when families across the world were
preparing to celebrate renewal and resilience, French President
Emmanuel Macron chose a different symbol.

He formally recognized, at the United Nations on September 23, a
so-called Palestinian state -- an act that emboldened Hamas, even as
the 20 Israeli hostages still believed to be alive remained starved,
tortured, and trapped in its tunnels in Gaza. Macron did not even have
the decency to make his recognition of a non-existent Palestinian state
contingent on Hamas releasing the hostages.

Joining Macron in this narcissistic display were other small, soft
leaders with large, hard Islamist constituencies -- Britain's PM Keir
Starmer, Australia's PM Anthony Albanese, and Canada's PM Mark Carney
-- who followed Macron's lead in granting international legitimacy to a
cause dedicated to terrorism.

The timing could hardly have been more cynical. It trampled on the
dignity of the hostages and their families, and rewarded forces that
glorify conquest and bloodshed, also in the West.

The Palestinian Authority continues to operate as an unelected
dictatorship, funneling millions into its infamous pay-for-slay "jobs"
program -- sometimes listed as "welfare" -- which grants salaries
to terrorists and their families based on how many Jews they succeed in
murdering. The more Jews they murder, the higher the monthly stipend.
Palestinian schoolbooks still erase Israel from maps, depict Jews as
usurpers, and teach children that the ultimate aspiration is martyrdom.

Macron's recognition, applauded by large sections of Europe and beyond,
was not the action of a statesman seeking peace. It was a pitiful lunge
to hold onto power by a weakened leader, desperate to posture as a
"moral arbiter" abroad while avoiding accountability at home. Macron is
willing to betray the Israelis, who are fighting not only for the West
but for his own people, the French.

The great French leader Charles Martel, who repelled the Muslims trying
to conquer France at Tours in the year 732, would probably die again
from disgust.

Macron's calculation is transparent: appease an increasingly assertive
Muslim electorate, cater to progressive elites, and hope that an
international gesture will distract the French public from his
collapsing domestic authority.

This is not the first time, in moments of moral testing, that France
has betrayed its own ideals. Not long ago, France surrendered to Hitler
and lived under the Third Reich's collaborationist government in
France, Vichy.

The very nation that proclaims itself the cradle of the Rights of Man
has a long and extremely questionable record when it comes to Jews and,
later, the Jewish state. From the anti-Semitic hysteria of the Dreyfus
Affair to the anti-Israel rhetoric of Charles de Gaulle, from France's
protection of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini after
World War II, to its welcoming of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the
eve of Iran's Islamic Revolution, Paris has repeatedly oscillated
between lofty universalist proclamations and sordid accommodations.

France's stance today under Macron is not an aberration. It is the
latest chapter in a long history of ambiguous — and often
duplicitous — policies toward the Jewish people and the State of
Israel. To understand this trajectory, one must begin at the very
moment when modern political Zionism was born: the Dreyfus Affair, in
the heart of Paris.

I. Dreyfus as the Matrix: The Birth of Modern Political Zionism

In 1894, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French Army,
was falsely accused of treason. The ensuing scandal tore French society
apart, dividing the country into two camps: the anti-Dreyfusards,
steeped in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and the defenders of
Dreyfus, who rallied behind principles of evidence, justice, and
equality before the law.

The hysteria was not confined to the courtroom. French newspapers
spread venomous caricatures portraying Jews as traitors, parasites, and
alien intruders within the French body politic. Crowds chanted
"Death to the Jews" in the streets of Paris.

For many, the case was not about one officer's guilt or innocence—it
was about the place of Jews in France itself.

One man observing this tragedy with particular intensity was Theodor
Herzl, a Jewish Viennese journalist covering the trial. Herzl had once
believed in the promise of European liberalism, convinced that Jews
could assimilate fully within modern nation-states. Yet in Paris he
witnessed the fragility of that dream. If antisemitism could erupt with
such virulence in the land of Voltaire (who, sadly, was himself a
venomous antisemite) and the Enlightenment, then emancipation was a
lie. Jews, Herzl concluded, would never be secure unless they had a
state of their own.

From this epiphany came Herzl's 1896 pamphlet Der Judenstaat (The
Jewish State), then, one year later, the first Zionist Congress in
Basel. His vision did not emerge in a vacuum; it was born of the venom
he had witnessed in France. The Dreyfus Affair became the crucible in
which modern political Zionism was forged.

French intellectual currents not only gave rise to Zionism — they also
nourished antisemitism in forms that would metastasize worldwide. As
France vacillated between defenders of justice and merchants of hatred,
the battle lines drawn in the 1890s would echo throughout the twentieth
century.

II. French Letters and the Poisoned Well (1890s–1930s)

It is hard to understand the modern spread of European antisemitism
without factoring in its French literary engine. In 1886, Édouard
Drumont published La France juive, a runaway bestseller that packaged
bigotry as a total explanation of French decline. Drumont did not
merely "describe" Jews; he indicted them as an alien cabal, thereby
giving a popular movement both its slogans and its pseudo-intellectual
veneer. His newspaper, La Libre Parole, normalized the discourse,
turning antisemitism into a daily habit for thousands of readers. The
template of conspiracy, financial demonology and cultural contempt
would stretch across Europe and into the twentieth century.

By the years between the world wars, the climate had worsened. Jacques
Doriot, once a rising Communist, mutated into a fascist, founding the
Parti Populaire Français (PPF). His trajectory, from far-left tribune
to Nazi collaborator, embodied a grim convergence: Jew-hatred as the
bridge between extremes. Under the German occupation during WWII, the
PPF enforced antisemitic policies and aped Nazi methods, showing how
French politics could serve as a transmission belt for imported
totalitarianism.

The literary canon itself was not spared. Louis-Ferdinand Céline, one
of France's most stylistically gifted novelists, published two
notorious pamphlets — Bagatelles pour un massacre (1937) and L'École
des cadavres (1938) — that dripped with genocidal antisemitic bile. He
never atoned. Even decades later, debates about republishing his
pamphlets acknowledged their openly antisemitic, fascistic core. What
mattered for the wider world was the export value: when hatred is
written with elegance, it travels farther.

III. The Communist Blind Spot: From Molotov-Ribbentrop to Defeatism
(1939–1941)

When Stalin signed his non-aggression pact with Hitler in August 1939,
the shock swept through Europe. The French Communist Party struggled
for a few days, but then aligned with Moscow.

The result was a propaganda campaign that promoted defeatism and
make-believe "peace" with Hitler, precisely when what France really
needed was immediate mobilization. Contemporary and subsequent analyses
record how communists disseminated the view that the war was
"imperialist," consequently undercutting national resolve at a decisive
hour.

Scholarly work details the tactical shifts and the impact inside
factories and unions during 1939–1940. The narrative is complex, but
the through-line is not: between 1939, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression
Pact, and June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa, when Germany invaded the
Soviet Union), the French Communist Party's stance mirrored Soviet
policies, not France's interests. This posture, however rationalized,
proved catastrophically out of step with the threat France actually
faced.

While the far right had given antisemitism a pulpit, part of the far
left gave Hitler a window — briefly but fatefully — through which to
divide and demoralize a democracy. Different motives, same effect:
France entered the storm of war after being weakened from within.

IV. Vichy: State Complicity and Deportations

After France's defeat at the hands of Germany in 1940 came
collaboration. France's Vichy regime did not merely submit to German
edicts; it embraced its own homegrown antisemitism. Vichy's machinery
operated with bureaucratic zeal: statutes defining who was a Jew, the
exclusion of Jews from professions, property seizures, internments, and
ultimately deportations to Auschwitz. The cultivated myth of a France
"shielding" Jews while Germany did the harm has long since been
demolished by the historical record. Vichy was a French government,
enacting French laws to persecute Jews on French soil, and in too
many instances, to deliver them to their deaths.

The shock is enduring because the betrayal was intimate. The nation of
the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen transformed its
own legal code into a weapon against a tiny minority that had fought
for France in WWI and WWII and believed in its promise. This was not
only an occupation story; it was a national story.

V. Post-War Realpolitik: Sheltering the Grand Mufti

Few episodes illustrate France's duplicity more vividly than its
post-war protection of Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.
Long before World War II, al-Husseini had incited murderous pogroms
against Jews in Palestine, most conspicuously in 1929 at Hebron and
Safed. Al-Husseini then lent ideological support to the Farhud pogrom
in Iraq in 1941, in which more than a hundred of Jews were murdered,
and hundreds more wounded. During WWII, Husseini was a willing
partner of Nazi Germany: broadcasting anti-Jewish and anti-British
propaganda from Berlin, lobbying Adolf Hitler and SS chief Heinrich
Himmler to prevent any transfer of Jews to Palestine, and even helping
to recruit Bosnian Muslims into the Waffen-SS.

At war's end, the case for accountability was clear. Al-Husseini's name
was raised for trial at Nuremberg; Yugoslavia filed an extradition
request for war crimes, and Britain initially pressed for his
prosecution.

The French government, however, which held him under house arrest
from May 1945 until May 1946, had other priorities. Apparently fearing
to alienate Arab opinion and desperate to preserve France's influence
in North Africa and the Middle East, French Foreign Ministry officials
concluded that leniency toward Husseini would be rewarded
diplomatically. Prosecuting him, they feared, would risk uprisings and
the loss of goodwill in Muslim lands.

Political considerations won out over justice. British resolve
softened; Yugoslavia eventually dropped its request. France used this
collapse of nerve as cover to avoid a trial. In May 1946, Husseini
conveniently "escaped" from France to Egypt. Most historians agree the
escape was tolerated — if not facilitated — by the French government,
eager to rid itself of a political embarrassment while currying favor
with Arab leaders.

This episode set a pattern that would haunt French policy for decades:
when forced to choose between upholding justice for Jewish victims or
cultivating Arab alliances, Paris chose the latter. In doing so, France
sheltered one of the most vicious antisemites of the twentieth century
— an active ally of Hitler, a recruiter for the SS, and an instigator
of pogroms — because his political utility outweighed the moral
imperative of accountability.

Then came a brief period of rational alliance and partnership between
France and Israel -- one that eventually led the two countries to
become nuclear powers. Unfortunately, this honeymoon did not last.

VI. De Gaulle and the "Arab Policy" (1967 and After)

Charles de Gaulle's reaction to the Six-Day War marked a dramatic
rupture in French policy toward Israel. Within days of Israel's
stunning military victory in June 1967, Paris moved from being one of
Israel's principal arms suppliers to imposing an arms embargo that
effectively cut military ties and signaled a strategic pivot toward
Arab capitals. This embargo, and the harsh language de Gaulle used to
describe Israel and the Jews — calling them at one point "a people sure
of themselves and domineering" — left an enduring scar on
French-Israeli relations and created the political space for a more
openly pro-Arab, realpolitik French diplomacy.

The logic behind the shift was straightforward: France was
recalibrating toward what it perceived as long-term national interests
— energy supplies in the form of Arab oil, commercial ties, and
influence in North Africa after decolonization — even at the price of
alienating a democratic ally. De Gaulle evidently believed that
maintaining good relations with the Arab world would serve France's
global role and help secure its independence from both the US and the
Soviet Union. The moral consequence, however, was a clear double
standard: universalist rhetoric at home; transactional back-stabbing
abroad.

VII. Giscard, Family Reunification and the Demographic Turn (1974–1981)

The post-1968 order in France included policies whose long-term social
and political impact has been underestimated by many commentators. One
such policy was the legal framework for family reunification for
immigrants, consolidated in the mid-1970s under President Valéry
Giscard d'Estaing and his prime ministers. By permitting long-term
immigrant workers to bring their families to France, successive
governments transformed a temporary labor policy into a more permanent
demographic shift — with important consequences for domestic politics
and the composition of the electorate that, in later decades, would
severely influence France's approach to the Middle East.

It is important to stress causality carefully: legislation on family
reunification did not deterministically produce any single foreign
policy choice. It did, all the same, help to create the electoral
constituencies whose concerns and votes French leaders would
increasingly weigh — and with whom political elites sometimes sought
conciliatory gestures on foreign policy as a matter of political
expediency. In short, immigration policy became a significant factor in
France's geopolitical calculations.

VIII. Khomeini's Safe Haven: France's Unwitting Launchpad (1978–1979)

When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini spent his final months in exile in
Neauphle-le-Château outside Paris, France inadvertently became a
broadcast platform for Iran's Islamic revolutionary movement. With
broad press freedoms and a ravenous international media corps gathered
around the cleric, Khomeini's sermons and statements were rapidly
transmitted back into Iran. What French authorities saw as a short-term
humanitarian and logistical solution turned into a strategic blunder:
the relative openness of France amplified Khomeini's message and helped
him to consolidate a revolutionary narrative that would soon sweep away
Iran's Shah and establish an anti-Western, jihadist, theocratic regime.

The decision to allow Khomeini into French territory was complicated.
He had been expelled from Najaf, Iraq and was seeking a place from
which he could freely communicate his messages to Iran. French
officials and local hosts were, according to contemporary reporting and
later histories, guided more by considerations of asylum and the
technicalities of visas than by any intent to aid an Islamic
revolution. Yet the strategic effect was that his stay in France gave
Khomeini a massive international megaphone. The French media — and the
protections of French civil rights — transformed a reclusive cleric
into a global icon.

IX. Mitterrand, Beirut and the Paradox of Protection (1982)

The 1982 Lebanon War demonstrated once again how France could position
itself rhetorically as a mediator while pursuing policies that many in
Israel and the US found opaque — even hostile. As Israeli forces closed
in on West Beirut and the PLO leadership faced annihilation, Paris —
under President François Mitterrand and through foreign policy channels
— advocated a multinational force to oversee the evacuation of the PLO
from Lebanon. France pressed for, and contributed troops to, the
multinational contingent that was supposed to supervise the PLO
withdrawal. France's diplomatic posture was presented as saving the PLO
from complete destruction. PLO leader Yasser Arafat himself publicly
expressed gratitude to France for its role in arranging and
guaranteeing the evacuation.

The same intervention, all the same, fed narratives of French
partiality. Critics argued that Paris's willingness to play shepherd to
Arafat reflected not a neutral humanitarian instinct but a consistent
policy tendency to court Arab opinion and preserve French influence in
the Levant. The multinational force succeeded in evacuating thousands
of PLO terrorists and the organization's leaders, but the region's
bloody aftermath revealed the limits of diplomatic theater when not
paired with decisive measures to protect civilians and confront
militias. France's role in Beirut in 1982 is therefore ambiguous: a
protector of evacuation on paper; in practice, a state whose broader
policy choices had repeatedly favored accommodating terrorists over
accountability.

X. The "Secret Deal": PFLP and French Intelligence

One of the darkest and most revealing episodes of late-20th-century
French diplomacy was the quiet coordination between elements of
France's intelligence services and Palestinian terrorist groups. In the
years after a wave of terror attacks on French soil in the 1970s and
1980s, former French intelligence officials later admitted that the
country's security services had entered informal understandings with
Palestinian terrorist factions — not out of sympathy for their cause,
but from a blunt, transactional desire to keep terror off French
streets. Yves Bonnet, who headed the Directorate of Territorial
Surveillance (DST) in the early 1980s, publicly described how the DST
cultivated channels to Palestinian terrorist organizations as a
"pragmatic" way to prevent attacks and preserve domestic order.

​​This was not high-minded diplomacy. It was a deal underwritten by
cynicism: toleration and limited engagement in exchange for the simple
promise that murderers would not strike France again.

​ The moral cost was enormous. By making stability the overriding
priority, French authorities tacitly normalized contact with
organizations that targeted Jews and Israelis. These back-channel
accommodations blurred the line between counterterrorism and collusion
— and served as an early modern example of a recurring French pattern:
When domestic tranquility and influence in the Arab world collide with
the safety and security of Jews, the balance is often struck in favor
of tranquility.

XI. Chirac's Arabist Reflex

Jacques Chirac's career embodied the ambivalence of France's
post-colonial diplomacy: a leader who publicly confronted France's past
crimes against the Jews (his 1995 speech acknowledging
responsibility for the Vichy deportations is historic), yet repeatedly
cultivated personal and political ties with authoritarian Arab leaders.
Chirac's long-standing, almost intimate ties with Iraq and with Saddam
Hussein in particular were well known in diplomatic circles; those ties
illustrate how French foreign policy often privileged personal
relationships and strategic commerce over moral clarity.

The texture of that reflex is visible in smaller, symbolic episodes, as
well. President Chirac, during a visit to Israel in October 1996,
erupted at what he called a "provocation" by Israeli plainclothes
security guards during a walk in the Old City of Jerusalem — an
incident that became emblematic of Paris's sensitivity to perceived
Israeli slights and a readiness to dramatize grievances that resonated
with the Arab and Muslim public. Whether the outburst was theatre or
genuine indignation, it fed a narrative: France would hold Israel to
scrutiny in a way that sometimes felt public and punitive, while
remaining discreet, conciliatory, or accommodating toward Arab regimes.

Chirac also played a backchannel role in moments of regional crisis.
During the fraught period following the failure of Camp David II and
the violence that surrounded the second Intifada in 2000, Paris's
posture favored diplomatic hedging and protection of Palestinian
leadership in ways that, critics argued, sometimes shielded figures
whose methods and rhetoric hardened the conflict rather than resolving
it. This posture — part humanitarian, part geopolitical calculation —
confirmed a French habit: act as mediator and moral broker while
maintaining policies that preserve Paris's influence in the Arab world,
as in its support for Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein.

XII. Al-Durrah: The Icon That Divided a Nation

Few images from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had the raw emotional
impact of the footage broadcast by France 2 on September 30, 2000:
a father crouched over his son, bullets flying — and the boy apparently
dying on camera. The scene of Muhammad al-Durrah became an emblem of
Palestinian suffering and a rallying image across the Muslim world. The
initial France 2 report, narrated by Charles Enderlin and filmed by
Talal Abu Rahma, was widely accepted as real and re-broadcast; it
shaped international opinion during the opening months of the Second
Intifada, a violent Palestinian uprising against Israelis.

This narrative, however, did not long survive forensic and legal
scrutiny. Subsequent inquiries, re-examination of the footage,
and several technical reconstructions raised serious doubts about
whether Israeli fire had caused the boy's death or whether he was even
shot. Some investigators argued that the image had been edited or
narrated in a way that produced a politically explosive impression not
fully supported by the raw material -- for instance, how come, if
Mohammad al-Durrah was shot, there was no blood at the scene? The
controversy led to libel suits, heated media debates in France, and a
long war of narratives: for many critics, the al-Durrah case became a
test of whether French media could be trusted to report dispassionately
on Palestine-Israel — or whether powerful images produced abroad would
be turned into instruments of political mobilization at home.

The scandal's political consequences were immediate. The image
accelerated anti-Israel sentiment in French public opinion, fed
protests and hardened the belligerent framing of the conflict in French
media and politics. Whether one believes the original France 2 account
in full or accepts the skeptical reconstructions, the al-Durrah affair
demonstrated how a single televised sequence can change the political
chemistry of a country and create a lasting credibility problem for its
media.

XIII. The French Anti-Zionist Intelligentsia

Beyond presidents and spy chiefs, France's intellectual and media class
has been a decisive engine shaping public attitudes. From certain
influential columnists to the editorial positions of major
publications, anti-Zionist framings have often bled into the discourse,
sometimes tipping into rhetorical excesses that risk conflating policy
critique with cultural or religious denigration.

Outlets and figures across the French media ecosystem — from leading
op-eds in Mediapart to controversies inside Le Monde and Libération
— have been accused by critics of asymmetrical coverage that places
Israel's worst actions at the center while "contextualizing" or
downplaying incitement, violence and terrorism from Palestinians and
other extremist actors.

Edwy Plenel himself, before founding Mediapart and after serving as
editor-in-chief of Le Monde, has a history that exemplifies this
problem. In 1972, while writing for Rouge, the weekly of the
Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist League, he reacted to the murder of
Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics not with condemnation but with
praise. He argued that "no revolutionary could disown Black September"
after they murdered the Israeli athletes, thereby effectively offering
what contemporaries described as "unconditional support" to the
terrorists.

While Plenel has since distanced himself from this youthful radicalism,
acknowledging that it was indefensible, the episode remains a solid
reminder of how parts of the French intelligentsia once crossed the
line from political critique to glorification of terror.

This environment creates two linked problems. First, it makes France's
public conversation unusually capricious: a large portion of France's
opinion-forming institutions interpret events through frames that often
emphasize French universalism and human rights language, yet apply
those frames unevenly when Jews and Israel are involved. Second, it
gives political actors license to pursue policies that mirror the elite
discourse — policies that, for reasons of domestic politics or
international positioning, can be strikingly less sympathetic to Israel
than to rival states. The result is predictable: when moral outrage is
selective, credibility erodes — and the Jewish community, and Israel,
frequently pay the price.

XIV. The Media Coverage That Misled a Nation

No survey of France's ambiguous stance toward Israel would be complete
without scrutinizing its media ecosystem. For decades, the front
pages of Le Monde, Libération, and Le Monde Diplomatique have
provided disproportionate framing that vilifies Israel while sanitizing
Palestinian violence. Headlines portraying Israeli counter-terrorism as
"aggression," while minimizing rocket fire or suicide bombings, have
shaped French public opinion, sometimes more decisively than
presidential speeches.

The effect of this editorial slant is cumulative: each cover, each
op-ed, each biased image is built into a narrative architecture in
which Israel stands as the perennial aggressor and Palestinians as the
archetypal victims. This distortion is not merely academic. It affects
political choices, emboldens intellectuals who conflate
anti-Zionism with moral virtue, and reinforces a climate where
politicians know they can score points by signaling distance from
Jerusalem. In the long run, media coverage has hardened the double
standard and provided cultural cover for diplomatic betrayals.

XV. Qatar, Inc.: Money, Influence, and Macron's Blind Eye

The 21st century has added a more transactional layer to France's Arab
policy: investment in the French economy. Few states have invested more
aggressively in French assets and businesses than Qatar. The oil-rich
emirate poured billions into Parisian real estate, media holdings,
luxury firms, and sports franchises. The purchase of Paris
Saint-Germain football team became a symbol of how deeply Qatari
capital has embedded itself into French public life. Alongside
investment came soft power: television channels, think tanks, and
influence campaigns aimed at projecting Doha's narratives into French
discourse.

Qatar's record is not benign. For years it has financed Hamas and
sheltered its leadership. That France tolerated -- even courted --
Qatar despite these links testifies to a familiar pattern: geopolitical
expediency trumping moral clarity. Macron himself has wavered on Qatar,
oscillating between mild criticisms and enthusiastic embrace. The
paradox is disingenuous: while Macron preaches republican secularism at
home, he welcomes investments from a monarchy accused of fueling
Islamist extremism abroad.

Some Qatari investors have pulled back from French markets of late,
signaling that Doha's support is conditional and that Macron's
balancing act offers uncertain returns. At the same time, Macron is
touting new economic partnerships, including a promise of 10 billion
euros of Qatari investments in France — a reminder that lofty
diplomatic postures are often cushioned by pragmatic financial deals.

XVI. La France Insoumise: The threat within.

In France, a radical left-wing political party has become a
destabilizing domestic force. La France Insoumise (LFI, "France
Unbowed"), led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has adopted methods of political
agitation that increasingly recall strategies once used by the Nazis:
street intimidation, permanent propaganda, and an obsessive use of
scapegoats. LFI has made antisemitism and hostility toward Israel
central to its discourse. Members of Parliament such as Thomas Portes,
Aymeric Caron and Rima Hassan have turned their anti-Zionist obsession
into a quasi-monopolistic political project, using Israel as a
lightning rod to mobilize resentment. The aim is clear: to capture as
many votes as possible within immigrant communities, where this
rhetoric finds fertile ground. For Macron, who is now unpopular with a
broad majority of the French population of native or integrated origin,
"throwing Israel under the bus" serves a dual purpose: attempting to
seduce a segment of this electorate while also appeasing an
ultra-violent street movement emboldened by LFI's constant incitement.

XVII. October 7, 2023 and After: Macron's Anti-Israel Tilt

The Hamas massacre of October 7, 2023 was a moral flashpoint. At first,
Macron's words were unequivocal: "France stands in solidarity with
Israel and the Israelis, committed to their security and their right to
defend themselves," he wrote on the day of the attack. Yet, within
months, the rhetoric shifted. As harrowing images from Gaza
saturated global media and pressure mounted from the European left and
Muslim communities inside France, Macron began to emphasize
"humanitarian" concerns and call publicly for ceasefires and restraint.
On July 25, 2025, he announced on X that "the urgent thing today is
that the war in Gaza stops and the civilian population is saved," and
declared his intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the
United Nations -- which he did on September 23, 2025.

This about-face reveals the weakness of Macron's calculation. He
presented "recognition" at the United Nations as a humane corrective —
a way to "restore political hope" and revive the two-state solution —
but the move was both poorly timed and politically naïve, if not
duplicitous.

Macron's post on X insisted on conditionality (Hamas must relinquish
control and the Palestinian Authority must reform), yet those
conditions remain unenforceable in practice. A state without concrete
guarantees risks rewarding the very actors — such as Hamas and its
patrons — who use terrorism as a policy. Macron's declaration looks
less like statesmanship and more like firing blanks: a symbolic attempt
at appeasement to placate vocal constituencies at home and reclaim the
moral high ground abroad by offering up a state that someone else -- a
sovereign nation, far away -- is supposed to implement, while offering
Israel and the United States nothing at all.

The international reaction was immediate and revealing. Israeli
hard-liners seized the moment to harden their posture. Finance Minister
Bezalel Smotrich publicly thanked Macron — ironically — for providing
"yet another reason" to press for Israeli sovereignty over parts of
Judea and Samaria, while other ministers openly mulled steps toward
annexation that until now had been largely rhetorical. Such responses
were predictable: unilateral recognition encourages maximalist
countermoves from the threatened party.

Washington also did not embrace Macron's gambit. U.S. officials
publicly warned that unilateral European recognition undermined
leverage in hostage negotiations and could empower extremist factions
inside Palestinian politics. US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee
noted, "If France is really so determined to see a Palestinian
state, I have a suggestion for them–carve out a piece of the French
Riviera." Macron's symbolic act effectively sabotaged the very US-led
channels that were most likely to secure the hostages and constrain
Hamas.

Domestically, Macron's maneuver landed poorly. Multiple polls
indicate that a large majority of the French public — roughly
three-quarters — opposed immediate, unconditional recognition of a
"Palestine" while Israeli hostages remained in Gaza or while Hamas
remained in power. The disconnect between Macron and his electorate is
striking. While he sought applause abroad, he was being widely
perceived at home as indulging in moral posturing that had little
chance of delivering peace and a lot of chance of making matters worse.

Macron's credibility was further undercut by other domestic crises that
exposed governance fatigue and strategic drift. His administration has
been battered by repeated street protests — over pension reforms,
austerity and other measures — and his government's authority has been
weakened by scandals and declining approval. These weaknesses mean that
Macron has fewer domestic political resources to absorb an
international backlash or to press for a foreign policy that might risk
his political future. The timing of his recognition of a non-existent
Palestinian state looked less like high moral purpose and more like the
miscalculated act of a beleaguered leader trying to reset a collapsing
career.

Macron's "recognition" declaration will probably do more harm than
good. It has angered Israel, failed to win over the United States,
alienated important swathes of his own electorate, and encouraged
Israeli hard-liners to entertain permanent annexation. The result is
the political opposite of what Macron thought he was promising. It is
not a revived diplomacy, but a harder, more dangerous stalemate — with
France's reputation as an honest broker badly in a ditch.

This disconnect — between a president desperate for approval abroad but
trying to woo a public increasingly skeptical of elite pretenses — is
the final irony. The nation of Alfred Dreyfus, Émile Zola, and the
Rights of Man, so often invoked as a beacon of a "universalism" that no
one appears to want any more, finds itself led by a government more
concerned with empty posturing than with genuine justice. Macron's
maneuver, like de Gaulle's embargo on Israel, like France's sheltering
Amin al-Husseini, will be remembered not as statesmanship but as yet
another entry in the ledger of France's double standard toward Jews,
virtue.

What next?

France's tangled relationship with Jews, Zionism and Israel stretches
from the Dreyfus Affair to today's diplomatic theater under Macron.
This history is a mosaic of high-minded ideals and ugly sell-outs and
compromises that put French interests ahead of moral clarity, as well
as a succession of leaders who sometimes courted Arab rulers and
"causes" for reasons of strategy, prestige or domestic politics.

What is new — and alarming — is how a contemporary French presidency,
ambitious abroad but weak at home, has chosen a symbolic, unilateral,
Wonderlandian path — recognizing the statehood of a fictitious
"Palestine" -- at a moment of extreme violence, hostage-taking, and
diplomatic fragility. Macron's move is being sold as a pragmatic tool
to reframe the region and "isolate Hamas," yet it has of necessity only
hardened Israel's stance, alienated large swathes of French public
opinion, and reopened old wounds that France's post-war politics had
never fully settled.

If France's century-long oscillation between principle and
self-interest teaches anything, it is that gestures divorced from
on-the-ground realities and credible enforcement rarely produce peace.
Recognizing a non-existent state — while hostages remain captive and
Hamas is still in power — rewards force over reconstruction and
rhetoric over results. The only durable path will require credible
security guarantees, an enforceable plan for disarming terror groups,
and a diplomatic strategy coordinated with Israel and the United States
— not a one-off diplomatic flourish that inflames passions at home and
abroad.

Finally, a sober France must confront its past honestly: the
anti-Jewish strains, the Nazi collaborators who facilitated the
deportation of Jews to their deaths, the postwar compromises that
protected war criminals, and the repeated flirtations with illiberal
movements abroad. Only by facing up to policies that are doing more
harm than good to France can it credibly advance "peace and prosperity"
either in the Middle East or at home.
