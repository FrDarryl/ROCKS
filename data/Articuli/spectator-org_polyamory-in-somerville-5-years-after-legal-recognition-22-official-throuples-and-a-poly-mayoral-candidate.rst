Recognition: 22 Official Throuples and a Poly Mayoral Candidate

Things are getting very weird.

In 2020, the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, the hipster community
just north of Boston, population 81,000, recognized “polyamorous”
relationships. It did so by extending domestic partnerships to include
relationships between three or more people. (RELATED: ‘Woke’
Polygamy is Coming Soon)

In a country in which polygamy is illegal, and in a state where — for
the time being, at least — only couples are recognized, the practical
impact is limited. City employees who belong to a “throuple” can get
benefits, and a “quad” can visit one of its members in a hospital
during restricted visiting hours.

This does not negate, of course, the formative consequences of
declaring that strange sexual arrangements deserve legal rights and
privileges akin to those of married couples.

Five years after the city ordinance was passed, the practical legal
benefits for officially registered throuples remain just as ephemeral,
but Somerville is emerging as the polyamory capital of America. One
“polycule” in the city, as chronicled by the London Times, has 80
people, meaning that 0.1 percent of the city’s population is sexually
involved in it. The city also plays host to Indecent, which has
been described as a “fetish- and kink-positive party,” as well as “smut
slam poetry readings.” The Harvard Crimson reported this month that
there are now 22 registered polyamorous domestic partnerships in
Somerville, encompassing 5 percent of domestic partner registrations
over the past five years. Somerville, wrote the London Times last
month, “is the most polyamory-friendly city in America, a haven for
people and their girlfriends, boyfriends, spouses, ‘them-friends,’
‘hunnies’ and ‘sweeties.’”

“Everyone on the City Council knows someone who is polyamorous. This
is Somerville.”

A Somerville city councilor, J.T. Scott, told the Harvard Crimson this
month: “Everyone on the City Council knows someone who is polyamorous.
This is Somerville.”

In Somerville’s ordinance that allows for throuple domestic
partnerships, persons are required to “reside together” and “consider
themselves to be a family” to qualify. But for polyamorous activists,
this was too restrictive on their expansive sexual relationships. So
when bordering Cambridge, Massachusetts, recognized polyamorous
domestic partnerships in 2021, the Polyamory Legal Advocacy Coalition
worked to eliminate the residential requirement, which the Harvard Law
Review described as “cost-prohibitive.”

This month, student reporters at the Harvard Crimson, Harvard’s student
newspaper, spoke to “10 polyamorous residents in Cambridge and
Somerville” to consider the effects of the domestic partnership
recognition.

One woman detailed how she met a man at a “non-monogamous speed dating”
event while also having a girlfriend. Another area man told the
students in “a series of online Zoom meetings” (during which his “hair
and beard [were] impeccably combed”) that he sees polyamory as an
alternative to marriage. Another woman said she displays a polyamorous
flag in front of her house and has engaged in all sorts of
arrangements. None of them had contracted a domestic partnership. In
fact, the through line seemed to be that they all engaged in a host of
sexual relationships that they cycled through and replaced every so
often.

One woman, Sarah K. Biddle, who goes by “they,” explained that she has
three separate relationships. She got “emotional” on the phone with the
Harvard student reporters when contemplating the idea of entering into
a domestic partnership. “I used to always think, oh, if I want to have
that, I have to choose someone,” she said.

This still all seems a marginal issue, except for the fact that one of
the two candidates for the Nov. 4 Somerville mayoral election, Willie
Burnley Jr., a current member of the city council, identifies as
polyamorous. Burnley and City Councilor Jake Wilson were the two
candidates to advance in September’s preliminary election, ousting
current Mayor Katjana Ballantyne.

Burnley, a socialist, has spoken quite openly about his sexual
proclivities.

Burnley told the London Times this month that he considers himself to
be a “relationship anarchist” and opposes any “hierarchy” in his sexual
relationships. Evidently, then, Somerville’s recognition of “throuples”
and “quads” as domestic partners must be too quaint for his own sexual
inclinations.

Burnley is perhaps unique among those involved in free-flowing sexual
relationships in that he believes monogamy is “very self-destructive.”
He explained that, after a heartbreak from a monogamous relationship,
he “realized my most important relationship is with myself.”

Burnley, who also identifies as queer, went on to explain that he does
not like denying himself anything sexual that he wants.

“And frankly,” he told the Times, “I’m a bit indulgent — I don’t like
the idea of denying myself something that I want and could potentially
have, just because society says no.”

In the course of this interview, Burnley waved to someone he said was
“another person in the community.” When asked if polyamory gets
complicated in the small city, he said, “Oh, certainly.”

Yet despite the fact that his own unrestrained sexual activities likely
keep Burnley away from utilizing Somerville’s recognition of
polyamorous domestic partnerships, he is enthusiastic about the
legitimacy it gives to his lifestyle.

“We’re actually moving forward as a society, and there’s a place that
actually sees us and respects us and wants to celebrate us enough that
they made room legally for our relationships,” he told the Harvard
Crimson.

As for his politics, Burnley supports the effort to get Somerville
to “divest” from Israel, is a proud police abolitionist, wants to
implement rent control, and has pledged not to clear homeless areas. He
has the support of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.

In the preliminary election, Wilson attained 42 percent of the
votes while Burnley received 34 percent.

The election next week is sure to be an interesting test of how
residents of Somerville feel about this citywide movement toward
polyamory.
