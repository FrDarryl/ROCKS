**Younger American priests more conservative, traditional, survey shows**

*October 14, 2025*

An extensive new survey of American Catholic priests has found major
differences between older and young priests, strong confidence in Pope
Leo, but less confidence in the American Catholic hierarchy.

A report from National Study of Catholic Priests, reflecting the
results of a survey of over 1,000 priests, was released on October 14.
The study—conducted by the Gallup Poll and commissioned by Catholic
University—found that younger priests were markedly more likely than
their older counterparts to describe themselves as theologically and
politically conservative, to favor broader access to the Traditional
Latin Mass, and to have reservations about the concept of synodality.

Specifically, the study found that:

* Among priests ordained before 1975, 70% described themselves as
“progressive.” Among those ordained since 2000, only 8% accept that
description. In the younger group, 70% describe themselves as
conservative/orthodox.

* Similarly, while 61% of the older priests say they are “somewhat”
or “very” liberal in their political beliefs, only 10% of the
younger priests do, and 51% of the younger cohort is “somewhat” or
“very” conservative.

* When asked to list pastoral priorities, younger priests emphasize
Eucharistic devotion. Older priests were more likely to cite
climate change, immigration, and social-justice issues in general.

* Among those ordained before 1980, 77% said listed “synodality” as a
priority, as against 29% of the younger priests.

* 86% of all priests expressed “a great deal” (43%) or “quite a lot”
(43%) of confidence in Pope Leo XIV, while only 1% reported “very
little” confidence.

* Only a bare majority (52%) of priests said they trust their own
bishop—down from 63% in 2001, before the explosion of the sex-abuse
crisis. The best predictor of whether a priest trusted his bishop
was that priest’s answer to a question about whether he felt the
bishop “cares about me.”

* Priests’ confidence in the US hierarchy as a whole was even lower,
with only 27% reporting a feeling of trust.

* Younger priests were more likely to report feeling lonely, and to
say that they were “expected to do many things that go beyond my
calling as a priest.”

* An overwhelming majority (79%) expected substantial improvement in
the relationship between the Catholic Church in the US and the
Vatican, with only 3% thinking that relationship would deteriorate.
