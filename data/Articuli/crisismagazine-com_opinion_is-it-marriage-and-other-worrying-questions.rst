**Is It Marriage…And Other Worrying Questions**

*The Church will face an increasing number of bizarre marital
arrangements that will seek to push long-standing ecclesial-determined
boundaries.*

“He’s gay. She’s straight. They’re happily married,” reads the title of
a recent Washington Post article, discussing a couple who has been
in a monogamous relationship for almost ten years. “A new crop of
couples are making content about their mixed-orientation marriages,
divorced from sexual attraction but not love,” the article stated.
Partners Samantha Wynn Greenstone and Jacob Hoff are not alone.
The WaPo also highlighted April Lexi Lee and Renee Wong as married
“aromantic” best friends. The former pair was said to be “happily
celibate for years,” the latter “solo poly,” which means having
multiple intimate relationships while living an independent lifestyle.

These people are impressively adept at crafting curated social media
content aimed at normalizing and celebrating their behavior. Indeed,
Greenstone, who with Hoff has turned their relationship into a
profitable career, says that some of their most supportive online
commenters are actually conservative. “If anything, I think we are
taking the sanctity of marriage to a whole new level,” she declares.

However, this representation is not entirely true: Greenstone is
pregnant with Hoff’s baby. “We birds’d and we bees’d,” explained
Greenstone, which provokes a few questions I don’t really want
answered. But one less scandalizing question worth asking is what
exactly we should call a committed relationship in which one party
claims to be gay but engages in heterosexual intercourse resulting in
the conception of a child—is that ever actually a marriage?

Given certain conditions, it seems at least possible that such a
scenario could be a marriage. Though we have no evidence to suggest
Greenstone and Hoff are baptized Catholics, if they were, they would
certainly be eligible to enter into a legitimate marriage with one
another, given the sacrament is reserved for one man and one woman.
That the male participating in such a relationship self-identifies as
gay would not itself be disqualifying, if he intended to consummate the
marriage with the woman via the conjugal act, which in this case it
would appear Hoff has done. (The answer to questions of whether or not
he intended to consummate the relationship when they entered into it,
or that he intended to abstain from gay sex are unknown.)

Granted, such a scenario seems bizarre and absurd, one contemplated to
amuse theology students or canon lawyers on a boring Friday evening
over cigars and bourbon. Yet the fact that Greenstone and Hoff are
calling their relationship a marriage should give us pause. And,
perhaps more broadly, these nontraditional scenarios may soon confront
Church leaders. Self-described “gay Catholic” author Eve Tushnet,
who disapproves of the Catechism referring to homosexuality as
disordered, has promoted what she calls celibate “vowed friendships”
and “paths of chaste, devoted same-sex love” in committed
relationships between gay persons.

This hints at the complex world the Church will confront in the years
to come. And it won’t just be people self-identifying as gay wanting to
live (or perhaps more accurately claiming to live) in some kind of
chaste committed relationship; it will include all manner of curious
arrangements that will seek to push long-standing ecclesial-determined
boundaries. About 5 percent of the American population is in a
consensual nonmonogamous relationship, and a startling 60 percent
of Americans are willing to contemplate entering into such a
relationship.

Imagine a scenario in which a “throuple” seeks an ecclesial blessing or
even a marriage because only one man and one woman in this party of
three intend to consummate the marriage. Perhaps the third person
stands smiling and content at the wedding as a maid of honor or
groomsman—and then goes off with the heterosexual couple on their
honeymoon. Of course, the “throuple” wouldn’t be married in the eyes of
the Church, but if the third party asserted he or she was not engaged
in sexual activity with the other two persons, on what grounds would a
priest prevent this social arrangement? Consider: Would a priest have
any moral ground to command a newly-married couple that they couldn’t
have a close friend live with them? And what if that arrangement simply
was or became permanent?

It’s all weird and shocking, I’ll admit. But I think it is a possible,
if not likely, challenge for the Church. The broader secular culture is
pushing all manner of unusual sexual, romantic, or cohabiting
arrangements, and those arrangements are being normalized by prominent
Catholic voices, including clerics such as Fr. James Martin and Fr.
Bryan Massingale. And anything that is permitted—such as blessings for
gay couples—suggests tacit ecclesial approval, as media
discussion of the late Pope Francis and now Leo XIV regularly remind
us.
The broader secular culture is pushing all manner of unusual
sexual, romantic, or cohabiting arrangements, and those arrangements
are being normalized by prominent Catholic voices…

This is all the more reason why the faithful must combat any messaging
that obscures or undermines what the Church has always taught about
human sexuality. Pace Tushnet and other “gay Catholics,” it is not just
homosexual acts that are disordered but homosexual desires as well.
Marriage is between a man and a woman who intend to consummate their
marriage and remain open to life, and priests must be wary of and
discourage arrangements in which a heterosexual and homosexual person
seek to wed in the Church, for to self-identify as irreversibly or
incontrovertibly gay is itself contrary to Catholic teaching on the
human person.

Through God’s grace, especially communicated via the sacraments, we can
not only overcome sinful acts but the very desires that tempt us to
commit them. To recontextualize such desires as in any sense good or
commendable, as if they are somehow indelibly part of our identity, is
to invite our own destruction and be complicit in the destruction of
others. “But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me
to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened
round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea” (Matthew
18:6).

There is no “sanctity” in committed relationships between homosexuals
and heterosexuals, or any other such relational arrangement. They are
not, as Greenstone claims, a means of sharing a “spiritual umbilical
cord.” They are, rather, confused means of self-indulgence, loosely
tethered, if not entirely untethered, from what God intended within the
context of marriage. They will inevitably bring harm upon those who
participate in them, including, worryingly, the new life Greenstone and
Hoff will soon welcome into this world. What, one wonders, will that
child’s parents tell him or her about sex, love, and marriage? We
should pray for that child, as well as all of those deceived into
thinking such relationships properly constitute a true definition of
love.
