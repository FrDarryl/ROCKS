**Latin Mass, Exorcism in St. Peter’s Basilica with Record Crowds**

October 27, 2025

“Ooh la, la!” In many ways the instinctive and sotto voce reaction of
the parish priest of St. Peter’s Basilica to the immense crowd he saw
on Saturday could be an apt representation of the response of many in
the Catholic Church today, when faced with the vibrancy of the
traditional movement.

Walking out into the crowds gathered at the Altar of the Chair in the
Vatican, the Italian Franciscan who serves as the Basilica’s parish
priest was met with the sight of around 3,000 people; over three times
more than had been anticipated. Whether this pleased or irritated him,
his amazement at the vibrancy of the crowd was visible.

After having processed in solemn pilgrimage from across the Tiber, the
vastly international crowd of Latin Mass devotees were at that point
reverently awaiting the much anticipated solemn Mass with Raymond
Cardinal Burke. Seminarians and clergy – predominantly young –
struggled to find spaces to accommodate their number, and space before
the altar vanished.

“It is the source of deepest joy for me to offer the Pontifical Mass at
the Altar of the Chair of Saint Peter as the culmination of
the Summorum Pontificum Pilgrimage of 2025,” the cardinal opened his
homily.

For those perhaps unfamiliar with the realities of daily life in and
around the Vatican, some context is necessary to truly appreciate what
took place at the site of St. Peter’s martyrdom this past weekend.

Saturday’s Mass marked a triumphant and very public return of the Mass
for the annual Ad Petri Sedem pilgrimage, after the authorities refused
permission for a Mass in the Vatican in both 2023 and 2024, following
Traditionis Custodes.

Run since 2012, the pilgrimage has drawn devotees of the traditional
Mass to Rome for a weekend of public prayer and witness to the beauty
of the Church’s ancient liturgy. Beginning with solemn Vespers on
Friday, the main highlight is the procession to the Vatican on Saturday
morning, followed normally by Mass inside the basilica.

The persecution which this liturgy has undergone following Pope
Francis’ 2021 restrictions is well known, and the sidelining of
Catholics nourished by the Latin Mass has been seen in Rome also.
Following Traditionis Custodes, no prelates were allowed to celebrate
Mass for the 2021 and 2022 pilgrimages, and in 2023 and 2024 the Mass
was then completely prohibited. Instead pilgrims had to content
themselves with Eucharistic Benediction and the office of Sext.

As the attacks on traditional priests also increased and the climate of
fear expanded, this too was reflected in the pilgrimage. Clergy
attended, but avoided the cameras and instead mingled with the crowds,
in order to avoid unwanted attention and subsequent retributions for
their public display of loyalty to the Mass which was deemed out of
step with the current ecclesial times.

During this period also, the manifold “crisis of confusion” in the
Church spiraled, and Cardinal Burke was thrust ever more into the
spotlight as the advocate of Catholic doctrine in the face of Vatican
heterodoxy.

In was in these years also that Cardinal Mauro Gambetti – archpriest of
the Vatican – ordered that all private Novus Ordo Masses be
concelebrated rather than said by solo priests, and forced the daily
private traditional Mass underground into the crypt. The basilica –
once alive with the constant early morning hum of Masses at every altar
– has long been turned more into a museum, with just delegated sections
and times for prayer.

Hence, the import of Cardinal Burke – one of the most prominent and
maligned prelates in the Church – celebrating a pontifical Mass in the
Vatican, in the rite that has been so persecuted in recent years, for a
record breaking crowd, cannot be underestimated.

Both the pilgrimage organizers and the Basilica staff appeared
impressed at the size of the crowd. There was quite literally no room
left in the area in front of the Altar of the Chair: every seat taken,
and every marble floor tile occupied. Those unable to fit in thronged
around the main high altar of the Basilica and down the central nave,
before then also beginning to fill up the side aisles.

Around 200 clergy and seminarians were present, joined by two more
cardinals and two superiors of traditional religious congregations.
Interest among the secular press was also high, and a video report on
the Mass was aired that evening during a primetime slot on Italian
national television.

The optics were undeniable: despite the beatings, the insults and the
persecutions, the traditional Mass and the Catholics it
ever-increasingly nourishes, are not to be waived aside.

Persecution leads to life; Tradition remains constant

Catholics have long known that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of
the Church. The annals of history document that every time a new
dictatorship has risen up against the Bride of Christ in an attempt to
purge Her members from the earth, those numbers flourish rather than
diminish. No idol of any form can satisfy the inner longing of the soul
for God and His kingdom, and hence such persecutions are always
destined to fail.

Alluding to this, and to the 100th anniversary of Pope Pius XI’s
institution of the feast of Christ the King, Cdl. Burke pointed to this
“importance of our worship of Christ under His title of King of Heaven
and Earth.”

“It is not the worship of an idea or an ideal,” he homilised.

It is communion with Christ the King, especially through the Most
Holy Eucharist, by which our own royal mission in Him is understood,
embraced, and lived. It is the reality in which we are called to
live, the reality of obedience to the Law of God written upon our
hearts and into the very nature of all things.

The Church thus calls upon Her members to “give witness to the truth
that Our Lord Jesus Christ is the King of all hearts by means of the
Mystery of the Cross and that His Virgin Mother is the mediatrix by
which He brings our hearts to dwell ever more completely in His Most
Sacred Heart.”

In these early months of Leo XIV’s papal reign, much has been said and
done about the traditional Mass, albeit not by him. Given certain
external prompts, many Vatican analysts have expressed hope that Leo
will not continue the same divisive path of his predecessor in so
brutally restricting the traditional Mass.

At the same time, certain U.S. bishops have continued to implement
high-profile and crushing blows to the ancient liturgy, prompting
concern and dismay from many Catholics.

So was Saturday’s Vatican liturgy a sign of the future under Leo?

Cdl. Burke has spoken to the Pope about the traditional Mass, and
though no details are known about their conversation, Burke’s homily
served as a tour de force regarding the benefits of the freedom
afforded to the Latin Mass by Pope Benedict XVI.

Making no mention of Traditionis Custodes – indeed certain
canonical questions have been raised about its legality – Burke
praised the traditional liturgies:

The Church is celebrating the 18th Anniversary of the promulgation
of the Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum by which Pope Benedict XVI
made possible the regular celebration of the Rite of the Mass
according to this form used since the time of Pope Saint Gregory the
Great. Privileged to participate in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass
today, we cannot help but think of the faithful who, throughout the
Christian centuries, have encountered Our Lord and deepened their
life in Him, through this venerable form of the Roman Rite. Many
were inspired to practice heroic sanctity, even unto martyrdom.
Those of us who are old enough to have grown up worshipping God
according to the Usus Antiquior cannot help but consider how it
inspired us to keep our gaze fixed upon Jesus, especially in
responding to our vocation in life.

Lastly, we cannot fail to thank God for the way in which this
venerable form of the Roman Rite has brought to the faith and
deepened in the life of faith so many who have discovered its
incomparable beauty, for the first time, thanks to the discipline
set forth in Summorum Pontificum.

We thank God that, through Summorum Pontificum, the whole Church is
coming to an ever-greater understanding and love of the great gift
of the Sacred Liturgy as it has been transmitted to us, in an
unbroken line, by Sacred Tradition, by the Apostles and their
successors.

Against the backdrop of the last four years, it is immensely
significant and moving to hear such words spoken inside the Vatican
itself, and by a cardinal who has endured much public vitriol for his
defence of the Church’s Tradition.

While Leo’s personal moves regarding the traditional Mass may have yet
to be formed and finalized, his authorization of Burke’s Mass this past
weekend should be seen as a “tell” of what might be in store.

The liturgy, said Burke, “is the most excellent expression of our life
in Him.” Should Leo truly wish to be true to his office as the Vicar of
Christ, then he would do well to listen to the advice of those who are
urging him to liberate the traditional Mass once again, and to allow
the Church to more freely nourish Her children.
