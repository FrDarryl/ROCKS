* In recent months, we have witnessed a well-timed campaign led by
the Palestinian Authority, civil society organizations and
anti-Israel Christian elements – some of them declared anti-Semitic

– to undermine the relations between the State of Israel and
Christian communities around the world, especially evangelical and
pro-Israel Christians whose long-standing support for Israel is not
self-evident.

* Four notable events this year indicate the tremendous power of this
campaign: The blood libel falsely alleging the burning of the
Church of St. George in Taybe; an episode of the Tucker Carlson
Show with an American nun who presented a series of anti-Semitic
claims without any factual, historical or theological basis; the
Declaration of the World Council of Churches in June 2025; a
Palestinian food advertisement mocking Christianity.

* The World Council of Churches over the years has tried to wear the
mask of a supposedly "neutral" organization. In light of the
campaign, it seems that in this statement, the WCC has dared to say
openly what it always wanted but previously did not dare to say.

* This group uses clear anti-Semitic messages, and... the expected
response from the Israeli government was therefore to declare a ban
on entry into Israel to any person who is a member of the WCC or to
any activist in the illegal EAPPI program, which the WCC has been
operating in Israel since 2002. But the government did not declare
such a ban.

* While the Christian population is persecuted under the Palestinian
Authority, outwardly it conveys a completely opposite image.

* This anti-Christian campaign in the PA areas did not reach the
wider world or the international media.

* The events listed above are not accidental. They are part of a
sweeping campaign run well by the Palestinian Authority, BDS
organizations and anti-Semitic elements in global religious
institutions, aimed at harming Israel's relations with the
Christian world, weakening the support of Christians for Israel,
and, through the churches, isolating Israel in the international
arena.

From Taybe to Tucker Carlson, Palestinians are trying to drive a wedge
between the Christian world and Israel, while Israel's government
appears to be asleep on guard duty.

In recent months, we have witnessed a well-timed campaign led by the
Palestinian Authority, civil society organizations and anti-Israel
Christian elements – some of them declared anti-Semitic – to undermine
the relations between the State of Israel and Christian communities
around the world, especially evangelical and pro-Israel Christians
whose long-standing support for Israel is not self-evident.

This campaign includes fake plots, media attacks, anti-Jewish and
anti-Israel messaging, and incitement under the guise of religious
discourse or human rights. Four notable events this year indicate the
tremendous power of this campaign:

* The blood libel falsely alleging the burning of the Church of
St. George in Taybe;

* an episode of the Tucker Carlson Show with an American nun who
presented a series of anti-Semitic claims without any factual,
historical or theological basis;

* the Declaration of the World Council of Churches in June 2025;

* a Palestinian food advertisement mocking Christianity.

The plot of a church fire in Taybe

In July 2025, media outlets around the world claimed that "Israeli
settlers set fire to an ancient Byzantine church" in the Christian
village of Taybe in the Binyamin area. Jerusalem's Greek Orthodox
Patriarch Theophilos III, Jerusalem Latin (Catholic) Patriarch Cardinal
Pierbattista Pizzaballa, and other senior officials in the churches
held a press conference condemning the alleged arson, which was
widely reported all over the world and in Christian communities in
particular.

Foreign ambassadors and various elements who joined the condemnation
added fuel to the fire, and the culmination was probably the words
written by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee:

"Taybeh is a quiet Palestinian Christian village south of Jerusalem
w/ a lot of American citizens that has been vandalized-including
fires set at ancient church. I visited there today. Desecrating a
church,mosque or synagogue is a crime against humanity & God."

Social networks and international media did not drop the issue for
weeks, but slowly the cracks began to emerge: an independent
investigation by the Press Service of Israel (TPS-IL) revealed that the
fire was actually in an adjacent field and did not even touch the
church, and featured videos in which Jewish shepherds run to put
out the fire with blowers and other firefighting equipment. The report
adds:

"Furthermore, separate fires on July 7, 8, and 11 were documented in
areas of pastureland dozens of meters away from the church compound.
In all cases, a Jewish farmer whose farm is next to the church
compound complained to the police that someone had torched the area
where his shepherd was grazing. TPS-IL has obtained time-stamped
documentation of these reports."

In the end, the Israel Police announced that the church was not
damaged at all, and following the findings and the investigation,
Huckabee retracted his remarks and even attacked the international
media's conduct in the affair.

Such a case requires the use of government spokespersons skilled in
"ecclesial diplomacy" that will appeal to church leaders, publish
documentation in English and Arabic translations, and brief Christian
writers. The resources exist, the personalities, the organizations, but
in this case Israeli government ministries were silenced, and the lack
of orderly action can be applied to Christian support bases in the
United States and other countries. The individuals who did act to
expose the truth were civil society organizations such as Regavim,
TPS-IL and independent Christian Israeli activists who worked behind
the scenes, as well as the Binyamin Council.

Tucker Carlson: How do American Christians support the Israeli
oppression of Christians?

On August 11, Tucker Carlson released an 80-minute-long episode on his
podcast, interviewing Mother Agapia Stephanopoulos, an American
Greek Orthodox nun. Stephanopoulos claimed that Israel was practicing
apartheid, persecuting Christians, and committing crimes against
humanity, with a clear message: Christians should stop supporting
Israel. The allegations in the interview also included theological
distortions such as "Biblical Palestine" and "Palestinian Jesus" --
long invalidated by historians and archeologists as well as countless
Christian churches and organizations.

This episode was watched by millions of people; the damage has been
done, especially among American evangelical Christians. Here, too,
instead of providing a fact-based rebuttal with the cooperation of
Christian Israelis and supporters of Israel around the world, the
Israeli government did nothing.

Declaration of the World Council of Churches

In June 2025, the World Council of Churches (WCC), representing about
349 churches from various streams around the world, issued a statement
at the closing of its conference in Johannesburg, South Africa. The
declaration, along with praise it gave the South African government "on
appealing to justice and responsibility through the International Court
of Justice", the World Council of Churches for Sanctions on Israel,
included recommending an arms embargo, to remove the "blockade" from
Gaza, announced its support for the "right of return", the "resistance"
of Christian Palestinian communities, and the investigation of Israel
by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for "crimes against
humanity" and falsely accused the State of Israel of apartheid.

The WCC over the years has tried to wear the mask of a supposedly
"neutral" organization. In light of the campaign, it seems that in this
statement, the WCC has dared to say openly what it always wanted but
previously did not dare to say.

The WCC uses clear anti-Semitic messages, and the Entry into Israel
(Article 2D) makes it clear that this is a valid reason for prohibiting
WCC members into Israel.

The expected response from the Israeli government was therefore to
declare a ban on entry into Israel to any person who is a member of the
WCC or to any activist in the illegal EAPPI program, which the WCC
has been operating in Israel since 2002. But the government did not
declare such a ban.

The only body that responded to the matter was the "Jerusalem
Initiative" (full disclosure: the writer is one of its founders), which
works to integrate Arabic-speaking Christians in Jerusalem into Israeli
society and consists of Christian and Jewish activists, clerics and
academics. The Jerusalem Initiative published a public letter in
English in response to the WCC's declaration. The letter exposed the
hypocrisy, ignorance and anti-Semitism behind it, and showed that it
should be considered in violation of various laws prohibiting the
boycotting of Israel in many of the countries that the WCC represents.

Zero Tolerance

From the Palestinian Authority, we can learn a lot about marketing
messages to the world. While the Christian population is persecuted
under the Palestinian Authority (such as here and here),
outwardly it conveys a completely opposite image. Unlike official
Israel with half a department (the Ministry of Religions that is
responsible for all religions), an anachronistic approach at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and another half department in the
Ministry of Interior, the Palestinian Authority invests considerable
resources in messaging for the Christian world under the "Higher
Presidential Committee for Church Affairs in Palestine," which
operates from Bethlehem and Ramallah.

In June 2025, Al-Qasrawi Food Products, a major snack manufacturer from
Hebron, posted the "Last Snack" campaign: a poster with the "Last
Supper" image in which the characters of Jesus and his disciples were
replaced by sheep and the table was covered with the company's
products. Following a broad protest (including the burning of the
company's products) by Christians living under the PA and by Israeli
Christians, the company deleted the content and issued an apology for
"unintentional harm."

This anti-Christian campaign in the PA areas did not reach the wider
world or the international media. But it is clear to all of us that if
the opposite were the case, the Palestinian Authority would know how to
use it well to its advantage. Israeli government ministries are
probably unaware of the matter or don't think out of the box.

Systemic failure to deal with the anti-Israel campaign in Christian
cloak

The events listed above are not accidental. They are part of a sweeping
campaign run well by the Palestinian Authority, BDS organizations and
anti-Semitic elements in global religious institutions, aimed at
harming Israel's relations with the Christian world, weakening the
support of Christians for Israel, and, through the churches, isolating
Israel in the international arena. The lack of an effective government
response by the Ministry of Diaspora and the fight against
anti-Semitism and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a large-scale
anti-Israel campaign harms Israel's strategic ties with Christian
communities around the world, especially among evangelicals.

Our failure is clear: lack of awareness, unwillingness, lack of tools
and speakers, zero use of church language (ecclesial diplomacy), and
ignoring the Christian partners themselves. The human resources exist –
in Israel and around the world – but they simply are not mobilized. The
ignorance and lack of acquaintance with the international and local
Christian world -- with the actors, the messages and the facts --
creates an explanatory and diplomatic vacuum in front of Christian
target audiences -- and this space is easily perceived and filled by
anti-Semitic and anti-Israel narratives.

One Israeli Christian remarked:

"Israel acts as if we do not exist. While others write her story,
she sometimes does not write anything, or, when she does, it is
hastily disparaged and swept aside by people who prefer their own
misinformation to such inconvenient facts."
