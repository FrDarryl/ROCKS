* Both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority are not, and never were,
interested in peace with Israel. The only peace they envision is
one that would see Israel eliminated and replaced with an Islamist
state, preferably, each with itself as the head.
* Trump is a man with good intentions, and his sincere efforts to end
the war should be commended by all those who want to see an end to
the death and destruction in the Gaza Strip. The US president,
however, needs to bear in mind that both the Palestinian Authority
and -- a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood organization -- were
established with the sole purpose of waging jihad (holy war) to
kill Jews and destroy Israel.
* Any proposal or deal that allows Hamas, the Palestinian Authority
(or Qatar, but that is for a later date) to hold on to its weapons
and maintain any form of presence in the Gaza Strip will only
facilitate their plans to pursue jihad against Israel.
* As long as the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and other
Qatari-promoted Palestinian terror groups exist, there will never
be peace or stability in the Middle East.

Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have never recognized Israel's
right to exist. That is why they have repeatedly rejected all attempts
by Muslim and Arab states to make peace with the Jewish state.

Any attempt to portray Hamas's purported acceptance of US President
Donald J. Trump's proposal to end the war in the Gaza Strip as a sign
that either the Palestinian Authority (PA) or the Iran-backed
Palestinian terror group is now interested in peace with Israel is
misleading and baseless.

Both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority are not, and never were,
interested in peace with Israel. The only peace they envision is one
that would see Israel eliminated and replaced with an Islamist state,
preferably, each with itself as the head.

Trump is a man with good intentions, and his sincere efforts to end the
war should be commended by all those who want to see an end to the
death and destruction in the Gaza Strip. The US president, however,
needs to bear in mind that both the Palestinian Authority and -- a
branch of the Muslim Brotherhood organization -- were established with
the sole purpose of waging jihad (holy war) to kill Jews and destroy
Israel. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have never recognized
Israel's right to exist. That is why they have repeatedly rejected all
attempts by Muslim and Arab states to make peace with the Jewish state.

In 1993, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat
was describing the Oslo Accord he had just signed between Israel and
the PLO to his own people -- in Arabic -- as basically no different
from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's Treaty of Hudaibiyya, in which
Muhammad agreed not to attack the tribe of Quraiysh for ten years, then
gathered together an army, came back in two years, and wiped the tribe
out.

Hamas, for its part, strongly opposed the Oslo Accords. The terror
group, in addition, rejected the PLO's alleged recognition of
Israel's right to exist, as expressed in a letter signed by Arafat
but never ratified by the PLO. According to Hamas, the Oslo Accords
"constitute treason to Islam and legitimization of the existence of the
Zionist entity."

It is worth noting that despite Arafat's letter of recognition, his
successor, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, has made it
clear that the Palestinians would never recognize Israel as a
Jewish state. "We will never recognize the Jewishness of the state of
Israel," Abbas declared in 2014.

In 2013, Hamas said that the Oslo Accords "have brought nothing but
disasters and shame to our people, our national cause, and the present
and future of our generations." In 2021, in a statement marking the
28th anniversary of the signing of the first Oslo Accord, Hamas called
on all Palestinian factions to form a broad national front to end the
agreement. "The Palestinian people have spoken by adhering to the
option of resistance [terrorism] as the path to liberating Palestine,"
the terror group asserted.

In 2022, on the occasion of the anniversary of the first Oslo Accord,
Hamas urged the PA to abrogate the agreement and revoke the PLO's
alleged recognition of Israel's right to exist. "We call on all
[Palestinian] factions, and on our people, to end the Oslo era and to
agree on a unified strategy based on the comprehensive resistance,"
Hamas stated.

Hamas's "positive" response to Trump's plan to end the war does not
include a pledge to recognize Israel's right to exist or end the
terrorist group's jihad to obliterate Israel. Hamas's response also
does not indicate any readiness to lay down its weapons or relinquish
control over the Gaza Strip.

Hamas, in fact, rejected Trump's [66]proposal to place the Gaza
Strip under a "temporary traditional governance of technocratic,
apolitical Palestinian committee made up of qualified Palestinians and
international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new
international transitional body."

Hamas's response clearly suggests that the terror group is opposed
to any international administration and still sees itself playing a
role in the management of the Gaza Strip in the day after the war:

"The other issues mentioned in President Trump's proposal regarding
the future of the Gaza Strip and the inherent rights of the
Palestinian people are linked to a comprehensive national position
and based on relevant international laws and resolutions. They are
to be discussed within a comprehensive Palestinian national
framework. Hamas will be part of it and will contribute to it with
full responsibility."

After delivering their reply to Trump's proposal, senior Hamas
officials announced that their group will not lay down its weapons.
"Hamas will hand over its weapons [only] to the future Palestinian
state," Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk told the Qatari-owned
Al-Jazeera TV network. "The weapons will be in the hands of those who
rule the Gaza Strip."

Hamas's partial acceptance of the Trump proposal, specifically to
launch negotiations for the release of the 48 Israeli hostages being
held in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, is nothing but a ploy
that aims to win time to allow the terror group to regroup, rearm and
prepare for more atrocities against Israel. Hamas does not see Trump's
proposal as a pathway for any kind of lasting peace in the Middle East.
Rather, it considers the US proposal an opportunity for another
temporary ceasefire, similar to previous ones reached with Israel — and
which the terror group repeatedly breached.

Two years after the war that Hamas began by invading Israel and
murdering 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and wounding thousands,
the terror group, which has lost thousands of its men and most of its
military capabilities, is understandably desperate for a lull in the
fighting and the possibility of gaining more ground during the pause
for negotiations.

Hamas remains fully committed to its 1988 charter, which quotes
Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna as saying: "Israel will
exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just
as it obliterated others before."

Notably, the charter also quotes the words of the Islamic Prophet
Mohammed:

"The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the
Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and
trees. The stones and trees will say 'O Muslims, O Abdullah, there
is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree would
not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."

In the eyes of both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, all proposals
and peace initiatives are unacceptable and a "waste of time":

"There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through
jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all
a waste of time and vain endeavors."
—Hamas charter, Article 13.

Any proposal or deal that allows Hamas, the Palestinian Authority (or
Qatar, but that is for a later date) to hold on to its weapons and
maintain any form of presence in the Gaza Strip will only facilitate
their plans to pursue jihad against Israel.

The group that carried out the worst atrocities against Jews since the
Holocaust and is responsible for the death of tens of thousands of
Palestinians has no right to exist, not as a political, military or
civilian force. As long as the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and other
Qatari-promoted Palestinian terror groups exist, there will never be
peace or stability in the Middle East.
