Gaza Strip will not end the dream of wiping Israel off the map.

As all eyes are fixed on the Hamas-Israel war in the Gaza Strip, the
Iranian regime and its Palestinian terror proxies are working to move
the fighting to the West Bank.

Recently, armed cells belonging to Iranian-backed Hamas and Palestinian
Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have escalated their terrorist attacks in the
West Bank against Israeli soldiers and civilians. The Palestinian
groups responsible for the death and destruction in the Gaza Strip over
the past two years are even trying to fire rockets from the West Bank
into the rest of Israel. The groups and their patrons in Tehran do not
care if Palestinians in the West Bank are killed and displaced as a
result of their terrorism. Iran's mullahs and their Palestinian proxies
have only one thing in mind: murdering Jews and eliminating Israel.

Last week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that they
discovered a rocket in the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem.
Earlier, another rocket was reportedly fired at Israel from the
village of Kufr Ni'meh, located near the West Bank city of Ramallah,
the de facto capital of the Palestinians. After the attack, IDF forces
found dozens of rockets and explosives in a building in the area of
Ramallah.

Israeli security sources described the seized weapons and the
firing of the rocket as a "game changer" in the West Bank. These
sources asserted that Iranian-linked elements were behind the
scheme to turn the West Bank into a further battlefield against Israel.

"Intelligence assessments indicate that armed groups in the West
Bank are seeking to manufacture rockets locally to target Israeli
cities in central and northern Israel, such as Kfar Saba, Ra'anana,
Netanya, Hadera, Afula, and Beit She'an... Iran has also reportedly
recently supplied mortar shells and ammunition to armed
[Palestinian] factions in West Bank cities of Jenin and Tulkarem."

These Palestinian armed groups, known as "The Battalions," are
affiliated with the armed wings of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad
and several years ago began operating in the West Bank. For the past
two years, dozens of their members have been killed or arrested by
Israeli security forces. Since the beginning of 2025 the IDF has been
waging a relentless war on the terrorist groups, especially in Jenin
and Tulkarem. Just when it seemed that the Israeli security forces had
succeeded in their mission, the armed groups resurfaced, this time
equipped with rockets designed to attack Israeli cities.

In the past week, PIJ's armed wing, Al-Quds Brigades, issued a
number of statements in which it claimed responsibility for terrorist
attacks against Israeli soldiers. The Jenin Battalion said:

"We detonated explosive devices targeting military reinforcements in
the town of Silat ad-Daher near Jenin."

The Ramallah Battalion, for its part, proclaimed:

"Our fighters succeeded at exactly 10.40 AM today in detonating
a number of explosive devices of the Sijjil-2 type at a military
point near the [Israeli] settlement of Psagot."

It was the first time that Palestinians had heard of the Ramallah
Battalion. Until recently, such groups had emerged only in the northern
West Bank, especially in the areas of Jenin and Tulkarem. Notably,
Ramallah serves as the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority (PA),
as well as of its security forces, which have so far failed to prevent
the Iranian-backed terrorists from operating in the city.

On September 25, Israeli security forces killed two senior
members of PIJ's armed wing in the northern West Bank: Mohammed
Qassem and Ala'a Jawdat. PIJ said in a statement after the
terrorists were eliminated:

"We affirm that we will remain steadfast on the path of jihad [holy
war] and resistance until liberation [of all of Palestine] and the
return [of all Palestinian refugees and their descendants to
Israel]."

Hamas also mourned the slain terrorists and vowed:

"The assassination of resistance fighters in the West Bank will only
increase our people's determination to escalate the confrontation
and resistance [against Israel]."

Iran's effort to copy the Gaza Strip's model of "resistance" against
Israel to the West Bank coincides with increased talk about the need
for a "two-state solution" and recognition of a Palestinian state by
Canada, the UK, Australia, France and other countries. These countries
have decided that the West Bank should be part of the proposed
Palestinian state, meanwhile totally ignoring Iran's ongoing efforts to
transform the Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps there into
another base for jihad to kill Jews and destroy Israel.

Those Western countries, in addition, have chosen to ignore that the PA
is unwilling to confront the terror groups in the West Bank. Under the
current circumstances, it is obvious that the West Bank would be used
as a launching pad to attack Israel, the same way the Gaza Strip was
used on October 7, 2023.

The expansion of Iran's terror proxies in the West Bank is undoubtedly
linked to the growing talk about the "two-state solution" and
recognition of a Palestinian state. In the eyes of the Iranian regime,
Hamas and PIJ, these moves could not have taken place were it not for
the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

Last month, senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told Qatar's
Al-Jazeera television network:

"Why are the countries recognizing a Palestinian state today? Before
October 7, did any country dare recognize a Palestinian state? The
fruits of October 7 are what caused the entire world to open its
eyes to the Palestinian issue – and they are moving toward it with
force."

Western countries that have chosen unilaterally to recognize a
Palestinian state have in fact emboldened the Iranian regime and its
Palestinian jihadist proxies.

The leaders of Iran, Hamas and PIJ view Western leaders such as
France's Emmanuel Macron, the UK's Keir Starmer, and Australia's
Anthony Albanese as "useful idiots" in their jihad to eradicate Israel.

Even if the war in the Gaza Strip ends, Qatar (here, here and
here), Iran (here, here and here), Hamas and PIJ will
never give up the fight to destroy Israel and replace it with a radical
Islamist state. The attempt to transform the West Bank into a second
base for jihad highlights that ending the war in the Gaza Strip will
not end the dream of wiping Israel off the map.

Calling Starmer (UK), Macron (France) and Merz (Germany) 'useful
idiots' is probably the kindest and most accurate description of them
ever.
Clueless and cowardly could be added to their descriptions, together
with arrogance, ignorance and abject stupidity!
Why do nations elect such ineffective non-entities to power?

It's always safer to know your enemy:
Iran, Qatar, Hamas, PLO/Abbas, Islamic Jihad, UN, EU, with special
thanks to President Pedro Sanchez, Ireland's "professor" Higgins
(president) & Simon Harris (PM), Britain's Labour Party, Norway,
Sweden, Belgium, hypocritical Holland, ignorant Luxembourg, Jew-hating
Slovenia, Socialists & Humanists & friends.

Useful idiots, where everybody is using everybody for their own
needs.... but all are united against Israel, the Jew among the nations.

"Humanity at it's best" & politics at its worst, leading us to the
abyss, because that's where UNited HATE against the Jews ALWAYS leads

Well said, Khaled Abu Toameh, "Even if the war in the Gaza Strip ends,
Qatar, Iran, Hamas and PIJ will never give up the fight to destroy
Israel and replace it with a radical Islamist state."

And yet today we learned of Donald Trump compelling Benjamin Netanyahu
to apologize to Qatar for Israel's attack on Hamas terrorists in Qatar.
What an obscenity! Qatar is a major sponsor of Islamic terrorist
groups, including Hamas, and we are supposed to swallow Trump's
pathetic nonsense that Qatar is a "great ally". The proposal for
Israeli peace with Hamas (that Qatar has been sponsoring) was even
discussed with Qatar in an effort to seek its approval! The Qatari emir
must be laughing over the absurdity to which Trump has lent himself.
Saudi Prince bin Salman knows it's a charade. Netanyahu knows all of
this, yet was compelled to play his part in a humiliating exercise. My
disgust knows no bounds and all sympathy goes to Netanyahu.

"... the Iranian regime and its Palestinian terror proxies are working
to move the fighting to the West Bank", yet Trump says he will stop
Israel annexing Judea and Samaria - in an effort to protect itself.
Some "great friend"! - while "Iran's mullahs and their Palestinian
proxies have only one thing in mind: murdering Jews and eliminating
Israel." I hope that U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, is
candidly voicing his views to Donald Trump over the latter's pandering
to Muslim countries. I truly wonder how Marco Rubio and Vice-President
JD Vance can stomach what they are seeing.

So much for this being "potentially one of the great days ever in
civilization". Sorry, Donald, but this is drivel, a delusion. The
Crusader Army in 1683 smashing the huge Ottoman army outside Vienna to
begin the process of driving the Islamic Ottomans out of eastern
Europe, was a great day for civilization.

Just as Jordan in 1948 ethnically cleansed the West Bank of all Jews,
destroyed synagogues and Jewish cemeteries, the time has come to
reclaim Judea and Samaria entirely for Israel, and ethnically cleanse
it of evermore Jew-hating Muslims.

This is an exceptionally informative article that informs us there will
not be lasting peace in Israel, just as there is no peace wherever
Islam's savages rampage, whether in Nigeria where over the last 125
days 7,000 Christians have been savagely murdered by jihadist or in
Mozambique where they've decapitated even ten-year-olds. Of this the
wondrously stupid leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Australia, etc.
say nothing.

Looking at the map of Israel, it is obvious that the West Bank is a far
graver threat to the existence of Israel compared to Gaza. The reality
is there will never be any peace between Muslim nations and Israel
because of Muslim ideology, as stated in the Koran and Sharia law, is
to kill Jews and destroy Israel because Jews are non-believers, as are
Christians etc. and the often-stated goal of Islam, as repeatedly
stated by all Muslim political religious leaders on a daily basis for
the past 1400 years since the founding of Islam, is to impose Islam on
the world. Just as it was suicidal for the world to have ignored what
Hitler said and wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, it is suicidal to ignore
what the followers of Islam believe in and plan to impose on the world
given any opportunity. Just as metastatic cancer cannot be stopped by
talk, neither can the goals of Islam.

May there be peace in Israel, despite all the obstacles in its path.
As we all know this not new, and this seems to be the Jewish fate: have
enemies that don't grasp the uniqueness of Monotheism, and the meaning
of a better world with peace at hand, in Jews own land.
I would argue that these are not "useful idiots" because they know
exactly the path they are taking because it is not only helping others,
but themselves. That is idolatry too, because they are pursuing false
aims and claims. The bigger idolatry is Islam itself- even with the
claim that they worship ONE! The truth is they worship death with the
notion of Jihad, not only local but global, and that is how those other
European leaders get ensnared in a web of deceptions to just help them
achieve their nefarious aims thinking that this is peace! THIS is not
surprising, and no matter what goals to end these conflicts are made, I
am afraid that none will work. Indeed, it is not easy to reject the
Qur'an to which they have pledged alliance. In this Holy Book it is
written: "Kill the Jew." If you find him behind a tree, or interpreted
further, in Tel, Aviv, Jerusalem, or the West Bank -even the world! The
"useful Idiots" are idolaters too !
Wishing all the readers a Good Year, too. It is wonderful to know that
there are people who can see behind the curtain !

Looks like ceramic tiles on the floor. Notice the high reflection. I'd

Idiocracy is alive and well in Europe as appeasement is supreme again
along with racial suicide. Survival does not change its ways so
suddenly in so few decades or centuries. Enlightenment does improve the
human condition, but it cannot change evils inherent in the cradle of
civilization.

Melania has been taking Trump to Fantasyland too often. The West Bank
needs to be formally annexed and federalized by Israel. Ask Trump how
his defense is doing in lawsuits against the U.S. by American Indian
tribes. What is the latest at the ICJ? More song and dance by law
schooled atavists? Abbas still needs to be indicted. Leftover border
barriers with Mexico should be shipped to Israel for their barrier with
Jordan.

Some perspective is needed. The Palestinians rejected offers to create
their own state in 1947, 1967, 2000 and 2008. The Arab League nations'
armies tried to destroy Israel in 1948, 1967 and
1973 wars. For decades, Palestinians killed thousands of Israelis,
including women and children in terror attacks. Gaza has not been
occupied since 2005. Arab countries like Egypt, Jordan, United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco already recognized the Jewish state and
signed peace treaties with tiny Israel. Palestinians should blame
nobody but themselves for the political deadlock.

What a surprise...NOT! Be honest: who truly did not see this coming,
the minute recognizing a "state" was mentioned? Who thought, for an
instant, ISLAM was going to relinquish it's 1400 yr old dream of
removing all Jews from the face of the Earth and claiming Israeli land
for itself? When your enemy consistently tells yo hs intentions, it
behooves you to heed him, and act accordingly! If YOU are unwilling to
act, at least have sense enough to stay out of the way of those who are
willing, and STOP siding, abetting and encouraging the enemy! Did you
learn NOTHING from the events that led into WW II? You CANNOT appease a
fanatic! That's just as true today as it was in the 1930s, only now
there over 1 billion of them; far more than there were the 1930s,
making efforts at appeasement even more ridiculous now, than then!
Today we have 1/2 dozen or so Chamberlains, instead of just 1,
convinced they can produce "peace in our time", by conceding land, not
theirs to give away, to an enemy who sees it as a victory, and is only
emboldened to grab for more! Who will concede your lands, when that
enemy comes for you? Because, unless forced to stop, you can take to
the bank that he will come for you too!

Those like Macron, Starmer, Carney, Albanese and their even more
obnoxious sidekicks like the senile moron known as Higgins in Ireland
and the venonmous Sanchez in Spain who obviously knows very little of
his country's own history (otherwise he might, if he had comprehension
skills, be horrified at the way he behaves like a certain Fascist named
Francisco Franco, who, for all his faults - actually had some redeeming
qualities Sanchez will never have - defying Hitler by giving refuge to
Jews escaping from Vichy France and allowing downed US and British
airman to be smuggled into and out of Spain), these aforementioned
extremely privileged (with the possible exception of Anthony Albanese)
spineless and sissified sorry excuses of manhood are NOT "Useful
Idiots" - THEY ARE JUST PLAIN USELESS IDIOTS who never worked a damn's
day in their pathetic lives, who bend with the wind, and who have made
the word Socialist (once honored, though some wags would tell you that
in the age of Hitler, the average European Socialist was like the
watchdog in the night, who, ostensibly was there to protect the
residence, i.e., country, simply allowed the thief, or in Hitler's
case, aggressor, to come in steal and murder to his delight while doing
nothing to stop him) a dirty word, akin to being that of a Fascist or a
Nazi.

And the obvious case in point is the vicious and virulent Islamist
Jew-hatred these spineless, stupid men with no values, no background,
no record of ever serving their countries, and who can and should be
labeled as Jew-haters (though Keir Starmer's JINO wife Vicky who lights
Shabbat candles and is said, get this, raising a Jew-hater's kids to be
Jewish - at least she's no Doug Emhoff who swoons at his wife's pork
roasts and turns a blind eye to his daughter wearing blouses covered
with Palestinian flags - might take exception (she's very lucky her
hubby hasn't allowed his Pakistani and Palestinian pals to 'groom' her
as he allowed them to "groom" , i.e., rape the poor, lower class young,
white British girls of Rotherham and Birmingham.

Victoria Starmer is typical of the average Western European Jew, whom,
80 years after the Holocaust, may have woken up to the fact that their
countries with their influx of Islamists, have allowed Jew-hatred to
flourish, but unlike Muslim kiddies who have been given carte blanche
to run amok,won't or can't fight back and stare like a frightened child
at the slithering rattler or cobra coming towards them ready to strike.
They think their "leaders" with their hollow voices - particularly
those British Commonwealth types Starmer, Carney and Albanese - will
put teeth into their hollow words of "we're against Hamas" and "we will
combat Jew hatred" when they NOT ONLY APPEASE HAMAS, THEY CULTIVATE AND
PUT THE ISLAMIST JEW-BAITER AND COUNTRY HATER ABOVE THEIR OWN PEOPLE,
LET ALONE THEIR JEWISH CITIZENS!

The scores of the raped and murdered in France, of priest being
beheaded and teachers knifed to death in their classrooms, those young
girls raped and driven to suicide in a Britain filled with NO-GO zones
where white Brits dare not venture into at night, the rising tide of
violence against Jews in once benevolent Australia - until Albanese and
Wong came along or even a Canada whose Jews gave so many to the arts
and charities of that nation, Leonard Cohen, Lorne Greene, Lloyd
Bochner, Monty Hall and William Shatner come to mind - the police now
look the other way or do nothing when Islamists not only threaten Jews
- but in one recent horrified incident - actually attacked a Jewish man
in front of his own children.

Yet their sissified, stupid hollow little boys insist they do not
reward terrorism and they fight Jew-hatred. THEY LIE THROUGH THEIR
ROTTEN TEETH.

For Starmer - Neville Chamberlain, for Macron - Pierre Laval, who ended
up before a firing squad, for Carney, a Mackenzie King who gloated that
he never allowed a single Jewish refugee into virginal Canada, for
Albanese, Benito Mussolini also a Socialist, for Higgins, a Eamon
DeValera who ventured to the NAZI German Embassy in Dublin on May 4,
1945 to pay his condolences at the death of his hero Hitler, and for
Sanchez, Francisco Franco, though that would be insulting Franco. ALL
SOCIALISTS, ALL FASCISTS, ALL ISLAMIST APPEASERS AND ALL JEW-HATERS,
ALL OF THE TIME!

Unless there is a sea change in those nations, like perhaps the rising
tide of anger and support for Reform UK in Britain, those once-proud
nations and their socialist (NAZI) trash sissy boys, will end up in the
dustbin of history, controlled by people, whom, if they had had any
pride in their history and culture, would never have allowed the jihadi
cockroach element to seize and dominate, just as they have those poor
girls in Rotherham.

The agitators in left-wing fascist NGOs spread their anti-Israel
propaganda worldwide about so-called increasing "settler violence." The
opposite is true. Violence originates exclusively from Muslims against
Jews who want to settle legally in their homeland, Israel. But these
actors constantly distort the facts. This, of course, fits the
narrative of the fools who believe that Western capitalism/imperialism
must be abolished to clear the way for a global communist paradise.
They ally themselves with the Islamofascists to defeat the "Great and
Lesser Satan," the symbol of capitalist exploitation. The fact that we
have so many "useful idiots" in our parliaments is due to the success
of decades of infiltration and propaganda by the enemies of freedom,
enlightenment, and democracy. The increasing decadence of the "elites"
in the West, due to intellectual inertia and saturation, creates the
gateway that allows tyrannical societies to take over these countries.
This is precisely what is happening right now in many Western
countries.

No surprise really about the European (and Canadian and Australian)
complete indifference to their own boost to the Jihadist war on Israel.
After all, they have also proven themselves to be utterly clueless
about their failure to augment NATO into a serious barrier to Putin's
expanding war against them. They would rather buy cheaper Russian
energy and fund the Putin reconquest of Europe than recognize that they
are paving their way to their own demise. And as to their immigration
policies, they are so self-destructive as to require no further
comment.

Great article, but I think you make a mistake with the term "useful
idiots." These country "leaders" are not idiots, unfortunately. If they
were, they could be rationally persuaded to recognize the truth.
However, they WANT to see the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state,
and now they have the opportunity to hide that under the guise of "two
state solution."

Very well said. Politicians are very smart people. They know what they
want and they know the best way how to get it. They may appear stupid
but they can't say the real reasons or they will look like very evil
people - which they are in many cases.
