**Canada’s Boldest Professor Defies the Gender Police**

Professor Jordan B. Peterson has made headlines all over Canada for the
past couple months. He is in a dogfight for freedom of speech against
what he calls the unreasonable demands of “radical left ideologues” at
the University of Toronto (U of T) where he teaches and across Canada
where gay activists exert an excessive and ultimately harmful influence
over elite institutions and the political class.

Peterson is uniquely qualified to take on the gender police at his
university and in the provincial legislature and national parliament.
At U of T, Peterson is a distinguished and widely published clinical
psychologist and a tenured professor of psychology who has been
teaching there since 1998. He has done extensive research in the
psychology of political ideology and the psychology of religion. Unlike
a great many professors in our highly secularized universities,
Peterson is very much aware of the devastating consequences that follow
from the eradication of religion. Indeed, his research and work as a
clinician has made him acutely aware of the destructive
ramifications caused by the abolition of religion, not only on society
at large but also at the individual and personal level. This is
something that is largely misunderstood and trivialized by the
so-called new atheists. Many of his insights are quite valuable in
understanding the multifaceted challenges we face. His longstanding
interest in politics has led to detail studies on how totalitarian
regimes and political ideologies destroy civilized life. Thus, one
should not be surprised to find Canada’s boldest professor in the thick
of controversy, a political firestorm that has raised his public
profile because so few have the courage to challenge the political
fashions of elite culture.

Canada has one of the most liberal stances on LGBTQ “rights” in the
world. In 1969, homosexual acts were finally decriminalized due to
legislation first introduced in 1967 by Pierre Trudeau, then justice
minister and attorney general (who would become the fifteenth prime
minister of Canada and father of the current prime minister, Justin
Trudeau). Pierre Trudeau infamously said at the time: “There’s no
place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.” On July 20, 2005,
same-sex “marriage” was legalized at the federal level. Efforts to add
gender identity and expression to the hate crime provisions of the
Criminal Code of Canada moved closer to reality on October 18, 2016
when Bill C-16 passed on second reading in Parliament. Bill C-16
would amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to
include gender identity and expression as prohibited grounds for
discrimination. Critics of Bill C-16 argue that the law can be used as
a weapon against unfashionable political speech.

Concerns over Bill C-16

The first thing to note is that the legislation was not passed by
conventional democratic means since sponsors of the bill did not
allow public hearings. The second point is that the bill has nothing to
do with discrimination and everything to do with the suppression of
political speech. In response to Bill C-16, Peterson has posted three
lectures explaining the various problems with this legislation (they
can be found here: 1, 2 and 3). In the first video, he
explains that he fears being brought in front of The Human Rights
Commission for the things he is saying and teaching, which could be
deemed as “hate speech” because of a carelessly and sloppily worded
bill. Hate is a notoriously difficult word to define. It is hopelessly
vague and could lead to the prosecution of innocent people. Peterson
notes that both provincial and federal legislation already cover gender
identity and gender expression (see Ontario Human Rights
Commission and the Canadian Department of Justice).

He emphasizes that there is an overrepresentation of “social justice
warrior” activists within the Ontario government including the premier
of Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, an outspoken lesbian and supporter of
the LGBTQ community, who may be part of “a sophisticated radical
leftist fringe” responsible for this hate crime legislation and the
expansion of gender identities increasingly mandated by law. We can see
her hand in recent Ontario legislation with Bill 28 expanding the
definition of parents beyond “mother” and “father.”

If we just take a look at, for example, how gender identity is defined,
we can discern a host of problems. “Gender identity is each person’s
internal and individual experience of gender. It is their sense of
being a woman, a man, both, neither, or anywhere along the gender
spectrum.” Peterson states in his video that such an elastic definition
of gender has not only been poorly written into legislation but also
poorly thought out, which should be a major cause for worry. What is
meant by “neither”? How can a human person be neither a man nor a
woman? Could this be a reference to otherkins—persons that are not
humans? Nonetheless, the denial of male or female is invalid in light
of binary biological sex. Where is the evidence for this? Is this a
denial of biological sex? Is this in reference to intersex individuals?
It is not clear at all. What is meant by both? It seems to be
demonstrably incoherent as currently expressed in legislation and vague
language makes for very poor law. Peterson states that the separation
of gender from one’s biological sex is a proposition and not a fact,
one that has next to zero scientific support. The main fear is that bad
legislation like this may hinder further scientific discussions on such
issues, if not outright prohibit them as “hate speech.”

More than a month has passed since Peterson’s videos on political
correctness. U of T has sent him two letters “urging” him to comply
with university policies that require faculty to address transgendered
students by the pronoun they prefer. Two demonstrations have transpired
at the U of T campus where “social justice warriors” assaulted a
journalist then lied about the assault. There were also
serious attempts to silence Peterson. Peterson had a panel debate
on a famous Canadian television show that tackles political
issues: The Agenda. A couple of weeks ago Peterson had a debate
with two other professors, on the subject of free speech and Bill C-16.
The debate resembled more of a witch trial than a legitimate
academic debate since Peterson was outnumbered and even the moderator
sided against him on several occasions. Unlike his opponents, Peterson
presented well-reasoned arguments to defend his position.

In an essay published in the London Catholic Herald, titled “My
fight for free speech in Trudeau’s Canada,” Peterson warns our American
friends that this is not only endemic to Canada:

Universities in the US are now even organising thought police, in
the form of “Bias Response Teams,” which will report on and conduct
“impact assessments” when a “bias incident” (which can be
“intentional or unintentional”) occurs.

This has gone too far. It must be stopped, before it can’t be.

The upshot is that Peterson refuses to utter gender-neutral
pronouns such as ‘thon,’ ‘hiz’ and ‘hizer’, ‘ne’ and ‘nir’, ‘ze’ and
‘zir’, and ‘xe’ and ‘xyr’ as substitutions to standard gender pronouns
such as his and hers, him and her, he and she, or even they to refer to
individual students: “I won’t mouth the words of ideologues, because
when you do that you become a puppet for their ideology,” comparing the
changes of the bill to “totalitarian and authoritarian political
states.” What is also troubling about legislating people to refer to
transgender individuals through gender-neutral pronouns is that there
are by some estimations at least 63 differing genders, this would
be an impossible feat. Perhaps one designation such as ‘they’ could be
a concession but 63? One potential way of simplifying this whole ordeal
is to only refer to someone by name, until you know someone’s name
perhaps it is best not to assign them a pronoun? But again, this goes
against standard societal conventions of how we interact daily with one
another, we have evolved certain mechanisms that allow us to recognize
when we are interacting with a male or female. At times, this
distinction may be vague but for the most part it is quite accurate.
Peterson explains, in an article for the Toronto Sun, the
unreasonableness behind the law demanding we use such pronouns:

It is simply not reasonable for a stranger—say, a student in one of
my classes—to request that I learn, speak and remember a whole set
of personal descriptors as a precondition for our interactions. It
is certainly not reasonable to demand that I do so—and it is
absolutely unreasonable for that demand to have been given the force
of law. You don’t get to exercise control over my speech.

The demand for use of preferred pronouns is not an issue of
equality, inclusion or respect for others. It’s a wolf in sheep’s
clothing. It’s a purposeful assault on the structure of language.
It’s a dangerous incursion into the domain of free speech. It’s
narcissistic self-centeredness. It’s part and parcel of the PC
madness that threatens to engulf our culture.

The problem is not solely endemic to Canada; indeed, that persecution
has already begun in the U.S. as well, for instance the case
of Tony Esolen at Providence College, for writing a couple of
essays on related issues for Crisis. Michael Rectenwald was asked to go
on leave for a misunderstood twitter experiment at NYU and Edward
Schlosser (writing under a pseudonym) exemplifies the fear mongering
prevalent at the universities with his article: “I’m a liberal
professor, and my liberal students terrify me.” These are just three
examples. An important lecture by Gad Saad at the University of Ottawa
explains the ever expanding reach of the politically correct thought
police across North American university campuses and how this
is limiting the free exchange of ideas. Already in New York City,
one can be fined for not referring to someone by their preferred
pronoun, which was instantiated by the New York City Human Rights
Law.

How Can One Respond?

All people of good will want to defend human rights and dignity. Those
arguing in favor of Bill C-16 have attempted to argue that this is
solely an issue of human rights and that recognizing all peoples’
gender identity and expression will guarantee a respect for their human
dignity. However, their demands go beyond questions of human dignity.
The bill will most definitely create more disunity than unity. It will
most likely have a more alienating effect on transgender people,
marginalizing them further than before. Moreover, it also plays into a
wrongheaded culture of not only political correctness but of
victimology and entitlement. Indeed, many students these days like to
play the victim card and have a great sense of entitlement. Moreover,
the use of a pronoun is not what truly demonstrates human dignity. It
is something demonstrated through love and authentic understanding,
something that cannot be legislated. The mere fact this is being
legislated is a form of coercion and control, which has no merit when
it comes to providing someone with basic human dignity. It simply
cannot be forced.

Nevertheless, on another level, it is extremely difficult to see how
totalitarian ideologues can seriously be understood as defenders of
human freedom and dignity. On what basis? The scientific-materialist
presuppositions that they base their worldview on do not guarantee
human worth and dignity. Reliance on one’s own autonomy is
self-defeating and ultimately dehumanizing since we are no greater than
matter in motion. It is ironic to see “social justice warriors” want to
defend human rights while simultaneously deprive others of their own
fundamental rights. On the other hand, the Judeo-Christian belief
system can provide a consistent and coherent basis for human rights and
dignity because God is the equalizer and guarantor for all people
(whether they believe in God or not) because he created all humanity in
his own image.

Unfortunately, often enough, the radical leftists lack philosophical
depth and erudition. This is why they are forcing their ideology
through fiat as opposed to well-reasoned and tempered argumentation.
This is also why debate and discourse are being stifled. Consequently,
violence has ensued and uncivilized methods used to silence their
critics. This is pure barbarism. We cannot allow this to happen,
especially at our institutions of higher learning. Yet, it is precisely
university administrators who have kowtowed to the demands of a radical
minority. They sacrifice freedom of speech in favor of the faux right
to never be offended.

Without acknowledging the existence of truth there can be no debate
that leads to genuine human flourishing. Our self-worth does not come
from a confused psychological identity crisis but is based on our
common dignity, an inalienable value that transcends all socio-cultural
impositions. Thus, we all need to act as champions of truth. We must
stand against such tyranny at all levels of society regardless of our
religious commitments. All who value freedom of speech as a means of
resolving disagreement and discovering truth must stand against tyranny
by supporting Peterson; you can go here to do so. Peterson in an
interview segment on The Rubin Report, eloquently explains through the
story of Pinocchio how we can all get involved and be authentic
witnesses to truth. Peterson represents a flickering light in an
increasingly dark time. If we unify we can turn that flicker into a
blazing bright flame for all.
