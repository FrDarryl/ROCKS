When Will Catholic Pastors Take Security Seriously?

For years, I have offered my help to improve security at Catholic
parishes; and for years, pastors have either politely declined or
simply ignored me.

When the news came out about the deadly shooting at a Catholic church
in Minneapolis, I felt more than just sadness and anger. I had a grim
sense of inevitability. For years, I have offered my help to improve
security at Catholic parishes; and for years, pastors have either
politely declined or simply ignored me.

Now, after another attack—this time at a Mormon church in Michigan, I
find myself wondering which Catholic parish will be next.

These tragedies are not isolated incidents. They show a troubling
trend: houses of worship across the country are increasingly targeted,
and Catholic churches are mostly unprepared.

The Warnings We Ignore

During my three decades in law enforcement, I responded to far too many
incidents at churches, synagogues, and other places of worship,
including at my own parish. I dealt with disturbed individuals who
intended to disrupt Mass or do worse.

As my department’s Homeland Security liaison, I received extensive
counterterrorism training and read threat bulletins sent to police
agencies. Federal and state agencies have warned for years about
extremist talk, mental-health-related threats, and organized hostility
toward religious institutions. Churches, especially Catholic ones, are
considered “soft targets.”

Yet, despite these warnings, Catholic leaders often look the other way.

One Saturday morning, my unit responded to a Protestant megachurch
where a mentally-disturbed woman drove her van through the front doors,
all the way to the “altar.” The building was empty at the time. If
services had been going on, casualties would have been unavoidable.

The very next day, I approached my pastor after Mass. I told him how
easily this could happen in our parish and urged him to install
bollards or decorative concrete planters to protect the congregation
while maintaining a welcoming appearance. He thanked me for the
suggestion, but nothing was ever done.

This scenario repeated itself in parish after parish, including at the
Catholic school my children attended. As part of my Homeland Security
duties, I offered free training and security assessments to schools,
synagogues, churches, and malls. Synagogues accepted eagerly.
Protestant pastors welcomed the help. Public school officials even
requested follow-up consultations.

Catholic pastors? They all declined. They appreciated police officers
attending Mass in uniform, but beyond that, nothing.

“We Want to Be a Welcoming Place”

When pressed, the response was almost always the same: “We want to be a
welcoming place.”

I explained that security doesn’t have to undermine hospitality.
Trained volunteers, discreet safety measures, and coordination with
local police can provide real safety without turning a church into a
fortress. Still, the answer was no.

After retiring and moving, I tried again with our new parish. I sent
two emails offering free consultation. Both were ignored. When I
finally spoke to the pastor in person, he told me he had forwarded my
messages to the parish security coordinator—a well-meaning elderly
volunteer with no law enforcement or security background. This man
assured me that everything was under control, even as I easily and
quickly identified multiple vulnerabilities that any hostile actor
could exploit.

This isn’t about bad will. I get it. Pastors are often overwhelmed and
burdened with administrative tasks they weren’t trained for. Security
may feel like “just one more thing.” But ignoring the problem doesn’t
make it go away; it simply leaves the congregation more exposed.

The Cost of Complacency

The Catholic Church knows martyrdom well. But there is a difference
between suffering for our Faith and exposing the faithful to dangers
that can be prevented. Shepherds are not meant to be naïve; they are
called to protect their sheep.

Consider some recent tragedies:
* In 2017, a gunman opened fire at a Baptist church in Sutherland
Springs, Texas, killing 26 people during Sunday worship.
* In 2018, a shooter attacked the Tree of Life synagogue in
Pittsburgh, killing 11 worshipers.
* In 2019, a gunman targeted the West Freeway Church of Christ in
Texas, but armed parishioners trained for such an attack stopped
him.
* In 2024 and 2025, both Catholic and Mormon congregations
experienced fatal shootings that might have been prevented with
basic security measures.

If Protestant and Jewish congregations can take decisive steps to
protect their people, why can’t Catholic parishes do the same?

The reality is that most parishes already have the resources they need.
Nearly every parish has current or retired law enforcement officers or
military veterans among its members. These parishioners would likely
volunteer happily for a parish security team. Most police departments
would gladly provide free assessments and work with parish leadership.

So why isn’t this happening?

Fear, Image, and Misplaced Priorities

Part of the problem is perception. Many pastors fear that visible
security will make the parish seem unwelcoming or send the wrong
message. Yet no one thinks twice about ushers standing at the back of
the church or volunteers directing traffic in the parking lot. Why
should security be different?

Others worry about liability or insurance, thinking that doing nothing
somehow protects them from responsibility. In reality, the opposite is
true: in an age of constant warnings and known threats, inaction is
itself negligent.

Still others assume it “won’t happen here.” This belief is perhaps the
most dangerous illusion of all. Every pastor thinks his parish is
different until the unimaginable happens at his own doorstep. Denial is
deadly.

A Catholic Framework for Security

This isn’t just a public policy issue. For Catholics, it’s a matter of
pastoral responsibility. Bishops and pastors are shepherds tasked with
protecting their sheep. That protection is both spiritual and, in
today’s world, physical.

Hospitality and vigilance are not opposites; they complement each
other. A parish that provides a safe environment is one that truly
welcomes families, children, and the vulnerable.

Non-Catholic places of worship demonstrate this balance. Synagogues,
Protestant churches, malls, and schools have learned how to combine
warmth with caution. Catholic parishes must do the same.

Practical First Steps

Security doesn’t have to be expensive or intimidating. Here are
measures any parish can take right away:
* Engage local police. Most departments will happily provide free
security assessments.
* Form a volunteer team. Retired officers, veterans, or
medically-trained parishioners can create a trained, discreet team.
* Secure entrances. Bollards, reinforced doors, and well-placed
planters can prevent vehicle attacks without making the church feel
like a bunker.
* Train ushers and greeters. A welcoming handshake can go hand in
hand with awareness. Simple training can help volunteers spot
warning signs before they escalate.
* Develop an emergency plan. Basic protocols—such as who calls 911,
who guides people to exits, and who communicates with first
responders—can save lives.

None of this requires “militarizing” the parish. It only requires
foresight and humility to accept help from those with experience.

A Call to Action

When will Catholic bishops and pastors take the safety of their
congregations seriously? How many more tragedies must happen before we
act?

We should not fear for our lives while worshiping God. Every
parishioner deserves to receive the Most Holy Eucharist without looking
over their shoulder in fear.

The faithful must begin asking their pastors tough questions. Parish
councils should make security a regular agenda item. Parents should
insist on safe schools and churches for their children. Parishioners
should offer their expertise instead of assuming “someone else will
handle it.”

Our shepherds must lead, but the flock must also make its voice heard.
The laity cannot stay silent while unnecessary dangers threaten the
Church’s most vulnerable members.

The next attack is not a matter of if but when. The only question is
whether we will be ready or if, once again, we will only offer thoughts
and prayers after lives have been lost.
