The NRSV has been updated (NRSVue) to make a number of changes. The most noteworthy has been to "gaywash" and eliminate clear reference to homosexual practice in the offender list in 1 Corinthians 6:9 (and 1 Tim 1:10 where the same Greek term appears).

Previously the NRSV translated as among the serial and unrepentant offenders (including self-professed believers) excluded from God's kingdom "male prostitutes" (the Greek word is malakoi) and "sodomites" (the Greek word is arsenokoitai). 

They have now changed "sodomites" to the nebulous "men who engage in illicit sex," which does not indicate to English readers the connection to homosexual practice provided by the Greek word, contrary to both morphology and context. A textual note added by the NRSVue committee claims that the term is unclear. It isn't.

The NRSVue now becomes the first major modern English committee translation of the Bible to eliminate any reference to homosexual practice in 1 Cor 6:9 (unless one counts the earlier RSV's "sexual perverts," picked up by the REB, as a paraphrase for both malakoi and arsenokoitai). 

[Note that my criticisms apply only to those scholars who had a hand in the translation of 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10; many other scholars, good scholars, were involved in the project of updating the NRSV, to whom my criticisms do not apply.]

The word literally means "men lying with (i.e., going to bed with, having sexual intercourse with) a male," in an active-initiating role. This translation is confirmed by the early rendering of the Greek word in the Old Latin and Latin Vulgate as masculorum concubitores ("men lying with males"). Similar renderings are given in the Syriac and Coptic versions. 

It is a specifically Jewish and Christian term formed from the Greek (Septuagint) translation of Hebrew Levitical prohibitions of man-male intercourse in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13. These Levitical texts prohibit absolutely (no exceptions) a man from lying (verb koimaomai) with a male (arsen) as though lying sexually (abstract noun koite) with a woman.* All future uses of the term arsenokoitai in Christian literature that have sufficient context to make a determination involve men lying with a male. 

The parallel Semitic expression mishkav zakur ("lying with a male") was used in the Jewish Talmud to forbid a man from having sexual intercourse with a male of any age (whether adult or minor). Both Josephus and Philo, two first century C.E. Jews, make clear from their discussion of homosexual practice that they understand the Levitical prohibitions as precluding any male same-sex relationships whatsoever. 

The term or its cognates does not appear in any non-Jewish, non-Christian text prior to the sixth century A.D. This way of talking about male homosexuality is a distinctly Jewish and Christian formulation. It was undoubtedly used as a way of distinguishing their absolute opposition to homosexual practice, rooted in the Torah of Moses, from more accepting views in the Greco-Roman milieu. 

The appearance of arsenokoitai in 1 Tim 1:10 makes the link to the Mosaic law explicit, since the list of vices of which arsenokoitai is a part are said to be derived from “the law” (1:9). While it is true that the meaning of a compound word does not necessarily add up to the sum of its parts, in this instance it clearly does.

Paul's own remarks in Romans 1:24-27 also make clear that any "male with male" sexual contact is expressly forbidden as "contrary to nature" and "shamelessness" or "indecency." It is cited by Paul as such in the context of Rom 1:18-32 in order to establish his claim that humans not only sin against God but also do so in deliberate suppression of the transparent truth about God and the way God made us. Same-sex intercourse entails a denial of the obvious fact that the appropriate sexual counterpart to a male is a female (per anatomy, physiology, and even psychology), not another male. Yes, deliberate suppression of the truth about the way God made us.

Both Church Fathers and Rabbis from the 2nd/3rd centuries C.E. on rejected even semi-official marriages between males and between females as acts that are contrary to nature even when conducted in the context of love and commitment. The idea that Scripture was limiting its indictment of homosexual practice to exploitative forms is historically untenable. The texts themselves, read in their literary and historical context, show this, as does the subsequent history of interpretation.

Need we mention that our Lord Jesus himself predicated a limitation of two persons to a sexual union on the divinely ordained sexual binary for marriage enunciated in Gen 1:27 ("male and female he made them") and Gen 2:24 ("Therefore, a man ... may become joined to his woman and [the two] become one flesh")?

There is absolutely no doubt, based on extant evidence, that the term arsenokoitai in 1 Cor 6:9 is correctly translated as "men lying with a male." If any updating of the NRSV were to be done on 1 Cor 6:9, it should have been done in the direction of translating arsenokoitai as "men lying with a male." The previous NRSV translation of "sodomites" was not the best translation because “Sodom” is not part of the stem of this Greek noun. 

Translating "sodomites" destroyed the deliberate echo to the Levitical prohibitions of man-male intercourse contained in the Greek word arsenokoitai and created in the English word a direct echo to the Sodom narrative that is not made in the Greek. While the Sodom narrative does indeed contain a severe indictment of homosexual practice, and is probably echoed by Paul in his indictment of homosexual practice in Rom 1:24-27 in its context, it is not being directly echoed in the morphology of arsenokoitai in 1 Cor 6:9. So, yes, there should have been a revision, but not in the direction of eliminating any reference to homosexual practice.

As for the Greek term malakoi, which literally means "soft men" and which NRSV continues to translate as "male prostitutes," this translation should have been changed to eliminate any restriction to prostitution and any inference that heterosexual relations might be in view. It is more accurately rendered as "males who feminize themselves to attract male sex partners" or even as "male-to-female transgenders."

Further exacerbating the error of the NRSV updaters is that the offender list in 1 Cor 6:9 already begins with a term that condemns sexual immorality generally: the word pornoi. The NRSV updaters correctly revised the old NRSV restrictive translation, "fornicators," to a more generic, "the sexually immoral." There is no need for another general description of sexual offenders in the list, which is what the NRSV updaters do with the translation "men who engage in illicit sex" for arsenokoitai. The sexual offender terms that follow pornoi in 1 Cor 6:9 provide more specific terms for different kinds of sexual immorality, "adulterers" (moikhoi) as well as the pairing of malakoi and arsenokoitai. What Paul intended as a more specific reference, the NRSV updaters have intentionally obscured by repetition of a general reference to illicit sex.

What the NRSVue translators have done is to conform the biblical witness to their own ideological biases, biases that militate against the overwhelming evidence from morphology and from the historical and literary context. The NRSV updating committee is really "without excuse" (to echo Rom 1:20). 

Even NT scholars thoroughly supportive of "gay marriage" -- the most careful ones, I might add -- have acknowledged that arsenokoitai refers to "men lying with a male" and intentionally echoes the Levitical prohibitions of man-male intercourse. 

William Loader, who has written more than anyone else in the modern era on sexual ethics in early Judaism and early Christianity, and who avidly promotes acceptance of committed homosexual relationships, acknowledges this (in agreement with my own work, I might add). In his magisterial *The New Testament on Sexuality* (Eerdmans, 2012; 500+ pages) Loader writes that the term arsenokoitai reflects

“the [absolute] prohibitions of Lev 18:22 and 20:13 on which it appears to be built.... [The malakoi] are most likely to be those who willingly engaged in the transgression, including male prostitutes, but also other consenting males.... On balance, then, Paul probably uses the two terms [malakoi and arsenokoitai in 1 Cor 6:9] with reference to men who engage in same-sex behavior, with the first referring to the willing passive partner, whether by private consent or as a male prostitute, ‘those who submit to sexual penetration by other men’, and the second referring to ‘those who engage in sexual penetration of other men’, which would have a broader reference and include, but not be limited to, exploitation, also by force [Loader adds in n. 175: 'So rightly Gagnon…'].​... I [also] see no need ... to narrow the [term arsenokoitai in 1 Tim 1:10] only to those engaging male prostitutes…. Given the context of the author’s list [in 1 Tim 1:10], namely, citation of the role of the law, it is also plausible to assume that the prohibitions of Lev 18:22 and 20:13 inform his usage of the word.” (330-34).

Likewise, NT scholar Bernadette Brooten, herself a lesbian, in her 500+-page work *Love between Women: Early Christian Responses to Female Homoeroticism* (University of Chicago Press, 1996) understood the malakoi to be "males performing the female role in homosexual relations" and the arsenokoitai to be "those who have sex with men."

As I said, the NRSV updaters who changed a specific term about men engaging in sex with males into a vague reference to "men who engage in illicit sex" are doubly "without excuse." They are acting like ideological hacks rather than true scholars who let the academic chips fall where they may. Since the NRSV has long been considered a flagship English translation, this is very bad news for scholarship and the integrity of the academy.

*For a more technical discussion of the morphology of arsenokoitai: The compound Greek word arsenokoitai (arsen-o-koi-tai; plural of singular arsenokoitēs) is formed from the Greek words for “lying” (verb keimai; stem kei- adjusted to koi- before the “t” or letter tau, and the alpha-contract verb koimao) and the Greek word for “male” (arsēn). The word is a neologism created from terms used in the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Levitical prohibitions of men “lying with a male” (18:22; 20:13). Note that the word for “lying” in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Levitical prohibitions is the noun koitē, also meaning “bed,” which is formed from the verb keimai. The masculine –tēs suffix of the sg. noun arsenokoitēs denotes continuing agency or occupation, roughly equivalent to English -er attached to a noun; hence, “(male) liers with a male.”

**Comments**

Ian Paul: It’s not the only basic error on this translation. Who is in the committee?

Robert A. J. Gagnon: I also disagree with the decision to replace "sin offering" with "purification offering." What other concerns do you have, Ian?

Ian Paul: Here is the list: https://friendshippress.org/nrsv-review-update/

Robert A. J. Gagnon: translating παιδίσκη as ‘woman’ rather than ‘servant girl’ “to give her more agency”.

Ian Paul
Robert A. J. Gagnon well I’m surprised. There’s some good people here—Brent A. Strawn, Mark Goodacre, Michael Bird, David DeSilva. All seems a bit odd to me.

David DeSilva
Whoa, now.... I just made recommendations on Hebrews and 4 Maccabees (and two things in 1 Peter that have always bothered me). I have no idea as of today what recommendations of mine have made it into the NRSVue. There is an uber-review committee that has made those calls....

Robert A. J. Gagnon
David, do you know who makes up the Uber-review committee?

David DeSilva
Robert A. J. Gagnon No, but Michael Holmes would know. He's the gentleman who recruited me. 🙂

Ian Paul
David DeSilva that’s helpful. But it would be a sad state of affairs if the overall review committee had made decisions the contributors would not agree with, making use of your good names to a different end…

David DeSilva
The electronic/Kindle edition of the NRSVue is available now for $9.99 in case anyone wants a closer look. I took the plunge to see how many of my recommendations made it into the final product. https://www.amazon.com/Revised-Standard-Version-Updated-Bible-ebook/dp/B09NNYLJFD

David DeSilva
Ian Paul Just coming back to this thread somehow, having had a close look at Hebrews and 4 Maccabees in the NRSVue. All of my recommended changes to 4 Maccabees were accepted (perhaps because no one really cares about 4 Maccabees and the editor responsible just hit "accept all changes in document and moved on to the important books 🙂 ); perhaps around 40-50% of my recommended changes to the body of Hebrews (I didn't look too closely at recommendations for the textual notes) were accepted. (This gives me the opportunity to continue to draw petulant attention to the errors in my annotations for the NOAB6. 🙂 )

Greg Teufel
not content with misinterpreting the word of God, they are now also mistranslating it on purpose. Great.

Steve Sorensen
“Well, if it gets people to read the Bible, it’s good,” so would say the defenders. But all that does is make the reader neither a hearer of the word nor a doer of the word.

Cathy Matheson
Thank you for posting this.
It looks to me like they are messing with the jots and tittles of God’s word.
God, protect Your words and the meaning You have always intended them to have.

Calvin Roach
Thank you again, Dr. Gagnon, for your fidelity to truth regarding the Word of Truth!

Allen Valentine Kemp
This is so sad. Always look at who is on the translation committees.

Chantay McClain
So sad and upsetting. Having a form of godliness, but denying its power.

Laurie Stutts
I don’t even like the current version of the niv where it use people instead of men. We know as they do that men was speaking to all!

Matthew Bates
Sad. The gods of our age are hungry and demand sacrifices.

Kim Parker
Thank you for your scholarly research and courage to share the truth.

Dave Knight
Thank you, Dr. Gagnon, for taking the time to post this explanation. 🙂

Tim Glaser
I am more surprised they didn't do a Jefferson and leave out verses they dislike.

Alyssa Huston
and now, people will choose this translation and say 'aha, see?!' 😕 😡

Tony Costa
Robert. Thanks for warning us about the NRSVue and its translational abuses. The Commiittee of the translation should be ashamed of themselves. No scholarly integrity.

Priscilla Turner
Amazing that modern people think it appropriate to undertake NT translation work while misunderstanding its nature, and perhaps even having insufficient Greek under their belts into the bargain ... 😔
Traduttore traditore indeed!

Heather Runser McLeod
As long as the NIV, NASB, and ESV are still ok to use. I've never been a fan of NRSV anyway. Also, I'm reminded of a particular verse in Revelation about changing things... I wish I could say that I'm suprised. My heart is just sick, though, about all the people who will be led astray.

Mel J. Cartera
They will answer to the Lord for toying with His Word 😡.

Michael Künnemann
Thanks for the clarity and for posting, Robert! 💝👍🏻

Wren Robinson
Offended? Just make it say what you want it to say - God have mercy! It is His Word or it is not - there is no shadow of turning.....

Mark Farnham
Thank you for your scholarship and clarity! You are a great gift to the church and the academy!

Ginger Haan
You are SO thorough. See right through the hypocrisy.

Robert E. Smith
I haven't looked at it yet, but did not have high hopes, given NRSV translates Gen 1:2: the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.

Diane Paul Ayers
Many of us have embraced the new Legacy Translation Bible (LSB) an update of the ‘95 NASB ~ by a team from The Master’s Seminary (John MacArthur).

Noel K Anderson
Robert, your work is thorough, crazily unpopular, and faithful to the most accurate exegesis of the text (i.e., unsullied by popular sentimentalism), which puts you squarely into the realm of the authentically prophetic.
Would you have anything to add regarding the translation of "Licentiousness" (aselgeia) from such verses as Mark 7:22? Is there a relation between something like "oversexedness" and Paul's prohibitions?

Colin Austin Barnes
Again, thankyou! Slightly off topic, why are so many translations so bad? In Hebrews 11 we are told that faith is not by sight, then in vs 23 we are told that Moses parents hid him because they SAW he was beautiful - how is this by faith, not by sight? Then in Acts 7:20 we are told that the child was "beautiful to God." That is what. by faith, his parents perceived. But the NIV leaves God out of this verse - why do that??

Jeff Foster
The NCC chose to politicize the Scriptures. Shocker.

Ray Dunsworth
Do people really read the NRSV? It seems to me that the people who might have this Bible in their pews are not the sort know for reading it at home.

Thank you for your analysis.

Larry Yerger
Robert A. J. Gagnon - well there goes my favourite translation...I think I'll keep my 1991 version, though...two things though - I see that you are using the "time stamp" of CE in your writing {which I presume means Christian Era} and was wondering if you also use BCE {Before Christian Era}? I'm still hung up on AD & BC - but times change...also, "adultery"...does the word - in either Hebrew or Greek - solely mean sexual infidelity? My studies {and I'll honestly admit my Hebrew ain't great [my son's, Joseph Yerger is 'much more better] but my Greek is - was anyway - pretty good right after seminary 25+/- years ago} can't seem to nail down the answer...today we can say (e.g.) "adulterated food" and be perfectly correct - and understood by most people - but would even THAT be a biblical-language-ly correct use of the word? There also seems to be - for me anyway - some nuances that imply 'adultery' to really mean "the breaking of a covenant" and, if this is indeed the case and is reflected in the ancient tongues, the word takes on a whole new importance and would insert itself directly into the "homosexual question" since SSA and SS activity {both male and female} are a basic breaking of the covenant of our mere existence in God's Creation, not to mention the 'be fruitful and multiply' clause (although at this time I do not want to get into the contraception debate which is another ball'o'wax}...if you have time - - - any thoughts? Happy New Year!!!!!!!

Tim Shawgo
Victoria you might want to read this. Just more and more of this every day happens.

William Harrison
As someone who bought one of the first RSVs when the translation first came out, this makes me very upset. My question is this:, will the original RSV translation still remain in publication? If so, how can we distinguish the two? Also, who is the publisher printing this maimed translation? That question is critical as Christians should avoid that publisher as much as possible. And it would be really good to know who did that translation of 1 Corinthians.

Chris Enoch
Dr. Gagnon, what is your preferred translation? I typically read the ESV.

JisDelivered Moore
Smh. Just crazy

John B. Tant
Thanks for posting. I rarely use NRSV, but I know folks who do.

Jason Storms
Excellent commentary Dr. Gagnon. Read your work on this many years ago and have been teaching the same ever since. Very convincing. Sad to see the blatant distortion of truth.

Thomas Kentwell
Dr Gagnon, I know almost nothing about Greek, but found your last sentence in this post to be particularly profound, in light of common commentary from gay activists that claim that in Biblical times the people knew nothing of sexual orientation. Your noting of “continuing agency or occupation” and “male liers with a male” implies to me a sense of characteristic or orientation rather than simply reference to a sexual act?

We better know our Greek before they take it all away

David McGlasson
It's one thing to lean left or lean right when the meaning of a Greek word is hard to translate into English. It's something else to directly contradict its known plain meaning in order to pervert the meaning of the English text. That's nothing but bowing the knee to the Woke crowd.

Brennon Hartshorn
This is a way bigger deal than what they did with the NIV a few years ago. Why aren't more conservative theologians making a stink about this?

Metzger is no longer with us. So, the NRSV is being transformed. This process will not end here. Joy Ryan
