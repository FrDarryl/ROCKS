**Giving the World a Christian Shape**

*There is no Christian culture if the Church commissioned to preach into it falls silent, or worse.*

As often happens with the most portentous and far-reaching events, the
learned and the clever will be the last to know. Something undeniably
huge and seismic took place in a tiny town in the Eastern Mediterranean
more than two millennia ago, and scarcely anyone took notice. “A star
shone forth in the heavens,” wrote St. Ignatius, bishop and martyr,
recalling the event near the end of the first century, “and its light
was unutterable. Its strangeness caused amazement, and all the rest of
the constellations with the sun and the moon formed themselves into a
chorus about the star. But the star itself outshone them all.”

It was the great secret, he said, “crying out to be told, but wrought
in God’s silence,” and so it escaped “the notice of the prince of this
world.” What was this secret? Only that salvation would come through a
Virgin giving birth to a Son who would die upon a Cross.

Thus it all began with the coming of a Child in the first century, then
ratified in the public life by the Emperor Constantine following his
conversion in the early fourth century. And now, of course, no honest
historian will dare deny that it was this that Providence intended to
be the decisive turning point in all human history. Nothing less than a
complete eruption of eternity into time, causing the very Logos of God
to assume the flesh and blood of the human being Jesus.

“The hint half guessed,” says T.S. Eliot,

the gift half understood, is Incarnation.
Here the impossible union
Of spheres of existence is actual,
Here the past and future
Are conquered, and reconciled…

It was, hands down, the single greatest game-changer in the history of
the universe. In a book written back in the late 1930s called The
Descent of the Dove: A Short History of the Holy Spirit in the Church,
Charles Williams, friend and fellow Inkling to C.S. Lewis and J.R.R.
Tolkien, provides a precise outline of the event and its profound and
far-reaching impact. Something truly momentous, he suggests, transpired
during the time between the missionary voyages of St. Paul—who,
instructed by the Holy Spirit, will leave Asia behind and thus enter
the soft underbelly of Europe—and the arrival of St. Augustine who,
fresh from his own conversion, enters the cities of Carthage and Hippo
to become their bishop.

“When St. Paul preached in Athens,” recounts Williams,

the world was thronged with crosses, rooted outside cities, bearing
all of them the bodies of slowly dying men. When Augustine preached
in Carthage, the world was also thronged with crosses, but now in
the very center of cities, lifted in processions and above altars,
decorated and bejeweled, and bearing all of them the image of the
Identity of dying Man…There was offered everywhere “the clean
sacrifice.” Men were no longer to die, for Man had died…

There will be no more duels to the death fought out in the Colosseum
among gladiators, gaudily staged to amuse the Roman mob; or the sight
of Christians being torn to shreds by ravenous beasts. Bloodlust had
long been the dark underside of pagan Rome. It broods over every
account of the city, like the face of the Emperor Caracalla, who once
received the leading citizens of Alexandria, summoning them to a
sumptuous banquet, only to have them all summarily butchered. Only
Romans would allow themselves to be so brutalized by habitual displays
of torture and sadism and still argue, as did Cicero, that such
spectacles inspired manly disdain for suffering.

Yes, something truly tremendous, horizon-shattering even, has taken
place. And the world will never be the same again. Pope St. John Paul
II, standing before the Colosseum 20 centuries following the birth of
Christ, spoke of it as a place “once consecrated to triumphs,
entertainments, and the impious worship of the pagan gods, but now
dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious
superstitions.”

The blood that had so freely flowed, soaked for so long into a pagan
soil, has since seeded an entirely new world. This was not the result
or the flowering of some juridic theory but the fruit of a myriad or
more acts of love, gestures of sacrifice, all anchored to a God whose
Name is Love and whose life is a Blessed Company—or Family—in the very
image and likeness of whom we have all been graced to grow. Christus
totam novitatem attulit, semetipsum afferns, announced the martyred
bishop of Lyons, Irenaeus, back in the second century. Christ brought
all things new by bringing Himself.

Here is the real heart and center of Christian Culture: that Christ,
who having entered fully and irrevocably into the human condition,
elevating our story to become His-story, has put all the idols to
flight. A humanism without Christ, a world shorn of every trace of the
sacred, was never intended as a scenario permanently written into the
script of history. It is God’s Word that is to be written—and on pages
that will never be effaced. He who wedded Himself to our world,
pitching the very tent of Heaven into our history, has come to urge us
to anneal ourselves at once, and the institutions we form, into the
very fire of divine love.

That said, what can only follow but a series of marching orders given
to a Church who sees herself as Christ’s Bride and Body, enjoined by no
less an authority than God Himself, to carry the Good News of Christ’s
Gospel to the very ends of the earth, baptizing everyone in the Name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit—knowing that God
will be with us, more present even than the Church is present to
herself, until the end of time, the final trumps, the consummation of
the world itself.

The only question, then, that matters is this: Is the Church to give
the world a Christian shape, or must she instead shape Christianity to
the world? Everything turns on the answer we give to that question.
Is the Church to give the world a Christian shape, or must she
instead shape Christianity to the world?

Is she truly an extension of Christ Himself, configured to God in such
a way as to lead the world back to Him? And if she is not, if her
ambitions have been so circumscribed as to fit the size of the
straightjacket the world has designed for her, then we are in a state
of despair and nothing good can ever come of our continuing to belong
to a Church that has given up on herself and on God. Then she is no
longer moved by love—not for God, or herself, or for the world God has
given her to help redeem. A whole world awaits us, therefore, whose
conquest will depend not only on our prayers but our politics as well.
