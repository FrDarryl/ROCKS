The Fabric of America… ‘Liberty and Justice for All’

America’s Pledge of Allegiance is a far weightier philosophical
proposition than is likely recognized by those who recite it routinely.

On an early fall morning, 133 years ago this month, thousands
of kids at schools throughout America rose together and looked up to a
crisp, new American flag in their classroom. They then began to
recite in unison 23 words authored by an American few today honor or
even remember.

I pledge allegiance to my Flag and to the Republic for which it
stands — one nation indivisible — with liberty and justice for all.

Yet, these few words constitute a far weightier statement about America
— and Americans — than is generally acknowledged.

Although the first version of America’s pledge was written in 1885
by Captain George Thatcher Balch, a Union Army officer in the Civil
War, it was another American who penned the version (with a few
additions later) we recite today.

How the government carries out its obligation to achieve liberty and
justice is often what creates problems in society.

It is said that Francis Bellamy wrote the Pledge of Allegiance we
know today in 1892 in only a few hours. But it was the result of
several years of effort at one of America’s bestselling magazines,
Youth’s Companion. In a marketing campaign, the Companion decided to
offer U.S. flags to readers who marketed subscriptions. Coincident
with the approaching 400th anniversary of Columbus’s landing in
America, the magazine decided to offer “Old Glory” to all public
schools across the U.S. and honor it with an oath.

Bellamy, a onetime Baptist minister, was at the time a writer for the
Companion. Historian Richard J. Ellis, in his work To the Flag: The
Unlikely History of the Pledge of Allegiance, notes that Bellamy’s
writings were typically loaded with marketing rhetoric and political
espousals. But to his credit, Bellamy argued that pledging allegiance
would ensure “that the distinctive principles of true Americanism will
not perish as long as free, public education endures.”

With the advent of World War II, many public schools instituted morning
recitations. And a slight modification was made during the “Cold War” —
President Eisenhower added “under God” in 1954 — essentially to
distinguish the U.S. from atheistic Communism.

As of this writing, although recitation of the pledge by students in
schools is no longer a federal mandate, almost all states
mandate public schools to at least schedule time for the pledge — only
Hawaii, Vermont, and Wyoming do not. Moreover, Congress begins each day
with the pledge, as does the U.S. naturalization ceremony, where
America’s new citizens take the oath. Not a bad history for a piece of
writing of only 23 words that began as a PR stunt.

What is so compelling about Bellamy’s words is their affirmation of
universal principles. They arrive late in the piece, but they pack a
powerful philosophical punch.

Two principles are given voice: liberty and justice, but it’s the
ending to the pledge — “liberty and justice for all” — that transforms
abstract concepts into concrete obligations which the state has a
responsibility to affect for all Americans.

When we recite the pledge we are exclaiming to the world this is who we
are as Americans and what we stand for: we are both promising to be
loyal to “the Republic for which it [the flag] stands” and our
government is charged with the responsibility to provide us “with
liberty and justice for all,” in whatever form that obligation might
take.

Through the pledge, liberty and justice become tangible
responsibilities which our government, bound by constitutional
restraint through the Bill of Rights, is charged to honor and respect.

Echoing British philosopher John Locke, the Declaration of
Independence asserts that all have inalienable rights (liberty in
particular), and that the government’s central purpose is to defend
those rights.

Classical liberalism, as articulated in the Declaration, holds that
a divine providence “endowed” humanity with rights that are inalienable
and therefore natural — not a function of human intervention. It holds
further that there is a natural law which operates as an ethical
principle from which natural rights are derived and through which
humans recognize their liberty — their freedom. The philosopher Isaiah
Berlin called them negative rights, as they are freedoms we have that
cannot be taken from us by anyone, including a government.

Yet, Berlin also spoke of positive rights, which are granted
(legislated) by the government. These are of human derivation and
operate to grant rights to Americans based on the government’s
obligation to achieve liberty and justice for all.

But for the government to affect freedom and justice for all Americans,
achieving liberty (freedom) cannot be divorced from equality — “equal
opportunity” for all. The greatest degree of equality possible must be
sought, consistent with the least disruption of individual freedom.
Otherwise, it is not “justice for all.” French philosopher Jean Jacque
Rousseau called this — the “common good.”

How the government carries out its obligation to achieve liberty and
justice is often what creates problems in society — liberty being
protected while endeavoring to achieve equality by creating positive
rights through legislation.

The issue is not whether positive rights (e.g., Affirmative Action,
Voting Rights, Hate Speech Laws, etc.) are “good or bad” — “right or
wrong.” Rather, the issue rests on determining how positive rights are
affected with as minimal a cost to individual freedom as possible,
consistent with the government’s responsibility to achieve equality —
“equal opportunity under the law.” Achieving a balance between these
two is what provides the basis for “liberty and justice for all.”

The controlling issue is the last few words of the pledge — “for all.”
Through that phrase, in effect, what the pledge refers to is a fair and
equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and privileges in
society. How one affects the latter for the benefit of all the people
determines whether justice for all is served. And that only occurs when
freedom through our natural rights is protected on a level commensurate
with the equality legislated through positive rights from the
government. The Bill of Rights in the Constitution is there,
specifically, to proscribe the federal government from doing otherwise.

America’s Pledge of Allegiance is a far weightier philosophical
proposition than is likely recognized by those who recite it routinely.
It addresses the very essence of who we are as a people, what we value,
and — above all — what we are unwilling to surrender and what many have
died to protect for all Americans: “liberty and justice for all.”
