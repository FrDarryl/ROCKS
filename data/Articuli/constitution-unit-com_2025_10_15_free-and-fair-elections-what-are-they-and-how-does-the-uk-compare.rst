This week, the Constitution Unit publishes a series of new and
updated briefings on key constitutional topics. In this post – covering
one of the series’ new topics – Alan Renwick and Lisa James describe
the principles and mechanisms that underpin free and fair elections,
and discuss the opportunities for strengthening these in the UK.

Background

The vast majority of countries hold elections. In democracies,
elections must be held at reasonable intervals, and must be the means
by which key decision-makers are chosen. The conduct of those elections
is also crucial: to count as democratic, elections must be ‘free and
fair’.

What makes elections free and fair?

There is no single agreed definition of ‘free and fair’ elections.
Various bodies offer descriptions, including the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe’s Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights and the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
Democracy-monitoring bodies such as Freedom House and
International IDEA also assess elections against various criteria.

As explored further in the sections below, free and fair elections
require that: suffrage and candidacy rights among adults are equal,
subject to only very limited, clearly justified limits; electors can
form their views freely; candidates can campaign freely (without
infringing other candidates’ or electors’ rights); and voting and
counting processes are free from corruption or fraud, with the outcome
determined by a fair count of the votes alone.

As also discussed below in the UK context, putting these principles
into practice requires various mechanisms to be in place. These include
legislation that enshrines the principles and is clear; independent,
impartial, and competent election administration; robust enforcement
mechanisms; a healthy information environment; and a strong, widely
supported democratic culture.

Elections in the UK take place at all levels of government. They use a
variety of electoral systems, including First Past the Post (for
Westminster elections, and local elections in England and Wales), and
various proportional representation systems (for the Scottish
Parliament, Welsh Senedd, Northern Ireland Assembly, and local
elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland). These systems all have
merits and drawbacks – but all are compatible with the basic
requirements of democracy.

Elections in the UK are widely seen as free and fair, including by
international observers. But experts and campaigners have also
identified various ways in which the system might be strengthened. The
government’s recent elections policy paper has pledged several
reforms.

Free and fair elections in principle

1. Equal suffrage and candidacy rights

* Equal suffrage requires universal adult voting rights, and that all
votes count the same.

* The UK has had universal adult suffrage since 1928, when the
voting age was equalised between men and women. An obvious
question is at what age people are considered adults. The 2024
Labour manifesto pledged to lower the UK voting age to 16 in time
for the next general election, bringing Westminster into line with
the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd in Wales; the pledge was
repeated in the elections policy paper and is expected to appear in
a forthcoming Elections Bill. The last change to the UK voting age
was in 1969, when it was lowered from 21 to 18.

* One area of controversy has been prisoner voting rights. The UK’s
ban on prisoner voting was found to be unlawful in 2005, and in
2018 the vote was extended to offenders released on temporary
license. In Scotland, prisoners serving 12 months or less may
vote in Scottish Parliament and local elections. Similar reforms
have been the subject of consultation in Wales.

* Though universal adult suffrage dates to 1928, equal suffrage
came only in 1950. Until then, graduates could vote in
university constituencies as well as local seats, and business
owners could vote in the constituencies of both their premises and
their home.

* Another key aspect of equal suffrage is the drawing of electoral
boundaries. Constituencies should have broadly equal numbers of
electors, and boundaries should be set independently, without
regard to effects on political parties. England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland each have an independent
boundary commission to redraw boundaries at regular intervals.

2. Ability of electors to form their views freely

* Electors’ ability to form their views freely depends on the
information environment, including in the media. The growth of
online media poses challenges for traditional election regulation:
while the impartiality of broadcast media is regulated, such rules
do not apply to online or print media.

* There is widespread public concern about the role of money in
politics, and the scope for wealthy individuals disproportionately
to influence debate. Political finance regulations currently set
local and national spending caps and require transparency
for larger donations. The elections policy paper pledges
further changes to restrict foreign money in politics, but
falls short of the donation cap recommended by bodies including the
Committee on Standards in Public Life.

3. Ability of candidates to campaign freely

* Candidates in the UK can generally campaign freely, without the
impediments seen in many non-democracies. However, there is growing
concern about violence toward or intimidation of candidates and
campaigners. The Electoral Commission’s 2024 candidate survey
found that 70% of respondents had experienced abuse or threatening
behaviour. Around 65% had been abused online, and 46% while
canvassing. This is a difficult but important problem to address.

* Voting and counting processes free from fraud, and an outcome
determined by votes alone

* There is little evidence of fraud in UK elections, and high
confidence that outcomes are determined by the votes cast. The
Johnson government cited concerns about potential fraud as a
key reason for introducing voter ID requirements in the Elections
Act 2022. However, most experts argued that the requirements
would disproportionately affect certain groups – risking damage to
the principle of equal suffrage in practice. The current government
plans to rebalance the rules by extending the list of forms of
ID that are accepted.

Mechanisms for guaranteeing free and fair elections

1. Legislation that enshrines the principles and is clear

* The UK’s electoral legislation has grown up over time, and is now
widely agreed to be confusingly complex. The Association of
Electoral Administrators (AEA) has highlighted the challenges
caused; the Law Commissions have recommended consolidation and
simplification. The absence of any plan to tackle this point in the
government’s elections policy paper has sparked concern.

2. Independent, impartial, and competent election administration

* Elections are administered at local authority level. Though they
generally run smoothly, the AEA has highlighted challenges
arising from growing complexity (e.g. rising numbers of postal
votes, and the challenges of distributing these in a timely way),
and inadequate funding.

* There is wide agreement that automated electoral registration (AER)
could simplify administration, improve the accuracy of the
register, and ease electors’ access to voting, though it also faces
practical hurdles. The UK, Welsh and Scottish governments
are all conducting or planning pilots.

3. Robust enforcement mechanisms

* Important concerns have been expressed about the independence
of the Electoral Commission. The Elections Act 2022 introduced the
power for the government to write a Strategy and Policy
Statement for the regulator; this was widely criticised at the time
as a threat to the body’s independence, including by the House
of Commons Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, the
Electoral Commission itself, and experts. The current
government’s elections policy paper indicates a plan to retain the
statement, despite a minister saying last year that the
existence of the statement was incompatible with the Commission’s
independence.

* The Electoral Commission and other groups have welcomed
changes proposed in the elections policy paper to close loopholes
in electoral finance law, including an increase in the maximum fine
that can be levied from £20,000 to £500,000.

4. A healthy information environment

* Concerns have been growing about mis/disinformation. Today’s media
business models often incentivise attention-grabbing material,
which may be sensationalist or divisive. Traditional media outlets
facing financial difficulties (particularly acute in the local
press) struggle to fund in-depth journalism. Mis/disinformation can
then flourish, while reliable information is harder to identify.
While an early version of the Online Safety Act required social
media companies to address democratic harms, the final text did
not.

* Political parties may respond to this environment either by issuing
sensationalist and divisive material themselves, or by avoiding any
messages that might provoke negative coverage (as with

* the widely criticised ‘conspiracy of silence’ over tax and
spending during the 2024 election campaign). Both approaches damage
the information environment for voters.

* The House of Lords Democracy and Digital Technologies Committee
recommended that a ‘democratic information hub’ should be
created, to provide a source of trustworthy information.

5. Strong, widely supported democratic culture

* Intimidation and misinformation point to weaknesses in the UK’s
wider democratic culture, along with polarisation and unwillingness
to ‘disagree well’. Survey evidence suggests that public trust in
politicians is low, and declining: in the 2024 Ipsos veracity
index, only 11% of respondents generally trusted politicians to
tell the truth.

* Building a healthier democratic culture is a complex task. One
element would be widely available, ongoing, impartial citizenship
education, which could help voters relate to politics more
effectively, and build skills of media literacy, genuine listening,
and critical thinking.

Upholding free and fair elections

UK elections are generally well-run, and meet international standards
for freedom and fairness. In any discussion of election reform, the
principles that underpin free and fair elections must be balanced
against one another – for example, weighing the ease of voting against
appropriate measures to prevent fraud. In states with declining levels
of democracy, these principles are sometimes invoked in favour of
changes that damage the integrity of elections (for example by
imposing unduly onerous voter registration processes).

The government has announced some significant changes to be brought
forward in an Elections Bill, not least the expansion of the franchise
to 16- and 17-year-olds, and stronger enforcement powers for the
Electoral Commission. But there remain various ways in which both the
rules surrounding elections in the UK, and the mechanisms for upholding
and enforcing those rules, could be strengthened. Some of these deserve
attention during passage of the upcoming bill – including restoring
independence to the Electoral Commission, and more rigorous regulation
of political finance. Rationalisation of the legal framework is
increasingly urgent, but would require a separate ‘consolidation’ bill;
while better administrative resourcing could be provided without
legislation.

Any work to improve the UK’s electoral processes should also be
considered in the context of the broader need to foster and maintain a
healthy democratic culture.
