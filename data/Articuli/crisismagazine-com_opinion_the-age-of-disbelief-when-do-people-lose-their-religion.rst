The Age of Disbelief: When Do People Lose Their Religion?

Knowing when people abandon their faith may help stop the loss.

There is a stereotype of people losing their faith while attending
a secular college. They may be ruined by the pleasures of the world,
bullied by atheistic professors, or simply lose their faith as they
grow in “wisdom” after being freed from their parents’ brainwashing. As
a state university graduate, I can confirm the atmosphere of
hostility to faith, but many people lose their faith well before they
are college age. While many people do lose their faith during this
period, research indicates that a significant number of Catholics
abandon their faith before adulthood, underscoring the importance of
early religious formation. The survey data shows dual threats to
Catholic faith, with different risks at different ages.

For many years, we have known that people often leave the Faith before
adulthood. In 2009, the Pew Research Center reported:

Almost half of Catholics who are now unaffiliated (48%) left
Catholicism before reaching age 18, as did one-third who are now
Protestant. Among both groups, an additional three-in-ten left the
Catholic Church as young adults between ages 18 and 23. Only
one-fifth who are now unaffiliated (21%) and one-third who are now
Protestant (34%) departed after turning age 24. Among those who left
the Catholic Church as minors, most say it was their own decision
rather than their parents’ decision.

Professor Christian Smith conducted a series of influential surveys
through the National Study of Youth and Religion.
Smith found that “most who commit to God did it before they were
age 14.” He concluded that “the religious commitments and orientations
of most people appear to be set early in life and [are] very likely to
follow a consistent trajectory from that early formation through the
adolescent and into emerging adult years.” To Smith, it was not that
the teenage years were irrelevant but “instead simply that what matters
for most even more is what happens religiously before the teenage
years, which powerfully conditions most of everything that happens
thereafter.” This is consistent with other research.

The Public Religion Research Institute released a report back in
2016 showing that most of those who lose their faith do so before
adulthood:

Most Americans who leave their childhood religious identity to
become unaffiliated generally do so before they reach their 18th
birthday. More than six in ten (62%) religiously unaffiliated
Americans who were raised in a religion say they abandoned their
childhood religion before they turned 18. About three in ten (28%)
say they were between the ages of 18 and 29. Only five percent say
they stopped identifying with their childhood religion between the
ages of 30 and 49, and just two percent say age 50 or older.

Most recently, Professor Ryan Burge, who runs a website
called Graphs About Religion, ran a survey of 2,400 “nones,” the
people who list their religion as none or nothing in surveys. As for
when people leave their religion, Burge finds that “there’s a
specific window of time: 15-25 years old. That’s when more than half of
non-religious folks head for the exits. The most popular age was 18.”

Of course, these various surveys generate different results because of
their different samples and methodologies. For example, you might see
it reported that: “The median age at which these former Catholics
said they made the decision to leave the faith was 13,” but this
is based on a survey “of former Catholics between the ages of 15
and 25.” Of course, a survey of younger people will have an early age
that they left the Faith, as with Christian Smith’s survey of young
people. Within a survey of Protestants, church attendance dropped
by half from their “early teens until age 19.”

The terminology can also vary. In one survey report, for example,
Pew distinguishes between a failure to transmit religion and switching
of religion. “Intergenerational transmission is the passing of
religious identity from parents to children. It occurs (or fails to
occur) in childhood.” On the other hand, Pew says:

Intergenerational transmission differs from switching because it
describes what happens before the age of 15 and is measured by
comparing the religious affiliation of mothers with the affiliations
reported by their teenage children. Switching, by contrast,
describes a change that happens after the age of 15; it is measured
by comparing the religions in which respondents say they were raised
with the affiliations they report today.

Nevertheless, Pew concludes that “Most people don’t change their
religious identity. But among those who do, the switch typically
happens between the ages of 15 and 29.” An older survey from a
different group showed only one third changed faiths before the age of
22, and “the median age at the time they changed faiths or
significantly altered their faith perspective was 22.” There may be
differences in the kind of change too. The Pew survey suggests
losing faith entirely happens at an earlier age while switching to
Protestantism comes later. (A later Pew report on Hispanic
Catholic-to-Protestant conversions also had an older age.) This makes
some sense, as college-age adults are more likely to have the physical
independence that makes switching churches easier.

The results above vary depending on their samples and methodologies,
but there are some consistent themes: while we lose people to
Protestantism in early adulthood, many Catholics lose their faith well
before adulthood. Parents should not assume they have 18 years to pass
on the Faith and cannot assume their middle schooler is solid in faith
because they have not yet been exposed to the hostile world.

Likewise, parishes cannot ignore kids after First Communion or
Confirmation. And when discussing the right age for Confirmation—which
I hope is driven more by doctrine than data—we should at least have
accurate information about when faith crises tend to occur. The
usefulness of this survey data is in helping us avoid the potential
blind spot of faith loss among middle schoolers and high schoolers. Our
children may find a different place to seek God in early adulthood, but
they are at risk of losing their belief in God altogether in
adolescence.
Catholics were “especially likely to drop” adherents “as they
transition from the teenage to the emerging adulthood years.”

To be clear, people do lose their faith and people do stop going to
Mass in college or when moving away from home as a young adult. This is
an issue, and one that Catholics should think deeply about.
Professor Smith noted that “some religious traditions gain or lose
more than others,” and that Catholics were “especially likely to drop”
adherents “as they transition from the teenage to the emerging
adulthood years.” This is a reason to encourage the young to attend
Catholic colleges and schools with strong campus ministries. But we
cannot focus on the college years in a way that ignores the epidemic of
earlier faith loss. The evidence above shows that the loss of faith can
happen earlier. Parents: you have been warned.
