The Old Cumberland Beggar and the Sweetness of Being Human

Wordsworth teaches us that the goodness of being is absolute.

I am persuaded that the movement to demand that physicians corrupt
themselves at the heart by assisting in the suicides of the
superannuated is but a reaction of terror before a perceived
inhumanity. We who have become the tools of our tools shudder at the
last insult to our human nature, that we should be invaded by all the
complicated paraphernalia of delay, to breathe our last in a dull white
room, with the pitted panels of the drop-ceiling overhead (reckon up
the chaos, O man, and count how many marks there are in one square),
while the calls to the nurses come and go, and a television blares out
the last few minutes of an inane comedy that was never once touched by
youth or mirth or the milk of human kindness.

If I, old and dying, mean nothing at all, then let me mean nothing on
my own terms. If I am to be swept out of consciousness, then let me ply
the broom! But this is no argument. It is a cry of despair.

Such despair is inevitable, if we accept the notion that our humanity
depends upon what we can do, rather than upon what we are. For the
knees will creak, and the hands tremble, and the mind wander; and,
whether for but a moment or for a year, we will be as helpless (though
not as beautiful) as a newborn child, that most useless of creatures,
who can do nothing but search for nourishment and love.

Then let us not try to fight unmeaning with unmeaning. Let us look
again at the special beauty of being human, a beauty that is especially
poignant in the child, the elderly, the unborn, and the dying.

One day the young poet William Wordsworth looked out upon the road and
saw a figure from his childhood, a certain old man who trudged along
the Cumberland roads, to beg from the villagers in their modest
cottages. He stopped at a ledge at the bottom of a steep hill, placed
there to help men remount their horses, and, taking his treasures from
his bag,

He sat, and ate his food in solitude:
And ever, scattered from his palsied hand,
That, still attempting to prevent the waste,
Was baffled still, the crumbs in little showers
Fell on the ground; and the small mountain birds,
Not venturing yet to peck their destined meal,
Approached within the length of half his staff.

Such is the drama of the old man’s day. Wordsworth grants himself a
gentle smile at the fellow, who doesn’t want to lose any of the bread
he eats, but loses a little bit anyway, and who is so harmless that the
small and timid birds manage to come within two feet of him, this
mysterious creature, this man.

to reclaiming the good, the beautiful, and the true.
