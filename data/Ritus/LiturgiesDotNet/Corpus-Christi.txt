It is desirable that a procession take place after the Mass in which
the Host to be carried in the procession is consecrated. However,
nothing prohibits a procession from taking place even after a public
and lengthy period of adoration following the Mass. If a procession
takes place after Mass, when the Communion of the faithful is over, the
monstrance in which the consecrated host has been placed is set on the
altar. When the Prayer after Communion has been said, the Concluding
Rites are omitted and the procession forms.
