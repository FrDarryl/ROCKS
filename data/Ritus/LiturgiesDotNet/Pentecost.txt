Vigil Mass- Extended Form

Vigil Mass - Simple Form

Mass During The Day


At the Vigil Mass

Extended form

This Vigil Mass may be celebrated on the Saturday evening, either
before or after First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Pentecost Sunday.

1. In churches where the Vigil Mass is celebrated in an extended form,
this may be done as follows.

2. a) If First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) celebrated in choir or in
common immediately precede Mass, the celebration may begin either from
the introductory verse and the hymn (Veni, cre&aacute;tor
Sp&iacute;ritus) or else from the singing of the Entrance Antiphon with
the procession and greeting of the Priest; in either case the
Penitential Act is omitted (cf. General Instruction of the Liturgy of
the Hours, nos. 94 and 96).

Then the Psalmody prescribed for Vespers follows, up to but not
including the Short Reading.

After the Psalmody, omitting the Penitential Act, and if appropriate,
the Kyrie, (Lord, have mercy), the Priest says the prayer Grant, we
pray, almighty God, that the splendor, as at the Vigil Mass.

3. b) If Mass is begun in the usual way, after the Kyrie (Lord, have
mercy), the Priest says the prayer Grant, we pray, almighty God, that
the splendor, as at the Vigil Mass. Then the Priest may address the
people in these or similar words
:
Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
we have now begun our Pentecost Vigil,
after the example of the Apostles and disciples,
who with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, persevered in prayer,
awaiting the Spirit promised by the Lord;
like them, let us, too, listen with quiet hearts to the Word of God.
Let us meditate on how many great deeds
God in times past did for his people
and let us pray that the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father sent as the first fruits for those who believe,
may bring to perfection his work in the world.
4. Then follow the readings proposed as options in the Lectionary. A
reader goes to the ambo and proclaims the reading. Afterwards a
psalmist or a cantor sings or says the Psalm with the people making the
response. Then all rise, the Priest says, Let us pray and, after all
have prayed for a while in silence, he says the prayer corresponding to
the reading. In place of the Responsorial Psalm a period of sacred
silence may be observed, in which case the pause after Let us pray is
omitted.

PREFACE          The Mystery of Pentecost
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus. Tu
enim, sacramentum paschale consummans, quibus, per Unigeniti tui
consortium, filios adoptionis esse tribuisti, hodie Spiritum Sanctum es
largitus; qui, principio nascentis Ecclesiae, et cunctis gentibus
scientiam indidit deitatis, et linguarum diversitatem in unius fidei
confessione sociavit. Quapropter, profusis paschalibus gaudiis, totus
in orbe terrarum mundus exsultat. Sed et supernae virtutes atque
angelicae potestates hymnum gloriae tuae concinunt, sine fine dicentes:
Sanctus.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For, bringing your Paschal Mystery to completion,
you bestowed the Holy Spirit today
on those you made your adopted children
by uniting them to your Only Begotten Son.
This same Spirit, as the Church came to birth,
opened to all peoples the knowledge of God
and brought together the many languages of the earth
in profession of the one faith.
Therefore, overcome with paschal joy,
every land, every people exults in your praise
and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts,
sing together the unending hymn of your glory,
as they acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
When the Roman Canon is used, the proper form of the Communicantes (In

If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink, alleluia.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Haec nobis, Domine, munera sumpta proficiant, ut illo iugiter Spiritu
ferveamus, quem Apostolis tuis ineffabiliter infudisti.
May these gifts we have consumed
benefit us, O Lord,
that we may always be aflame with the same Spirit,
whom you wondrously poured out on your Apostles.
Through Christ our Lord.

Come, Holy Spirit, come!
And from your celestial home
Shed a ray of light divine!

Come, Father of the poor!
Come, source of all our store!
Come, within our bosoms shine.

You, of comforters the best;
You, the soul�s most welcome guest;
Sweet refreshment here below;

In our labor, rest most sweet;
Grateful coolness in the heat;
Solace in the midst of woe.

O most blessed Light divine,
May that light within us shine
And our inmost being fill!

Where you are not, we have naught,
Nothing good in deed or thought,
Nothing free from taint and ill.

Heal our wounds, our strength renew;
On our dryness pour your dew;
Wash the stains of guilt away:

Bend the stubborn heart and will;
Melt the frozen, warm the chill;
Guide the steps that go astray.

On the faithful, who adore
And confess you, evermore
In your sevenfold gift descend;

Give them virtue�s sure reward;
Give them your salvation, Lord;
Give them joys that never end.

Amen. Alleluia.

O lux beatissima,
reple cordis intima
tuorum fidelium.

Sine tuo numine,
nihil est in homine,
nihil est innoxium.

Lava quod est sordidum,
riga quod est aridum,
sana quod est saucium.

Flecte quod est rigidum,
fove quod est frigidum,
rege quod est devium.

Da tuis fidelibus,
in te confidentibus,
sacrum septenarium.

Da virtutis meritum,
da salutis exitum,
da perenne gaudium,

Amen, Alleluia.

is desirable to keep the paschal candle in the baptistery with due
honor so that it is lit at the celebration of Baptism and the candles
of those baptized are lit from it. Where the Monday or Tuesday after
Pentecost are days on which the faithful are obliged or accustomed to
attend Mass, the Mass of Pentecost Sunday may be repeated, or a Mass of
the Holy Spirit may be said.
