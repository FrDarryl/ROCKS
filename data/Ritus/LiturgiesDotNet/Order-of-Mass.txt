THE ORDER OF MASS
The Introductory Rites
1. When the people are gathered, the Priest approaches the altar with
the ministers while the Entrance Chant is sung.
When he has arrived at the altar, after making a profound bow with the
ministers, the Priest venerates the altar with a kiss and, if
appropriate, incenses the cross and the altar. Then, with the
ministers, he goes to the chair.
When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest and the faithful,
standing, sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest,
facing the people, says:
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
The people reply:
Amen.
2. Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people, saying:
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Spirit
be with you all.
Or:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Or:
The Lord be with you.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.

In this first greeting a Bishop, instead of The Lord be with you, says:
Peace be with you.

3. The Priest, or a Deacon, or another minister, may very briefly
introduce the faithful to the Mass of the day.
Penitential Act*
* From time to time on Sundays, especially in Easter time, instead of
the customary Penitential Act, the blessing and sprinkling of water may
take place (as in Appendix II, pp. 000-000) as a reminder of Baptism.
4. Then follows the Penitential Act, to which the Priest invites the
faithful, saying:
Brethren (brothers and sisters), let us acknowledge our sins,
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.
A brief pause for silence follows. Then all recite together the formula
of general confession:
I confess to almighty God
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have greatly sinned,
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,
And, striking their breast, they say:
through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault;
Then they continue:
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,
all the Angels and Saints,
and you, my brothers and sisters,
to pray for me to the Lord our God.
The absolution of the Priest follows:
May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins,
and bring us to everlasting life.
The people reply:
Amen.

Or:

Brethren (brothers and sisters), let us acknowledge our sins,
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.
A brief pause for silence follows.
The Priest then says:

The people reply:
For we have sinned against you.
The Priest:
Show us, O Lord, your mercy.
The people:
And grant us your salvation.
The absolution by the Priest follows:
May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins,
and bring us to everlasting life.
The people reply:

other invocations* with Kyrie, eleison (Lord, have mercy):
* Sample invocations are found in Appendix VI, pp. 000-000. [USA]
You were sent to heal the contrite of heart:
Lord, have mercy. Or: Kyrie, eleison.
The people reply:

The Priest:
You came to call sinners:

Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace to people of good will.
We praise you,
we bless you,
we adore you,
we glorify you,
we give you thanks for your great glory,
Lord God, heavenly King,
O God, almighty Father.
Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son,
Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,
you take away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us;
you take away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer;
you are seated at the right hand of the Father,
have mercy on us.
For you alone are the Holy One,
you alone are the Lord,
you alone are the Most High,
Jesus Christ,
with the Holy Spirit,
in the glory of God the Father.
Amen.
9. When this hymn is concluded, the Priest, with hands joined, says:
Let us pray.
And all pray in silence with the Priest for a moment.
Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Collect prayer, at the
end of which the people acclaim:
Amen.
The Liturgy of the Word
10. Then the reader goes to the ambo and reads the first reading, while
all sit and listen.
To indicate the end of the reading, the reader acclaims:
The Word of the Lord.
All reply:
Thanks be to God.
11. The psalmist or cantor sings or says the Psalm, with the people
making the response.
12. After this, if there is to be a second reading, a reader reads it
from the ambo, as above.
To indicate the end of the reading, the reader acclaims:
The Word of the Lord.
All reply:
Thanks be to God.
13. There follows the Alleluia or another chant laid down by the
rubrics, as the liturgical time requires.
14. Meanwhile, if incense is used, the Priest puts some into the
thurible. After this, the Deacon who is to proclaim the Gospel, bowing
profoundly before the Priest, asks for the blessing, saying in a low
voice:
Your blessing, Father.
The Priest says in a low voice:
May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips
that you may proclaim his Gospel worthily and well,
in the name of the Father and of the Son X and of the Holy Spirit.
The Deacon signs himself with the Sign of the Cross and replies:
Amen.
If, however, a Deacon is not present, the Priest, bowing before the
altar, says quietly:
Cleanse my heart and my lips, almighty God,
that I may worthily proclaim your holy Gospel.
15. The Deacon, or the Priest, then proceeds to the ambo, accompanied,
if appropriate, by ministers with incense and candles. There he says:
The Lord be with you.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.
The Deacon, or the Priest:
A reading from the holy Gospel according to N.
and, at the same time, he makes the Sign of the Cross on the book and
on his forehead, lips, and breast.
The people acclaim:
Glory to you, O Lord.
Then the Deacon, or the Priest, incenses the book, if incense is used,
and proclaims the Gospel.
16. At the end of the Gospel, the Deacon, or the Priest, acclaims:
The Gospel of the Lord.
All reply:
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.
Then he kisses the book, saying quietly:
Through the words of the Gospel
may our sins be wiped away.
17. Then follows the homily, which is to be preached by a Priest or
Deacon on all Sundays and holy days of obligation; on other days, it is
recommended.
18. At the end of the homily, the Symbol or Profession of Faith or
Creed, when prescribed, is either sung or said:
I believe in one God,
the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.
I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God,
born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us men and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
At the words that follow up to and including and became man, all bow.
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate
of the Virgin Mary,
and became man.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
to judge the living and the dead
and his kingdom will have no end.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.
I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
and the life of the world to come. Amen.
19. Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during
Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known
as the Apostles' Creed, may be used.
I believe in God,
the Father almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
At the words that follow, up to and including the Virgin Mary, all bow.
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried;
he descended into hell;
on the third day he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.
20. Then follows the Universal Prayer, that is, the Prayer of the
Faithful or Bidding Prayers.
The Liturgy of the Eucharist
21. When all this has been done, the Offertory Chant begins. Meanwhile,
the ministers place the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the
pall, and the Missal on the altar.
22. It is desirable that the faithful express their participation by
making an offering, bringing forward bread and wine for the celebration
of the Eucharist and perhaps other gifts to relieve the needs of the
Church and of the poor.
23. The Priest, standing at the altar, takes the paten with the bread
and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in
a low voice:
Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the bread we offer you:
fruit of the earth and work of human hands,
it will become for us the bread of life.
Then he places the paten with the bread on the corporal.
If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak
these words aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:
Blessed be God for ever.
24. The Deacon, or the Priest, pours wine and a little water into the
chalice, saying quietly:
By the mystery of this water and wine
may we come to share in the divinity of Christ
who humbled himself to share in our humanity.
25. The Priest then takes the chalice and holds it slightly raised
above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice:
Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the wine we offer you:
fruit of the vine and work of human hands
it will become our spiritual drink.
Then he places the chalice on the corporal.
If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak
these words aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:
Blessed be God for ever.
26. After this, the Priest, bowing profoundly, says quietly:
With humble spirit and contrite heart
may we be accepted by you, O Lord,
and may our sacrifice in your sight this day
be pleasing to you, Lord God.
27. If appropriate, he also incenses the offerings, the cross, and the
altar. A Deacon or other minister then incenses the Priest and the
people.
28. Then the Priest, standing at the side of the altar, washes his
hands, saying quietly:
Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.
29. Standing at the middle of the altar, facing the people, extending
and then joining his hands, he says:
Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters),
that my sacrifice and yours
may be acceptable to God,
the almighty Father.
The people rise and reply:
May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands
for the praise and glory of his name,
for our good
and the good of all his holy Church.
30. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer over the
Offerings, at the end of which the people acclaim:
Amen.
THE EUCHARISTIC PRAYER
31. Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer.
Extending his hands, he says:
The Lord be with you.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.
The Priest, raising his hands, continues:
Lift up your hearts.
The people:
We lift them up to the Lord.
The Priest, with hands extended, adds:
Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
The people:
It is right and just.
The Priest, with hands extended, continues the Preface.
At the end of the Preface he joins his hands and concludes the Preface
with the people, singing or saying aloud:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
Or:
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dóminus Deus Sábaoth.
Pleni sunt caeli et terra glória tua.
Hosánna in excélsis.
Benedíctus qui venit in nómine Dómini.
Hosánna in excélsis.
32. In all Masses, the Priest celebrant is permitted to sing parts of
the Eucharistic Prayer provided with musical notation below, pp.

V/. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R/. It is right and just.
Then follows the Preface to be used in accord with the rubrics, which
concludes:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
108. The Priest, with hands extended, says:
You are indeed Holy, O Lord,
and all you have created rightly gives you praise, for through your Son
our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,
you give life to all things and make them holy, and you never cease to
gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its
setting
a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.
109. He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings,
says:
Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you:
by the same Spirit graciously make holy
these gifts we have brought to you for consecration,
He joins his hands and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread
and chalice together, saying:
that they may become the Body and X Blood
of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
He joins his hands.
at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.
110. In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be
pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words
requires.
For on the night he was betrayed
He takes the bread
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
he himself took bread,
and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying:
He bends slightly.
TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,
FOR THIS IS MY BODY,
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.
He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the
paten, and genuflects in adoration.
111. After this, he continues:
In a similar way, when supper was ended,
He takes the chalice
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
he took the chalice,
and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
He bends slightly.
TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD,
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT,
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY
FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.
DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.
He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and
genuflects in adoration.
112. Then he says:
The mystery of faith.
And the people continue, acclaiming:
We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
Or:
When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
Or:
Save us, Savior of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free.
113. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says:
Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving Passion
of your Son,
his wondrous Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, and as we look
forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy
and living sacrifice.
Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church and, recognizing the
sacrificial Victim by whose death
you willed to reconcile us to yourself,
grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and
filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body, one spirit in Christ.
May he make of us
an eternal offering to you,
so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,
especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,
with your blessed Apostles and glorious Martyrs
(with Saint N.: the Saint of the day or Patron Saint)
and with all the Saints,
on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing
help.
May this Sacrifice of our reconciliation,
we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation of all the world. Be
pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim Church on earth,
with your servant N. our Pope and N. our Bishop,*
* Mention may be made here of the Coadjutor Bishop, or Auxiliary
Bishops, as noted in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, n.
149.
the Order of Bishops, all the clergy,
and the entire people you have gained for your own.
Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,
whom you have summoned before you:
in your compassion, O merciful Father, gather to yourself all your
children scattered throughout the world.
 To our departed brothers and sisters
and to all who were pleasing to you
at their passing from this life,
give kind admittance to your kingdom.
There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory
He joins his hands.
through Christ our Lord,
through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. 
114. He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and raising both,
he says:
Through him, and with him, and in him,
O God, almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honor is yours,
for ever and ever.
The people acclaim:
Amen.
Then follows the Communion Rite, p. 000.

115. When this Eucharistic Prayer is used in Masses for the Dead, the
following may be said:
 Remember your servant N.
whom you have called (today)
from this world to yourself.
Grant that he (she) who was united with your Son in a death like his,
may also be one with him in his Resurrection,
when from the earth
he will raise up in the flesh those who have died,
and transform our lowly body after the pattern of his own glorious
body. To our departed brothers and sisters, too, and to all who were
pleasing to you at their passing from this life,
give kind admittance to your kingdom. There we hope to enjoy for ever
the fullness of your glory, when you will wipe away every tear from our
eyes.
For seeing you, our God, as you are, we shall be like you for all the
ages and praise you without end,
He joins his hands.
through Christ our Lord, through whom you bestow on the world all that
is good. 

EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IV
116. It is not permitted to change the Preface of this Eucharistic
Prayer because of the structure of the Prayer itself, which presents a
summary of the history of salvation.
V/. The Lord be with you.
R/. And with your spirit.
V/. Lift up your hearts.
R/. We lift them up to the Lord.
V/. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R/. It is right and just.
It is truly right to give you thanks,
truly just to give you glory, Father most holy,
for you are the one God living and true,
existing before all ages and abiding for all eternity,
dwelling in unapproachable light;
yet you, who alone are good, the source of life,
have made all that is,
so that you might fill your creatures with blessings
and bring joy to many of them by the glory of your light.
And so, in your presence are countless hosts of Angels,
who serve you day and night
and, gazing upon the glory of your face,
glorify you without ceasing.
With them we, too, confess your name in exultation,
giving voice to every creature under heaven
as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
117. The Priest, with hands extended, says:
We give you praise, Father most holy,
for you are great,
and you have fashioned all your works
in wisdom and in love.
You formed man in your own image
and entrusted the whole world to his care,
so that in serving you alone, the Creator,
he might have dominion over all creatures.
And when through disobedience he had lost your friendship,
you did not abandon him to the domain of death.
For you came in mercy to the aid of all,
so that those who seek might find you.
Time and again you offered them covenants
and through the prophets
taught them to look forward to salvation.
And you so loved the world, Father most holy,
that in the fullness of time
you sent your Only Begotten Son to be our Savior.
Made incarnate by the Holy Spirit
and born of the Virgin Mary,
he shared our human nature
in all things but sin.
To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation,
to prisoners, freedom,
and to the sorrowful of heart, joy.
To accomplish your plan,
he gave himself up to death,
and, rising from the dead,
he destroyed death and restored life.
And that we might live no longer for ourselves
but for him who died and rose again for us,
he sent the Holy Spirit from you, Father,
as the first fruits for those who believe,
so that, bringing to perfection his work in the world,
he might sanctify creation to the full.
118. He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings,
says:
Therefore, O Lord, we pray:
may this same Holy Spirit
graciously sanctify these offerings,
He joins his hands and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread
and chalice together, saying:
that they may become
the Body and X? Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
He joins his hands.
for the celebration of this great mystery,
which he himself left us
as an eternal covenant.
119. In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be
pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words
requires.
For when the hour had come
for him to be glorified by you, Father most holy,
having loved his own who were in the world,
he loved them to the end:
and while they were at supper,
He takes the bread
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
he took bread, blessed and broke it,
and gave it to his disciples, saying,
He bends slightly.
TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,
FOR THIS IS MY BODY,
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.
He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the
paten, and genuflects in adoration.
120. After this, he continues:
In a similar way,
He takes the chalice
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
taking the chalice filled with the fruit of the vine,
he gave thanks,
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
He bends slightly.
TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD,
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT,
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY
FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.
DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.
He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and
genuflects in adoration.
121. Then he says:
The mystery of faith.
And the people continue, acclaiming:
We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
Or:
When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
Or:
Save us, Savior of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free.
122. Then, with hands extended, the Priest says:
Therefore, O Lord,
as we now celebrate the memorial of our redemption,
we remember Christ's death
and his descent to the realm of the dead,
we proclaim his Resurrection
and his Ascension to your right hand;
and as we await his coming in glory,
we offer you his Body and Blood,
the sacrifice acceptable to you
which brings salvation to the whole world.
Look, O Lord, upon the Sacrifice
which you yourself have provided for your Church,
and grant in your loving kindness
to all who partake of this one Bread and one Chalice
that, gathered into one body by the Holy Spirit,
they may truly become a living sacrifice in Christ
to the praise of your glory.
Therefore, Lord, remember now
all for whom we offer this sacrifice:
especially your servant, N. our Pope,
N. our Bishop,* and the whole Order of Bishops,
* Mention may be made here of the Coadjutor Bishop, or Auxiliary
Bishops, as noted in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, n.
149.
all the clergy,
those who take part in this offering,
those gathered here before you,
your entire people,
and all who seek you with a sincere heart.
Remember also
those who have died in the peace of your Christ
and all the dead,
whose faith you alone have known.
To all of us, your children,
grant, O merciful Father,
that we may enter into a heavenly inheritance
with the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,
and with your Apostles and Saints in your kingdom.
There, with the whole of creation,
freed from the corruption of sin and death,
may we glorify you through Christ our Lord,
He joins his hands.
through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.
123. He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and raising both,
he says:
Through him, and with him, and in him,
O God, almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all glory and honor is yours,
for ever and ever.
The people acclaim:
Amen.
Then follows the Communion Rite, p. 000.
The Communion Rite
124. After the chalice and paten have been set down, the Priest, with
hands joined, says:
At the Savior's command
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:
He extends his hands and, together with the people, continues:
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
125. With hands extended, the Priest alone continues, saying:
Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,
that, by the help of your mercy,
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,
as we await the blessed hope
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
He joins his hands.
The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming:
For the kingdom,
the power and the glory are yours
now and for ever.
126. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud:
Lord Jesus Christ,
who said to your Apostles,
Peace I leave you, my peace I give you,
look not on our sins,
but on the faith of your Church,
and graciously grant her peace and unity
in accordance with your will.
He joins his hands.
Who live and reign for ever and ever.
The people reply:
Amen.
127. The Priest, turned towards the people, extending and then joining
his hands, adds:
The peace of the Lord be with you always.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.
128. Then, if appropriate, the Deacon, or the Priest, adds:
Let us offer each other the sign of peace.
And all offer one another a sign, in keeping with local customs, that
expresses peace, communion, and charity. The Priest gives the sign of
peace to a Deacon or minister.
129. Then he takes the host, breaks it over the paten, and places a
small piece in the chalice, saying quietly:
May this mingling of the Body and Blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ
bring eternal life to us who receive it.
130. Meanwhile the following is sung or said:
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,
grant us peace.
The invocation may even be repeated several times if the fraction is
prolonged. Only the final time, however, is grant us peace said.
131. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly:
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,
who by the will of the Father
and the work of the Holy Spirit,
through your Death gave life to the world;
free me by this, your most holy Body and Blood,
from all my sins and from every evil;
keep me always faithful to your commandments,
and never let me be parted from you.
Or:
May the receiving of your Body and Blood,
Lord Jesus Christ,
not bring me to judgment and condemnation,
but through your loving mercy
be for me protection in mind and body,
and a healing remedy.
132. The Priest genuflects, takes the host and, holding it slightly
raised above the paten or above the chalice, while facing the people,
says aloud:
Behold the Lamb of God,
behold him who takes away the sins of the world.
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.
And together with the people he adds once:
Lord, I am not worthy
that you should enter under my roof,
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.
133. The Priest, facing the altar, says quietly:
May the Body of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life.
And he reverently consumes the Body of Christ.
Then he takes the chalice and says quietly:
May the Blood of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life.
And he reverently consumes the Blood of Christ.
134. After this, he takes the paten or ciborium and approaches the
communicants. The Priest raises a host slightly and shows it to each of
the communicants, saying:
The Body of Christ.
The communicant replies:
Amen.
And receives Holy Communion.
If a Deacon also distributes Holy Communion, he does so in the same
manner.
135. If any are present who are to receive Holy Communion under both
kinds, the rite described in the proper place is to be followed.
136. While the Priest is receiving the Body of Christ, the Communion
Chant begins.
137. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest or a Deacon
or an acolyte purifies the paten over the chalice and also the chalice
itself.
While he carries out the purification, the Priest says quietly:
What has passed our lips as food, O Lord,
may we possess in purity of heart,
that what has been given to us in time
may be our healing for eternity.
138. Then the Priest may return to the chair. If appropriate, a sacred
silence may be observed for a while, or a psalm or other canticle of
praise or a hymn may be sung.
139. Then, standing at the altar or at the chair and facing the people,
with hands joined, the Priest says:
Let us pray.
All pray in silence with the Priest for a while, unless silence has
just been observed. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the
Prayer after Communion, at the end of which the people acclaim:
Amen.
The Concluding Rites
140. If they are necessary, any brief announcements to the people
follow here.
141. Then the dismissal takes place. The Priest, facing the people and
extending his hands, says:
The Lord be with you.
The people reply:
And with your spirit.
The Priest blesses the people, saying:
May almighty God bless you:
the Father, and the Son, X and the Holy Spirit.
The people reply:
Amen.

142. On certain days or occasions, this formula of blessing is
preceded, in accordance with the rubrics, by another more solemn
formula of blessing or by a prayer over the people (cf. pp. 000ff).

143. In a Pontifical Mass, the celebrant receives the miter and,
extending his hands, says:
The Lord be with you.
All reply:
And with your spirit.
The celebrant says:
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
All reply:
Now and for ever.
The celebrant says:
Our help is in the name of the Lord.
All reply:
Who made heaven and earth.
Then the celebrant receives the pastoral staff, if he uses it, and
says:
May almighty God bless you,
making the Sign of the Cross over the people three times, he adds:
the Father, X and the Son, X and the Holy X Spirit.
All:
Amen.

144. Then the Deacon, or the Priest himself, with hands joined and
facing the people, says:
Go forth, the Mass is ended.
Or:
Go and announce the Gospel of the Lord.
Or:
Go in peace, glorifying the Lord by your life.
Or:
Go in peace.
The people reply:
Thanks be to God.
145. Then the Priest venerates the altar as usual with a kiss, as at
the beginning. After making a profound bow with the ministers, he
withdraws.
146. If any liturgical action follows immediately, the rites of
dismissal are omitted.
