PREFACE I OF ADVENT
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Qui, primo adventu in humilitate carnis
assumptae, dispositionis antiquae munus implevit, nobisque salutis
perpetuae tramitem reseravit: ut, cum secundo venerit in suae gloria
maiestatis, manifesto demum munere capiamus, quod vigilantes nunc
audemus exspectare promissum. Et ideo cum Angelis et Archangelis, cum
Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque omni militia caelestis exercitus,
hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine fine dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For he assumed at his first coming the lowliness of human flesh,
and so fulfilled the design you formed long ago,
and opened for us the way to eternal salvation,
that, when he comes again in glory and majesty
and all is at last made manifest,
we who watch for that day may inherit the great promise
in which now we dare to hope.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

PREFACE II OF ADVENT
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Quem praedixerunt cunctorum praeconia
prophetarum, Virgo Mater ineffabili dilectione sustinuit, Ioannes
cecinit affuturum et adesse monstravit. Qui suae nativitatis mysterium
tribuit nos praevenire gaudentes, ut et in oratione pervigiles et in
suis inveniat laudibus exsultantes. Et ideo cum Angelis et Archangelis,
cum Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque omni militia caelestis exercitus,
hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine fine dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For all the oracles of the prophets foretold him,
the Virgin Mother longed for him with love beyond all telling,
John the Baptist sang of his coming
and proclaimed his presence when he came.

It is by his gift that already we rejoice at the mystery of his
Nativity,
so that he may find us watchful in prayer
and exultant in his praise.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

PREFACE I OF THE NATIVITY OF THE LORD
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Quia per incarnati Verbi mysterium nova mentis nostrae oculis lux tuae
claritatis infulsit: ut, dum visibiliter Deum cognoscimus, per hunc in
invisibilium amorem rapiamur. Et ideo cum Angelis et Archangelis, cum
Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque omni militia caelestis exercitus,
hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine fine dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.

For in the mystery of the Word made flesh
a new light of your glory has shone upon the eyes of our mind,
so that, as we recognize in him God made visible,
we may be caught up through him in love of things invisible.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

PREFACE II OF THE NATIVITY OF THE LORD
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Qui, in huius venerandi festivitate
mysterii, invisibilis in suis, visibilis in nostris apparuit, et ante
tempora genitus esse coepit in tempore; ut, in se erigens cuncta
deiecta, in integrum restitueret universa, et hominem perditum ad
caelestia regna revocaret. Unde et nos, cum omnibus Angelis te
laudamus, iucunda celebratione clamantes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For on the feast of his awe-filled mystery,
though invisible in his own divine nature,
he has appeared visibly in ours;
and begotten before all ages,
he has begun to exist in time;
so that, raising up in himself all that was cast down,
he might restore unity to all creation
and call straying humanity back to the heavenly Kingdom.

And so, with Angels.
we praise you, as in joyful celebration we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

PREFACE III OF THE NATIVITY OF THE LORD
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Per quem hodie commercium nostrae
reparationis effulsit, quia, dum nostra fragilitas a tuo Verbo
suscipitur, humana mortalitas non solum in perpetuum transit honorem,
sed nos quoque, mirando consortio, reddit aeternos. Et ideo, choris
angelicis sociati, te laudamus in gaudio confitentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For through him the holy exchange that restores our life
has shone forth today in splendour:
when our frailty is assumed by your word
not only does human mortality receive unending honour
but by this wondrous union we, too, are made eternal.

And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

EPIPHANY OF THE LORD
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Quia ipsum in Christo salutis nostrae mysterium hodie ad lumen gentium
revelasti, et, cum in substantia nostrae mortalitatis apparuit, nova
nos immortalitatis eius gloria reparasti. Et ideo cum Angelis et
Archangelis, cum Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque omni militia
caelestis exercitus, hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine fine dicentes:
Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.

For today you have revealed
the mystery of our salvation in Christ
as a light for the nations,
and, when he appeared in our mortal nature,
you made us new by the glory of his immortal nature.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

PREFACE OF LENT I
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Quia fidelibus tuis dignanter concedis
quotannis paschalia sacramenta in gaudio purificatis mentibus
exspectare: ut, pietatis officia et opera caritatis propensius
exsequentes, frequentatione mysteriorum, quibus renati sunt, ad gratiae
filiorum plenitudinem perducantur. Et ideo cum Angelis et Archangelis,
cum Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque omni militia caelestis exercitus,
hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine fine dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For by your gracious gift each year
your faithful await the sacred paschal feasts
with the joy of minds made pure,
so that, more eagerly intent on prayer
and on the works of charity,
and participating in the mysteries
by which they have been reborn,
they may be led to the fullness of grace
that you bestow on your sons and daughters.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory
as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

PREFACE OF LENT II
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Qui filiis tuis ad reparandam mentium puritatem, tempus praecipuum
salubriter statuisti, quo, mente ab inordinatis affectibus expedita,
sic incumberent transituris ut rebus potius perpetuis inhaererent. Et
ideo, cum Sanctis et Angelis universis, te collaudamus, sine fine
dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,

For you have given your children a sacred time
for the renewing and purifying of their hearts,
that, freed from disordered affections,
they may so deal with the things of this passing world
as to hold rather to the things that eternally endure.

And so, with all the Angels and Saints,
we praise you, as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
PREFACE OF LENT III
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Qui nos per abstinentiam tibi gratias referre voluisti, ut ipsa et nos
peccatores ab insolentia mitigaret, et, egentium proficiens alimento,
imitatores tuae benignitatis efficeret. Et ideo, cum innumeris Angelis,
una te magnificamus laudis voce dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.

For you will that our self-denial should give you thanks,

contribute to the feeding of the poor,
and so help us imitate you in your kindness.

And so we glorify you with countless Angels,
as with one voice of praise we acclaim:

Holy, holy, holy...

ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Qui corporali ieiunio vitia comprimis, mentem elevas, virtutem largiris
et praemia: per Christum Dominum nostrum. Per quem maiestatem tuam
laudant Angeli, adorant Dominationes, tremunt Potestates. Caeli

Quia per Filii tui salutiferam passionem sensum confitendae tuae
maiestatis totus mundus accepit, dum ineffabili crucis potentia

tempore confiteri, sed in hoc potissimum gloriosius praedicare, cum
Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus. Qui se pro nobis offerre non
desinit, nosque apud te perenni advocatione defendit; qui immolatus iam
non moritur, sed semper vivit occisus. Quapropter, profusis paschalibus

virtutes atque angelicae potestates hymnum gloriae tuae concinunt, sine
fine dicentes: Sanctus.

ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Cuius hoc mirificum fuit opus per
paschale mysterium, ut de peccato et mortis iugo ad hanc gloriam
vocaremur, qua nunc genus electum, regale sacerdotium, gens sancta et

a holy nation, a people for your own possession,
to proclaim everywhere your mighty works,
for you have called us out of darkness
into your own wonderful light.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,

ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Qui, humanis miseratus erroribus, de
Virgine nasci dignatus est. Qui, crucem passus, a perpetua morte nos

ideo cum Angelis et Archangelis, cum Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque
omni militia caelestis exercitus, hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine
fine dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,

For out of compassion for the waywardness that is ours,
he humbled himself and was born of the Virgin;
by the passion of the Cross he freed us from unending death,
and by rising from the dead he gave us life eternal.

cuius immensam gloriam pertinere cognoscimus ut mortalibus tua deitate
succurreres; sed et nobis provideres de ipsa mortalitate nostra
remedium, et perditos quosque unde perierant, inde salvares, per
Christum Dominum nostrum. Per quem maiestatem tuam adorat exercitus
Angelorum, ante conspectum tuum in aeternitate laetantium. Cum quibus
et nostras voces ut admitti iubeas, deprecamur, socia exsultatione
dicentes: Sanctus.

that the cause of our downfall
might become the means of our salvation,
through Christ our Lord.
Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty

we are made strong,
and, as we drink his Blood that was poured out for us,
we are washed clean.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,

et nos cum omni exercitu Angelorum proclamamus, sine fine dicentes:

For at the Last Supper with his Apostles,
establishing for the ages to come the saving memorial of the Cross,
he offered himself to you as the unblemished Lamb,
the acceptable gift of perfect praise.
Nourishing your faithful by this sacred mystery,
you make them holy, so that the human race,
bounded by one world,
may be enlightened by one faith

so that, bathed in the sweetness of your grace,
we may pass over to the heavenly realities here foreshadowed.
Therefore, all creatures of heaven and earth
sing a new song in adoration,
and we, with all the host of Angels,
cry out, and without end we acclaim:

COMMON PREFACE VI           The mystery of salvation in Christ
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi, sancte Pater,
semper et ubique gratias agere per Filium dilectionis tuae Iesum
Christum, Verbum tuum per quod cuncta fecisti: quem misisti nobis
Salvatorem et Redemptorem, incarnatum de Spiritu Sancto et ex Virgine
natum. Qui voluntatem tuam adimplens et populum tibi sanctum acquirens
extendit manus cum pateretur, ut mortem solveret et resurrectionem
manifestaret. Et ideo cum Angelis et omnibus Sanctis gloriam tuam
praedicamus, una voce dicentes: Sanctus.
The following Preface is said in Masses that have no proper Preface,
and for which a Preface related to a specific liturgical time is not
indicated.

It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks, Father most holy,
through your beloved Son, Jesus Christ,
your Word through whom you made all things,
whom you sent as our Saviour and Redeemer,
incarnate by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin.
Fulfilling your will and gaining for you a holy people,
he stretched out his hands as he endured his Passion,
so as to break the bonds of death and manifest the resurrection.
And so, with the Angels and all the Saints,
we declare your glory,
as with one voice we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
PREFACE I FOR THE DEAD          The hope of resurrection in Christ
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. In quo nobis spes beatae resurrectionis
effulsit, ut, quos contristat certa moriendi condicio, eosdem
consoletur futurae immortalitatis promissio. Tuis enim fidelibus,
Domine, vita mutatur, non tollitur, et, dissoluta terrestris huius
incolatus domo, aeterna in caelis habitatio comparatur. Et ideo cum
Angelis et Archangelis, cum Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque omni
militia caelestis exercitus, hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine fine
dicentes: Sanctus.

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.
In him the hope of blessed resurrection has dawned,
that those saddened by the certainty of dying,
might be consoled by the promise of immortality to come.
Indeed for your faithful, Lord,
life is changed not ended,
and, when this earthly dwelling turns to dust,
an eternal dwelling is made ready for them in heaven.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
PREFACE II FOR THE DEAD           Christ died so that we might live
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Ipse enim mortem unus accepit, ne omnes
nos moreremur; immo unus mori dignatus est, ut omnes tibi perpetuo
viveremus. Et ideo, choris angelicis sociati, te laudamus in gaudio
confitentes: Sanctus.

For as one alone he accepted death,
so that we might all escape from dying;
as one man he chose to die,
so that in your sight we all might live for ever.
And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
PREFACE III FOR THE DEAD           Christ, the salvation and the life
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum: Qui est salus mundi, vita hominum,
resurrectio mortuorum. Per quem maiestatem tuam adorat exercitus
Angelorum, ante conspectum tuum in aeternitate laetantium. Cum quibus
et nostras voces ut admitti iubeas, deprecamur, socia exsultatione
dicentes: Sanctus.

For he is the salvation of the world,
the life of the human race,
the resurrection of the dead.
Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
PREFACE IV FOR THE DEAD           From earthly life to heavenly glory
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Cuius imperio nascimur, cuius arbitrio regimur, cuius praecepto in
terra, de qua sumpti sumus, peccati lege absolvimur. Et, qui per mortem
Filii tui redempti sumus, ad ipsius resurrectionis gloriam tuo nutu
excitamur. Et ideo, cum Angelorum atque Sanctorum turba, hymnum laudis
tibi canimus, sine fine dicentes: Sanctus.

always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For it is at your summons that we come to birth,
by your will that we are governed,
and at your command that we return,
on account of sin,
to that earth from which we came.
And when you give the sign,
we who have been redeemed by the Death of your Son,
shall be raised up to the glory of his Resurrection.
And so, with the company of Angels and Saints,
we sing the hymn of your praise,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
PREFACE V FOR THE DEAD           Our resurrection through the victory
of Christ
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Quia, etsi nostri est meriti quod perimus, tuae tamen est pietatis et
gratiae quod, pro peccato morte consumpti, per Christi victoriam
redempti, cum ipso revocamur ad vitam. Et ideo, cum caelorum
Virtutibus, in terris te iugiter celebramus, maiestati tuae sine fine
clamantes: Sanctus.

yet by your compassion and your grace,
when seized by death according to our sins,
we are redeemed through Christ's great victory,
and with him called back into life.
And so, with the Powers of heaven,
we worship you constantly on earth,
and before your majesty
without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
