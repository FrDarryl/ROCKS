Sanctifica, quaesumus, Domine Deus noster, per tui nominis
invocationem, haec munera nostrae servitutis, et per ea nosmetipsos
tibi perfice munus aeternum.

PREFACE          The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Qui cum Unigenito Filio tuo et Spiritu Sancto unus es Deus, unus es
Dominus: non in unius singularitate personae, sed in unius Trinitate
substantiae. Quod enim de tua gloria, revelante te, credimus, hoc de
Filio tuo, hoc de Spiritu Sancto, sine discretione sentimus. Ut, in
confessione verae sempiternaeque Deitatis, et in personis proprietas,
et in essentia unitas, et in maiestate adoretur aequalitas. Quem
laudant Angeli atque Archangeli, Cherubim quoque ac Seraphim, qui non
cessant clamare cotidie, una voce dicentes: Sanctus.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For with your Only Begotten Son and the Holy Spirit
you are one God, one Lord:
not in the unity of a single person,
but in a Trinity of one substance.
For what you have revealed to us of your glory
we believe equally of your Son
and of the Holy Spirit,
so that, in the confessing of the true and eternal Godhead,
you might be adored in what is proper to each Person,
their unity in substance,
and their equality in majesty.
For this is praised by Angels and Archangels,
Cherubim, too, and Seraphim,
who never cease to cry out each day,
as with one voice they acclaim:
Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts... .
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Gal 4: 6
Quoniam autem estis filii, misit Deus Spiritum Filii sui in corda
vestra clamantem: Abba, Pater.
Since you are children of God,
God has sent into your hearts the Spirit of his Son,
the Spirit who cries out: Abba, Father.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Proficiat nobis ad salutem corporis et animae, Domine Deus noster,
huius sacramenti susceptio, et sempiternae sanctae Trinitatis
eiusdemque individuae Unitatis confessio.
May receiving this Sacrament, O Lord our God,
bring us health of body and soul,
as we confess your eternal holy Trinity and undivided Unity.
Through Christ our Lord.


Readings


YEAR A

FIRST READING          Exodus 34:4b-6,8-9
Early in the morning Moses went up Mount Sinai
as the LORD had commanded him,
taking along the two stone tablets.

Having come down in a cloud, the LORD stood with Moses there
and proclaimed his name, "LORD."
Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out,
"The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God,
slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity."
Moses at once bowed down to the ground in worship.
Then he said, "If I find favor with you, O Lord,
do come along in our company.
This is indeed a stiff-necked people; yet pardon our wickedness and
sins,
and receive us as your own."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Daniel 3:52,53,54,55
Et laudabilis et superexaltatus in saecula.
R. Glory and praise for ever!
Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers,
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever;
And blessed is your holy and glorious name,
praiseworthy and exalted above all for all ages.
R. Glory and praise for ever!
Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory,
praiseworthy and glorious above all forever.
R. Glory and praise for ever!
Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom,
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.
R. Glory and praise for ever!
Blessed are you who look into the depths from your throne upon the
cherubim,
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.
R. Glory and praise for ever!
SECOND READING          2 Corinthians 13:11-13
Brothers and sisters, rejoice.
Mend your ways, encourage one another,
agree with one another, live in peace,
and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the holy ones greet you.

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.
ALLELUIA          Cf. Rev. 1:8
Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto, Deo qui est, et qui erat,
et qui venturus est.
Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit;
to God who is, who was, and who is to come.
GOSPEL          John 3:16-18
God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,
so that everyone who believes in him might not perish
but might have eternal life.
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,
but that the world might be saved through him.
Whoever believes in him will not be condemned,
but whoever does not believe has already been condemned,
because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.


YEAR B

FIRST READING          Deuteronomy 4:32-34, 39-40
Moses said to the people:
"Ask now of the days of old, before your time,
ever since God created man upon the earth;
ask from one end of the sky to the other:
Did anything so great ever happen before?
Was it ever heard of?
Did a people ever hear the voice of God
speaking from the midst of fire, as you did, and live?
Or did any god venture to go and take a nation for himself
from the midst of another nation,
by testings, by signs and wonders, by war,
with strong hand and outstretched arm, and by great terrors,
all of which the LORD, your God,
did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
This is why you must now know,
and fix in your heart, that the LORD is God
in the heavens above and on earth below,
and that there is no other.
You must keep his statutes and commandments that I enjoin on you today,
that you and your children after you may prosper,
and that you may have long life on the land
which the LORD, your God, is giving you forever."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Psalm 33:4-5, 6, 9, 18-19, 20, 22
Beatus populus quem elegit Dominus in hereditatem sibi.
R. Blessed the people the Lord has chosen to be his own.
Upright is the word of the LORD ,
and all his works are trustworthy.
He loves justice and right;
of the kindness of the LORD the earth is full.
R. Blessed the people the Lord has chosen to be his own.
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made;
by the breath of his mouth all their host.
For he spoke, and it was made;
he commanded, and it stood forth.
R. Blessed the people the Lord has chosen to be his own.
See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear him,
upon those who hope for his kindness,
To deliver them from death
and preserve them in spite of famine.
R. Blessed the people the Lord has chosen to be his own.
Our soul waits for the LORD ,
who is our help and our shield.
May your kindness, O LORD , be upon us
who have put our hope in you.
R. Blessed the people the Lord has chosen to be his own.
SECOND READING          Romans 8:14-17
Brothers and sisters:
For those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear,
but you received a Spirit of adoption,
through whom we cry, �Abba, Father!�
The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit
that we are children of God,
and if children, then heirs,
heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,
if only we suffer with him
so that we may also be glorified with him.
ALLELUIA          Cf. Rev. 1:8
Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto, Deo qui est, et qui erat,
et qui venturus est.
Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit;
to God who is, who was, and who is to come.
GOSPEL          Matthew 28:16-20
The eleven disciples went to Galilee,
to the mountain to which Jesus had ordered them.
When they all saw him, they worshiped, but they doubted.
Then Jesus approached and said to them,
"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age."


YEAR C

FIRST READING          Proverbs 8:22-31
Thus says the wisdom of God:
"The LORD possessed me, the beginning of his ways,
the forerunner of his prodigies of long ago;
from of old I was poured forth,
at the first, before the earth.
When there were no depths I was brought forth,
when there were no fountains or springs of water;
before the mountains were settled into place,
before the hills, I was brought forth;
while as yet the earth and fields were not made,
nor the first clods of the world.

"When the Lord established the heavens I was there,
when he marked out the vault over the face of the deep;
when he made firm the skies above,
when he fixed fast the foundations of the earth;
when he set for the sea its limit,
so that the waters should not transgress his command;
then was I beside him as his craftsman,
and I was his delight day by day,
playing before him all the while,
playing on the surface of his earth;
and I found delight in the human race."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Psalm 8:4-5, 6-7, 8-9
Domine, Dominus noster, quam admirabile est nomen tuum in universa
terra!
R. O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!
When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers,
the moon and stars that you set in place--
What are humans that you are mindful of them,
mere mortals that you care for them?
R. O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!
Yet you have made them little less than a god,
crowned them with glory and honor.
You have given them rule over the works of your hands,
put all things at their feet:
R. O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!
All sheep and oxen,
even the beasts of the field,
The birds of the air, the fish of the sea,
and whatever swims the paths of the seas.
R. O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!
SECOND READING          Romans 5:1-5
Brothers and sisters:
Therefore, since we have been justified by faith,
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have gained access by faith
to this grace in which we stand,
and we boast in hope of the glory of God.
Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions,
knowing that affliction produces endurance,
and endurance, proven character,
and proven character, hope,
and hope does not disappoint,
because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.
ALLELUIA          Cf. Rev. 1:8
Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto, Deo qui est, et qui erat,
et qui venturus est.
Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit;
to God who is, who was, and who is to come.
GOSPEL          John 16:12-15
Jesus said to his disciples:
"I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now.
But when he comes, the Spirit of truth,
he will guide you to all truth.
He will not speak on his own,
but he will speak what he hears,
and will declare to you the things that are coming.
He will glorify me,
because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.
Everything that the Father has is mine;
for this reason I told you that he will take from what is mine
and declare it to you."
