1. It is strongly recommended that the tradition of gathering the local
Church after the fashion of the Roman stations be kept and promoted,
especially during Lent and at least in larger towns and cities, in a
way best suited to individual places.

Such gatherings of the faithful can take place, especially with the
chief Pastor of the diocese presiding, on Sundays or on other more
convenient days during the week, either at the tombs of the Saints, or
in the principal churches or shrines of a city, or even in the mor-
frequently visited places of pilgrimage in the diocese.

If a procession precedes a Mass celebrated for such a gathering,
according to circumstances and local conditions, the faithful gather at
a smaller church or some other suitable place other than in the church
to which the procession will head.

After greeting the people, the Priest says a Collect of the mystery of
the Holy Cross for the remission of sins, or for the Church, especially
the local Church, or one of the Prayers over the People. Then the
procession makes its way to the church in which Mass will be celebrated
and meanwhile the Litany of the Saints is sung. Invocations to the
Patron Saint or the Founder Saint and to the Saints of the local Church
may be inserted at the appropriate point in the Litany.

When the procession reaches the church, the Priest venerates the altar
and, if appopriate, incenses it. Afterwards, omitting the Introductory
Rites and, if appropriate, the Kyrie, he says the Collect of the Mass,
and then continues the Mass in the usual way. 2. At these gatherings,
instead of Mass, some celebration of the Word of God may also take
place, especially in the form of the penitential celebrations given in
the Roman Ritual for Lent.

3. On weekdays of Lent, at the end of Mass and before the final
blessing, the Prayer over the People indicated for each day may
appropriately be used. 4. During Lent, it is not permitted to decorate
the altar with flowers, and the use of musical instruments is allowed
only so as to support the singing. Nevertheless, Laetare Sunday (the
Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts are exceptions to this
rule.


ASH WEDNESDAY

In the course of today's Mass, ashes are blessed and distributed. These
are made from the olive branches or branches of other trees that were
blessed the previous year.

Introductory Rites and Liturgy of the Word

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Wis 11: 24, 25, 27
Misereris omnium, Domine, et nihil odisti eorum quae fecisti,
dissimulans peccata hominum propter paenitentiam et parcens illis, quia
tu es Dominus Deus noster.
You are merciful to all, O Lord,
and despise nothing that you have made.
You overlook people's sins, to bring them to repentance,
and you spare them, for you are the Lord our God.
The Penitential Act is omitted, and the Distribution of Ashes takes its
place.
COLLECT
Concede nobis, Domine, praesidia militiae christianae sanctis inchoare
ieiuniis, ut, contra spiritales nequitias pugnaturi, continentiae
muniamur auxiliis.
Grant, O Lord, that we may begin with holy fasting
this campaign of Christian service,
so that, as we take up battle against spiritual evils,
we may be armed with weapons of self-restraint.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever
FIRST READING
A reading from the Book of the Prophet Joel
2:12-18
Even now, says the LORD,
return to me with your whole heart,
with fasting, and weeping, and mourning;
Rend your hearts, not your garments,
and return to the LORD, your God.
For gracious and merciful is he,
slow to anger, rich in kindness,
and relenting in punishment.
Perhaps he will again relent
and leave behind him a blessing,
Offerings and libations
for the LORD, your God.

Blow the trumpet in Zion!
proclaim a fast,
call an assembly;
Gather the people,
notify the congregation;
Assemble the elders,
gather the children
and the infants at the breast;
Let the bridegroom quit his room
and the bride her chamber.
Between the porch and the altar
let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep,
And say, “Spare, O LORD, your people,
and make not your heritage a reproach,
with the nations ruling over them!
Why should they say among the peoples,
‘Where is their God?’”

Then the LORD was stirred to concern for his land
and took pity on his people.

- PSALM 51 -
51:3-4, 5-6ab, 12-13, 14 and 17

Miserere, Domine, quia peccavimus.
R. (see 3a) Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness;
in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.
Thoroughly wash me from my guilt
and of my sin cleanse me.
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
For I acknowledge my offense,
and my sin is before me always:
Against you only have I sinned,
and done what is evil in your sight.
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
A clean heart create for me, O God,
and a steadfast spirit renew within me.
Cast me not out from your presence,
and your Holy Spirit take not from me.
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
Give me back the joy of your salvation,
and a willing spirit sustain in me.
O Lord, open my lips,
and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.
R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.
SECOND READING
A reading from the second Letter of Saint Paul to the
Corinthians                     5:20-6:2
Brothers and sisters:
We are ambassadors for Christ,
as if God were appealing through us.
We implore you on behalf of Christ,
be reconciled to God.
For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin,
so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.

Working together, then,
we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
For he says:

In an acceptable time I heard you,
and on the day of salvation I helped you.

Behold, now is a very acceptable time;
behold, now is the day of salvation.
GOSPEL ANTIPHON
Hodie, nolite obdurare corda vestra, sed vocem Domine audite.
If today you hear his voice,
harden not your hearts.
GOSPEL
A reading from the holy Gospel according to
Matthew                     6:1-6, 16-18
Jesus said to his disciples:
"Take care not to perform righteous deeds
in order that people may see them;
otherwise, you will have no recompense from your heavenly Father.
When you give alms,
do not blow a trumpet before you,
as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
to win the praise of others.
Amen, I say to you,
they have received their reward.
But when you give alms,
do not let your left hand know what your right is doing,
so that your almsgiving may be secret.
And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

"When you pray,
do not be like the hypocrites,
who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on street corners
so that others may see them.
Amen, I say to you,
they have received their reward.
But when you pray, go to your inner room,
close the door, and pray to your Father in secret.
And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.

"When you fast,
do not look gloomy like the hypocrites.
They neglect their appearance,
so that they may appear to others to be fasting.
Amen, I say to you, they have received their reward.
But when you fast,
anoint your head and wash your face,
so that you may not appear to be fasting,
except to your Father who is hidden.
And your Father who sees what is hidden will repay you."
Blessing and Distribution of Ashes

After the Homily, the Priest, standing with hands joined, says:

Deum Patrem, fratres carissimi, suppliciter deprecemur, ut hos cineres,
quos paenitentiae causa capitibus nostris imponimus, ubertate gratiae
suae benedicere dignetur.
Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), let us humbly ask God our Father
that he be pleased to bless with the abundance of his grace
these ashes, which we will put on our heads in penitence.

After a brief prayer in silence, and, with hands extended, he
continues:

Deus, qui humiliatione flecteris et satisfactione placaris, aurem tuae
pietatis precibus nostris inclina, et super famulos tuos, horum cinerum
aspersione contactos, gratiam tuae benedictionis effunde propitius, ut,
quadragesimalem observantiam prosequentes, ad Filii tui paschale
mysterium celebrandum purificatis mentibus pervenire mereantur.
O God, who are moved by acts of humility
and respond with forgiveness to works of penance,
lend your merciful ear to our prayers
and in your kindness pour out the grace of your blessing
on your servants who are marked with these ashes,
that, as they follow the Lenten observances,
they may be worthy to come with minds made pure
to celebrate the Paschal Mystery of your Son.
Through Christ our Lord
R. Amen.

Or:

Deus, qui non mortem sed conversionem desideras peccatorum, preces
nostras clementer exaudi, et hos cineres, quos capitibus nostris imponi
decernimus benedicere pro tua pietate dignare, ut qui nos cinerem esse
et in pulverem reversuros cognoscimus quadragesimalis exercitationis
studio, peccatorum veniam et novitatem vitae, ad imaginem Filii tui
resurgentis, consequi valeamus.
O God, who desire not the death of sinners,
but their conversion,
mercifully hear our prayers
and in your kindness be pleased to bless + these ashes,
which we intend to receive upon our heads,
that we, who acknowledge we are but ashes
and shall return to dust,
may, through a steadfast observance of Lent,
gain pardon for sins and newness of life
after the likeness of your Risen Son.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.

R. Amen.

He sprinkles the ashes with holy water, without saying anything.

Then the Priest places ashes on the head of all those present who come
to him, and says
to each one:

Paenitemini, et credite Evangelio.
Repent, and believe in the Gospel.

Or:

Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.
Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.
Meanwhile, the following are sung:

ANTIPHON 1
Immutemur habitu, in cinere et cilicio, ieiunemus, et ploremus ante
Dominum, quia multum misericors est dimittere peccata nostra Deus
noster.
Let us change our garments to sackcloth and ashes,
let us fast and weep before the Lord,
that our God, rich in mercy, might forgive us our sins.
ANTIPHON 2          Cf. Jl 2: 17; Est 4: 17
Inter vestibulum et altare plorabunt sacerdotes ministri Domini, et
dicent: Parce, Domine, parce populo tuo, et ne claudas ora canentium
te, Domine.
Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord,
stand between the porch and the altar and weep and cry out:
Spare, O Lord, spare your people;
do not close the mouths of those who sing your praise, O Lord.
ANTIPHON 3           Ps 51 (50): 3
Dele, Domine, iniquitatem meam.
Blot out my transgressions, O Lord.
This may be repeated after each verse of Psalm 51 (50): Have mercy on
me, O God.
RESPONSORY           Cf. Bar 3: 2; Ps 79 (78): 9
Emendemus in melius, quae ignoranter peccavimus, ne subito praeoccupati
die mortis quaeramus spatium paenitentiae, et invenire non possimus.
Attende, Domine, et miserere, quia peccavimus tibi. Adiuva nos, Deus
salutaris noster, et propter honorem nominis tui, Domine, libera nos.
R. Let us correct our faults which we have committed in ignorance,
let us not be taken unawares by the day of our death,
looking in vain for leisure to repent.
* Hear us, O Lord, and show us your mercy, for we have sinned against
you.
V. Help us, O God our Savior;
for the sake of your name, O Lord, set us free.
* Hear us, O Lord, and show us your mercy, for we have sinned against
you.

Another appropriate chant may also be sung.
After the distribution of ashes, the Priest washes his hands and
proceeds to the Universal
Prayer, and continues the Mass in the usual way.

The Creed is not said.

tui passionem mereamur esse devoti.

et praemia: per Christum Dominum nostrum. Per quem maiestatem tuam
laudant Angeli, adorant Dominationes, tremunt Potestates. Caeli
caelorumque Virtutes, ac beata Seraphim, socia exsultatione
concelebrant. Cum quibus et nostras voces ut admitti iubeas,
deprecamur, supplici confessione dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.

For through bodily fasting you restrain our faults,
raise up our minds, and bestow both virtue and its rewards,
through Christ our lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven
and the blessed Seraphim worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in humble praise, as we acclaim:

PRAYER OVER THE PEOPLE
For the dismissal, the Priest stands facing the people and, extending
his hands over them, says this prayer:
Super inclinantes se tuae maiestati, Deus, spiritum compunctionis
propitius effunde, et praemia paenitentibus repromissa misericorditer
consequi mereantur.
Pour out a spirit of compunction, O God,
on those who bow before your majesty,
and by your mercy may they merit the rewards you promise
to those who do penance.
Through Christ our Lord.
The blessing and distribution of ashes may also take place outside
Mass. In this case, the rite is preceded by a Liturgy of the Word, with
the Collect, and the readings with their chants as at Mass. Then there
follow the Homily and the blessing and distribution of ashes. The rite
is concluded with the Universal Prayer, the Blessing, and the Dismissal
of the Faithful.

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,

By abstaining forty long days from earthly food,
he consecrated through his fast
the pattern of our Lenten observance
and, by overturning all the snares of the ancient serpent,
taught us to cast out the leaven of malice,
so that, celebrating worthily the Paschal Mystery,
we might pass over at last to the eternal paschal feast.
And so, with the company of Angels and Saints,
we sing the hymn of your praise,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

HOLY WEEK

PALM SUNDAY OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD

1. On this day the Church recalls the entrance of Christ the Lord into
Jerusalem to accomplish his Paschal Mystery. Accordingly, the memorial
of this entrance of the Lord takes place at all Masses, by means of the
Procession or the Solemn Entrance before the principal Mass or the
Simple Entrance before other Masses. The Solemn Entrance, but not the
Procession, may be repeated before other Masses that are usually
celebrated with a large gathering of people.
It is desirable that, where neither the Procession nor the Solemn
Entrance can take place, there be a sacred celebration of the Word of
God on the messianic entrance and on the Passion of the Lord, either on
Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time.

The Commemoration of the Lord's Entrance into Jerusalem

First Form: The Procession
2. At an appropriate hour, a gathering takes place at a smaller church
or other suitable place other than inside the church to which the
procession will go. The faithful hold branches in their hands.
3. Wearing the red sacred vestments as for Mass, the Priest and the
Deacon, accompanied by other ministers, approach the place where the
people are gathered. Instead of the chasuble, the Priest may wear a
cope, which he leaves aside when the procession is over, and puts on a
chasuble.
4. Meanwhile, the following antiphon or another appropriate chant is
sung.
ANTIPHON           Mt 21: 9
Hosanna filio David: benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini, Rex Israel:
Hosanna in excelsis.
Hosanna to the Son of David;
blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.
Hosanna in the highest.
5. After this, the Priest and people sign themselves, while the Priest
says: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit. Then he greets the people in the usual way. A brief address is
given, in which the faithful are invited to participate actively and
consciously in the celebration of this day, in these or similar words:
Fratres carissimi, postquam iam ab initio Quadragesimae corda nostra
paenitentia et operibus caritatis praeparavimus, hodierna die
congregamur, ut cum tota Ecclesia praeludamus paschale Domini nostri
mysterium, eius nempe passionem atque resurrectionem, ad quod implendum
ipse ingressus est civitatem suam Ierusalem. Quare cum omni fide et
devotione memoriam agentes huius salutiferi ingressus, sequamur
Dominum, ut, per gratiam consortes effecti crucis, partem habeamus
resurrectionis et vitae.
Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
since the beginning of Lent until now
we have prepared our hearts by penance and charitable works.
Today we gather together to herald with the whole Church
the beginning of the celebration
of our Lord's Paschal Mystery,
that is to say, of his Passion and Resurrection.
For it was to accomplish this mystery
that he entered his own city of Jerusalem.
Therefore, with all faith and devotion,
let us commemorate
the Lord's entry into the city for our salvation,
following in his footsteps,
so that, being made by his grace partakers of the Cross,
we may have a share also in his Resurrection and in his life.
6. After the address, the Priest says one of the following prayers with
hands extended.
Let us pray.
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, hos palmites tua benedictione sanctifica,
ut nos, qui Christum Regem exsultando prosequimur, per ipsum valeamus
ad aeternam Ierusalem pervenire.
Almighty ever-living God,
sanctify + these branches with your blessing,
that we, who follow Christ the King in exultation,
may reach the eternal Jerusalem through him.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or:
Auge fidem in te sperantium, Deus, et supplicum preces clementer
exaudi, ut, qui hodie Christo triumphanti palmites exhibemus, in ipso
fructus tibi bonorum operum afferamus.
Increase the faith of those who place their hope in you, O God,
and graciously hear the prayers of those who call on you,
that we, who today hold high these branches
to hail Christ in his triumph,
may bear fruit for you by good works accomplished in him.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
He sprinkles the branches with holy water without saying anything.
7. Then a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, a Priest, proclaims in the
usual way the Gospel concerning the Lord's entrance according to one of
the four Gospels. If appropriate, incense may be used.
YEAR A          Mt 21:1-11
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.
When Jesus and the disciples drew near Jerusalem
and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives,
Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
"Go into the village opposite you,
and immediately you will find an ass tethered,
and a colt with her.
Untie them and bring them here to me.
And if anyone should say anything to you, reply,
'The master has need of them.'
Then he will send them at once."
This happened so that what had been spoken through the prophet
might be fulfilled:
Say to daughter Zion,
"Behold, your king comes to you,
meek and riding on an ass,
and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden."
The disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them.
They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks over them,
and he sat upon them.
The very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
while others cut branches from the trees
and strewed them on the road.
The crowds preceding him and those following
kept crying out and saying:
"Hosanna to the Son of David;
blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord;
hosanna in the highest."
And when he entered Jerusalem
the whole city was shaken and asked, "Who is this?"
And the crowds replied,
"This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee."
YEAR B          Mark 11:1-10 (First Option)
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark.
When Jesus and his disciples drew near to Jerusalem,
to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives,
he sent two of his disciples and said to them,
"Go into the village opposite you,
and immediately on entering it,
you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat.
Untie it and bring it here.
If anyone should say to you,
'Why are you doing this?' reply,
'The Master has need of it
and will send it back here at once.'"
So they went off
and found a colt tethered at a gate outside on the street,
and they untied it.
Some of the bystanders said to them,
"What are you doing, untying the colt?"
They answered them just as Jesus had told them to,
and they permitted them to do it.
So they brought the colt to Jesus
and put their cloaks over it.
And he sat on it.
Many people spread their cloaks on the road,
and others spread leafy branches
that they had cut from the fields.
Those preceding him as well as those following kept crying out:
"Hosanna!
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is to come!
Hosanna in the highest!"
Or:
John 12:12-16 (2nd Option)
A reading from the holy Gospel according to John.
When the great crowd that had come to the feast heard
that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
they took palm branches and went out to meet him, and cried out:
"Hosanna!
"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,
the king of Israel."
Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is written:
Fear no more, O daughter Zion;
see, your king comes, seated upon an ass's colt.
His disciples did not understand this at first,
but when Jesus had been glorified
they remembered that these things were written about him
and that they had done this for him.
YEAR C          Luke 19:28-40
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.
Jesus proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem.
As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany
at the place called the Mount of Olives,
he sent two of his disciples.
He said, "Go into the village opposite you,
and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered
on which no one has ever sat.
Untie it and bring it here.
And if anyone should ask you,
'Why are you untying it?'
you will answer,
'The Master has need of it.'"
So those who had been sent went off
and found everything just as he had told them.
And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them,
"Why are you untying this colt?"
They answered,
"The Master has need of it."
So they brought it to Jesus,
threw their cloaks over the colt,
and helped Jesus to mount.
As he rode along,
the people were spreading their cloaks on the road;
and now as he was approaching the slope of the Mount of Olives,
the whole multitude of his disciples
began to praise God aloud with joy
for all the mighty deeds they had seen.
They proclaimed:
"Blessed is the king who comes
in the name of the Lord.
Peace in heaven
and glory in the highest."
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him,
"Teacher, rebuke your disciples."
He said in reply,
"I tell you, if they keep silent,
the stones will cry out!"
8. After the Gospel, a brief homily may be given. Then, to begin the
Procession, an invitation may be given by a Priest or a Deacon or a lay
minister, in these or similar words:
Imitemur, fratres carissimi, turbas acclamantes Iesum, et procedamus in
pace.
Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
like the crowds who acclaimed Jesus in Jerusalem,
let us go forth in peace.
Or:
Procedamus in pace.
Let us go forth in peace.
In this latter case, all respond:
In nomine Christi. Amen.
In the name of Christ. Amen.
9. The Procession to the church where Mass will be celebrated then sets
off in the usual way. If incense is used, the thurifer goes first,
carrying a thurible with burning incense, then an acolyte or another
minister, carrying a cross decorated with palm branches according to
local custom, between two ministers with lighted candles. Then follow
the Deacon carrying the Book of the Gospels, the Priest with the
ministers, and, after them, all the faithful carrying branches.
As the Procession moves forward, the following or other suitable chants
in honor of Christ the King are sung by the choir and people.
ANTIPHON 1

clamantes et dicentes, Hosanna in excelsis.

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

1. In accordance with a most ancient tradition of the Church, on this
day all Masses without the people are forbidden.
The Chrism Mass
2. The blessing of the Oil of the Sick and of the Oil of Catechumens
and the consecration of the Chrism are carried out by the Bishop,
according to the Rite described in the Roman Pontifical, usually on
this day, at a proper Mass to be celebrated during the morning.
3. If, however, it is very difficult for the clergy and the people to
gather with the Bishop on this day, the Chrism Mass may be anticipated
on another day, but near to Easter.
4. This Mass, which the Bishop concelebrates with his presbyterate,
should be, as it were, a manifestation of the Priests' communion with
their Bishop. Accordingly it is desirable that all the Priests
participate in it, insofar as is possible, and during it receive
Communion even under both kinds. To signify the unity of the
presbyterate of the diocese, the Priests who concelebrate with the
Bishop should be from different regions of the diocese.
5. In accord with traditional practice, the blessing of the Oil of the
Sick takes place before the end of the Eucharistic Prayer, but the
blessing of the Oil of Catechumens and the consecration of the Chrism
take place after Communion. Nevertheless, for pastoral reasons, it is
permitted for the entire rite of blessing to take place after the
Liturgy of the Word.
6. ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Rev 1: 6

8. After the reading of the Gospel, the Bishop preaches the Homily in
which, taking his starting point from the text of the readings
proclaimed in the Liturgy of the Word, he speaks to the people and to
his Priests about priestly anointing, urging the Priests to be faithful
in their office and calling on them to renew publicly their priestly
promises.
Renewal of Priestly Promises
9. After the Homily, the Bishop speaks with the Priests in these or
similar words.
Filii carissimi, annua redeunte memoria diei, qua Christus Dominus
sacerdotium suum cum Apostolis nobisque communicavit, vultis olim
factas promissiones coram Episcopo vestro et populo sancto Dei
renovare? Volo.
Beloved sons,
on the anniversary of that day
when Christ our Lord conferred his priesthood
on his Apostles and on us,
are you resolved to renew
in the presence of your Bishop and God's holy people,
the promises you once made?
The Priests, all together, respond: I am.
Vultis Domino Iesu arctius coniungi et conformari, vobismetipsis
abrenuntiantes atque promissa confirmantes sacrorum officiorum, quae,
Christi amore inducti, erga eius Ecclesiam, sacerdotalis vestrae
ordinationis die, cum gaudio suscepistis? Volo.
Are you resolved to be more united with the Lord Jesus
and more closely conformed to him,
denying yourselves and confirming those promises
about sacred duties towards Christ's Church
which, prompted by love of him,
you willingly and joyfully pledged
on the day of your priestly ordination?
Priests: I am.
Vultis fideles esse dispensatores mysteriorum Dei per sanctam
Eucharistiam ceterasque liturgicas actiones, atque sacrum docendi
munus, Christum Caput atque Pastorem sectando, fideliter implere, non
bonorum cupidi, sed animarum zelo tantum inducti? Volo.
Are you resolved to be faithful stewards of the mysteries of God
in the Holy Eucharist and the other liturgical rites
and to discharge faithfully the sacred office of teaching,
following Christ the Head and Shepherd,
not seeking any gain,
but moved only by zeal for souls?
Priests: I am.
Then, turned towards the people, the Bishop continues:
Vos autem, filii dilectissimi, pro presbyteris vestris orate, ut
Dominus super eos bona sua abundanter effundat, quatenus fideles
ministri Christi, Summi Sacerdotis, vos ad eum perducant, qui fons est
salutis. Christe, audi nos. Christe, exaudi nos.
As for you, dearest sons and daughters,
pray for your Priests,
that the Lord may pour out his gifts abundantly upon them,
and keep them faithful as ministers of Christ, the High Priest,
so that they may lead you to him,
who is the source of salvation.
People: Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.
Et pro me etiam orate, ut fidelis sim muneri apostolico humilitati meae
commisso, et inter vos efficiar viva et perfectior in dies imago
Christi Sacerdotis, Boni Pastoris, Magistri et omnium Servi. Christe,

And pray also for me,

entrusted to me in my lowliness
and that in your midst I may be made day by day

Qui Unigenitum tuum Sancti Spiritus unctione novi et aeterni testamenti
constituisti Pontificem, et ineffabili dignatus es dispositione
sancire, ut unicum eius sacerdotium in Ecclesia servaretur. Ipse enim
non solum regali sacerdotio populum acquisitionis exornat, sed etiam
fraterna homines eligit bonitate, ut sacri sui ministerii fiant manuum
impositione participes. Qui sacrificium renovent, eius nomine,
redemptionis humanae, tuis apparantes filiis paschale convivium, et
plebem tuam sanctam caritate praeveniant, verbo nutriant, reficiant
sacramentis. Qui, vitam pro te fratrumque salute tradentes, ad ipsius
Christi nitantur imaginem conformari, et constanter tibi fidem
amoremque testentur. Unde et nos, Domine, cum Angelis et Sanctis
universis tibi confitemur, in exsultatione dicentes: Sanctus.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
you made your Only Begotten Son
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,
and by your wondrous design were pleased to decree
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.
For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood
the people he has made his own,
but with a brother's kindness he also chooses men
to become sharers in his sacred ministry
through the laying on of hands.
They are to renew in his name
the sacrifice of human redemption,
to set before your children the paschal banquet,
to lead your holy people in charity,
to nourish them with the word
and strengthen them with the Sacraments.
As they give up their lives for you
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

15. The reception of the Holy Oils may take place in individual
parishes either before the celebration of the Evening Mass of the
Lord's Supper or at another time that seems more appropriate.


THE SACRED PASCHAL TRIDUUM


1. In the Sacred Triduum, the Church solemnly celebrates the greatest
mysteries of our redemption, keeping by means of special celebrations
the memorial of her Lord, crucified, buried, and risen.

The Paschal Fast should also be kept sacred. It is to be celebrated
everywhere on the Friday of the Lord's Passion and, where appropriate,
prolonged also through Holy Saturday as a way of coming, with spirit
uplifted, to the joys of the Lord's Resurrection.

2. For a fitting celebration of the Sacred Triduum, a sufficient number
of lay ministers is required, who must be carefully instructed as to
what they are to do. The singing of the people, the ministers, and the
Priest Celebrant has a special importance in the celebrations of these
days, for when texts are sung, they have their proper impact. Pastors
should, therefore, not fail to explain to the Christian faithful, as
best they can, the meaning and order of the celebrations and to prepare
them for active and fruitful participation.

3. The celebrations of the Sacred Triduum are to be carried out in
cathedral and parochial churches and only in those churches in which
they can be performed with dignity, that is, with a good attendance of
the faithful, an appropriate number of ministers, and the means to sing
at least some of the parts. Consequently, it is desirable that small
communities, associations, and special groups of various kinds join
together in these churches to carry out the sacred celebrations in a
more noble manner.

THURSDAY OF THE LORD'S SUPPER

At the Evening Mass
1. The Mass of the Lord's Supper is celebrated in the evening, at a
convenient time, with the full participation of the whole local
community and with all the Priests and ministers exercising their
office.

2. All Priests may concelebrate even if they have already concelebrated
the Chrism Mass on this day, or if they have to celebrate another Mass
for the good of the Christian faithful.

3. Where a pastoral reason requires it, the local Ordinary may permit
another Mass to be celebrated in churches and oratories in the evening
and, in case of genuine necessity, even in the morning, but only for
the faithful who are in no way able to participate in the evening Mass.
Care should, nevertheless, be taken that celebrations of this sort do
not take place for the advantage of private persons or special small
groups, and do not prejudice the evening Mass.

4. Holy Communion may only be distributed to the faithful during Mass;
but it may be brought to the sick at any hour of the day.

5. The altar may be decorated with flowers with a moderation that
accords with the character of this day. The tabernacle should be
entirely empty; but a sufficient amount of bread should be consecrated
in this Mass for the Communion of the clergy and the people on this and
the following day.
6. ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf. Gal 6: 14
Non autem gloriari oportet in cruce Domini nostri Iesu Christi, in quo
est salus, vita et ressurectio nostra, per quem salvati et liberati
sumus.
We should glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
in whom is our salvation, life and resurrection,
through whom we are saved and delivered.
7. The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.
While the hymn is being sung, bells are rung, and when it is finished,
they remain silent until the Gloria in excelsis of the Easter Vigil,
unless, if appropriate, the Diocesan Bishop has decided otherwise.
Likewise, during this same period, the organ and other musical
instruments may be used
only so as to support the singing.
8. COLLECT
Sacratissimam, Deus, frequentantibus Cenam, in qua Unigenitus tuus,

O God, who have called us to participate
in this most sacred Supper,
in which your Only Begotten Son,
when about to hand himself over to death,
entrusted to the Church a sacrifice new for all eternity,
the banquet of his love,
grant, we pray,
that we may draw from so great a mystery,
the fullness of charity and of life.

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever

For he is the true and eternal Priest,
who instituted the pattern of an everlasting sacrifice
and was the first to offer himself as the saving Victim,
commanding us to make this offering as his memorial.

As we eat his flesh that was sacrificed for us,
we are made strong,
and, as we drink his Blood that was poured out for us,
we are washed clean.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
17. When the Roman Canon is used, this special form of it is said, with
proper formulas for the Communicantes (In communion with those), Hanc
igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray), and Qui pridie (On the day before he
was to suffer) are said.
18. The Priest, with hands extended, says:
To you, therefore, most merciful Father,
we make humble prayer and petition
through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord:
He joins his hands and says:
that you accept
He makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice
together, saying:
and bless † these gifts, these offerings,
these holy and unblemished sacrifices,
With hands extended, he continues:
which we offer you firstly
for your holy catholic Church.
Be pleased to grant her peace,
to guard, unite and govern her
throughout the whole world,
together with your servant N. our Pope
and N. our Bishop,
and all those who, holding to the truth,
hand on the catholic and apostolic faith.
19. Commemoration of the Living.
Remember, Lord, your servants N. and N.
The Priest joins his hands and prays briefly for those for whom he
intends to pray. Then, with hands extended, he continues:
and all gathered here,
whose faith and devotion are known to you.
For them we offer you this sacrifice of praise
or they offer it for themselves
and all who are dear to them:
for the redemption of their souls,
in hope of health and well-being,
and paying their homage to you,
the eternal God, living and true.
20. Within the Action.
Celebrating the most sacred day
on which our Lord Jesus Christ
was handed over for our sake,
and in communion with those whose memory we venerate,
especially the glorious ever-Virgin Mary,
Mother of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ,
and † blessed Joseph, her Spouse
your blessed Apostles and Martyrs,
Peter and Paul, Andrew,
(James, John,
Thomas, James, Philip,
Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon and Jude;
Linus, Cletus, Clement, Sixtus,
Cornelius, Cyprian,
Lawrence, Chrysogonus,
John and Paul,
Cosmas and Damian)
and all your Saints;
we ask that through their merits and prayers,
in all things we may be defended
by your protecting help.
(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
21. With hands extended, the Priest continues:
Therefore, Lord, we pray:
graciously accept this oblation of our service,
that of your whole family,
which we make to you
as we observe the day
on which our Lord Jesus Christ
handed on the mysteries of his Body and Blood
for his disciples to celebrate;
order our days in your peace,
and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation
and counted among the flock of those you have chosen.
He joins his hands.
(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
22. Holding his hands extended over the offerings, he says:
Be pleased, O God, we pray,
to bless, acknowledge,
and approve this offering in every respect;
make it spiritual and acceptable,
so that it may become for us
the Body and Blood of your most beloved Son,
our Lord Jesus Christ.
He joins his hands.
23. In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be
pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words
requires.
On the day before he was to suffer
for our salvation and the salvation of all,
that is today,
He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar,
continues:
he took bread in his holy and venerable hands,
He raises his eyes.
and with eyes raised to heaven
to you, O God, his almighty Father,
giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
broke the bread
and gave it to his disciples, saying:
He bows slightly.
TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,
FOR THIS IS MY BODY,
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.
He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the
paten, and genuflects in adoration.
24. After this, the Priest continues:
In a similar way, when supper was ended,
He takes the chalice and, holding it slightly raised above the altar,
continues:
he took this precious chalice
in his holy and venerable hands,
and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
He bows slightly.
TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,
FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD,
THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT,
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY
FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.
DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.
He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and
genuflects in adoration.
25. Then he says:
The mystery of faith.
And the people continue, acclaiming:
We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
Or:
When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
Or:
Save us, Savior of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free.
26. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says:
Therefore, O Lord,
as we celebrate the memorial of the blessed Passion,
the Resurrection from the dead,
and the glorious Ascension into heaven
of Christ, your Son, our Lord,
we, your servants and your holy people,
offer to your glorious majesty
from the gifts that you have given us,
this pure victim,
this holy victim,
this spotless victim,
the holy Bread of eternal life
and the Chalice of everlasting salvation.
27. Be pleased to look upon these offerings
with a serene and kindly countenance,
and to accept them,
as once you were pleased to accept
the gifts of your servant Abel the just,
the sacrifice of Abraham, our father in faith,
and the offering of your high priest Melchizedek,
a holy sacrifice, a spotless victim.
28. Bowing, with hands joined, he continues:
In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God:
command that these gifts be borne
by the hands of your holy Angel
to your altar on high
in the sight of your divine majesty,
so that all of us, who through this participation at the altar receive
the most holy Body and Blood of your Son,
He stands upright and signs himself with the Sign of the Cross, saying:
may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing.
He joins his hands.
(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
29. Commemoration of the Dead
With hands extended, the Priest says:
Remember also, Lord, your servants N. and N.,
who have gone before us with the sign of faith
and rest in the sleep of peace.
He joins his hands and prays briefly for those who have died and for
whom he intends to pray.
Then, with hands extended he continues:
Grant them, O Lord, we pray,
and all who sleep in Christ,
a place of refreshment, light and peace.
He joins his hands.
(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
30. He strikes his breast with his right hand, saying:
To us, also, your servants, who, though sinners,
And, with hands extended he continues:
hope in your abundant mercies,
graciously grant some share
and fellowship with your holy Apostles and Martyrs:
with John the Baptist, Stephen,
Matthias, Barnabas,
(Ignatius, Alexander,
Marcellinus, Peter,
Felicity, Perpetua,
Agatha, Lucy,
Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia)
and all your Saints;
admit us, we beseech you,
into their company,
not weighing our merits,
but granting us your pardon,
He joins his hands.
through Christ our Lord.
31. And he continues:
Through whom
you continue to make all these good things, O Lord;
you sanctify them, fill them with life,
bless them, and bestow them upon us.
32. He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, elevating
both, he says:
Through him, and with him, and in him,
to you, O God, almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
is all honor and glory,
for ever and ever.
The people acclaim:
Amen.
Then follows the Communion Rite.
33. At an appropriate moment during Communion, the Priest entrusts the
Eucharist from the table of the altar to Deacons or acolytes or other
extraordinary ministers, so that afterwards it may be brought to the
sick who are to receive Holy Communion at home.
34. COMMUNION ANTIPHON           1 Cor 11: 24-25
Hoc Corpus, quod pro vobis tradetur: hic calix novi testamenti est in
meo Sanguine, dicit Dominus; hoc facite, quotiescumque sumitis, in meam
commemorationem.
This is the Body that will be given up for you;
this is the Chalice of the new covenant in my Blood, says the Lord;
do this, whenever you receive it, in memory of me.
35. After the distribution of Communion, a ciborium with hosts for
Communion on the following day is left on the altar. The Priest,
standing at the chair, says the Prayer after Communion.
36. PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Concede nobis, omnipotens Deus, ut, sicut Cena Filii tui reficimur
temporali, ita satiari mereamur aeterna.
Grant, almighty God,
that, just as we are renewed
by the Supper of your Son in this present age,
so we may enjoy his banquet for all eternity.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
The Transfer of the Most Blessed Sacrament
37. After the Prayer After Communion the Priest puts incense in the
thurible while standing, blesses it and then, kneeling, incenses the
Blessed Sacrament three times. Then, having put on a white humeral
veil, he rises, takes the ciborium, and covers it with the ends of the
veil.

38. A procession is formed in which the Blessed Sacrament, accompanied
by torches and incense, is carried through the church to a place of
repose prepared in a part of the church or in a chapel suitably
decorated. A lay minister with a cross, standing between two other
ministers with lighted candles leads off. Others carrying lighted
candles follow. Before the Priest carrying the Blessed Sacrament comes
the thurifer with a smoking thurible. Meanwhile, the hymn Pange, lingua
(exclusive of the last two stanzas) or another eucharistic chant is
sung.

Of the glorious Body telling,
O my tongue, its mysteries sing,
and the Blood, all price excelling,
which the world's eternal King,
in a noble womb once dwelling
shed for the world's ransoming.

Given for us, descending,
of a Virgin to proceed,
man with man in converse blending,
scattered he the Gospel seed,
till his sojourn drew to ending,
which he closed in wondrous deed.

At the last great Supper lying
circled by his brethren's band,
meekly with the law complying,
first he finished its command
then, immortal Food supplying,
gave himself with his own hand.

Word made Flesh, by word he maketh
very bread his Flesh to be;
man in wine Christ's Blood partaketh:
and if senses fail to see,
faith alone the true heart waketh
to behold the mystery.
Pange, lingua, gloriosi
Corporis mysterium,
Sanguinisque pretiosi,
quem in mundi pretium
fructus ventris generosi
Rex effudit Gentium.

Nobis datus, nobis natus
ex intacta Virgine,
et in mundo conversatus,
sparso verbi semine,
sui moras incolatus
miro clausit ordine.

In supremae nocte coenae
recumbens cum fratribus
observata lege plene
cibis in legalibus,
cibum turbae duodenae
se dat suis manibus.

Verbum caro, panem verum
verbo carnem efficit:
fitque sanguis Christi merum,
et si sensus deficit,
ad firmandum cor sincerum
sola fides sufficit.

39. When the procession reaches the place of repose, the Priest, with
the help of the Deacon if necessary, places the ciborium in the
tabernacle, the door of which remains open. Then he puts incense in the
thurible and, kneeling, incenses the Blessed Sacrament, while Tantum
ergo Sacramentum or another eucharistic chant is sung. Then the Deacon
or the Priest himself places the Sacrament in the tabernacle and closes
the door.

40. After a period of adoration in silence, the Priest and ministers
genuflect and return to the sacristy.

Therefore we, before him bending,
this great Sacrament revere;
types and shadows have their ending,
for the newer rite is here;
faith, our outward sense befriending,
makes the inward vision clear.

Glory let us give, and blessing
to the Father and the Son;
honor, might and praise addressing,
while eternal ages run;
ever too his love confessing,
who, from both, with both is one.
Verbum caro, panem verum
verbo carnem efficit:
fitque sanguis Christi merum,
et si sensus deficit,
ad firmandum cor sincerum
sola fides sufficit.

Tantum ergo Sacramentum
veneremur cernui:
et antiquum documentum
novo cedat ritui:
praestet fides supplementum
sensuum defectui.

41. At an appropriate time, the altar is stripped and, if possible, the
crosses are removed from the church. It is expedient that any crosses
which remain in the church be veiled.

42. Vespers (Evening Prayer) is not celebrated by those who have
attended the Mass of the Lord's Supper.

43. The faithful are invited to continue adoration before the Blessed
Sacrament for a suitable length of time during the night, according to
local circumstances, but after midnight the adoration should take place
without solemnity.

44. If the celebration of the Passion of the Lord on the following
Friday does not take place in the same church, the Mass is concluded in
the usual way and the Blessed Sacrament is placed in the tabernacle.

FRIDAY OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD
[GOOD FRIDAY]



Liturgy of the Word



Solemn Intercessions



Adoration of the Cross



Holy Communion

1. On this and the following day, by a most ancient tradition, the
Church does not celebrate the Sacraments at all, except for Penance and
the Anointing of the Sick.
2. On this day, Holy Communion is distributed to the faithful only
within the celebration of the Lord's Passion; but it may be brought at
any hour of the day to the sick who cannot participate in this
celebration.
3. The altar should be completely bare: without a cross, without
candles and without cloths.
The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord
4. On the afternoon of this day, about three o'clock (unless a later
hour is chosen for a pastoral reason), there takes place the
celebration of the Lord's Passion consisting of three parts, namely,
the Liturgy of the Word, the Adoration of the Cross, and Holy
Communion.
In the United States, if the size or nature of a parish or other
community indicates the pastoral need for an additional liturgical
service, the Diocesan Bishop may permit the service to be repeated
later. This liturgy by its very nature may not, however, be celebrated
in the absence of a Priest.
5. The Priest and the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, wearing red
vestments as for Mass, go to the altar in silence and, after making a
reverence to the altar, prostrate themselves or, if appropriate, kneel
and pray in silence for a while. All others kneel.
6. Then the Priest, with the ministers, goes to the chair where, facing
the people, who are standing, he says, with hands extended, one of the
following prayers, omitting the invitation Let us pray.
PRAYER
Reminiscere miserationum tuarum, Domine, et famulos tuos aeterna
protectione sanctifica, pro quibus Christus, Filius tuus, per suum
cruorem instituit paschale mysterium.
Remember your mercies, O Lord,
and with your eternal protection sanctify your servants,
for whom Christ your Son,
by the shedding of his Blood,
established the Paschal Mystery.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or:
Deus, qui peccati veteris hereditariam mortem, in qua posteritatis
genus omne successerat, Christi Filii tui, Domini nostri, passione
solvisti, da, ut conformes eidem facti, sicut imaginem terreni hominis
naturae necessitate portavimus, ita imaginem caelestis gratiae
sanctificatione portemus.
O God, who by the Passion of Christ your Son, our Lord,
abolished the death inherited from ancient sin
by every succeeding generation,
grant that just as, being conformed to him,
we have borne by the law of nature
the image of the man of earth,
so by the sanctification of grace
we may bear the image of the Man of heaven.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

R. Father, into your hands, I commend my spirit.
Pater, in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum.

Because of this, God greatly exalted him and bestowed on him
the name which is above every other name. - Phil 2:8-9
John 18:1-19:42

After the reading of the Lord's Passion, the Priest gives a brief
homily and, at its end, the faithful may be invited to spend a short
time in prayer.
THE SOLEMN INTERCESSIONS
11. The Liturgy of the Word concludes with the Solemn Intercessions,
which take place in this way: the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, or if
he is not, a lay minister, stands at the ambo, and sings or says the
invitation in which the intention is expressed. Then all pray in
silence for a while, and afterwards the Priest, standing at the chair
or, if appropriate, at the altar, with hands extended, sings or says
the prayer.
The faithful may remain either kneeling or standing throughout the
entire period of the prayers.
12. Before the Priest's prayer, in accord with tradition, it is
permissible to use the Deacon's invitations Let us kneel - Let us
stand, with all kneeling for silent prayer.
The Conferences of Bishops may provide other invitations to introduce
the prayer of the Priest.
13. In a situation of grave public need, the Diocesan Bishop may permit
or order the addition of a special intention.
I. For Holy Church
The prayer is sung in the simple tone or, if the invitations Let us
kneel - Let us stand are used, in the solemn tone.
Oremus, dilectissimi nobis, pro Ecclesia sancta Dei, ut eam Deus et
Dominus noster pacificare, adunare et custodire dignetur toto orbe
terrarum, detque nobis, quietam et tranquillam vitam degentibus,
glorificare Deum Patrem omnipotentem.
Let us pray, dearly beloved, for the holy Church of God,
that our God and Lord be pleased to give her peace,
to guard her and to unite her throughout the whole world
and grant that, leading our life in tranquility and quiet,
we may glorify God the Father almighty.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui gloriam tuam omnibus in Christo
gentibus revelasti: custodi opera misericordiae tuae, ut Ecclesia tua,
toto orbe diffusa, stabili fide in confessione tui nominis perseveret.
Almighty ever-living God,
who in Christ revealed your glory to all the nations,
watch over the works of your mercy,
that your Church, spread throughout all the world,
may persevere with steadfast faith in confessing your name.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
II. For the Pope
Oremus et pro beatissimo Papa nostro N., ut Deus et Dominus noster, qui
elegit eum in ordine episcopatus, salvum atque incolumem custodiat
Ecclesiae suae sanctae, ad regendum populum sanctum Dei.
Let us pray also for our most Holy Father Pope N.,
that our God and Lord,
who chose him for the Order of Bishops,
may keep him safe and unharmed for the Lord's holy Church,
to govern the holy People of God.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, cuius iudicio universa fundantur, respice
propitius ad preces nostras, et electum nobis Antistitem tua pietate
conserva, ut christiana plebs, quae te gubernatur auctore, sub ipso
Pontifice, fidei suae meritis augeatur.
Almighty ever-living God,
by whose decree all things are founded,
look with favor on our prayers

that, under him, the Christian people,
governed by you their maker,
may grow in merit by reason of their faith.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
III. For all orders and degrees of the faithful
Oremus et pro Episcopo nostro, pro omnibus Episcopis, presbyteris,
diaconis Ecclesiae, et universa plebe fidelium.
Let us pray also for our Bishop N.,
for all Bishops, Priests, and Deacons of the Church
and for the whole of the faithful people.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, cuius Spiritu totum corpus Ecclesiae
sanctificatur et regitur, exaudi nos pro ministris tuis supplicantes,
ut, gratiae tuae munere, ab omnibus tibi fideliter serviatur.
Almighty ever-living God,
by whose Spirit the whole body of the Church
is sanctified and governed,
hear our humble prayer for your ministers,
that, by the gift of your grace,
all may serve you faithfully.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
IV. For catechumens
Oremus et pro catechumenis (nostris), ut Deus et Dominus noster
adaperiat aures praecordiorum ipsorum ianuamque misericordiae, ut, per
lavacrum regenerationis accepta remissione omnium peccatorum, et ipsi
inveniantur in Christo Iesu Domino nostro.
Let us pray also for (our) catechumens,
that our God and Lord
may open wide the ears of their inmost hearts
and unlock the gates of his mercy,
that, having received forgiveness of all their sins
through the waters of rebirth,
they, too, may be one with Christ Jesus our Lord.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui Ecclesiam tuam nova semper prole
fecundas, auge fidem et intellectum catechumenis (nostris), ut, renati
fonte baptismatis, adoptionis tuae filiis aggregentur.
Almighty ever-living God,
who make your Church ever fruitful with new offspring,
increase the faith and understanding of (our) catechumens,
that, reborn in the font of Baptism,
they may be added to the number of your adopted children.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
V. For the unity of Christians
Oremus et pro universis fratribus in Christum credentibus, ut Deus et
Dominus noster eos, veritatem facientes, in una Ecclesia sua congregare
et custodire dignetur.
Let us pray also for all our brothers and sisters who believe in
Christ,
that our God and Lord may be pleased,
as they live the truth,
to gather them together and keep them in his one Church.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui dispersa congregas et congregata
conservas, ad gregem Filii tui placatus intende, ut, quos unum baptisma
sacravit, eos et fidei iungat integritas et vinculum societ caritatis.
Almighty ever-living God,
who gather what is scattered
and keep together what you have gathered,
look kindly on the flock of your Son,
that those whom one Baptism has consecrated
may be joined together by integrity of faith
and united in the bond of charity.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
VI. For the Jewish people
Oremus et pro Iudaeis, ut, ad quos prius locutus est Dominus Deus
noster, eis tribuat in sui nominis amore et in sui foederis fidelitate
proficere.
Let us pray also for the Jewish people,
to whom the Lord our God spoke first,
that he may grant them to advance in love of his name
and in faithfulness to his covenant.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui promissiones tuas Abrahae eiusque
semini contulisti, Ecclesiae tuae preces clementer exaudi, ut populus
acquisitionis prioris ad redemptionis mereatur plenitudinem pervenire.
Almighty ever-living God,
who bestowed your promises on Abraham and his descendants,
hear graciously the prayers of your Church,

illustrati, viam salutis et ipsi valeant introire.
Let us pray also for those who do not believe in Christ,
that, enlightened by the Holy Spirit,
they, too, may enter on the way of salvation.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:

te sincero corde ambulantes, inveniant veritatem, nosque, mutuo
proficientes semper amore et ad tuae vitae mysterium plenius
percipiendum sollicitos, perfectiores effice tuae testes caritatis in
mundo.
Almighty ever-living God,
grant to those who do not confess Christ
that, by walking before you with a sincere heart,
they may find the truth
and that we ourselves, being constant in mutual love
and striving to understand more fully the mystery of your life,
may be made more perfect witnesses to your love in the world.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
VIII. For those who do not believe in God
Oremus et pro iis qui Deum non agnoscunt, ut, quae recta sunt sincero
corde sectantes, ad ipsum Deum pervenire mereantur.
Let us pray also for those who do not acknowledge God,
that, following what is right in sincerity of heart,
they may find the way to God himself.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui cunctos homines condidisti, ut te
semper desiderando quaererent et inveniendo quiescerent, praesta,
quaesumus, ut inter noxia quaeque obstacula omnes, tuae signa pietatis
et in te credentium testimonium bonorum operum percipientes, te solum
verum Deum nostrique generis Patrem gaudeant confiteri.
Almighty ever-living God,
who created all people
to seek you always by desiring you
and, by finding you, come to rest,
grant, we pray,
that, despite every harmful obstacle,
all may recognize the signs of your fatherly love
and the witness of the good works
done by those who believe in you,
and so in gladness confess you,
the one true God and Father of our human race.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
IX. For those in public office

noster mentes et corda eorum secundum voluntatem suam dirigat ad veram
omnium pacem et libertatem.
Let us pray also for those in public office,
that our God and Lord
may direct their minds and hearts according to his will
for the true peace and freedom of all.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:

populorum, respice benignus ad eos, qui nos in potestate moderantur, ut
ubique terrarum populorum prosperitas, pacis securitas et religionis
libertas, te largiente, consistant.
Almighty ever-living God,
in whose hand lies every human heart
and the rights of peoples,
look with favor, we pray,
on those who govern with authority over us,
that throughout the whole world,
the prosperity of peoples,
the assurance of peace,
and freedom of religion
may through your gift be made secure.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
X. For those in tribulation
Oremus, dilectissimi nobis, Deum Patrem omnipotentem, ut cunctis mundo
purget erroribus, morbos auferat, famem depellat, aperiat carceres,
vincula solvat, viatoribus securitatem, peregrinantibus reditum,
infirmantibus sanitatem atque morientibus salutem indulgeat.
Let us pray, dearly beloved,
to God the Father almighty,
that he may cleanse the world of all errors,
banish disease, drive out hunger,
unlock prisons, loosen fetters,
granting to travelers safety, to pilgrims return,
health to the sick, and salvation to the dying.
Prayer in silence. Then the Priest says:
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, maestorum consolatio, laborantium
fortitudo, perveniant ad te preces de quacumque tribulatione
clamantium, ut omnes sibi in necessitatibus suis misericordiam tuam
gaudeant affuisse.
Almighty ever-living God,
comfort of mourners, strength of all who toil,
may the prayers of those who cry out in any tribulation
come before you,
that all may rejoice,
because in their hour of need
your mercy was at hand.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
SECOND PART: THE ADORATION OF THE HOLY CROSS
14. After the Solemn Intercessions, the solemn Adoration of the Holy
Cross takes place. Of the two forms of the showing of the Cross
presented here, the more appropriate one, according to pastoral needs,
should be chosen.

The Showing of the Holy Cross
First Form

15. The Deacon accompanied by ministers, or another suitable minister,
goes to the sacristy, from which, in procession, accompanied by two
ministers with lighted candles, he carries the Cross, covered with a
violet veil, through the church to the middle of the sanctuary.
The Priest, standing before the altar and facing the people, receives
the Cross, uncovers a little of its upper part and elevates it while
beginning the Ecce lignum Crucis (Behold the wood of the Cross). He is
assisted in singing by the Deacon or, if need be, by the choir. All
respond, Come, let us adore. At the end of the singing, all kneel and
for a brief moment adore in silence, while the Priest stands and holds
the Cross raised.
Ecce lignum Crucis, in quo salus mundi pependit.
Behold the wood of the Cross,
on which hung the salvation of the world.
R. Come, let us adore. Or: Venite, adoremus
Then the Priest uncovers the right arm of the Cross and again, raising
up the Cross, begins, Behold the wood of the Cross and everything takes
place as above.
Finally, he uncovers the Cross entirely and, raising it up, he begins
the invitation Behold the wood of the Cross a third time and everything
takes place like the first time.

Second Form

16. The Priest or the Deacon accompanied by ministers, or another
suitable minister, goes to the door of the church, where he receives
the unveiled Cross, and the ministers take lighted candles; then the
procession sets off through the church to the sanctuary. Near the door,
in the middle of the church and before the entrance of the sanctuary,
the one who carries the Cross elevates it, singing, Behold the wood of
the Cross, to which all respond, Come, let us adore. After each
response all kneel and for a brief moment adore in silence, as above.
The Adoration of the Holy Cross
17. Then, accompanied by two ministers with lighted candles, the Priest
or the Deacon carries the Cross to the entrance of the sanctuary or to
another suitable place and there puts it down or hands it over to the
ministers to hold. Candles are placed on the right and left sides of
the Cross.
18. For the Adoration of the Cross, first the Priest Celebrant alone
approaches, with the chasuble and his shoes removed, if appropriate.
Then the clergy, the lay ministers, and the faithful approach, moving
as if in procession, and showing reverence to the Cross by a simple
genuflection or by some other sign appropriate to the usage of the
region, for example, by kissing the Cross.
19. Only one Cross should be offered for adoration. If, because of the
large number of people, it is not possible for all to approach
individually, the Priest, after some of the clergy and faithful have
adored, takes the Cross and, standing in the middle before the altar,
invites the people in a few words to adore the Holy Cross and
afterwards holds the Cross elevated higher for a brief time, for the
faithful to adore it in silence.
20. While the adoration of the Holy Cross is taking place, the antiphon
Crucem tuam adoramus (We adore your Cross, O Lord), the Reproaches, the
hymn Crux fidelis (Faithful Cross) or other suitable chants are sung,
during which all who have already adored the Cross remain seated.

Chants to Be Sung during the Adoration of the Holy Cross

et glorificamus: ecce enim propter lignum venit gaudium in universo
mundo.
We adore your Cross, O Lord,
we praise and glorify your holy Resurrection,

flagellatum tradidisti. Popule meus, quid feci tibi? Aut in quo

Pharaone in Mare Rubrum: et tu me tradidisti principibus sacerdotum.
Ego ante te aperui mare: et tu aperuisti lancea latus meum. Ego ante te

propter te Chananaeorum reges percussi: et tu percussisti arundine

spineam coronam. Ego te exaltavi magna virtute: et tu me suspendisti in
patibulo Crucis.

Hymn

All:
Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.
Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!

Cantors:
Sing, my tongue, in exultation
Of our banner and device!
Make a solemn proclamation
Of a triumph and its price:
How the Savior of creation
Conquered by his sacrifice!

All:
Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.

Cantors:
For, when Adam first offended,
Eating that forbidden fruit,
Not all hopes of glory ended
With the serpent at the root:
Broken nature would be mended
By a second tree and shoot.

All:
Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!

Cantors:
Thus the tempter was outwitted
By a wisdom deeper still:
Remedy and ailment fitted,
Means to cure and means to kill;
That the world might be acquitted,
Christ would do his Father's will

All:
Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.

Cantors:
So the Father, out of pity
For our self-inflicted doom,
Sent him from the heavenly city
When the holy time had come:
He, the Son and the Almighty,
Took our flesh in Mary's womb.

All:
Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!

Cantors:
Hear a tiny baby crying,
Founder of the seas and strands;
See his virgin Mother tying
Cloth around his feet and hands;
Find him in a manger lying
Tightly wrapped in swaddling-bands!

All:
Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.

Cantors:
So he came, the long-expected,
Not in glory, not to reign;
Only born to be rejected,
Choosing hunger, toil and pain,
Till the scaffold was erected
And the Paschal Lamb was slain.

All:
Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!

Cantors:
No disgrace was too abhorrent:
Nailed and mocked and parched he died;
Blood and water, double warrant,
Issue from his wounded side,
Washing in a mighty torrent
Earth and stars and oceantide.

All:
Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.

Cantors:
Lofty timber, smooth your roughness,
Flex your boughs for blossoming;
Let your fibers lose their toughness,
Gently let your tendrils cling;
Lay aside your native gruffness,
Clasp the body of your King!

All:
Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!

Cantors:
Noblest tree of all created,
Richly jeweled and embossed:
Post by Lamb's blood consecrated;
Spar that saves the tempest-tossed;
Scaffold-beam which, elevated,
Carries what the world has cost!

All:
Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.

The following conclusion is never to be omitted:

All:
Wisdom, power, and adoration
To the blessed Trinity
For redemption and salvation
Through the Paschal Mystery,
Now, in every generation,
And for all eternity. Amen.
All:

passioni deditus,
agnus in crucis levatur
immolandus stipite.

All:
Dulce lignum dulci clavo
dulce pondus sustinens!

Cantors:
En acetum, fel, arundo,

Cantors:
Flecte ramos, arbor alta,
tensa laxa viscera,
Et rigor lentescat ille,
quem dedit nativitas,
Ut superni membra Regis
miti tendas stipite.

All:
Dulce lignum dulci clavo
dulce pondus sustinens!

Cantors:
Sola digna tu fuisti
ferre saecli pretium
Atque portum praeparare
nauta mundo naufrago,
Quem sacer cruor perunxit
fusus Agni corpore.

All:
Crux fidelis, inter omnes
arbor una nobilis,
Nulla talem silva profert,
flore, fronde, germine!

The following conclusion is never to be omitted:

All:
Aequa Patri Filioque,
inclito Paraclito,
Sempiterna sit beatae
Trinitati gloria;
cuius alma nos redemit
atque servat gratia. Amen.

In accordance with local circumstances or popular traditions and if it
is pastorally appropriate, the Stabat Mater may be sung, as found in
the Graduale Romanum, or another suitable chant in memory of the
compassion of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
21. When the adoration has been concluded, the Cross is carried by the
Deacon or a minister to its place at the altar. Lighted candles are
placed around or on the altar or near the Cross.
THIRD PART: HOLY COMMUNION
22. A cloth is spread on the altar, and a corporal and the Missal put
in place. Meanwhile the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest
himself, putting on a humeral veil, brings the Blessed Sacrament back
from the place of repose to the altar by a shorter route, while all
stand in silence. Two ministers with lighted candles accompany the
Blessed Sacrament and place their candlesticks around or upon the
altar.
When the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, has placed the Blessed
Sacrament upon the altar and uncovered the ciborium, the Priest goes to
the altar and genuflects.
23. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says aloud:
Praeceptis salutaribus moniti, et divina institutione formati, audemus
dicere:
At the Savior's command
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:
The Priest, with hands extended says, and all present continue:
Pater noster, qui es in caelis: sanctificetur nomen tuum; adveniat
regnum tuum; fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo, et in terra. Panem
nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie; et dimitte nobis debita nostra,
sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris; et ne nos inducas in
tentationem; sed libera nos a malo.
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
24. With hands extended, the Priest continues alone:
Libera nos, quaesumus, Domine, ab omnibus malis, da propitius pacem in
diebus nostris, ut, ope misericordiae tuae adiuti, et a peccato simus
semper liberi et ab omni perturbatione securi: exspectantes beatam spem
et adventum Salvatoris nostri Iesu Christi. Quia tuum est regnum, et
potestas, et gloria in saecula.
Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,
that, by the help of your mercy,
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,
as we await the blessed hope
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
He joins his hands.
The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming:
For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours now and for ever.
25. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly:
Perceptio Corporis tui, Domine Iesu Christe, non mihi proveniat in
iudicium et condemnationem: sed pro tua pietate prosit mihi ad
tutamentum mentis et corporis, et ad medelam percipiendam.
May the receiving of your Body and Blood,
Lord Jesus Christ,
not bring me to judgment and condemnation,
but through your loving mercy
be for me protection in mind and body
and a healing remedy.
26. The Priest then genuflects, takes a particle, and, holding it
slightly raised over the ciborium, while facing the people, says aloud:
Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi. Beati qui ad cenam Agni
vocati sunt.
Behold the Lamb of God,
behold him who takes away the sins of the world.
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.
And together with the people he adds once:
Domine, non sum dignus, ut intres sub tectum meum, sed tantum dic
verbo, et sanabitur anima mea.
Lord, I am not worthy
that you should enter under my roof,
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.
27. And facing the altar, he reverently consumes the Body of Christ,
saying quietly: May the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life.
28. He then proceeds to distribute Communion to the faithful. During
Communion, Psalm 22 (21) or another appropriate chant may be sung.
29. When the distribution of Communion has been completed, the ciborium
is taken by the Deacon or another suitable minister to a place prepared
outside the church or, if circumstances so require, it is placed in the
tabernacle.
30. Then the Priest says: Let us pray, and, after a period of sacred
silence, if circumstances so suggest, has been observed, he says the
Prayer after Communion.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION.
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui nos Christi tui beata morte et
resurrectione reparasti, conserva in nobis opus misericordiae tuae, ut
huius mysterii participatione perpetua devotione vivamus.
Almighty ever-living God,
who have restored us to life
by the blessed Death and Resurrection of your Christ,
preserve in us the work of your mercy,
that, by partaking of this mystery,
we may have a life unceasingly devoted to you.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
31. For the Dismissal the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest
himself, may say the invitation Bow down for the blessing.
Then the Priest, standing facing the people and extending his hands
over them, says this Prayer over the People:

PRAYER OVER THE PEOPLE
Super populum tuum, quaesumus, Domine, qui mortem Filii tui in spe suae
resurrectionis recoluit, benedictio copiosa descendat, indulgentia
veniat, consolatio tribuatur, fides sancta succrescat, redemptio
sempiterna firmetur.
May abundant blessing, O Lord, we pray,
descend upon your people,
who have honored the Death of your Son
in the hope of their resurrection:
may pardon come,
comfort be given,
holy faith increase,
and everlasting redemption be made secure.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
32. And all, after genuflecting to the Cross, depart in silence.
33. After the celebration, the altar is stripped, but the Cross remains
on the altar with two or four candlesticks.
34. Vespers (Evening Prayer) is not celebrated by those who have been
present at the solemn afternoon liturgical celebration.

HOLY SATURDAY

1. On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and
fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into
Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.
2. The Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred
table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the
anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for
paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.
3. Holy Communion may only be given on this day as Viaticum.
