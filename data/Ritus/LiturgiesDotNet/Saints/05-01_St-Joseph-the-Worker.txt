Eucharistic Readings

2 Samuel 7:4,8-16

But that same night the word of the LORD came to Nathan: Now therefore
thus you shall say to my servant David: Thus says the LORD of hosts: I
took you from the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over
my people Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have
cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a
great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will
appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, so that they
may live in their own place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers
shall afflict them no more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed
judges over my people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your
enemies. Moreover, the LORD declares to you that the LORD will make you
a house. When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your
ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come
forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build
a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for
ever. I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. When he
commits iniquity, I will punish him with a rod such as mortals use,
with blows inflicted by human beings. But I will not take my steadfast
love from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you.
Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me; your
throne shall be established for ever.

Romans 4:13-18

For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham
or to his descendants through the law but through the righteousness of
faith. If it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith
is null and the promise is void. For the law brings wrath; but where
there is no law, neither is there violation. For this reason it depends
on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed
to all his descendants, not only to the adherents of the law but also
to those who share the faith of Abraham (for he is the father of all of
us, as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) —in
the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead
and calls into existence the things that do not exist. Hoping against
hope, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,”
according to what was said, “So numerous shall your descendants be.”

Psalm 89:1-29 or 89:1-4, 26-29

1 Lord, I will sing for ever of your loving-kindnesses *
my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness throughout all
generations.
2 I have said of your loving-kindness that it is built for ever *
you have established your faithfulness in the heavens.
3 The Lord said ‘I have made a covenant with my chosen *
I have sworn an oath to my servant David.
4 ‘I will establish your line for ever *
and build up your throne for all generations.’
[5 Let the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord *
and let your faithfulness be sung in the assembly of the holy
ones.
6 For who amidst the clouds can be compared to the Lord *
or who is like the Lord among the sons of heaven?
7 A God to be feared in the council of the holy ones *
great and terrible above all that are around him.
8 O Lord God of hosts, who is like you? *
your power and your faithfulness are all about you.
9 You rule the raging of the sea *
when its waves surge, you still them.
10 You crushed Rahab like a carcase *
you scattered your enemies by your mighty arm.
11 The heavens are yours, so also is the earth *
you founded the world and all that is in it.
12 You created the north and the south *
Tabor and Mount Hermon shall sing of your name.
13 Mighty is your arm *
strong is your hand, and your right hand is lifted high.
14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne *
loving-kindness and faithfulness attend your presence.
15 Happy the people who know the triumphal shout *
who walk, O Lord, in the light of your countenance.
16 They rejoice all the day long because of your name *
because of your righteousness they are exalted.
17 For you are their glory and their strength *
and our heads are uplifted by your favour.
18 Our king belongs to the Lord *
he that rules over us to the Holy One of Israel.
19 You spoke once in a vision *
and said to your faithful one,
20 ‘I have set a youth above a warrior *
I have exalted a young man out of the people.
21 ‘I have found my servant David *
and anointed him with my holy oil.
22 ‘My hand shall uphold him *
and my arm shall strengthen him.
23 ‘No enemy shall deceive him *
no evil man shall hurt him.
24 ‘I will crush his adversaries before him *
and strike down those that hate him.
25 ‘My faithfulness and loving-kindness shall be with him *
and through my name his head shall be lifted high.]
26 ‘I will set the hand of his dominion upon the Western Sea *
and his right hand shall stretch to the streams of Mesopotamia.
27 ‘He will call to me “You are my Father *
my God, and the Rock of my salvation.”
28 ‘I will make him my first-born son *
and highest among the kings of the earth.
29 ‘I will ever maintain my loving-kindness toward him *
and my covenant with him shall stand firm.

Luke 2:41-52

Now every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the
Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for
the festival. When the festival was ended and they started to return,
the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know
it. Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day’s
journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and
friends. When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to
search for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting
among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And
all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to
him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I
have been searching for you in great anxiety.” He said to them, “Why
were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my
Father’s house?” But they did not understand what he said to them. Then
he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them.
His mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased
in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favor.

Morning Prayer

Psalm 132

1  Lord, remember David and all his trouble *
how he swore an oath to the Lord,
and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob;
2  I will not enter the shelter of my house *
nor climb into the comfort of my bed; 3  I will not give sleep to my
eyes *
or slumber to my eyelids, 4  Till I find out a place for the ark of
the Lord *
a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob. 5  Lo, we heard of it at
Ephrathah *
we found it in the fields of Ja-ar. 6  Let us go to the place of his
dwelling *
let us fall upon our knees before his footstool. 7  Arise, O Lord,
into your resting-place *
you, and the ark of your might. 8  Let your priests be clothed with
righteousness *
and let your faithful ones shout for joy. 9  For the sake of David
your servant *
do not turn away the face of your anointed. 10  The Lord has sworn to
David *
an oath which he will not break; 11  One who is the fruit of your
body *
I will set upon your throne. 12  If your children will keep my
covenant
and the commands which I teach them *
their children also shall sit upon your throne for ever. 13  For the
Lord has chosen Zion for himself *
he has desired it for his habitation. 14  This shall be my
resting-place for ever *
here will I dwell, for my delight is in her. 15  I will bless her
provisions with abundance *
I will satisfy her poor with bread. 16  I will clothe her priests
with salvation *
and her faithful ones shall shout for joy. 17  There will I make a
horn to sprout for the family of David *
I have prepared a lamp for my anointed. 18  As for his enemies, I
will cover them with shame *
but upon his head shall his crown be bright.

Isaiah 63:7-16

I will recount the gracious deeds of the Lord,
the praiseworthy acts of the Lord,
because of all that the Lord has done for us,
and the great favour to the house of Israel
that he has shown them according to his mercy,
according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
For he said, ‘Surely they are my people,
children who will not deal falsely’;
and he became their saviour
in all their distress.
It was no messenger or angel
but his presence that saved them;
in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;
he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
But they rebelled
and grieved his holy spirit;
therefore he became their enemy;
he himself fought against them.
Then they remembered the days of old,
of Moses his servant.
Where is the one who brought them up out of the sea
with the shepherds of his flock?
Where is the one who put within them
his holy spirit,
who caused his glorious arm
to march at the right hand of Moses,
who divided the waters before them
to make for himself an everlasting name,
who led them through the depths?
Like a horse in the desert,
they did not stumble.
Like cattle that go down into the valley,
the spirit of the Lord gave them rest.
Thus you led your people,
to make for yourself a glorious name.
Look down from heaven and see,
from your holy and glorious habitation.
Where are your zeal and your might?
The yearning of your heart and your compassion?
They are withheld from me.
For you are our father,
though Abraham does not know us
and Israel does not acknowledge us;
you, O Lord, are our father;
our Redeemer from of old is your name.

Matthew 1:18-25

Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his
mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together,
she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband
Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public
disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved
to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
“Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for
the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a
son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from
their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the
Lord through the prophet: “Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a
son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,” which means, “God is with us.”
When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded
him; he took her as his wife, but had no marital relations with her
until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.

Evening Prayer

Psalm 34

1  I will bless the Lord continually *
his praise shall be always in my mouth.
2  Let my soul boast of the Lord *
the humble shall hear it and rejoice. 3  O praise the Lord with me *
let us exalt his name together. 4  For I sought the Lords help and he
answered *
and he freed me from all my fears. 5  Look towards him and be bright
with joy *
your faces shall not be ashamed. 6  Here is a wretch who cried, and
the Lord heard him *
and saved him from all his troubles. 7  The angel of the Lord encamps
round those who fear him *
and delivers them in their need. 8  O taste and see that the Lord is
good *
happy the man who hides in him! 9  Fear the Lord, all you his holy
ones *
for those who fear him never lack. 10  Lions may suffer want and go
hungry *
but those who seek the Lord lack nothing good. 11  Come, my children,
listen to me *
and I will teach you the fear of the Lord. 12  Which of you relishes
life *
wants time to enjoy good things? 13  Keep your tongue from evil *
and your lips from telling lies. 14  Turn from evil and do good *
seek peace and pursue it. 15  The eyes of God are on the righteous *
and his ears towards their cry. 16  The Lord sets his face against
wrongdoers *
to root out their memory from the earth. 17  The righteous cry; the
Lord hears it *
and frees them from all their afflictions. 18  The Lord is close to
those who are broken-hearted *
and the crushed in spirit he saves. 19  The trials of the righteous
are many *
but our God delivers him from them all. 20  He guards all his bones *
so that not one is broken. 21  Evil will slay the wicked *
and those who hate the righteous will be destroyed. 22  The Lord
ransoms the lives of his servants *
and none who hide in him will be destroyed.

2 Chronicles 6:12-17

Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the
whole assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands. Solomon had made a
bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits
high, and had set it in the court; and he stood on it. Then he knelt on
his knees in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel, and spread
out his hands towards heaven. He said, ‘O Lord, God of Israel, there is
no God like you, in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant in steadfast
love with your servants who walk before you with all their heart— you
who have kept for your servant, my father David, what you promised to
him. Indeed, you promised with your mouth and this day have fulfilled
with your hand. Therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for your
servant, my father David, that which you promised him, saying, “There
shall never fail you a successor before me to sit on the throne of
Israel, if only your children keep to their way to walk in my law as
you have walked before me.” Therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, let your
word be confirmed, which you promised to your servant David.

Ephesians 3:14-21

For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every
family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to
the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in
your inner being with power through his Spirit, and that Christ may
dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and
grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend,
with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and
depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that
you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to him who by the
power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than
all we can ask or imagine, to him be glory in the church and in Christ
Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
