O loving God, who called your servant Aidan from the peace of a
Cloister to re-establish the Christian mission in northern England, and
gave him the gifts of gentleness, simplicity, and strength: Grant that
we, following his example, may use what you have given us for the
relief of human need, and may persevere in commending the saving Gospel
of our Redeemer Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the
Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever.

O holy Bishop Aidan, Apostle of the North and light of the Celtic
Church, glorious in humility, noble in poverty, zealous monk and loving
missionary, intercede for us sinners that Christ our God may have mercy
on our souls.
Kontakion (Orthodox)
Thou didst teach and preserve Christï¿½s doctrine and didst spread the
faith throughout Northumbria, O holy Hierarch Aidan. Unceasingly pray
to God for us for thou dost worship before His throne for ever.
First Reading
1 Corinthians 9:16-23
If I proclaim the gospel, this gives me no ground for boasting, for an
obligation is laid on me, and woe to me if I do not proclaim the
gospel! For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of
my own will, I am entrusted with a commission. What then is my reward?
Just this: that in my proclamation I may make the gospel free of
charge, so as not to make full use of my rights in the gospel.

For though I am free with respect to all, I have made myself a slave to
all, so that I might win more of them. To the Jews I became as a Jew,
in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the
law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those
under the law. To those outside the law I became as one outside the law
(though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law) so that
I might win those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, so that I
might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that I
might by all means save some. I do it all for the sake of the gospel,
so that I may share in its blessings.
Psalm 97:1-2,7-12
Dominus regnavit
^1 The Lord is king: let the earth rejoice; *
let the multitude of the isles be glad.
^2 Clouds and darkness are round about him; *
righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
^7 Confounded be all who worship carved images
and delight in mere idols. *
Bow down before him, all you gods.
^8 Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced, *
because of your judgements, O Lord.
^9 For you, Lord, are most high over all the earth; *
you are exalted far above all gods.
^10 The Lord loves those who hate evil; *
he preserves the lives of his faithful
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
^11 Light has sprung up for the righteous *
and joy for the true of heart.
^12 Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous, *
and give thanks to his holy name.
or
Psalm 85:8-13
Benedixisti, Domine
^8 I will listen to what the Lord God will say, *
for he shall speak peace to his people and to the faithful,
that they turn not again to folly.
^9 Truly, his salvation is near to those who fear him, *
that his glory may dwell in our land.
^10 Mercy and truth are met together, *
righteousness and peace have kissed each other;
^11 Truth shall spring up from the earth *
and righteousness look down from heaven.
^12 The Lord will indeed give all that is good, *
and our land will yield its increase.
^13 Righteousness shall go before him *
and direct his steps in the way.
Gospel
Matthew 19:27-30
Peter said in reply to Jesus, "Look, we have left everything and
followed you. What then will we have?" Jesus said to his disciples,
"Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man is
seated on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me will also
sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And
everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother
or children or fields, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold,
and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and
the last will be first.
