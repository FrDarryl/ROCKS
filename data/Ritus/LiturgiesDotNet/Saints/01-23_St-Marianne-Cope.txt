Witness to sacrificial love
It is with great joy that I welcome you to Rome, dear brothers and
sisters, for the Beatification of Mother Marianne Cope. I know that
your participation in Saturday's solemn liturgy, so significant for the
universal Church, will have been a source of renewed grace and
commitment to the exercise of charity which marks the life of every
Christian.

Marianne Cope's life was one of profound faith and love which bore
fruit in a missionary spirit of immense hope and trust. In 1862 she
entered the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of Syracuse where
she imbibed the particular spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi,
dedicating herself wholeheartedly to spiritual and corporal works of
mercy. Her own experience of consecrated life saw an extraordinary
apostolate unfold, adorned with heroic virtue.

As is well known, while Mother Marianne was Superior General of her
Congregation, the then-Bishop of Honolulu invited the Order to come to
Hawaii and work among the lepers. Leprosy was spreading rapidly and
causing unspeakable suffering and misery among the afflicted. Fifty
other Congregations received the same plea for assistance, but only
Mother Marianne, in the name of her Sisters, responded positively.

True to the charism of the Order and in imitation of St. Francis, who
had embraced lepers, Mother Marianne volunteered herself for the
mission with a trusting, "Yes!" And for 35 years, until her death in
1918, our new Blessed dedicated her life to the love and service of
lepers on the islands of Maui and Molokai.

Undoubtedly the generosity of Mother Marianne was, humanly speaking,
exemplary. Good intentions and selflessness alone, however, do not
adequately explain her vocation. It is only the perspective of faith
which enables us to understand her witness�as a Christian and as a
Religious�to that sacrificial love which reaches its fullness in Jesus
Christ. All that she achieved was inspired by her personal love of the
Lord, which she in turn expressed through her love of those abandoned
and rejected by society in a most wretched way.

Dear brothers and sisters, let us today be inspired by Bl. Marianne
Cope to renew our commitment to walk the path of holiness.

May the Virgin Mary obtain for us the gift of continual fidelity to the
Gospel. May she help us to follow the example of the new Blesseds and
to strive tirelessly towards holiness.
RESPONSORY          Matthew 25:35-36, 40; John 15:12
I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink,
a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me,
ill and you cared for me.
- Amen, I say to you: whatever you did for one of the least of my
brethren,
you did it for me.

This is my commandment:
love one another as I love you.
- Amen, I say to you: whatever you did for one of the least of my
brethren,
you did it for me.
