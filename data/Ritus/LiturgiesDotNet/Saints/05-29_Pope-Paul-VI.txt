Deus, qui Ecclesiam tuam regendam
beato Paulo papae commisisti,
strenuo Filii tui Evangelii apostolo,
praesta, quaesumus, ut ab eius institutis illuminati
ad civilem amoris cultum in mundum dilatandum,
tibi collaborare valeamus.
Per Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum Filium tuum,
qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti,
Deus, per omnia saecula sculorum.
(Or from the Common:)
Almighty ever-living God,
who chose Saint Paul VI to preside over your whole people
and benefit them by word and example,
keep safe, we pray, by his intercession, the shepherds of your Church
along with the flocks entrusted to their care,
and direct them in the way of eternal salvation.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever
