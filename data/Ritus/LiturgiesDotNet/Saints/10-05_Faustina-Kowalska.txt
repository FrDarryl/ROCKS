O God, who in a wondrous manner
revealed the inexhaustible riches of your mercy to Saint Maria
Faustina,
grant, we beseech you,
that by looking with trust upon the pierced side of your Son
we may be strengthened to show mercy one to another
and, at length, sing forever of your mercy in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.
FIRST READING      Ephesians 3:14-19
Brothers and sisters:
I kneel before the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory
to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self,
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith;
that you, rooted and grounded in love,
may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          103:1bc-2, 3-4, 8-9, 13-14, 17-18a
R. (1) O bless the Lord, my soul!
Bless the LORD, O my soul;
and all my being, bless his holy name.
Bless the LORD, O my soul,
and forget not all his benefits.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
He pardons all your iniquities,
he heals all your ills,
He redeems your life from destruction,
crowns you with kindness and compassion.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
Merciful and gracious is the LORD,
slow to anger and abounding in kindness.
He will not always chide,
nor does he keep his wrath forever.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
As a father has compassion on his children,
so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him,
For he knows how we are formed;
he remembers that we are dust.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
But the kindness of the LORD is from eternity
to eternity toward those who fear him,
And his justice toward his children's children
among those who keep his covenant.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
GOSPEL        Matthew 11:25-30
At that time Jesus responded:
"I give praise to you, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth,
for although you have hidden these things
from the wise and the learned
you have revealed them to the childlike.
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.
No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him."
"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart;
and you will find rest for yourselves.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."

SECOND READING
From the diary of St Faustina
The mission of proclaiming and begging divine mercy for the world
O my God, I am conscious of my mission in the Holy Church. It is my
constant endeavour to plead for mercy for the world. I unite myself
closely with Jesus and stand before him as an atoning sacrifice on
behalf of the world. God will refuse me nothing when I entreat him with
the voice of his Son. My sacrifice is nothing in itself, but when I
join it to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, it becomes all-powerful and
has the power to appease divine wrath. God loves us in his Son; the
painful Passion of the Son of God constantly turns aside the wrath of
God.
O God, how I desire that souls come to know you and to see that you
have created them because of your unfathomable love. O my Creator and
Lord, I feel that I am going to remove the veil of heaven so that earth
will not doubt your goodness.
Make of me, Jesus, a pure and agreeable offering before the face of
your Father. Jesus, transform me, miserable and sinful as I am, into
your own self (for you can do all things), and give me to your eternal
Father. I want to become a sacrificial host before you, but an ordinary
wafer to people. I want the fragrance of my sacrifice to be known to
you alone. O eternal God, an unquenchable fire of supplication for your
mercy burns within me. I know and understand that this is my task, here
and in eternity. You yourself have told me to speak about this great
mercy and about your goodness.
RESPONSORY          2 Chronicles 6:21,39
Listen to the petitions of your servant and of your people.
- And when you have heard, pardon.
Forgive your people who have sinned against you.
- And when you have heard, pardon.
