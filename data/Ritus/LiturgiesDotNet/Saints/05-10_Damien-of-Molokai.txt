SECOND READING
A reading from the Letters of Saint Damien De Veuster, priest
(Processus suppletivus Servi Dei Damiani De Veuster, Copia Publica,
Rome, Archives of the SS.CC. General Postulation, vol. I & vol. II,
1951)
I have accepted this disease as my particular cross
Divine Providence, having compassion on the unfortunate, has thought
fit to look upon your unworthy servant to care for the spiritual needs
of a well-known leprosy hospital that our Government had to establish
to preserve the whole archipelago from disease. Thus, it is in my role
as pastor of an unusual parish of eight hundred lepers, nearly half of
whom are now Catholics, that I take the liberty to write to you these
lines.
Here I am in the midst of my dear lepers. They are so frightful to see,
it is true, but they have souls redeemed at the price of the Precious
Blood of our Divine Saviour. He also in his divine charity consoled
lepers. If I can not cure them as he did, at least I can console them
and by the holy ministry which in his goodness he has entrusted to me,
I hope that many among them, purified from the leprosy of the soul,
will present themselves before his tribunal prepared to enter the
communion of the blessed.
My chapel, which was too big the first weeks I was here, has now become
too small. Three weeks in a row I have had to ask some of the older
Christians to stand outside along the windows in order to give their
places to the new-comers or to the fallen away who have returned or to
the catechumens of whom there are always some.
Besides Sunday, there are a good number who come regularly to Mass and
evening rosary everyday of the week. A good number receive communion
every Sunday. Besides the consolations that the heart of a priest finds
in the church, there is also much good to do by visiting homes, going
from one hut to another, almost all of them filled with poor
unfortunates who can hardly drag themselves around as often their hands
and feet have been eaten away by this horrible disease. They are
condemned to breathe foul air. Ordinarily they listen with great
attention to the word of salvation which I share with each one
according to their disposition.
Even though I am not a leper, I make myself a leper with the lepers;
when I preach, I always use the expression, "We, lepers". Thus may I
gain all for Christ as St. Paul.
As you know, it has been already quite a while that Divine Providence
chose me to become a victim of this repugnant disease of ours. I hope
to remain eternally grateful for this grace. It seems to me that this
disease will shorten and narrow the way that will lead me to our dear
homeland. In that hope accepted this disease as my particular cross; I
try to bear it as did Simon of Cyrene, following in the footsteps of
our Divine Master. Please assist me with your good prayers, so as to
obtain for me the strength of perseverance, until I reach the summit of
Calvary.
RESPONSORY      Cf. Jn 15:13,16
R. There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's
friends.*
To lay down one's life for one's friends. That is the fruit of true
love.
V. I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain*
To lay down one's life for one�s friends.
