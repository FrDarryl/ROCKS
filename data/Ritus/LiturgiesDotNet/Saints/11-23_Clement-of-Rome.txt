Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui in omnium sanctorum tuorum es virtute
mirabilis, da nobis in beati Clementis annua commemoratione laetari,
qui, Filii tui sacerdos et martyr, quod mysterio gessit, testimonio
comprobavit, et, quod praedicavit ore, confirmavit exemplo.
Almighty ever-living God,
who are wonderful in the virtue of all your Saints,
grant us joy in the yearly commemoration of Saint Clement,
who, as a Martyr and High Priest of your Son,
bore out by his witness what he celebrated in mystery
and confirmed by example what he preached with his lips.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Peter 5:1-4
Beloved:
I exhort the presbyters among you,
as a fellow presbyter and witness to the sufferings of Christ
and one who has a share in the glory to be revealed.
Tend the flock of God in your midst,
overseeing it not by constraint but willingly,
as God would have it, not for shameful profit but eagerly.
Do not lord it over those assigned to you,
but be examples to the flock.
And when the chief Shepherd is revealed,
you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          89:2-3, 4-5, 21-22, 25 and 27
Misericordias tuas, Domine, in aeternum cantabo
R. (2) For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The favors of the LORD I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever";
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
I have sworn to David my servant:
Forever will I confirm your posterity
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have found David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
That my hand may be always with him,
and that my arm may make him strong."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,
and through my name shall his horn be exalted.
He shall say of me, 'You are my father,
my God, the rock, my savior."'
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Mk 1:17
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Matthew 16:13-19
When Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi
he asked his disciples,
"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,
still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter said in reply,
"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah.
For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly
Father.
And so I say to you, you are Peter,
and upon this rock I will build my Church,
and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the Kingdom of heaven.
Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;
and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."heaven."

SECOND READING
From a letter to the Corinthians by Saint Clement I, Pope
(Ps. 32, sermo 1, 7-8: CCL 38, 253-254)
Wonderful are God�s gifts
Beloved, how blessed and wonderful are God�s gifts! There is life
everlasting, joy in righteousness, truth in freedom, faith, confidence,
and self-control in holiness. And these are the gifts that we can
comprehend; what of all the others that are being prepared for those
who look to him. Only the Creator, the Father of the ages, the
All-Holy, knows their grandeur and their loveliness. And so we should
strive to be found among those who wait for him so that we may share in
these promised gifts. And so we should strive to be found among those
who wait for him so that we may share in these promised gifts. And how
is this to be, beloved brothers? It will come about if by our faith our
minds remain fixed on God; if we aim at what is pleasing and acceptable
to him, if we accomplish what is in harmony with his faultless will and
follow the path of truth, rejecting all injustice, viciousness,
covetousness, quarrels, malice and deceit.

This is the path, beloved, by which we find our salvation, Jesus
Christ, the high priest of our sacrifices, the defender and ally in our
helplessness. It is through him that we gaze on the highest heaven,
through him we can see the reflection of God�s pure and sublime
countenance, through him the eyes of our hearts have been opened,
through him our foolish and darkened understanding opens toward the
light, and through him the Lord has willed that we should taste
everlasting knowledge. He reflects God�s majesty and is as much
superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than
theirs.

Let us then serve in his army, brothers, following his blameless
commands with all our might. The great cannot exist without the small
nor the small without the great; they blend together to their mutual
advantage. Take the body, for example. The head is nothing without the
feet, just as the feet are nothing without the head. The smallest parts
of our body are necessary and valuable to the whole. All work together
and are mutually subject for the preservation of the whole body.

Our entire body, then will be preserved in Christ Jesus, and each of us
should be subject to his neighbor in accordance with the grace given to
each. The stronger should care for the weak, and the weak should
respect the stronger. The wealthy should give to the poor, and the poor
man should thank God that he has sent him someone to supply his needs.
The wise should manifest their wisdom not in words but in good deeds,
and the humble should not talk about their own humility, but allow
others to bear witness to it. Since, therefore, we have all this from
him, we ought to thank him for it all. Glory to him for ever. Amen
RESPONSORY        See Mt 7:24; 1 Pt 2:22; 1 Sm 2:28
This wise man built his house upon rock.
No deceit was found in his mouth.
- God chose him as his priest.
Behold a great priest, who in his days pleased God
and was found just. - God chose him as his priest.
