COLLECT
Patientia pretiosa iustorum tuae nobis, Domine, quaesumus, affectum
dilectionis accumulet, et in cordibus nostris sacrae fidei semper
exerceat firmitatem.
May the precious long-suffering of the just,
O Lord, we pray,
bring us a great increase of love for you
and always prompt in our hearts
constancy in the holy faith.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Peter 4:12-19
Beloved, do not be surprised that a trial by fire is occurring among
you,
as if something strange were happening to you.
But rejoice to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ,
so that when his glory is revealed
you may also rejoice exultantly.
If you are insulted for the name of Christ, blessed are you,
for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
But let no one among you be made to suffer
as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as an intriguer.
But whoever is made to suffer as a Christian should not be ashamed
but glorify God because of the name.
For it is time for the judgment to begin with the household of God;
if it begins with us, how will it end
for those who fail to obey the Gospel of God?

And if the righteous one is barely saved,
where will the godless and the sinner appear?

As a result, those who suffer in accord with God's will
hand their souls over to a faithful creator as they do good.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          124:2-3, 4-5, 7cd-8
Anima nostra sicut passer erepta est de laqueo venantium.
R./ (7) Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler�s snare.
Had not the Lord been with us –
When men rose up against us,
then would they have swallowed us alive,
When their fury was inflamed against us.
R./ Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler�s snare.
Then would the waters have overwhelmed us;
The torrent would have swept over us;
over us then would have swept
the raging waters.
R./ Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler�s snare.
Broken was the snare,
and we were freed.
Our help is in the name of the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.
R./ Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler�s snare.
ALLELUIA
Te deum laudamus, te Dominum confitemur. Te gloriosus Apostolorum
chorus laudat, Domine.
We praise you, O God,
we acclaim you as Lord;
the white robed army of martyrs praise you.
GOSPEL          John 15:18-21
Jesus said to his disciples:
"If the world hates you, realize that it hated me first.
If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own;
but because you do not belong to the world,
and I have chosen you out of the world,
the world hates you.
Remember the word I spoke to you,
`No slave is greater than his master.'
If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.
If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
And they will do all these things to you on account of my name,
because they do not know the one who sent me."

Office of Readings
SECOND READING
From a letter by Saint Cyprian, bishop and martyr
(Epist 10, 2-3, 5; CSEL 3, 491-492, 494-495)
Invincible faith
With what praises can I extol you, most valiant brothers? What words
can I find to proclaim and celebrate your brave hearts and your
persevering faith? Examined under the fiercest torture, you held out
until your ordeal was consummated in glory; it was not you who yielded
to the torments but rather the torments that yielded to you. No respite
from pain was allowed by the instruments of your torture, but your very
crowning signaled the end of pain. The cruel butchery was permitted to
last the longer, not so that it might overthrow the faith that stood so
firm, but rather that it might dispatch you, men of God, more speedily
to the Lord.

The crowd in wonder watched God�s heavenly contest, this spiritual
battle that was Christ�s. They saw his servants standing firm, free in
speech, undefiled in heart, endowed with supernatural courage, naked
and bereft of the weapons of this world, but as believers equipped with
the arms of faith. Tortured men stood there stronger than their
torturers; battered and lacerated limbs triumphed over clubs and claws
that tore them.

Savage and prolonged beating could not overcome such invincible faith,
even when the bodies of God�s servants were so mangled that no whole
members were left to suffer punishment, but only wounds remained.
Enough blood flowed to quench the fire of persecution, a glorious river
to cool even the burning heat of hell. What a divine display it was,
how sublime and magnificent! How pleasing did the sworn allegiance and
loyalty of his soldiers render the dead in God�s sight! In the psalms,
where the Holy Spirit speaks to us and counsels us, it is written:
Precious in the sight of God is the death of his holy ones. Rightly is
that death called �precious,� for at the price of blood it purchased
immortality and won God�s crown through the ultimate act of courage.

How happy Christ was to be there, how gladly he fought and conquered in
such servants! He protects their faith and gives strength to believers
in proportion to the trust that each man who receives that strength is
willing to place in him. Christ was there to wage his own battle; he
aroused the soldiers who fought for his name; he made them spirited and
strong. And he who once for all has conquered death for us, now
continually conquers in us.

How blessed is this Church of ours, so honored and illuminated by God
and ennobled in these our days by the glorious blood of martyrs! In
earlier times it shone white with the good deeds of our brethren, and
now it is adorned with the red blood of martyrs. It counts both lilies
and roses among its garlands. Let each of us, then, strive for the
highest degree of glory, whichever be the honor for which he is
destined; may all Christians be found worthy of either the pure white
crown of a holy life or the royal red crown of martyrdom.
RESPONSORY
We are warriors now, fighting on the battlefield of faith, and God sees
all we do;
the angels watch and so does Christ.
- What honor and glory and joy, to do battle in the presence of God,
and to have Christ approve of our victory.
Let us arm ourselves in full strength
and prepare ourselves for the ultimate struggle
with blameless hearts, true faith and unyielding courage.
- What honor and glory and joy, to do battle in the presence of God,
and to have Christ approve of our victory.
COLLECT
May the precious long-suffering of the just,
O Lord, we pray,
bring us a great increase of love for you
and always prompt in our hearts
constancy in the holy faith.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
