First Reading

1 Corinthians 3:8-11

The one who plants and the one who waters have a common purpose, and
each will receive wages according to the labor of each. For we are
God's servants, working together; you are God's field, God's building.

According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master
builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building on it. Each
builder must choose with care how to build on it. For no one can lay
any foundation other than the one that has been laid; that foundation
is Jesus Christ.




Psalm

Psalm 67

Deus misereatur



^1 Let God be gracious to us and bless us *
and make his face shine upon us,
^2 That your ways may be known on earth *
your liberating power among all nations.
^3 Let the peoples praise you, O God *
let all the peoples praise you.
^4 Let the nations be glad and sing *
for you judge the peoples with integrity,
and govern the nations upon earth.
^5 Let the peoples praise you, O God *
let all the peoples praise you.
^6 Then the earth will yield its fruitfulness *
and God, our God, will bless us.
^7 God shall bless us *
and all the ends of the earth will fear him.


or

Psalm 96:1-7

Cantate Domino


^1 O sing to the Lord a new song *
sing to the Lord, all the earth.
^2 Sing to the Lord and bless his holy name *
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.
^3 Declare his glory among the nations *
and his wonders among all peoples.
^4 For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised *
he is more to be feared than all gods.
^5 As for all the gods of the nations, they are mere idols *
it is the Lord who made the heavens.
^6 Majesty and glory are before him *
beauty and power are in his sanctuary.
^7 Render to the Lord, you families of the nations *
render to the Lord glory and might.


Second Reading

Matthew 28:16-20

The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus
had directed them. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some
doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and
on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have
commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the
age."
