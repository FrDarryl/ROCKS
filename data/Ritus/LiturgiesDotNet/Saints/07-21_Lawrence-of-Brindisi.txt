Deus, qui pro nominis tui gloria et animarum salute beato Laurentio
presbytero spiritum consilii et fortitudinis contulisti, da nobis, in
eodem spiritu, et agenda cognoscere, et cognita, eius intercessione,
perficere.
O God, who for the glory of your name
and the salvation of souls
bestowed on the Priest Saint Lawrence of Brindisi
a spirit of counsel and fortitude,
grant, we pray, that in the same spirit,
we may know what must be done
and, through his intercession,
bring it to completion.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 4:1-2,5-7
Brothers and sisters:
Since we have this ministry through the mercy shown us,
we are not discouraged.
Rather, we have renounced shameful, hidden things;
not acting deceitfully or falsifying the word of God,
but by the open declaration of the truth
we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.
For we do not preach ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord,
and ourselves as your slaves for the sake of Jesus.
For God who said, Let light shine out of darkness,
has shone in our hearts to bring to light
the knowledge of the glory of God on the face of Jesus Christ.
But we hold this treasure in earthen vessels,
that the surpassing power may be of God and not from us.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          40:2; 4ab,7-8a,8b-9,10-11
R. (8a and 9a)  Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD,
and he stooped toward me.
And he put a new song into my mouth,
a hymn to our God.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,
but ears open to obedience you gave me.
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;
then said I, �Behold I come.�
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly;
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart;
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of;
I have made no secret of your kindness and your truth
in the vast assembly.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
ALLELUIA
The seed is the word of God, Christ is the sower;
all who come to him will live for ever.
GOSPEL           Mark 4:1-10, 13-20 or 4:1-9
On another occasion, Jesus began to teach by the sea.
A very large crowd gathered around him
so that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.
And the whole crowd was beside the sea on land.
And he taught them at length in parables,
and in the course of his instruction he said to them,
"Hear this! A sower went out to sow.
And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path,
and the birds came and ate it up.
Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil.
It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.
And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of
roots.
Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it and
it produced no grain.
And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit.
It came up and grew and yielded thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."
He added, "Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear."

[And when he was alone,
those present along with the Twelve
questioned him about the parables.
Jesus said to them, "Do you not understand this parable?
Then how will you understand any of the parables?
The sower sows the word.
These are the ones on the path where the word is sown.
As soon as they hear, Satan comes at once
and takes away the word sown in them.
And these are the ones sown on rocky ground who,
when they hear the word, receive it at once with joy.
But they have no roots; they last only for a time.
Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word.
they quickly fall away.
Those sown among thorns are another sort.
They are the people who hear the word,
but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches,
and the craving for other things intrude and choke the word,
and it bears no fruit.
But those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept
it
and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold."]

Office of Readings
SECOND READING
From a sermon by St. Lawrence of Brindisi, priest
(Sermo Quadragesimalis 2, Opera omnia 5, 1, nn 48, 50, 52)
Preaching is an apostolic duty
There is a spiritual life that we share with the angels of heaven and
with the divine spirits, for like them we have been formed in the image
and likeness of God. The bread that is necessary for living this life
is the grace of the Holy Spirit and the love of God. But grace and love
are nothing without faith, since without faith it is impossible to
please God. And faith is not conceived unless the word of God is
preached. Faith comes through hearing, and what is heard is the word of
Christ. The preaching of the word of God, then, is necessary for the
spiritual life, just as the planting of seed is necessary for bodily
life.

Christ says: The sower went out to sow his seed. The sower goes out as
a herald of justice. On some occasions we read that the herald was God,
for example, when with a living voice from heaven he gave the law of
justice to a whole people in the desert.

On other occasions, the herald was an angel of the Lord, as when he
accused the people of transgressing the divine law at Bochim, in the
place of weeping. At this all the sons of Israel, when they heard the
angel's address, became sorrowful in their hearts, lifted up their
voices, and wept bitterly. Then again, Moses preached the law of the
Lord to the whole people on the plains of Moab, as we read in
Deuteronomy. Finally, Christ came as God and man to preach the word of
the Lord, and for the same purpose he sent the apostles, just as he had
sent the prophets before them.

Preaching therefore, is a duty that is apostolic, angelic, Christian,
divine. The word of God is replete with manifold blessings, since it
is, so to speak, a treasure of all goods. It is the source of faith,
hope, charity, all virtues, all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, all the
beatitudes of the Gospel, all good works, all the rewards of life, all
the glory of paradise: Welcome the word that has taken root in you,
with its power to save you.

For the word of God is a light to the mind and a fire to the will. It
enables man to know God and to love him. And for the interior man who
lives by the Spirit of God, through grace, it is bread and water, but a
bread sweeter than honey and the honeycomb, a water better than wine
and milk. For the soul it is a spiritual treasure of merits yielding an
abundance of gold and precious stones. Against the hardness of a heart
that persists in wrongdoing, it acts as a hammer. Against the world,
the flesh and the devil it serves as a sword that destroys all sin.
RESPONSORY          Isaiah 40:9; Luke 9:59,60
You who preach the good news to Zion,
climb up to the top of a high mountain
- and proclaim to the cities of Judah:
Here is your God.

Follow me; go and preach the kingdom of God.
- And proclaim to the cities of Judah:
Here is your God.
