COLLECT
Concede, misericors Deus, fragilitati nostrae praesidium, ut, qui
immaculatae Dei Genetricis memoriam agimus, intercessionis eius
auxilio, a nostris iniquitatibus resurgamus.
Grant us, O merciful God, protection in our weakness,
that we, who keep the Memorial of the Immaculate Mother of God,
may, with the help of her intercession,
rise up from our iniquities.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 66:10-14c
Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad because of her,
all you who love her;
Exult, exult with her,
all you who were mourning over her!
Oh, that you may suck fully
of the milk of her comfort,
That you may nurse with delight
at her abundant breasts!
For thus says the LORD:
Lo, I will spread prosperity over her like a river,
and the wealth of the nations like
an overflowing torrent.
As nurslings, you shall be carried in her arms,
and fondled in her lap;
As a mother comforts her child,
so will I comfort you;
in Jerusalem you shall find your comfort.

When you see this, your heart shall rejoice,
and your bodies flourish like the grass;
The LORD's power shall be known to his servants.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM Judith 13:18bcde,19
R. You are the highest honor of our race.
Blessed are you, daughter, by the Most High God,
above all the women on earth; and blessed be the LORD God,
the creator of heaven and earth.
R. You are the highest honor of our race.
Your deed of hope will never be forgotten
by those who tell of the might of God.
R. You are the highest honor of our race.
ALLELUIA          See Luke 1:45
Blessed are you, O Virgin Mary,
who believed that what was spoken to you by the Lord would be fulfilled
GOSPEL          John 2:1-11
There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee,and the mother of Jesus was
there.
Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.
When the wine ran short,
the mother of Jesus said to him,
"They have no wine."
And Jesus said to her,
"Woman, how does your concern affect me?
My hour has not yet come."
His mother said to the servants,
"Do whatever he tells you."
Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial
washings,
each holding twenty to thirty gallons.
Jesus told them,
"Fill the jars with water."
So they filled them to the brim.
Then he told them,
"Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter."
So they took it.
And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine,
without knowing where it came from
(although they who had drawn the water knew),
the headwaiter called the bridegroom and said to him,
"Everyone serves good wine first,
and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one;
but you have kept the good wine until now."
Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs at Cana in Galilee
and so revealed his glory,
and his disciples began to believe in him.

Office of Readings

(Ep. ad Gondrand a 1861: cf. A. Ravier, Les escrits de sainte
Bernadette, Paris, 1961, pp. 53-59)
The apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes

I had gone down one day with two other girls to the bank of the river
Gave when suddenly I heard a kind of rustling sound. I turned my head
toward the field by the side of the river but the trees seemed quite
still and the noise was evidently not from them. Then I looked up and
caught sight of the cave where I saw a lady wearing a lovely white
dress with a bright belt. On top of each of her feet was a pale yellow
rose, the same color as her rosary beads.

At this I rubbed my eyes, thinking I was seeing things, and I put my
hands into the fold of my dress where my rosary was. I wanted to make
the sign of the cross but for the life of me I couldn’t manage it and
my hand just fell down. Then the lady made the sign of the cross
herself and at the second attempt I managed to do the same, though my
hands were trembling. Then I began to say the rosary while the lady let
her beads slip through her fingers, without moving her lips. When I
stopped saying the Hail Mary, she immediately vanished.

I asked my two companions if they had noticed anything, but they said
no. Of course they wanted to know what I was doing and I told them that
I had seen a lady wearing a nice white dress, though I didn’t know who
she was. I told them not to say anything about it, and they said I was
silly to have anything to do with it. I said they were wrong and I came
back next Sunday, feeling myself drawn to the place....

The third time I went the lady spoke to me and asked me to come every
day for fifteen days. I said I would and then she said that she wanted
me to tell the priests to build a chapel there. She also told me to
drink from the stream. I went to the Gave, the only stream I could see.
Then she made me realise she was not speaking of the Gave and she
indicated a little trickle of water close by. When I got to it I could
only find a few drops, mostly mud. I cupped my hands to catch some
liquid without success and then I started to scrape the ground. I
managed to find a few drops of water but only at the fourth attempt was
there a sufficient amount for any kind of drink. The lady then vanished
and I went back home.

I went back each day for two weeks and each time, except one Monday and
one Friday, the lady appeared and told me to look for a stream and wash
in it and to see that the priests build a chapel there. I must also
pray, she said, for the conversion of sinners. I asked her many times
what she meant by that, but she only smiled. Finally with outstretched
arms and eyes looking up to heaven she told me she was the Immaculate
Conception.

During the two weeks she told me three secrets but I was not to speak
about them to anyone and so far I have not.
RESPONSORY
