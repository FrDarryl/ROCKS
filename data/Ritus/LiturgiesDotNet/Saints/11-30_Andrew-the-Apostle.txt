ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Mt 4: 18-19
Dominus secus mare Galilaeae vidit duos fratres, Petrum et Andream, et
vocavit eos: Venite post me, faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum
Beside the Sea of Galilee,
the Lord saw two brothers, Peter and Andrew,
and he said to them:
Come after me and I will make you fishers of men.
GLORIA IN EXCELSIS
COLLECT
Maiestatem tuam, Domine, suppliciter exoramus, ut, sicut Ecclesiae tuae
beatus Andreas apostolus exstitit praedicator et rector, ita apud te
sit pro nobis perpetuus intercessor.
We humbly implore your majesty, O Lord,
that, just as the blessed Apostle Andrew
was for your Church a preacher and pastor,
so he may be for us a constant intercessor before you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Romans 10:9-18
Brothers and sisters:
If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord
and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
you will be saved.
For one believes with the heart and so is justified,
and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved.
The Scripture says,
No one who believes in him will be put to shame.
There is no distinction between Jew and Greek;
the same Lord is Lord of all,
enriching all who call upon him.
For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

But how can they call on him in whom they have not believed?
And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard?
And how can they hear without someone to preach?
And how can people preach unless they are sent?
As it is written,
How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news!
But not everyone has heeded the good news;
for Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed what was heard from us?
Thus faith comes from what is heard,
and what is heard comes through the word of Christ.
But I ask, did they not hear?
Certainly they did; for

Their voice has gone forth to all the earth,
and their words to the ends of the world.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          19: 8, 9, 10, 11
Domine, verba vitae aeternae habes
R. (John 6:63c) Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.
The law of the LORD is perfect,
refreshing the soul;
The decree of the LORD is trustworthy,
giving wisdom to the simple.
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.
The precepts of the LORD are right,
rejoicing the heart;
The command of the LORD is clear,
enlightening the eye.
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.
The fear of the LORD is pure,
enduring forever;
The ordinances of the LORD are true,
all of them just.
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.
They are more precious than gold,
than a heap of purest gold;
Sweeter also than syrup
or honey from the comb.
R. Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.
ALLELUIA          Mt 4:19
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Matthew 4:18-22
As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers,
Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew,
casting a net into the sea; they were fishermen.
He said to them,
�Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.�
At once they left their nets and followed him.
He walked along from there and saw two other brothers,
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
They were in a boat, with their father Zebedee, mending their nets.
He called them, and immediately they left their boat and their father
and followed him.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Concede nobis, omnipotens Deus, ut his muneribus, quae in beati Andreae
festivitate deferimus, et tibi placeamus exhibitis, et vivificemur
acceptis.
Grant us, almighty God, that through these offerings,
which we bring on the feast day of Saint Andrew,
we may please you by what we have brought
and be given life by what you have accepted.
Through Christ our Lord.

and he brought him to Jesus.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Roboret nos, Domine, sacramenti tui communio, ut, exemplo beati Andreae
apostoli, Christi mortificationem ferentes, cum ipso vivere mereamur in
gloria.
May communion in your Sacrament strengthen us, O Lord,
so that by the example of the blessed Apostle Andrew
we, who carry in our body the Death of Christ,

Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
SOLEMN BLESSING OF THE APOSTLES

to stand firm on apostolic foundations,

you may inherit the eternal homeland,
for by their teaching you possess firmness of faith.
R. Amen.

And may the blessing of almighty God,
the Father, and the Son, + and the Holy Spirit,
come down on you and remain with you for ever.
R. Amen.
