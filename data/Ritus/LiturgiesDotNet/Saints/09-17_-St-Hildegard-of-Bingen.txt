COLLECT
Hear us, God our Saviour,
that, as we rejoice in commemorating the Virgin blessed Hildegard,
we may be instructed by her loving devotion.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Song of Songs 8:6-7
Stern as death is love.
Set me as a seal on your heart,
as a seal on your arm;
For stern as death is love,
relentless as the nether world is devotion;
its flames are a blazing fire.
Deep waters cannot quench love,
nor floods sweep it away.
Were one to offer all he owns to purchase love,
he would be roundly mocked.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Psalm 45:11-12, 14-15, 16-17
Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.
or
The bridegroom is here; let us go out to meet Christ the Lord.
Hear, O daughter, and see; turn your ear,
forget your people and your father�s house.
So shall the king desire your beauty;
for he is your lord, and you must worship him.
Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.
or
The bridegroom is here; let us go out to meet Christ the Lord.
All glorious is the king�s daughter as she enters;
her raiment is threaded with spun gold.
In embroidered apparel she is borne in to the king;
behind her the virgins of her train are brought to you.
Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.
or
The bridegroom is here; let us go out to meet Christ the Lord.
They are borne in with gladness and joy;
they enter the palace of the king.
The place of your fathers your sons shall have;
you shall make them princes through all the land
Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.
or
The bridegroom is here; let us go out to meet Christ the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 5:8
Blessed are the clean of heart,
for they will see God.
GOSPEL          Matthew 25:1-13
Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!
Jesus told his disciples this parable: �The Kingdom of heaven will be
like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the
bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish
ones, when taking their lamps, brought no oil with them, but the wise
brought flasks of oil with their lamps. Since the bridegroom was long
delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight, there was
a cry, �Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!� Then all those
virgins got up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the
wise, �Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.� But the
wise ones replied, �No, for there may not be enough for us and you. Go
instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.� While they went
off to buy it, the bridegroom came and those who were ready went into
the wedding feast with him. Then the door was locked. Afterwards the
other virgins came and said, �Lord, Lord, open the door for us!� But he
said in reply, �Amen, I say to you, I do not know you.� Therefore, stay
awake, for you know neither the day nor the hour.�
