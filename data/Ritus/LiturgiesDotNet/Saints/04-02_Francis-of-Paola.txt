MASS

From the Common of Holy Men and Women: For Religious

COLLECT
O God, exaltation of the lowly,
who raised Saint Francis of Paola to the glory of your Saints,
grant, we pray, that by his merits and example
we may happily attain the rewards promised to the humble.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Philippians 3:8-14
Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For His sake I have suffered the loss of
all things, and count them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ
and be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own, based on
law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from
God that depends on faith; that I may know Him and the power of His
resurrection, and may share His sufferings, becoming like Him in His
death, that if possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect; but I
press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me His own.
Brethren, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but one thing I
do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies
ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of
God in Christ Jesus.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM                    Ps 16:1-2a and 5, 7-8, 11
Tu es, Domine, pars heredidatis meae.
R. (see 5a) You are my inheritance, O Lord.
Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;
I say to the LORD, "My Lord are you."
O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup,
you it is who hold fast my lot.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
I bless the LORD who counsels me;
even in the night my heart exhorts me.
I set the LORD ever before me;
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
You will show me the path to life,
fullness of joys in your presence,
the delights at your right hand forever.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          Mt 5:3
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Luke 12:32-34
"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give
you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide
yourselves with purses that do not grow old, with a treasure in the
heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth
destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

Office of Readings

From a letter by Saint Francis of Paola, hermit
(Epistola a. 1486: A. Galuzzi, Origini dell'Ordine dei Minimi, Romae,
1967, pp. 121-122)
Be converted with a sincere heart
May our Lord Jesus Christ, a most generous giver, reward you for your
labor.

Avoid evil, cast danger aside. Though we are unworthy, we and your
brothers never cease to pray to God the Father and to his Son Jesus
Christ and also to the Virgin Mary that you may receive everything you
need for your spiritual and physical well-being.

I earnestly admonish you, therefore, my brothers, to look after your
spiritual well-being with judicious concern. Death is certain; life is
short and vanishes like smoke.

Fix your minds, then, on the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Inflamed
with love for us, he came down from heaven to redeem us. For our sake
he endured every torment of body and soul and shrank from no bodily
pain. He himself gave us an example of perfect patience and love. We,
then, are to be patient in adversity.

Put aside your hatred and animosity. Take pains to refrain from sharp
words. If they escape your lips, do not be ashamed to let your lips
produce the remedy, since they have caused the wounds. Pardon one
another so that later on you will not remember the injury. The
recollection of an injury is itself wrong. It adds to our anger,
nurtures our sin and hates what is good. It is a rusty arrow and poison
for the soul. It puts all virtue to flight. It is like a worm in the
mind: it confuses our speech and tears to shreds our petitions to God.
It is foreign to charity: it remains planted in the soul like a nail.
It is wickedness that never sleeps, sin that never fails. It is indeed
a daily death.

Be peace-loving. Peace is a precious treasure to be sought with great
zeal. You are well aware that our sins arouse God�s anger. You must
change your life, therefore, so that God in his mercy will pardon you.
What we conceal from men is known to God. Be converted, then, with a
sincere heart. Live your life that you may receive the blessing of the
Lord. Then the peace of God our Father will be with you always.
RESPONSORY       2 Corinthians 4:11, 16
Though we are always alive,
we are continually being handed over to death
for the sake of Jesus,
- so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal bodies
(alleluia).
Even though our outward body is failing,
the inner man is being renewed with each passing day.
- so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal bodies
(alleluia).
