From the Common of the Blessed Virgin Mary

COLLECT
Adiuvet nos, quaesumus, Domine, gloriosae Virginis Mariae intercessio
veneranda, ut, eius muniti praesidiis, ad montem, qui Christus est,
pervenire valeamus.
May the venerable intercession of the glorious Virgin Mary
come to our aid, we pray, O Lord,
so that, fortified by her protection,
we may reach the mountain which is Christ.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Zechariah 2:14-17
Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion!
See, I am coming to dwell among you, says the LORD.
Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD on that day,
and they shall be his people,
and he will dwell among you,
and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
The LORD will possess Judah as his portion in the holy land,
and he will again choose Jerusalem.
Silence, all, in the presence of the LORD!
for he stirs forth from his holy dwelling. Be silent, all flesh, before
the LORD; for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Luke 1:46-47, 48-49, 50-51, 52-53, 54-55
R./ The Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.

Or:

R./ O Blessed Virgin Mary, you carried the Son of the eternal Father.

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior. R./

For he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed:
the Almighty has done great things for me,
and holy is his Name. R./

He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit. R./

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty. R./

He has come to the help of his servant Israel,
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
The promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children for ever.
ALLELUIA           Lk 11:28
Beati qui audiunt verbum Dei. et custodiunt illud.
Blessed are they who hear the word of God
and observe it.
GOSPEL
Matthew 12:46-50
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds,
his mother and his brothers appeared outside,
wishing to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside,
asking to speak with you."
But he said in reply to the one who told him,
"Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said,
"Here are my mother and my brothers.
For whoever does the will of my heavenly Father
is my brother, and sister, and mother."
