and his wonders among all the peoples,
for the Lord is great and highly to be praised.
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatos Timotheum et Titum apostolicis virtutibus decorasti,
utriusque intercessione concede, ut, iuste et pie viventes in hoc
saeculo, ad caelestem mereamur patriam pervenire.
O God, who adorned Saints Timothy and Titus
with apostolic virtues,
grant, through the intercession of them both,
that, living justly and devoutly in this present age,
we may merit to reach our heavenly homeland.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING (1st Option)          2 Tim 1:1-8
Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God
for the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
to Timothy, my dear child:
grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I am grateful to God,
whom I worship with a clear conscience as my ancestors did,
as I remember you constantly in my prayers, night and day.
I yearn to see you again, recalling your tears,
so that I may be filled with joy,
as I recall your sincere faith
that first lived in your grandmother Lois
and in your mother Eunice
and that I am confident lives also in you.
For this reason, I remind you to stir into flame
the gift of God that you have through the imposition of my hands.
For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice
but rather of power and love and self-control.
So do not be ashamed of your testimony to our Lord,
nor of me, a prisoner for his sake;
but bear your share of hardship for the Gospel
with the strength that comes from God.
Or:
FIRST READING (2nd Option)          Titus 1:1-5
Paul, a slave of God and Apostle of Jesus Christ
for the sake of the faith of God�s chosen ones
and the recognition of religious truth,
in the hope of eternal life
that God, who does not lie, promised before time began,
who indeed at the proper time revealed his word
in the proclamation with which I was entrusted
by the command of God our savior,
to Titus, my true child in our common faith:
grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our savior.
For this reason I left you in Crete
so that you might set right what remains to be done
and appoint presbyters in every town, as I directed you.

GOSPEL          Luke 10:1-9
The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two other disciples
whom he sent ahead of him in pairs
to every town and place he intended to visit.
He said to them,
�The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest.
Go on your way;
behold, I am sending you like Iambs among wolves.
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals;
and greet no one along the way.
Into whatever house you enter, first say,
'Peace to this household.'
If a peaceful person lives there,
your peace will rest on him;
but if not, it will return to you.
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you,
for the laborer deserves his pay.
Do not move about from one house to another.
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you,
eat what is set before you,
cure the sick in it and say to them,
'The Kingdom of God is at hand for you.'"
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, quaesumus, Domine, munera populi tui, pro beatorum tuorum
Timothei et Titi festivitate delata, et sincero nos corde perfice
benignus acceptos.
Receive, O Lord, we pray, the offerings of your people,
which we bring in celebration of Saints Timothy and Titus,
and, in your kindness, render us fully acceptable
by giving us sincerity of heart.
Through Christ our Lord.

Euntes in mundum universum, praedicate Evangelium: ego vobiscum sum
omnibus diebus, dicit Dominus.
Go into all the world, and proclaim the Gospel.
I am with you always, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Sacramenta quae sumpsimus, Domine Deus noster, illam nobis fidem
innutriant, quam et apostolica docuit praedicatio, et beatorum Timothei
et Titi sollicitudo custodivit.
May the Sacrament we have received, O Lord our God,
nourish in us that faith
taught by the preaching of the Apostles
and kept safe by the labors of Saints Timothy and Titus.
Through Christ our Lord.

The Office of Readings

From a homily by Saint John Chrysostom , bishop
(Hom. 2 de laudibus sanct Pauli: PG 50, 480-484)
I have fought the good fight
Though housed in a narrow prison, Paul dwelt in heaven. He accepted
beatings and wounds more readily than others reach out for rewards.
Sufferings he loved as much as prizes; indeed he regarded them as his
prizes, and therefore called them a grace or gift. Reflect on what this
means. To depart and be with Christ was certainly a reward, while
remaining in the flesh meant struggle. Yet such was his longing for
Christ that he wanted to defer his reward and remain amid the fight;
those were his priorities.

Now, to be separated from the company of Christ meant struggle and pain
for Paul; in fact, it was a greater affliction than any struggle or
pain would be. On the other hand, to be with Christ was a matchless
reward. Yet, for the sake of Christ, Paul chose the separation.

But, you may say: “Because of Christ, Paul found all this pleasant.” I
cannot deny that, for he derived intense pleasure from what saddens us.
I need not think only of perils and hardships. It was true even of the
intense sorrow that made him cry out: Who is weak that I do not share
the weakness? Who is scandalised that I am not consumed with
indignation?

I urge you not simply to admire but also to imitate this splendid
example of virtue, for, if we do, we can share his crown as well.

Are you surprised at my saying that if you have Paul’s merits, you will
share that same reward? Then listen to Paul himself: I have fought the
good fight, I have run the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth a
crown of justice awaits me, and the Lord, who is a just judge, will
give it to me on that day – and not to me alone, but to those who
desire his coming. You see how he calls all to share the same glory?

Now, since the same crown of glory is offered to all, let us eagerly
strive to become worthy of these promised blessings.

In thinking of Paul we should not consider only his noble and lofty
virtues or the strong and ready will that disposed him for such great
graces. We should also realise that he shares our nature in every
respect. If we do, then even what is very difficult will seem to us
easy and light; we shall work hard during the short time we have on
earth and someday we shall wear the incorruptible, immortal crown. This
we shall do by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
all glory and power belongs now and always through endless ages. Amen.
RESPONSORY          1 Timothy 6:11-12; Titus 2:1
Man of God, you must strive for holiness, goodness, fidelity,
love, patience and gentleness.
- Fight the good fight of faith,
and win the prize of eternal life.

Preach nothing but sound doctrine.
- Fight the good fight of faith,
and win the prize of eternal life.
