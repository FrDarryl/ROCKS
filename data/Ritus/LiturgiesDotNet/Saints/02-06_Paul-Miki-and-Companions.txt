From the Common of Martyrs: For Several Martyrs
COLLECT
Deus, omnium fortitudo sanctorum, qui beatos martyres Paulum eiusque
socios per crucem ad vitam vocare dignatus es, praesta, quaesumus, ut,
eorum intercessione, fidem quam profitemur usque ad mortem fortiter
teneamus.
O God, strength of all the Saints,
who through the Cross were pleased to call
the Martyrs Saint Paul Miki and companions to life,
grant, we pray, that by their intercession
we may hold with courage even until death
to the faith that we profess.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Galatians 2:19-20
Brothers and sisters:
Through the law I died to the law,
that I might live for God.
I have been crucified with Christ;
yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me;
insofar as I now live in the flesh,
I live by faith in the Son of God
who has loved me and given himself up for me.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM Ps. 126:1-2, 2-3, 4-5, 6
Qui seminant in lacrimis, in exsultatione metent.
R./ Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion,
then we thought we were dreaming.
Our mouths were filled with laughter;
our tongues sang for joy.
R./ Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then it was said among the nations,
"The LORD had done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us;
Oh, how happy we were!
R./ Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore again our fortunes, LORD,
like the dry stream beds of the Negeb.
Those who sow in tears
will reap with cries of joy.
R./ Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Those who go forth weeping,
carrying sacks of seed,
Will return with cries of joy,
carrying their bundled sheaves.
R./ Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Mt. 28:19a, 20b
Euntes docete omnes gentes, dicit Dominus: ego vobiscum sum omnibus
diebus usque ad consummationem saeculi.
Go and teach all nations, says the Lord
I am with you always, until the end of the world.
GOSPEL          Matthew 28:16-20
The Eleven disciples went to Galilee,
to the mountain to which Jesus had ordered them.
When they saw him, they worshiped, but they doubted.
Then Jesus approached and said to them,
"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
And behold, I am with yon always, until the end of the age."

Paul Miki and companions

From the Common of Several Martyrs, except the following:

Office of Readings

From an account of the martyrdom of Saint Paul Miki and his companions,
by a contemporary writer
(Cap. 14, 109-110; Acta Sanctorum Febr.1, 769)
You shall be my witnesses
The crosses were set in place. Father Pasio and Father Rodriguez took
turns encouraging the victims. Their steadfast behaviour was wonderful
to see. The Father Bursar stood motionless, his eyes turned heavenward.
Brother Martin gave thanks to God�s goodness by singing psalms. Again
and again he repeated: �Into your hands, Lord, I entrust my life.�
Brother Francis Branco also thanked God in a loud voice. Brother
Gonsalvo in a very loud voice kept saying the Our Father and Hail Mary.
Our brother, Paul Miki, saw himself standing now in the noblest pulpit
he had ever filled. To his �congregation� he began by proclaiming
himself a Japanese and a Jesuit. He was dying for the Gospel he
preached. He gave thanks to God for this wonderful blessing and he
ended his �sermon� with these words: �As I come to this supreme moment
of my life, I am sure none of you would suppose I want to deceive you.
And so I tell you plainly: there is no way to be saved except the
Christian way. My religion teaches me to pardon my enemies and all who
have offended me. I do gladly pardon the Emperor and all who have
sought my death. I beg them to seek baptism and be Christians
themselves.�
Then he looked at his comrades and began to encourage them in their
final struggle. Joy glowed in all their faces, and in Louis� most of
all. When a Christian in the crowd cried out to him that he would soon
be in heaven, his hands, his whole body strained upward with such joy
that every eye was fixed on him.
Anthony, hanging at Louis� side, looked toward heaven and called upon
the holy names � �Jesus, Mary!� He began to sing a psalm: �Praise the
Lord, you children!� (He learned it in catechism class in Nagasaki.
They take care there to teach the children some psalms to help them
learn their catechism).
Others kept repeating �Jesus, Mary!� Their faces were serene. Some of
them even took to urging the people standing by to live worthy
Christian lives. In these and other ways they showed their readiness to
die.
Then, according to Japanese custom, the four executioners began to
unsheathe their spears. At this dreadful sight, all the Christians
cried out, �Jesus, Mary!� And the storm of anguished weeping then rose
to batter the very skies. The executioners killed them one by one. One
thrust of the spear, then a second blow. It was over in a very short
time.
RESPONSORY          See Gal. 6:14, Phil 1:29
We must glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ;
in him is our salvation, life and resurrection.
- Through him we are saved and set free.
This grace has been given to you,
not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for his sake.
- Through him we are saved and set free.
COLLECT
O God, strength of all the Saints,
who through the Cross were pleased to call
the Martyrs Saint Paul Miki and companions to life,
grant, we pray, that by their intercession
we may hold with courage even until death
to the faith that we profess.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
