MASS

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Ezekiel 34:11,23-24
Isti sunt viri sancti facti amici Dei, divinae veritatis praeconio
gloriosi.
These are holy men who became friends of God,
glorious heralds of divine truth.
COLLECT
Deus, qui per beatos fratres Cyrillum et Methodium Slavoniae gentes
illuminasti, da cordibus nostris tuae doctrinae verba percipere, nosque
perfice populum in vera fide et recta confessione concordem.
O God, who enlightened the Slavic peoples
through the brothers Saints Cyril and Methodius,
grant that our hearts may grasp the words of your teaching,
and perfect us as a people of one accord
in true faith and right confession.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Acts 13:46-49
Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said,
"It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first,
but since you reject it
and condemn yourselves as unworthy of eternal life,
we now turn to the Gentiles.
For so the Lord has commanded us,
I have made you a light to the Gentiles,
that you may be an instrument of salvation
to the ends of the earth. "

The Gentiles were delighted when they heard this
and glorified the word of the Lord.
All who were destined for eternal life came to believe,
and the word of the Lord continued to spread
through the whole region.
REPONSORIAL PSALM          117:1bc,2
R. Go out to all the world and tell the good news.
Praise the Lord, all you nations;
glorifiy him, all you peoples!
R. Go out to all the world and tell the good news.
For steadfast is his kindness toward us,
and the fidelity of the Lord endures forever.
R. Go out to all the world and tell the good news.
ALLELUIA     Luke 4:18
Evangelizare pauperibus misit me Dominus, praedicare captivis
remissionem.
The Lord sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor,
and to proclaim liberty to captives.
GOSPEL          Luke 10:1-9
The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two disciples
whom he sent ahead of him in pairs
to every town and place he intended to visit.
He said to them,
"The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest.
Go on your way;
behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals;
and greet no one along the way.
Into whatever house you enter, first say,
'Peace to this household.'
If a peaceful person lives there,
your peace will rest on him;
but if not, it will return to you.
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you,
for the laborer deserves his payment.
Do not move about from one house to another.
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you,
eat what is set before you,
cure the sick in it and say to them,
'The Kingdom of God is at hand for you."'
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Respice, Domine, munera quae in commemoratione beatorum Cyrilli et
Methodii maiestati tuae deferimus, et praesta, ut signum fiant
humanitatis novae in dilectione caritatis tibi reconciliatae.
Look, O Lord, upon the offerings
which we bring before your majesty
in commemoration of Saints Cyril and Methodius,
and grant that these gifts may become the sign of a new humanity,
reconciled to you in loving charity.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          See Mark 16:20
Profecti sunt discipuli Evangelium praedicantes, Domino cooperante et
sermonem confirmante, sequentibus signis.
The disciples went forth and preached the Gospel,
while the Lord worked with them,
confirming the word through accompanying signs.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Deus, cunctarum Pater gentium, qui nos de uno pane et uno Spiritu
participes efficis ac aeterni heredes convivii, in hac festivitate
beatorum Cyrilli et Methodii benignus concede, ut tuorum multitudo
filiorum, in eadem fide perseverans, unanimis regnum iustitiae et pacis
aedificet.
God, Father of all nations,
who make us sharers in the one Bread and the one Spirit
and heirs of the eternal banquet,
grant in your kindness
on this feast day of Saints Cyril and Methodius,
that the multitude of your children,
persevering in the same faith,
may be united in building up
the Kingdom of justice and peace.
Through Christ our Lord.

Office of Readings

From an old Slavonic life of Constantine
(Cap. 18: Denkschriften der kaiserl. Akademie der Wissenschaften 19,
Viena 1870, p. 246)
Build up your Church and gather all into unity
Constantine, already burdened by many hardships, became ill. At one
point during his extended illness, he experienced a vision of God and
began to sing this verse: �My spirit rejoiced and my heart exulted
because they told me we shall go into the house of the Lord.�

Afterward he remained dressed in the vestments that were to be
venerated later, and rejoiced for an entire day saying: �From now on, I
am not the servant of the emperor or any man on earth, but of almighty
God alone. Before, I was dead, now I am alive and I shall live for
ever. Amen.�

The following day, he assumed the monastic habit and took the religious
name Cyril. He lived the life of a monk for fifty days.

When the time came for him to set out from this world to the peace of
his heavenly homeland, he prayed to God with his hands outstretched and
his eyes filled with tears: �O Lord, my God, you have created the
choirs of angels and spiritual powers; you have stretched forth the
heavens and established the earth, creating all that exists from
nothing. You hear those who obey your will and keep your commands in
holy fear. Hear my prayer and protect your faithful people, for you
have established me as their unsuitable and unworthy servant.

�Keep them free from harm and the worldly cunning of those who
blaspheme you. Build up your Church and gather all into unity. Make
your people known for the unity and profession of their faith. Inspire
the hearts of your people with your word and your teaching. You called
us to preach the Gospel of your Christ and to encourage them to lives
and works pleasing to you.

�I now return to you, your people, your gift to me. Direct them with
your powerful right hand, and protect them under the shadow of your
wings. May all praise and glorify your name, the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit. Amen.�

Once he had exchanged the gift of peace with everyone, he said:
�Blessed be God, who did not hand us over to our invisible enemy, but
freed us from his snare and delivered us from perdition.� He then fell
asleep in the Lord at the age of forty-two.

The Patriarch commanded all those in Rome, both the Greeks and Romans,
to gather for his funeral. They were to celebrate his funeral as if he
had been a pope. This they did.
RESPONSORY
Psalm 89:20, 21-22; Jeremiah 3:15
You spoke to your saints and told them:
I have exalted one chosen from the people;
I have found David my servant.
- With my holy oil I have anointed him;
the power of my hand will be with him.
I will give you shepherds after my own heart;
they will nourish you with knowledge and understanding.
- With my holy oil I have anointed him;
the power of my hand will be with him.
COLLECT
O God, who enlightened the Slavic peoples
through the brothers Saints Cyril and Methodius,
grant that our hearts may grasp the words of your teaching,
and perfect us as a people of one accord
in true faith and right confession.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
