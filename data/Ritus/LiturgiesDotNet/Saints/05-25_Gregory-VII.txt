From the Common of Pastors: For a Pope

COLLECT
Give to your Church, we pray, O Lord,
that spirit of fortitude and zeal for justice
which you made to shine forth in Pope Saint Gregory the Seventh,
so that, rejecting evil, she may be free
to carry out in charity whatever is right.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Acts 20:17-18a, 28-32, 36
From Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the
church. And when they came to him, he said to them:

"You yourselves know how I lived among you all the time. Take heed to
yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you
overseers, to care for the church of God which he obtained with the
blood of His own Son. I know that after my departure fierce wolves will
come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among your own
selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the
disciples after them. Therefore be alert, remembering that for three
years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears.
And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is
able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those
who are sanctified.

And when he had spoken thus, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 110:1,2,3,4
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORDsaid to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand
till I make your enemies your footstool."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The scepter of your power the LORDwill stretch forth from Zion:
"Rule in the midst of your enemies."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
"Yours is princely power in the day of your birth, in holy splendor;
before the daystar, like the dew, I have begotten you."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORDhas sworn, and he will not repent:
"You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
ALLELUIA          Mk:1-17 Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Matt 16:13-19
Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
his disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?" And they said,
"Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or
one of the prophets." He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and
blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. And
I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and
the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven."

SECOND READING
From a letter by Saint Gregory VII, pope
(Ep. 64 extra Registrum: PL, 148 709, 710)
The Church must be free, chaste and catholic

I beg and implore in the Lord Jesus, who redeemed us by his death, that
by careful investigation you may become aware of the trial and
distresses brought on me by the enemies of Christianity and understand
why and how I endure them.

By God's will Mother Church placed me in my unworthiness (and God knows
that I was unwilling, too) upon the apostolic throne, and with all my
powers I have tried to see that the holy Church, the bride of God, our
lady and mother, might return to the beauty which is rightly hers and
remain free, chaste and catholic. But, because this so greatly
displeases our ancient foe, he has armed his minions against us so that
they might overturn all our efforts. What he has been unable to do from
the days of Constantine the Great he now does against us and
particularly against the Apostolic See.  Do not be surprised that, as
the time goes on, he will fight all the harder to wipe out the
Christian religion.

But now, my dearest brothers, listen carefully to what I tell you. All
those throughout the world who are numbered as Christian and who truly
acknowledge the Christian faith know and believe that the blessed
Peter, the prince of the apostles, is the father of all Christians and,
after Christ, the first shepherd, and that the holy Roman Church is the
mother and teacher of all the churches. Therefore, if you believe this
and hold to it without hesitation, I ask you and enjoin upon you by
Almighty God - I, your brother and your unworthy teacher as I am - to
support and assist your father and your mother if you wish to have,
through them, the remission of all your  sins, along with blessing and
grace in this world and in the life to come.

May almighty God, from whom all good things come, continually enlighten
your minds and fill them with love for him and for your neighbor, so
that by your devotion you may deserve to make this father and mother of
whom I have spoken your debtors and enter without shame into their
company. Amen.
RESPONSORY
The Lord glorified him in the sight of kings
and gave him commandments for his people.
God revealed to him his glory, alleluia.

The Lord chose him to be a servant,
a shepherd of his own Israel.
God revealed to him his glory, alleluia.
COLLECT
Give to your Church, we pray, O Lord,
that spirit of fortitude and zeal for justice
which you made to shine forth in Pope Saint Gregory the Seventh,
so that, rejecting evil, she may be free
to carry out in charity whatever is right.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
