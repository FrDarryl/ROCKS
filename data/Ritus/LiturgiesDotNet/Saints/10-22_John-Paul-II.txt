John Paul II

From the Common of Pastors: popes, except the following:

Office of Readings

From the Homily of Blessed John Paul II, Pope,
for the Inauguration of his Pontificate
Do not be afraid. Open wide the doors for Christ.

Peter came to Rome! What else but obedience to the inspiration received
from the Lord could have guided him and brought him to this city, the
heart of the Empire? Perhaps the fisherman of Galilee did not want to
come here. Perhaps he would have preferred to stay there, on the shores
of Lake of Genesareth, with his boat and his nets. Yet guided by the
Lord, obedient to his inspiration, he came here!

According to an ancient tradition, Peter tried to leave Rome during
Nero' persecution. However, the Lord intervened and came to meet him.
Peter spoke to him and asked. "Quo vadis, Domine?" -- "Where are you
going, Lord?" And the Lord answered him at once: "I am going to Rome to
be crucified again." Peter went back to Rome and stayed here until his
crucifixion.

Our time calls us, urges us, obliges us, to gaze on the Lord and to
immerse ourselves in humble and devout meditation on the mystery of the
supreme power of Christ himself.

He who was born of the Virgin Mary, the carpenter' Son (as he was
thought to be), the Son of the living God (as confessed by Peter), came
to make us all "a kingdom of priests".

The Second Vatican Council has reminded us of the mystery of this power
and of the fact that Christ' mission as Priest, Prophet-Teacher and
King continues in the Church. Everyone, the whole People of God, shares
in this threefold mission. Perhaps in the past the tiara, that triple
crown, was placed on the Pope' head in order to signify by that symbol
the Lord' plan for his Church, namely that all the hierarchical order
of Christ' Church, all "sacred power" exercised in the Church, is
nothing other than service, service with a single purpose: to ensure
that the whole People of God shares in this threefold mission of Christ
and always remains under the power of the Lord; a power that has its
source not in the powers of this world, but instead in the mystery of
the Cross and the Resurrection.

The absolute, and yet sweet and gentle, power of the Lord responds to
the whole depths of the human person, to his loftiest aspirations of
intellect, will and heart. It does not speak the language of force, but
expresses itself in charity and truth.

The new Successor of Peter in the See of Rome today makes a fervent,
humble and trusting prayer: Christ, make me become and remain the
servant of your unique power, the servant of your sweet power, the
servant of your power that knows no dusk. Make me a servant: indeed,
the servant of your servants.

Brothers and sisters, do not be afraid to welcome Christ and accept his
power. Help the Pope and all those who wish to serve Christ and with
Christ' power to serve the human person and the whole of mankind.

Do not be afraid. Open, I say open wide the doors for Christ. To his
saving power open the boundaries of states, economic and political
systems, the vast fields of culture, civilization and development. Do
not be afraid. Christ knows "that which is in man". He alone knows it.

So often today, man does not know that which is in him, in the depths
of his mind and heart. So often he is uncertain about the meaning of
his life on this earth. He is assailed by doubt, a doubt which turns
into despair. We ask you, therefore, we beg you with humility and with
trust, let Christ speak to man. He alone has words of life, yes, of
life eternal.
RESPONSORY           2 Corinthians 4:11,16
Do not be afraid. The Redeemer of mankind has revealed the power of the
Cross and has given his life for us.
- Open, open wide the doors for Christ.
In the Church we are called to partake of his power.
- Open, open wide the doors for Christ.
