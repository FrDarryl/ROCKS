Deus, qui beatam Claram ad paupertatis amorem misericorditer adduxisti,
eius nobis intercessione concede, ut, in paupertate spiritus Christum
sequentes, ad tui contemplationem in caelesti regno pervenire mereamur.
O God, who in your mercy led Saint Clare to a love of poverty,
grant, through her intercession,
that, following Christ in poverty of spirit,
we may merit to contemplate you
one day in the heavenly Kingdom.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Phil 3:8-14
Brothers and sisters:
I consider everything as a loss
because of the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
For his sake I have accepted the loss of all things
and I consider them so much rubbish,
that I may gain Christ and be found in him,
not having any righteousness of my own based on the law
but that which comes through faith in Christ,
the righteousness from God,
depending on faith to know him and the power of his resurrection
and the sharing of his sufferings by being conformed to his death,
if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

It is not that I have already taken hold of it
or have already attained perfect maturity,
but I continue my pursuit in hope that I may possess it,
since I have indeed been taken possession of by Christ Jesus.
Brothers and sisters, I for my part
do not consider myself to have taken possession.
Just one thing: forgetting what lies behind
but straining forward to what lies ahead,
I continue my pursuit toward the goal,
the prize of God's upward calling, in Christ Jesus.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          16:1-2ab;5,7-8;11
Tu es, Domine, pars heredidatis meae.
R. (see 5a) You are my inheritance, O Lord.
Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;
I say to the LORD, “My Lord are you.”
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
They multiply their sorrows
who court other gods.
Blood libations to them I will not pour out,
nor will I take their names upon my lips.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
O LORD, my allotted portion and cup,
you it is who hold fast my lot.
I set the LORD ever before me;
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
You will show me the path to life,
fullness of joys in your presence,
the delights at your right hand forever.
R. You are my inheritance, O Lord.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:3
Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are the poor in spirit;
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Matt 19:27-29
Peter said to Jesus,
"We have given up everything and followed you.
What will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "Amen, I say to you
that you who have followed me, in the new age,
when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory,
will yourselves sit on twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters
or father or mother or children or lands
for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more,
and will inherit eternal life."

SECOND READING

A letter of St Clare to Blessed Agnes of Prague
(Edit . I. Omaechevarria, Escritos de Santa Clara, Madrid 1970, pp.
339-341)

His Indescribable Delights

Happy indeed is she who is granted a place at the divine banquet, for
she may cling with her inmost heart to him whose beauty eternally awes
the blessed hosts of heaven; to him whose love inspires love, whose
contemplation refreshes, whose generosity satisfies, whose gentleness
delights, whose memory shines sweetly as the dawn; to him whose
fragrance revives the dead, and whose glorious vision will bless all
the citizens of that heavenly Jerusalem. For his is the splendor of
eternal glory, the brightness of eternal light, and the mirror without
cloud.

Queen and bride of Jesus Christ, look into that mirror daily and study
well your reflection, that you may adorn yourself, mind and body, with
an enveloping garment of every virtue, and thus find yourself attired
in flowers and gowns befitting the daughter and most chaste bride of
the king on high. In this mirror blessed poverty, holy humility and
ineffable love are also reflected. With the grace of God the whole
mirror will be your source of contemplation.

Behold, I say, the birth of this mirror. Behold his poverty even as he
was laid in the manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes. What wondrous
humility, what marvelous poverty! The King of angels, the Lord of
heaven and earth resting in a manger! Look more deeply into the mirror
and meditate on his humility, or simply on his poverty. Behold the many
labors and sufferings he endured to redeem the human race. Then, in the
depths of this very mirror, ponder his unspeakable love which caused
him to suffer on the wood of the cross and to endure the most shameful
kind of death. The mirror himself, from his position on the cross,
warned passersby to weigh carefully this act, as he said: All of you
who pass by  this way, behold and see if there is any sorrow like mine.
Let us answer his cries and lamentations with one voice and one spirit;
I will be mindful and remember, and my soul will be consumed within me.
In this way, queen of the king of heaven, your love will burn with an
ever brighter flame.

Consider also his indescribable delights, his unending riches and
honors, and sigh for what is beyond your love and heart's content as
you cry out: Draw me on! We will run after you in the perfume of your
ointment, heavenly spouse. Let me run and not faint until you lead me
into your wine cellar; your left hand rests  under my head, your right
arm joyfully embraces me, and you kiss me with the sweet kiss of your
lips. As you rest in this state of contemplation, remember your poor
mother and know that I have indelibly written your happy memory into my
heart, for you are dearer to me than all the others.
RESPONSORY          Psalm 73:26; Philippians 3:8-9
Though my flesh and my heart may fail,
- God is my strength
and my portion for ever.
I count all that this world offers as worthless,
that I may gain Christ
and be found in him.
- God is my strength
and my portion for ever.
