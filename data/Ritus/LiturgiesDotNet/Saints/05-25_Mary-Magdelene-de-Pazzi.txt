O God, lover of virginity,
who adorned with heavenly gifts
the Virgin Saint Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi,
setting her on fire with your love,
grant, we pray, that we, who honor her today,
may imitate her example of purity and love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 7:25-35
Now concerning the unmarried, I have no command of the Lord, but I give
my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. I think that
in view of the present distress it is well for a person to remain as he
is. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from
a wife? Do not seek marriage. But if you marry, you do not sin, and if
a girl marries she does not sin. Yet those who marry will have worldly
troubles, and I would spare you that. I mean, brethren, the appointed
time has grown very short; from now on, let those who have wives live
as though they had none, and those who mourn as though they were not
mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and
those who buy as though they had no goods, and those who deal with the
world as though they had no dealings with it. For the form of this
world is passing away.
I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious
about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord; but the married
man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife, and his
interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or girl is anxious about
the affairs of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit; but the
married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please her
husband. I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon
you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to
the Lord.

GOSPEL          Mark 3:31-35
Jesus' mother and his brethren came; and standing outside they sent to
him and called him. And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to
him, "Your mother and your brethren are outside, asking for you." And
he replied, "Who are my mother and my brethren?" And looking around on
those who sat about him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brethren!
Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From the writings On Revelation and On Trials by Saint Mary Magadalene
de Pazzi, Virgin
(Mss III 186, 264; IV, 716: Opere di S.M. Maddalena de Pazzi, Firenze,
1965, 4, pp 200, 269: 6, p. 194)
Come,Holy Spirit
You, the Word, are most wonderful, working through the Holy Spirit to
fill the soul with yourself, so that it is joined to God, grasps God,
tastes God and absorbs nothing but God.

The Holy Spirit comes into the soul signed with the precious seal of
the blood of the Word and of the slain Lamb; or rather that very blood
urges it to come, although the Spirit moves itself and desires to come.

This Spirit which moves in itself is the substance of the Father and of
the Word, and it proceeds from the essence of the Father and the good
will of the Word; it comes into the soul like a fountain, and the soul
is immersed in it.  Just as two rushing rivers intermingle in such a
way that the smaller loses its name and is absorbed into the larger, so
the divine Spirit acts upon the soul and absorbs it. It is proper that
the soul, which is lesser, should lose its name and surrender to the
Spirit, as it will if it turns entirely toward the Spirit and is
united.

This Spirit, dispenser of the treasures which lay in the lap of the
Father, and guardian of the deliberations which pass between the Father
and the Son, flows into the soul so sweetly and imperceptibly that few
esteem its greatness.

It moves itself by its own weight and lightness into all places that
are fitting and disposed to receive it. Its word is heard by all in the
most attentive silence; through the impetus of love, the unmoved yet
most perfect mover infuses itself into all.

You do not, O Holy Spirit, stand still in the unmoved Father or in the
Word, and yet you are always in the Father and in the Word and in
yourself and in all blessed spirits and creatures. You are the friend
of the created because of the blood shed by the only-begotten Word, who
in the greatness of his love made himself the friend of the created.
You find rest in creatures who are prepared to receive you, so that in
the transmission of your gifts they take on, through purity, their own
particular likeness to you. You find rest in those creatures who absorb
the effects of the blood of the Word and make themselves a worthy
dwelling place for you.

Come, Holy Spirit. Let the precious pearl of the Father and the Word's
delight come. Spirit of truth, you are the reward of the saints, the
comforter of souls, light in the darkness, riches to the poor, treasure
to lovers, food for the hungry, comfort to those who are wandering; to
sum up, you are the one in whom all treasures are contained.

Come! As you descended upon Mary that the Word might become flesh, work
in us through graces as you worked in her through nature and grace.

Come! Food of every chaste thought, fountain of all mercy, sum of all
purity.

Come! Consume in us whatever prevents us from being consumed in you.
RESPONSORY          1 Corinthians 2:9-10
No eye has seen, no ear heard,
nor has the heart of man conceived
- the marvels God has prepared for those who love him, alleluia.
These things God has revealed to us through his Spirit.
- the marvels God has prepared for those who love him, alleluia.
