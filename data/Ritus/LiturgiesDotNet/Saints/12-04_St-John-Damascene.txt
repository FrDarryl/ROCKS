Beloved:
Take as your norm the sound words that you heard from me,
in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
Guard this rich trust with the help of the Holy Spirit
that dwells within us.
My child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
And what you heard from me through many witnesses
entrust to faithful people
who will have the ability to teach others as well.
Bear your share of hardship along with me
like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

ALLELUIA          John 14:23
Si quis diligit me, sermonem meum servabit, dicit Dominus; et Pater
meus diligit eum, et ad eum veniemus.
Whoever loves me will keep my word, says the Lord;
and my Father will love him and we will come to him.
GOSPEL          Matthew 25:14-30 [Short reading: Matthew 25:14-23]
Jesus told his disciples this parable:
"A man going on a journey
called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one--
to each according to his ability.
Then he went away.
Immediately the one who received five talents went and traded with
them,
and made another five.
Likewise, the one who received two made another two.
But the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground
and buried his master's money.
After a long time
the master of those servants came back
and settled accounts with them.
The one who had received five talents
came forward bringing the additional five.
He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents.
See, I have made five more.'
His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant.
Since you were faithful in small matters,
I will give you great responsibilities.
Come, share your master's joy.'
Then the one who had received two talents also came forward and said,
'Master, you gave me two talents.
See, I have made two more.'
His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant.
Since you were faithful in small matters,
I will give you great responsibilities.
Come, share your master's joy.'
[Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said,
'Master, I knew you were a demanding person,
harvesting where you did not plant
and gathering where you did not scatter;
so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground.
Here it is back.'
His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant!
So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant
and gather where I did not scatter?
Should you not then have put my money in the bank
so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?
Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.
For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich;
but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside,
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'" ]

SECOND READING
From The Statement of Faith by St. John Damascene, priest
(Cap 1 PG 95, 417-419)

You have called me, Lord, to minister to your people

O Lord, you led me from my father�s loins and formed me in my mother�s
womb. You brought me, a naked babe, into the light of day, for nature�s
laws always obey your commands.

By the blessing of the Holy Spirit, you prepared my creation and my
existence, not because man willed it or flesh desired it, but by your
ineffable grace. The birth you prepared for me was such that it
surpassed the laws of our nature. You sent me forth into the light by
adopting me as your son and you enrolled me among the children of your
holy and spotless Church.

You nursed me with the spiritual milk of your divine utterances. You
kept me alive with the solid food of the body of Jesus Christ, your
only-begotten Son for our redemption. And he undertook the task
willingly and did not shrink from it. Indeed, he applied himself to it
as though destined for sacrifice, like an innocent lamb. Although he
was God, he became man, and in his human will, became obedient to you,
God his Father, unto death, even death on a cross.

In this way you have humbled yourself, Christ my God, so that you might
carry me, your stray sheep, on your shoulders. You let me graze in
green pastures, refreshing me with the waters of orthodox teaching at
the hands of your shepherds. You pastured these shepherds, and now they
in turn tend your chosen and special flock. Now you have called me,
Lord, by the hand of your bishop to minister to your people. I do not
know why you have done so, for you alone know that. Lord, lighten the
heavy burden of the sins through which I have seriously transgressed.
Purify my mind and heart. Like a shining lamp, lead me along the
straight path. When I open my mouth, tell me what I should say. By the
fiery tongue of your Spirit make my own tongue ready. Stay with me
always and keep me in your sight.

Lead me to pastures, Lord, and graze there with me. Do not let my heart
lean either to the right or to the left, but let your good Spirit guide
me along the straight path. Whatever I do, let it be in accordance with
your will, now until the end.

And you, O Church, are a most excellent assembly, the noble summit of
perfect purity, whose assistance comes from God. You in whom God lives,
receive from us an exposition of the faith that is free from error, to
strengthen the Church, just as our Fathers handed it down to us.
RESPONSORY        Malachi 2:6; Psalm 89:22
True teaching was in his mouth;
no evil was ever found on his lips.
He walked with me in goodness and in peace.
My hand will be steady to help him,
my arm will give him strength. He walked with me in goodness and in
peace.
COLLECT
Grant, we pray, O Lord,
that we may be helped by the prayers
of the Priest Saint John Damascene,
so that the true faith,
which he excelled in teaching,
may always be our light and our strength.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
