1 John 3:13-16
Psalm 34:1-8 or Psalm 31:1-5
Matthew 10:34-42

Collect:
Almighty God,
by whose grace and power your holy martyr Alban triumphed over
suffering
and was faithful even to death:
Grant us, who now remember him in thanksgiving,
to be so faithful in our witness to you in this world,
that we may receive with him the crown of life;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever. Amen.
1 John 3:13-16
Do not be astonished, brothers and sisters, that the world hates you.
We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one
another. Whoever does not love abides in death. All who hate a brother
or sister are murderers, and you know that murderers do not have
eternal life abiding in them. We know love by this, that he laid down
his life for us-- and we ought to lay down our lives for one another.
Psalm 34:1-8
Benedicam Domine

1
I will bless the LORD at all times; *
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.

2
I will glory in the LORD; *
let the humble hear and rejoice.

3
Proclaim with me the greatness of the LORD; *
let us exalt his Name together.

4
I sought the LORD, and he answered me *
and delivered me out of all my terror.

5
Look upon him and be radiant, *
and let not your faces be ashamed.

6
I called in my affliction and the LORD heard me *
and saved me from all my troubles.

7
The angel of the LORD encompasses those who fear him, *
and he will deliver them.

8
Taste and see that the LORD is good; *
happy are they who trust in him!

Or:
Psalm 31
In te, Domine, speravi

1
In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;
let me never be put to shame; *
deliver me in your righteousness.

2
Incline your ear to me; *
make haste to deliver me.

3
Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.

4
Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *
for you are my tower of strength.

5
Into your hands I commend my spirit, *
for you have redeemed me,
O LORD, O God of truth.

Matthew 10:34-42
Jesus said, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth;
I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.

For I have come to set a man against his father,
and a daughter against her mother,
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
and one's foes will be members of one's own household.

Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and
whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and
whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life
for my sake will find it.

"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the
one who sent me. Whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet
will receive a prophet's reward; and whoever welcomes a righteous
person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the
righteous; and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these
little ones in the name of a disciple-- truly I tell you, none of these
will lose their reward."
