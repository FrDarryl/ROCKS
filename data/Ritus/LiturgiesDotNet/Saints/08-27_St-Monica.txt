COLLECT
Deus, maerentium consolator, qui beatae Monicae pias lacrimas in
conversione filii sui Augustini misericorditer suscepisti, da nobis,
utriusque interventu, peccata nostra deplorare, et gratiae tuae
indulgentiam invenire.
O God, who console the sorrowful
and who mercifully accepted
the motherly tears of Saint Monica
for the conversion of her son Augustine,
grant us, through the intercession of them both,
that we may bitterly regret our sins
and find the grace of your pardon.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ecclesiasticus 26:1-4,13-16
Blessed the husband of a good wife,
twice-lengthened are his days;
A worthy wife brings joy to her husband,
peaceful and full is his life.
A good wife is a generous gift
bestowed upon him who fears the Lord;
Be he rich or poor, his heart is content,
and a smile is ever on his face.

A gracious wife delights her husband,
her thoughtfulness puts flesh on his bones;
A gift from the Lord is her governed speech,
and her firm virtue is of surpassing worth.
Choicest of blessings is a modest wife,
priceless her chaste soul.
A holy and decent woman adds grace upon grace;
indeed, no price is worthy of her temperate soul.
Like the sun rising in the Lord�s heavens,
the beauty of a virtuous wife is the radiance of her home.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          131:1bcde, 2, 3
Custodi animam meam in pace apud te, Domine.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
O LORD, my heart is not proud,
nor are my eyes haughty;
I busy not myself with great things,
nor with things too sublime for me.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
Nay rather, I have stilled and quieted
my soul like a weaned child.
Like a weaned child on its mother's lap,
so is my soul within me.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
O Israel, hope in the LORD,
both now and forever.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
est regnum caelorum
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness;
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Luke 7:11-17
Jesus journeyed to a city called Nain,
and his disciples and a large crowd accompanied him.
As he drew near to the gate of the city,
a man who had died was being carried out,
the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.
A large crowd from the city was with her.
When the Lord saw her,
he was moved with pity for her and said to her,
�Do not weep.�
He stepped forward and touched the coffin;
at this the bearers halted,
and he said, �Young man, I tell you, arise!�
The dead man sat up and began to speak,
and Jesus gave him to his mother.
Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, exclaiming,
�A great prophet has arisen in our midst,�
and �God has visited his people.�
This report about him spread through the whole of Judea
and in all the surrounding region.

The Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From the Confessions of St. Augustine, bishop
(Lib. 9,10-11:CSEL 33, 215-219)
Let us gain eternal wisdom
The day was now approaching when my mother Monica would depart from
this life; you know that day, Lord, though we did not. She and I
happened to be standing by ourselves at a window that overlooked the
garden in the courtyard of the house. At the time we were in Ostia on
the Tiber. And so the two of us, all alone, were enjoying a very
pleasant conversation, "forgetting the past and pushing on to what is
ahead.." We were asking one another in the presence of the Truth - for
you are the Truth - what it would be like to share the eternal life
enjoyed by the saints, which "eye has not seen, nor ear heard, which
has not even entered into the heart of man." We desired with all our
hearts to drink from the streams of your heavenly fountain, the
fountain of life.

That was the substance of our talk, though not the exact words. But you
know, O Lord, that in the course of our conversation that day, the
world and its pleasures lost all their attraction for us. My mother
said, "Son, as far as I am concerned, nothing in this life now gives me
any pleasure. I do not know why I am still here, since I have no
further hopes in this world. I did have one reason for wanting to live
a little longer: to see you become a Catholic Christian before I died.
God has lavished his gifts on me in that respect, for I know that you
have even renounced earthly happiness to be his servant. So what am I
doing here?"

I do not really remember how I answered her. Shortly, within five days
or thereabouts, she fell sick with a fever. Then one day during the
course of her illness she became unconscious and for a while she was
unaware of her surroundings. My brother and I rushed to her side, but
she regained consciousness quickly. She looked at us as we stood there
and asked in a puzzled voice: "Where was I?"

We were overwhelmed with grief, but she held her gaze steadily upon us,
and spoke further: "Here you shall bury your mother." I remained silent
as I held back my tears. However, my brother haltingly expressed his
hope that she might not die in a strange country but in her own land,
since her end would be happier there. When she heard this, her face was
filled with anxiety, and she reproached him with a glance because he
had entertained such earthly thoughts. Then she looked at me and spoke:
"Look what he is saying." Thereupon she said to both of us, "Bury my
body wherever you will; let not care of it cause you any concern. One
thing only I ask you, that you remember me at the altar of the Lord
wherever you may be." Once our mother had expressed this desire as best
she could, she fell silent as the pain of her illness increased.
RESPONSORY          1 Cor. 7:29,30,31;2:12
The time is growing short,
so we must rejoice as though we were not rejoicing;
we must work in the world yet without becoming immersed in it,
- for the world as we know it is passing away.
We have not adopted the spirit of the world.
- For the world as we know it is passing away.
