O God of peace, by whose grace the abbess Hilda was endowed with gifts
of justice, prudence, and strength to rule as a wise mother over the
nuns and monks of her household, and to become a trusted and
reconciling friend to leaders of the Church: Give us the grace to
recognize and accept the varied gifts you bestow on men and women, that
our common life may be enriched and your gracious will be done; through
Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

First Reading
Ephesians 4:1-6

I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of
the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and
gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, making
every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one
hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
Father of all, who is above all and through all and in all.

The Psalm
Psalm 122
Laetatus sum

1
I was glad when they said to me, *
"Let us go to the house of the LORD."

2
Now our feet are standing *
within your gates, O Jerusalem.

3
Jerusalem is built as a city *
that is at unity with itself;

4
To which the tribes go up,
the tribes of the LORD, *
the assembly of Israel,
to praise the Name of the LORD.

5
For there are the thrones of judgment, *
the thrones of the house of David.

6
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: *
"May they prosper who love you.

7
Peace be within your walls *
and quietness within your towers.

8
For my brethren and companions' sake, *
I pray for your prosperity.

9
Because of the house of the LORD our God, *
I will seek to do you good."

or
Psalm 33:1-5, 20-21
Exultate, justi

1
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; *
it is good for the just to sing praises.

2
Praise the LORD with the harp; *
play to him upon the psaltery and lyre.

3
Sing for him a new song; *
sound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet.

4
For the word of the LORD is right, *
and all his works are sure.

5
He loves righteousness and justice; *
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.

20
Our soul waits for the LORD; *
he is our help and our shield.

21
Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, *
for in his holy Name we put our trust.

Gospel Reading
Matthew 19:27-29

Peter replied to Jesus, "Look, we have left everything and followed
you. What then will we have?" Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I
tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man is seated
on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me will also sit on
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who
has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children
or fields, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will
inherit eternal life.
