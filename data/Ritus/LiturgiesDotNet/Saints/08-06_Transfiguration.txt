ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf Matt:17:5
In splendenti nube Spiritus Sanctus visus est, paterna vox audita est;
Hic est Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi bene conplacuit; ipsum
audite.
In a resplendent cloud the Holy Spirit appeared.
The Father's voice was heard: This is my beloved Son,
with whom I am well pleased.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui fidei sacramenta in Unigeniti tui gloriosa Transfiguratione
patrum testimonio roborasti, et adoptionem filiorum perfectam
mirabiliter praesignasti, concede nobis famulis tuis, ut, ipsius
dilecti Filii tui vocem audientes, eiusdem coheredes effici mereamur.
O God, who in the glorious Transfiguration
of your Only Begotten Son
confirmed the mysteries of faith by the witness of the Fathers
and wonderfully prefigured our full adoption to sonship,
grant, we pray, to your servants,
that, listening to the voice of your beloved Son,
we may merit to become co-heirs with him.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14
As I watched:

Thrones were set up
and the Ancient One took his throne.
His clothing was bright as snow,
and the hair on his head as white as wool;
his throne was flames of fire,
with wheels of burning fire.
A surging stream of fire
flowed out from where he sat;
Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him,
and myriads upon myriads attended him.
The court was convened and the books were opened.

As the visions during the night continued, I saw:

One like a Son of man coming,
on the clouds of heaven;
When he reached the Ancient One
and was presented before him,
The one like a Son of man received dominion, glory, and kingship;
all peoples, nations, and languages serve him.
His dominion is an everlasting dominion
that shall not be taken away,
his kingship shall not be destroyed.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 97:1-2, 5-6, 9
Dominus regnavit, Altissimus super omnem terram.
R. (1a and 9a) The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth.
The LORD is king; let the earth rejoice;
let the many islands be glad.
Clouds and darkness are round about him,
justice and judgment are the foundation of his throne.
R. The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth.
The mountains melt like wax before the LORD,
before the LORD of all the earth.
The heavens proclaim his justice,
and all peoples see his glory.
R. The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth.
Because you, O LORD, are the Most High over all the earth,
exalted far above all gods.
R. The Lord is king, the Most High over all the earth.
SECOND READING           2 Pt 1:16-19
Beloved:
We did not follow cleverly devised myths
when we made known to you
the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty.
For he received honor and glory from God the Father
when that unique declaration came to him from the majestic glory,
"This is my Son, my beloved, with whom I am well pleased."
We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven
while we were with him on the holy mountain.
Moreover, we possess the prophetic message that is altogether reliable.
You will do well to be attentive to it,
as to a lamp shining in a dark place,
until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 17:5c
Hic est Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi bene conplacuit; ipsum
audite.
This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased;
listen to him.

GOSPEL READING

Year A
Matthew 17:1-9

Year B
Mark 9:2-10

Year C
Luke 9:28b-36

GOSPEL           Year A          Matt 17:1-9
Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John,
and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And he was transfigured before them;
his face shone like the sun
and his clothes became white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them,
conversing with him.
Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,
�Lord, it is good that we are here.
If you wish, I will make three tents here,
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.�
While he was still speaking, behold,
a bright cloud cast a shadow over them,
then from the cloud came a voice that said,
�This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased;
listen to him.�
When the disciples heard this, they fell prostrate and were very much
afraid.
But Jesus came and touched them, saying,
�Rise, and do not be afraid.�
And when the disciples raised their eyes,
they saw no one else but Jesus alone.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
�Do not tell the vision to anyone until the Son of Man has been raised
from the dead.�

GOSPEL           Year B           Mark 9:2-10
Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John,
and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves.
And he was transfigured before them,
and his clothes became dazzling white,
such as no fuller on earth could bleach them.
Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses,
and they were conversing with Jesus.
Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,
"Rabbi, it is good that we are here!
Let us make three tents:
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified.
Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them;
from the cloud came a voice,
"This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."
Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone
but Jesus alone with them.

As they were coming down from the mountain,
he charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone,
except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
So they kept the matter to themselves,
questioning what rising from the dead meant.

GOSPEL           Year C           Luke 9:28b-36
Jesus took Peter, John, and James and went up a mountain to pray.
While he was praying his face changed in appearance
and his clothing became dazzling white.
And behold, two men were conversing with him, Moses and Elijah,
who appeared in glory and spoke of his exodus
that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem.
Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep,
but becoming fully awake,
they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
As they were about to part from him,
Peter said to Jesus,
�Master, it is good that we are here;
let us make three tents,
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.�
But he did not know what he was saying.
While he was still speaking,
a cloud came and cast a shadow over them,
and they became frightened when they entered the cloud.
Then from the cloud came a voice that said,
�This is my chosen Son; listen to him.�
After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone.
They fell silent and did not at that time tell anyone what they had
seen.
When this feast falls on a Sunday, the Creed is said
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Oblata munera, quaesumus, Domine, gloriosa Unigeniti tui
Transfiguratione sanctifica, nosque a peccatorum maculis, splendoribus
ipsius illustrationis, emunda.
Sanctify, O Lord, we pray,
these offerings here made to celebrate
the glorious Transfiguration of your Only Begotten Son,
and by his radiant splendor
cleanse us from the stains of sin.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE           The mystery of the transfiguration
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Qui coram electis testibus suam gloriam
revelavit, et communem illam cum ceteris corporis formam maximo
splendore perfudit, ut de cordibus discipulorum crucis scandalum
tolleretur, et in totius Ecclesiae corpore declararet implendum quod
eius mirabiliter praefulsit in capite. Et ideo cum caelorum virtutibus
in terris te iugiter celebramus, maiestati tuae sine fine clamantes:
Sanctus.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.

It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.
For he revealed his glory in the presence of chosen witnesses
and filled with the greatest splendor that bodily form
which he shares with all humanity,
that the scandal of the Cross
might be removed from the hearts of his disciples
and that he might show
how in the body of the whole Church is to be fulfilled
what so wonderfully shone forth first in its Head.
And so, with the Powers of heaven,
we worship you constantly on earth,
and before your majesty
without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. 1 Jn 3: 2
Cum Christus apparuerit, similes ei erimus, quoniam videbimus eum
sicuti est.
When Christ appears, we shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Caelestia, quaesumus, Domine, alimenta quae sumpsimus in eius nos
transforment imaginem, cuius claritatem gloriosa Transfiguratione
manifestare voluisti.
May the heavenly nourishment we have received,
O Lord, we pray,
transform us into the likeness of your Son,
whose radiant splendor you willed to make manifest
in his glorious Transfiguration.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
