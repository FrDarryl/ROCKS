COLLECT
Praesta, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut divinitatem Filii tui, quam
beatus Hilarius episcopus constanter asseruit, et convenienter
intellegere valeamus, et veraciter profiteri.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that we may rightly understand and truthfully profess
the divinity of your Son,
which the Bishop Saint Hilary taught with such constancy.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 2:18-25
Children, it is the last hour;
and just as you heard that the antichrist was coming,
so now many antichrists have appeared.
Thus we know this is the last hour.
They went out from us, but they were not really of our number;
if they had been, they would have remained with us.
Their desertion shows that none of them was of our number.
But you have the anointing that comes from the Holy One,
and you all have knowledge.
I write to you not because you do not know the truth
but because you do, and because every lie is alien to the truth.
Who is the liar?
Whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ.
Whoever denies the Father and the Son, this is the antichrist.
Anyone who denies the Son does not have the Father,
but whoever confesses the Son has the Father as well.

Let what you heard from the beginning remain in you.
If what you heard from the beginning remains in you,
then you will remain in the Son and in the Father.
And this is the promise that he made us: eternal life.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 110:1,2,3,4
Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech.
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORD said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand
till I make your enemies your footstool."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The scepter of your power the LORD will stretch forth from Zion:
"Rule in the midst of your enemies."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
"Yours is princely power in the day of your birth, in holy splendor;
before the daystar, like the dew, I have begotten you."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORD has sworn, and he will not repent:
"You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:16
Sic luceat lux vestra coram hominibus, ut videant vestra bona opera et
glorificent Patrem vestrum.
Let your light shine before others,
that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.
GOSPEL          Matthew 5:13-19
Jesus said to his disciples:
"You are the salt of the earth.
But if salt loses Its taste, with what can it be seasoned?
It is no longer good for anything
but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world.
A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket;
it is set on a lampstand,
where it gives light to all in the house.
Just so, your light must shine before others,
that they may see your good deeds
and glorify your heavenly Father.

"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.
Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away,
not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter
will pass from the law,
until all things have taken place.
Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
and teaches others to do so
will be called least in the Kingdom of heaven.
But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments
will be called greatest in the Kingdom of heaven."

The Office of Readings

From a sermon on the Trinity by Saint Hilary, Bishop
(Lib 1, 37-38: PL 10, 48-49)
May I serve you by making you known
I am well aware, almighty God and Father, that in my life I owe you a
most particular duty. It is to make my every thought and word speak of
you.

In fact, you have conferred on me this gift of speech, and it can yield
no greater return than to be at your service. It is for making you
known as Father, the Father of the only-begotten God, and preaching
this to the world that knows you not and to the heretics who refuse to
believe in you.

In this matter the declaration of my intention is only of limited
value. For the rest, I need to pray for the gift of your help and your
mercy. As we spread our sails of trusting faith and public avowal
before you, fill them with the breath of your Spirit, to drive us on as
we begin this course of proclaiming your truth. We have been promised,
and he who made the promise is trustworthy: Ask, and it will be given
to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

Yes, in our poverty we will pray for our needs. We will study the
sayings of your prophets and apostles with unflagging attention, and
knock for admittance wherever the gift of understanding is safely kept.
But yours it is, Lord, to grant our petitions, to be present when we
seek you and to open when we knock.

There is an inertia in our nature that makes us dull; and in our
attempt to penetrate your truth we are held within the bounds of
ignorance by the weakness of our minds. Yet we do comprehend divine
ideas by earnest attention to your teaching and by obedience to the
faith which carries us beyond mere human apprehension.

So we trust in you to inspire the beginnings of this ambitious venture,
to strengthen its progress, and to call us into a partnership in the
spirit with the prophets and the apostles. To that end, may we grasp
precisely what they meant to say, taking each word in its real and
authentic sense. For we are about to say what they already have
declared as part of the mystery of revelation: that you are the eternal
God, the Father of the eternal, only-begotten God; that you are one and
not born from another; and that the Lord Jesus is also one, born of you
from all eternity. We must not proclaim a change in truth regarding the
number of gods. We must not deny that he is begotten of you who are the
one God; nor must we assert that he is other than the true God, born of
you who are truly God the Father.

Impart to us, then, the meaning of the words of Scripture and the light
to understand it, with reverence for the doctrine and confidence in its
truth. Grant that we may express what we believe. Through the prophets
and apostles we know about you, the one God the Father, and the one
Lord Jesus Christ. May we have the grace, in the face of heretics who
deny you, to honor you as God, who is not alone, and to proclaim this
as truth.
RESPONSORY          John 4:2-3, 6, 15
Everyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a man of flesh and
blood is of God;
anyone who denies this of Jesus is not of God;
- this is how you may know the spirit of truth from the spirit of
falsehood.
He who proclaims that Jesus is the Son of God
lives in God and God in him.
- this is how you may know the spirit of truth from the spirit of
falsehood.
