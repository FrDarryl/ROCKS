Deus, qui beatum Iosephum presbyterum tanta caritate et patientia
decorasti, ut pueris erudiendis omnique virtute exornandis constanter
incumberet, concede, quaesumus, ut, quem sapientiae praeceptorem
colimus, veritatis cooperatorem iugiter imitemur.
O God, who adorned the Priest Saint Joseph Calasanz
with such charity and patience
that he labored tirelessly
to educate children and endow them with every virtue,
grant, we pray, that we, who venerate him as a teacher of wisdom,
may constantly imitate him,
for he was a co-worker of your truth.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 12:31-13:13 or 13:4-13
Brothers and sisters:
Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts.
But I shall show you a still more excellent way.

If I speak in human and angelic tongues,
but do not have love,
I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.
And if I have the gift of prophecy,
and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge;
if I have all faith so as to move mountains,
but do not have love, I am nothing.
If I give away everything I own,
and if I hand my body over so that I may boast,
but do not have love, I gain nothing.

Love is patient, love is kind.
It is not jealous, it is not pompous,
It is not inflated, it is not rude,
it does not seek its own interests,
it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury,
it does not rejoice over wrongdoing
but rejoices with the truth.
It bears all things, believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never fails.
If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing;
if tongues, they will cease;
if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.
For we know partially and we prophesy partially,
but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
When I was a child, I used to talk as a child,
think as a child, reason as a child;
when I became a man, I put aside childish things.
At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror,
but then face to face.
At present I know partially;
then I shall know fully, as I am fully known.
So faith, hope, love remain, these three;
but the greatest of these is love.
Or:          13:4-13

The disciples approached Jesus and said,
�Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven?�
He called a child over, placed it in their midst, and said,
�Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children,
you will not enter the Kingdom of heaven.
Whoever humbles himself like this child
is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.
And whoever receives one child such as this in my name receives me.

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From The Writings of Saint Joseph Calasanz, priest
(Memoriale al Card. M. A.Tonti, 1621: Ephem, Calas. 36,9-10: Romae
1967, pp.473-474; L.Picanyol, Epistolario di S. Giuseppe Calasanzio. 9
vol., ediz. Calas., Romae 1951-1956, passim)
Let us try to cling to Christ and please him alone
Everyone knows the great merit and dignity attached to that holy
ministry in which young boys, especially the poor, receive instruction
for the purpose of attaining eternal life. This ministry is directed to
the well-being of body and soul; at the same time that it shapes
behavior it also fosters devotion and Christian doctrine. In doing this
it performs for the young boys the very same service as their guardian
angels.

Moreover the strongest support is provided not only to protect the
young from evil, but also to rouse them and attract them more easily
and gently to the performance of good works. Whatever the type of
condition, it is well known that when the young are given this help the
change for the better is so great that it becomes impossible to
distinguish those who are educated from those who are not. Like the
twigs of plants the young are easily influenced, as long as someone
works to change their souls. But if they are allowed to grow hard, we
know well that the possibility of one day bending them diminishes a
great deal and is sometimes utterly lost.

All who belong to the society of men, and especially all Christians,
praise those who increase the human dignity of young boys, especially
poor boys by giving them a proper education Above all, parents are
happy that their children are led through straight paths. civil leaders
rejoice to gain upright subjects and good citizens. The Church is
especially joyful that others who love Christ and proclaim the Gospel
are added to its following.

All who undertake to teach must be endowed with deep love, the greatest
patience, and, most of all, profound humility. They must perform their
work with earnest zeal. Then, through their humble prayers, the Lord
will find them worthy to become fellow workers with him in the cause of
truth. He will console them in the fulfillment of this most noble duty,
and, finally, will enrich them with the gift of heaven.

As Scripture says: Those who instruct many in justice will shine as
stars for all eternity. They will attain this more easily if they make
a covenant of perpetual obedience and strive to cling to Christ and
please him alone, because, in his words: What you did to one of the
least of my brethren, you did for me.
RESPONSORY          1 Thess. 2:8; Gal. 4:19
I have longed to give you the Gospel,
and more than that, to give you my very life;
- you have become very dear to me.
My little children, I am like a mother giving birth to you,
until Christ is formed in you.
- you have become very dear to me.
