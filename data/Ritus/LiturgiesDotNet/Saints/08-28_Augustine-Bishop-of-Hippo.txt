MASS

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf. Sirach 15: 5
In medio Ecclesiae aperuit os eius, et implevit eum Dominus spiritu
sapientiae et intellectus, stolam gloriae induit eum.
In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth,
and the Lord filled him
with the spirit of wisdom and understanding
and clothed him in a robe of glory.
COLLECT
Innova, quaesumus, Domine, in Ecclesia tua spiritum, quo beatum
Augustinum episcopum imbuisti, ut, eodem nos repleti, te solum verae
fontem sapientiae sitiamus, et superni amoris quaeramus auctorem.
Renew in your Church, we pray, O Lord,
the spirit with which you endowed
your Bishop Saint Augustine
that, filled with the same spirit,
we may thirst for you,
the sole fount of true wisdom,
and seek you, the author of heavenly love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          John 4:7-16
Beloved, let us love one another,
because love is of God;
everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God.
Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.
In this way the love of God was revealed to us:
God sent his only-begotten Son into the world
so that we might have life through him.
In this is love:
not that we have loved God, but that he loved us
and sent his Son as expiation for our sins.
Beloved, if God so loved us,
we also must love one another.
No one has ever seen God.
Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us,
and his love is brought to perfection in us.

This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us,
that he has given us of his Spirit.
Moreover, we have seen and testify
that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world.
Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,
God remains in him and he in God.
We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us.

God is love, and whoever remains in love
remains in God and God in him.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          119:9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Doce me, Domine, iustificationes tuas.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
How can the young walk without fault?
Only by keeping your words.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
With all my heart I seek you;
do not let me stray from your commands.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
In my heart I treasure your promise,
that I may not sin against you.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
Blessed are you, O LORD;
teach me your laws.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
With my lips I recite
all the edicts you have spoken.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
I find joy in the way of your decrees
more than in all riches.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 23:9b, 10b
Unus est Pater vester, caelestis; et magister vester unus est,
Christus.
You have but one Father in heaven
and one master, the Christ.
GOSPEL          Matthew 23:8-12
Jesus spoke to his disciples:
"Do not be called 'Rabbi.'
You have but one teacher, and you are all brothers.
Call no one on earth your father;
you have but one Father in heaven.
Do not be called 'Master';
you have but one master, the Christ.
The greatest among you must be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled;
but whoever humbles himself will be exalted."

SECOND READING
From the Confessions of St. Augustine, bishop
(Lib. 7,10,18; 10,27: CSEL 33,157-163,255)
O eternal truth, true love, and beloved eternity
Urged to reflect upon myself, I entered under your guidance into the
inmost depth of my soul. I was able to do so because you were my
helper. On entering into myself I saw, as it were with the eye of the
soul, what was beyond the eye of the soul, beyond my spirit: your
immutable light. It was not the ordinary light perceptible to all
flesh, nor was it merely something of greater magnitude but still
essentially akin, shining more clearly and diffusing itself everywhere
by its intensity. No, it was something entirely distinct, something
altogether different from all these things; and it did not rest above
my mind as oil on the surface of water, nor was it above me as heaven
is above the earth. This light was above me because it had made me; I
was below it because I was created by it. He who has come to know the
truth knows this light.
O Eternal truth, true love and beloved eternity. You are my God. To you
do I sigh day and night. When I first came to know you, you drew me to
yourself so that I might see that there were things for me to see, but
that I myself was not yet ready to see them. Meanwhile you overcame the
weakness of my vision, sending forth most strongly the beams of your
light, and I trembled at once with love and dread. I learned that I was
in a region unlike yours and far distant from you, and I thought I
heard your voice from on high: �I am the food of grown men; grow then,
and you will feed on me. Nor will you change me into yourself like
bodily food, but you will be changed into me.�
I sought a way to gain the strength which I needed to enjoy you. But I
did not find it until I embraced the mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus, who is above all, God blessed for ever. He was
calling me and saying: I am the way of truth, I am the life. He was
offering the food which I lacked the strength to take, the food he had
mingled with our flesh. For the Word became flesh, that your wisdom, by
which you created all things, might provide milk for us children.
Late have I loved you, O Beauty ever ancient, ever new, late have I
loved you! You were within me, but I was outside, and it was there that
I searched for you. In my unloveliness I plunged into the lovely things
which you created. You were with me, but I was not with you. Created
things kept me from you; yet if they had not been in you they would not
have been at all. You called, you shouted, and you broke through my
deafness. You flashed, you shone, and you dispelled my blindness. You
breathed your fragrance on me; I drew in breath and now I pant for you.
I have tasted you, now I hunger and thirst for more. You touched me,
and I burned for your peace.
RESPONSORY
O Truth, you are the light of my heart.
Let your light speak to me, not my own darkness.
I went astray, but I remembered you
- and now I return longing and thirsting for your fountain.
I myself cannot give life.
Of myself I have live wrongly;
in you I have found life again.
- And now I return longing and thirsting for your fountain.
COLLECT
Renew in your Church, we pray, O Lord,
the spirit with which you endowed
your Bishop Saint Augustine
that, filled with the same spirit,
we may thirst for you,
the sole fount of true wisdom,
and seek you, the author of heavenly love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
