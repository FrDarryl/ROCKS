Deus, innocentiae auctor et castitatis amator, qui famulae tuae Mariae
iuvenili aetate martyrii gratiam contulisti, da nobis, quaesumus, eius
intercessione, in tuis mandatis constantiam, qui dedisti certanti
virgini coronam.
O God, author of innocence and lover of chastity,
who bestowed the grace of martyrdom
on your handmaid, the Virgin Saint Maria Goretti, in her youth,
grant, we pray, through her intercession,
that, as you gave her a crown for her steadfastness,
so we, too, may be firm
in obeying your commandments.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 6:13c-15a, 17-20
Brothers and sisters:
The body is not for immorality, but for the Lord,
and the Lord is for the body;
God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
Whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
Avoid immorality.
Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,
but the immoral person sins against his own body.
Do you not know that your body
is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
whom you have from God,
and that you are not your own?
For you have been purchased at a price.
Therefore glorify God in your body
RESPONSORIAL PSALM Psalm 31:3cd-4, 6 and 8ab, 16bc and 17
In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum.
R. (6) Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
Be my rock of refuge,
a stronghold to give me safety.
You are my rock and my fortress;
for your name's sake you will lead and guide me.
R. Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
Into your hands I commend my spirit;
you will redeem me, O LORD, O faithful God.
I will rejoice and be glad because of your mercy.
R. Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
Rescue me from the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors,
Let your face shine upon your servant;
save me in your kindness.
R. Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
ALLELUIA          2 Cor 1:3b-4a
Blessed be the father of compassion and the God of all encouragement,
who encourages us in our every affliction.
GOSPEL           John 12:24-26
Jesus said to his disciples:
"Amen, amen, I say to you,
unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies,
it remains just a grain of wheat;
but if it dies, it produces much fruit.
Whoever loves his life loses it,
and whoever hates his life in this world
will preserve it for eternal life.
Whoever serves me must follow me,
and where I am, there also will my servant be.
The Father will honor whoever serves me."

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a homily at the canonization of Saint Maria Goretti by Pope Pius
XII
(AAS 42 , 581-582)
I have no fear, for you are with me
It is well known how this young girl had to face a bitter struggle with
no way to defend herself. Without warning a vicious stranger burst upon
her, bent on raping her and destroying her childlike purity. In that
moment of crisis she could have spoken to her Redeemer in the words of
that classic, The Imitation of Christ: "Though tested and plagued by a
host of misfortunes, I have no fear so long as your grace is with me.
It is my strength, stronger than any adversary; it helps me and gives
me guidance." With splendid courage she surrendered herself to God and
his grace and so gave her life to protect her virginity.

The life of this simple girl - I shall concern myself only with
highlights - we can see as worthy of heaven. Even today people can look
upon it with admiration and respect. Parents can learn from her story
how to raise their God-given children in virtue, courage and holiness;
they can learn to train them in the Catholic faith so that, when put to
the test, God's grace will support them and they will come through
undefeated, unscathed and untarnished.

From Maria's story carefree children and young people with their zest
for life can learn not to be led astray by attractive pleasures which
are not only ephemeral and empty but also sinful. Instead they can fix
their sight on achieving Christian moral perfection, however difficult
and hazardous that course may prove. With determination and God's help
all of us can attain that goal by persistent effort and prayer.

Not all of us are expected to die a martyr's death, but we are all
called to the pursuit of Christian virtue. This demands strength of
character though it may not match that of this innocent girl. Still, a
constant, persistent and relentless effort is asked of us right up to
the moment of our death. This may be conceived as a slow steady
martyrdom which Christ urged upon us when he said: The kingdom of
heaven is set upon and laid waste by violent forces.

So let us all, with God's grace, strive to reach the goal that the
example of the virgin martyr, Saint Maria Goretti, sets before us.
Through her prayers to the Redeemer may all of us, each in his own way,
joyfully try to follow the inspiration example of Maria Goretti who now
enjoys eternal happiness in heaven.
RESPONSORY
How beautiful you are, virgin of Christ;
- the Lord has given you the gift of perpetual virginity.

Nothing can rob you of your reward
or separate you from the love of the Son of God.
- the Lord has given you the gift of perpetual virginity.
