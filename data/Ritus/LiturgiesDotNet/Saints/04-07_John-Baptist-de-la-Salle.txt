Deus, qui ad christianam iuventutem educandam beatum Ioannem Baptistam
elegisti, excita in Ecclesia tua institutores, qui humanae et
christianae iuvenum disciplinae toto corde sese devoveant.
O God, who chose Saint John Baptist de la Salle
to educate young Christians,
raise up, we pray, teachers in your Church
ready to devote themselves wholeheartedly
to the human and Christian formation of the young.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Timothy 1:13-14; 2:1-3
Beloved:
Take as your norm the sound words that you heard from me,
in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
Guard this rich trust with the help of the Holy Spirit
that dwells within us.
My child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
And what you heard from me through many witnesses
entrust to faithful people
who will have the ability to teach others as well.
Bear your share of hardship along with me
like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 1:1-2, 3, 4 and 6
Vincente dabo edere de ligno vitae.
R. Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
Blessed the man who follows not
the counsel of the wicked,
nor walks in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the company of the insolent,
but delights in the law of the Lord
and meditates on his law day and night.
R. Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
He is like a tree
planted near running water,
that yields its fruit in due season,
and whose leaves never fade.
Whatever he does, prospers.
R. Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
Not so the wicked, not so;
they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
For the Lord watches over the way of the just,
but the way of the wicked vanishes.
R. Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
ALLELUIA          Luke 4:18
Evangelizare pauperibus misit me Dominus, praedicare captivis
remissionem.
The Lord sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor
and to proclaim liberty to the captives.
GOSPEL          Matthew 18:1-5
The disciples approached Jesus and said,
"Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven?"
He called a child over, placed it in their midst, and said,
"Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children,
you will not enter the Kingdom of heaven.
Whoever humbles himself like this child
is the greatest in the Kingdom of heaven.
And whoever receives one child such as this in my name receives me."

The Office of Readings
SECOND READING
From a meditation by Saint John Baptist de la Salle, priest
(Meditatio 201)
Let the love of God impel you

The apostle Paul states that God has placed apostles, prophets and
doctors in the Church. If you meditate on this you will be convinced
that you too have been given your special place. Paul testifies to
this. He declares that there are different kinds of ministry and work,
and that the same Holy Spirit is manifested in a variety of gifts for
the good of all, that is, the good of the Church.

Therefore you should not doubt that you have been given the same kind
of grace to teach boys, to instruct them in the Gospel, and to form
them in religion. This is a great gift which God gave you when he
called you to this holy work.

In your teaching, the boys in your charge must see by the way you teach
that you are true ministers of God, full of true charity and sincere in
carrying out your task. It is most important for you to realize that
you are ministers not only of God but also of Jesus Christ and the
Church.

Saint Paul also urges us to regard as ministers of Christ not only all
who preach the Gospel but also those who write the message that Christ
dictates not with ink but with the spirit of the living God, not on
tablets of stone but on the fleshy tablets of the heart - on the hearts
of boys. Be driven by the love of God then, because Jesus Christ died
for all, that those who live may not live for themselves but for him
who died and rose for them. Let your students be moved by your untiring
care for them and feel as though God were encouraging them through you,
because you perform your duties as ambassadors of Christ.

Above all, let your charity and zeal show how you love the Church. Your
work is for the Church, which is the body of Christ. By your diligence
show your love for those whom God has given you, just as Christ loved
the Church.

Take care that your boys enter into the building up of this temple so
that one day they may become worthy to stand, glorious and without spot
or wrinkle, before the tribunal of Jesus Christ. See to it that the
abundant grace God has given them may be shown in the years to come, as
well as the grace given you to teach them and to bring them up to
inherit the kingdom of God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
RESPONSORY      Mark 10:13-14, 16
The people brought little children to Jesus that he might touch them,
but the disciples tried to discourage them.
Jesus saw this and said:
� Let the little children come to me, and do not prevent them,
for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these, alleluia.

Embracing them and placing his hands upon them,
he blessed them.
� Let the little children come to me, and do not prevent them,
for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these, alleluia.
