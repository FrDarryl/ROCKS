COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Thomam sanctitatis zelo ac sacrae doctrinae studio
conspicuum effecisti, da nobis, quaesumus, et quae docuit intellectu
conspicere, et quae gessit imitatione complere. Per Dominum.
O God, who made Saint Thomas Aquinas
outstanding in his zeal for holiness
and his study of sacred doctrine,
grant us, we pray,
that we may understand what he taught
and imitate what he accomplished.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Wisdom 7:7-10,15-16
I prayed, and prudence was given me;
I pleaded, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.
I preferred her to scepter and throne,
and deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,
nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;
because all gold, in view of her, is but a little sand,
and before her, silver is to be accounted mire.
Beyond health and comeliness I loved her ,
and I chose to have her rather than the light,
because the spendor of her never yields to sleep.

Now God grant that I speak suitably
and value these endowments at their worth:
For He is the guide of Wisdom
and the director of the wise.
For both we and our words are in his hand,
as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 119:9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Doce me, Domine, iustificationes tuas
R. (12) Lord, teach me your statutes.
How shall a young man be faultless in his way?
By keeping to your words.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
With all my heart I seek you;
let me not stray from your commands.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
Within my heart I treasure your promise,
that I may not sin against you.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
Blessed are you, O LORD;
teach me your statutes.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
With my lips I declare
all the ordinances of your mouth.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
In the way of your decrees I rejoice,
as much as in all riches.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
ALLELUIA          Matt 23:9b, 10b
Unus est Pater vester, caelis est; magister vester unus est Christus.
You have but one Father in heaven
and one master, the Christ.
GOSPEL          Matthew 23:8-12
Jesus said,
"Do not to be called "Rabbi."
You have but one teacher, and you are all brothers.
Call no one on earth your father;
you have but one Father in heaven.
Do not be called "Master";
you have but one master, the Christ.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
but whoever humbles himself will be exalted."

Office of Readings

From a conference by Saint Thomas Aquinas, priest
(Collatio 6 super Credo in Deum)
The Cross exemplifies every virtue
Why did the Son of God have to suffer for us? There was a great need,
and it can be considered in a twofold way: in the first place, as a
remedy for sin, and secondly, as an example of how to act.
It is a remedy, for, in the face of all the evils which we incur on
account of our sins, we have found relief through the passion of
Christ. Yet, it is no less an example, for the passion of Christ
completely suffices to fashion our lives. Whoever wishes to live
perfectly should do nothing but disdain what Christ disdained on the
cross and desire what he desired, for the cross exemplifies every
virtue.
If you seek the example of love: "Greater love than this no man has,
than to lay down his life for his friends." Such a man was Christ on
the cross. And if he gave his life for us, then it should not be
difficult to bear whatever hardships arise for his sake.
If you seek patience, you will find no better example than the cross.
Great patience occurs in two ways: either when one patiently suffers
much, or when one suffers things which one is able to avoid and yet
does not avoid. Christ endured much on the cross, and did so patiently,
because when he suffered he did not threaten; he was led like a sheep
to the slaughter and he did not open his mouth. Therefore Christ�s
patience on the cross was great. In patience let us run for the prize
set before us, looking upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our
faith who, for the joy set before him, bore his cross and despised the
shame.
If you seek an example of humility, look upon the crucified one, for
God wished to be judged by Pontius Pilate and to die.
If you seek an example of obedience, follow him who became obedient to
the Father even unto death. For just as by the disobedience of one man,
namely, Adam, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one man,
many were made righteous.
If you seek an example of despising earthly things, follow him who is
the King of kings and the Lord of lords, in whom are hidden all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Upon the cross he was stripped,
mocked, spat upon, struck, crowned with thorns, and given only vinegar
and gall to drink.
Do not be attached, therefore, to clothing and riches, because "they
divided my garments among themselves." Nor to honours, for he
experienced harsh words and scourgings. Nor to greatness of rank, for
"weaving a crown of thorns they placed it on my head." Nor to anything
delightful, for "in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink."
RESPONSORY          Wisdom 7:7-8; 9:17
I prayed, and understanding was given me;
I entreated and the spirit of wisdom came to me;
- I esteemed wisdom more than scepter or throne;
compared with her, I held riches to be nothing.
Who will know your design, O Lord,
unless you bestow wisdom,
and send your Holy Spirit from above?
- I esteemed wisdom more than scepter or throne;
compared with her, I held riches to be nothing.
