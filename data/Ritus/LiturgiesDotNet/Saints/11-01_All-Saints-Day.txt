Gaudeamus omnes in Domino, diem festum celebrantes sub honore Sanctorum

as we celebrate the feast day in honor of all the Saints,
at whose festival the Angels rejoice
and praise the Son of God.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui nos omnium Sanctorum tuorum merita sub
una tribuisti celebritate venerari, quaesumus, ut desideratam nobis
tuae propitiationis abundantiam, multiplicatis intercessoribus,
largiaris.
Almighty ever-living God,
by whose gift we venerate in one celebration
the merits of all the Saints,
bestow on us, we pray,
through the prayers of so many intercessors,
an abundance of the reconciliation with you
for which we earnestly long.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING           Revelation 7:2-4, 9-14
I, John, saw another angel come up from the East,
holding the seal of the living God.
He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels
who were given power to damage the land and the sea,
Do not damage the land or the sea or the trees
until we put the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.
I heard the number of those who had been marked with the seal,
one hundred and forty-four thousand marked
from every tribe of the children of Israel.
After this I had a vision of a great multitude,
which no one could count,
from every nation, race, people, and tongue.
They stood before the throne and before the Lamb,
wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.
They cried out in a loud voice:
Salvation comes from our God, who is seated on the throne,
and from the Lamb.
All the angels stood around the throne
and around the elders and the four living creatures.
They prostrated themselves before the throne,
worshiped God, and exclaimed:
Amen. Blessing and glory, wisdom and thanksgiving,
honor, power, and might
be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
Then one of the elders spoke up and said to me,
Who are these wearing white robes, and where did they come from?
I said to him, My lord, you are the one who knows.
He said to me,
These are the ones who have survived the time of great distress;
they have washed their robes
and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          24:1bc-2, 3-4ab, 5-6
Haec est generatio quaerentium faciem tuam, Domine.
R. Lord, this is the people that longs to see your face.
The LORDs are the earth and its fullness;
the world and those who dwell in it.
For he founded it upon the seas
and established it upon the rivers.
R. Lord, this is the people that longs to see your face.
Who can ascend the mountain of the LORD?
or who may stand in his holy place?
One whose hands are sinless, whose heart is clean,
who desires not what is vain.
R. Lord, this is the people that longs to see your face.
He shall receive a blessing from the LORD,
a reward from God his savior.
Such is the race that seeks him,
that seeks the face of the God of Jacob.
R. Lord, this is the people that longs to see your face.
SECOND READING          1 John 3:1-3
Beloved:
See what love the Father has bestowed on us
that we may be called the children of God.
Yet so we are.
The reason the world does not know us
is that it did not know him.
Beloved, we are Gods children now;
what we shall be has not yet been revealed.
We do know that when it is revealed we shall be like him,
for we shall see him as he is.
Everyone who has this hope based on him makes himself pure,
as he is pure.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 11:28
Venite ad me, omnes qui laboratis et onerati estis, et ego reficiam
vos, dicit Dominus.
Come to me, all you that labour, and are burdened,
and I will give you rest, says the Lord.
GOSPEL          Matthew 5:1-12a
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain,
and after he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
He began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they who mourn,
for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek,
for they will inherit the land.
Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they will be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the clean of heart,
for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you
and utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me.
Rejoice and be glad,
for your reward will be great in heaven.
CREDO
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Grata tibi sint, Domine, munera, quae pro cunctorum offerimus honore
Sanctorum, et concede, ut, quos iam credimus de sua immortalitate
securos, sentiamus de nostra salute sollicitos.
May these offerings we bring in honor of all the Saints
be pleasing to you, O Lord,
and grant that, just as we believe the Saints
to be already assured of immortality,
so we may experience their concern for our salvation.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE OF ALL SAINTS          The glory of Jerusalem, our mother.
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
Nobis enim hodie civitatem tuam tribuis celebrare, quae mater nostra
est, caelestisque Ierusalem, ubi iam te in aeternum fratrum nostrorum
corona collaudat. Ad quam peregrini, per fidem accedentes, alacriter
festinamus, congaudentes de Ecclesiae sublimium glorificatione
membrorum, qua simul fragilitati nostrae adiumenta et exempla concedis.
Et ideo, cum ipsorum Angelorumque frequentia, una te magnificamus,
laudis voce clamantes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For today by your gift we celebrate the festival of your city,
the heavenly Jerusalem, our mother,
where the great array of our brothers and sisters
already gives you eternal praise.
Towards her, we eagerly hasten, as pilgrims advancing by faith,
rejoicing in the glory bestowed upon those exalted members of the
Church
through whom you give us, in our frailty, both strength and good
example.
And so, we glorify you with the multitude of Saints and Angels,
as with one voice of praise we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Mt 5:8-10
Beati mundo corde: quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt. Beati pacifici: quoniam
filii Dei vocabuntur. Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter
iustitiam: quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Mirabilem te, Deus, et unum Sanctum in omnibus Sanctis tuis adorantes,
tuam gratiam imploramus, qua, sanctificationem in tui amoris
plenitudine consummantes, ex hac mensa peregrinantium ad caelestis
patriae convivium transeamus.
As we adore you, O God, who alone are holy
and wonderful in all your Saints,
we implore your grace,
so that, coming to perfect holiness in the fullness of your love,
we may pass from this pilgrim table
to the banquet of our heavenly homeland.
Through Christ our Lord.
SOLEMN BLESSING
God is the glory and joy of all his saints,
whose memory we celebrate today.
May his blessing be with you always. Amen.

May the prayers of the saints deliver you from present evil;
may their example of holy living
turn your thoughts to the service of God and neighbor. Amen.

God's holy Church rejoices that her children
are one with the saints in lasting peace.
May you come to share with them
in all the joys of our Father's house. Amen.
