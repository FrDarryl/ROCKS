Vespers 1
Composite: Proverbs 10,3,8

The memory of the righteous is with praise and the blessing of the Lord
is upon his head. Blessed is the man who has found wisdom and the
mortal who has understanding. For it is better to purchase her than
treasuries of gold and silver. She is more precious than precious
stones and all that is precious is unworthy of her. For length of days
and years of life are in her right hand; and in her left hand are
riches and glory. Out of her mouth proceeds righteousness and she bears
law and mercy upon her tongue.

Hear me, O child, for I will speak noble things. Blessed is the man who
keeps my ways, for my ways are the way of life, and in them is prepared
favor from the Lord. Therefore, I pray you, and utter my voice to the
sons of men: For I, wisdom, have dwelt with counsel and knowledge and I
have called upon understanding. Counsel and safety are mine,
understanding and strength are mine. I love those who love me and those
seeking me shall find grace.

Understand craftiness, O you who are simple, and imbibe knowledge, you
who are untaught. Hear me again, for I will speak noble things: I will
open my mouth and from my lips shall come what is right. For my throat
shall meditate truth; false lips are an abomination before me. All the
words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing in them that is
twisted or perverse. They are all straight to him who understands and
right to those who find knowledge.

I shall instruct you in truth, so that your hope will be in the Lord
and you shall be filled with the Spirit.

Vespers 2
Proverbs 10:31-11:12

The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, But the perverse tongue
will be cut out.
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, But the mouth of the
wicked what is perverse.
Dishonest scales are an abomination to the Lord, But a just weight is
His delight.
When pride comes, then comes shame; But with the humble is wisdom.
The integrity of the upright will guide them, But the perversity of the
unfaithful will destroy them.
Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness delivers
from death.
The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way aright, But the
wicked will fall by his own wickedness.
The righteousness of the upright will deliver them, But the unfaithful
will be caught by their lust.
When a wicked man dies, his expectation will perish, And the hope of
the unjust perishes.
The righteous is delivered from trouble, And it comes to the wicked
instead.
The hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbor, But through
knowledge the righteous will be delivered.
When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; And when the
wicked perish, there is jubilation.
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted, But it is
overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
He who is devoid of wisdom despises his neighbor, But a man of
understanding holds his peace.

Vespers 3
Wisdom 3:1-9

But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment
will ever touch them.
In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their
departure was thought to be affliction,
and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace.
For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope is full
of immortality.
Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, because
God tested them and found them worthy of himself;
like gold in the furnace he tried them, and like a sacrificial burnt
offering he accepted them.
In the time of their visitation they will shine forth, and will run
like sparks through the stubble.
They will govern nations and rule other peoples, and the Lord will
reign over them for ever.
Those who trust in him will understand truth, and the faithful will
abide with him in love, because grace and mercy are upon his elect, and
he watches over his holy ones.

Matins Gospel
Matthew 11:27-30

All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the
Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son,
and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in
heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.

Epistle
Galatians 5:22-6:2

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.
And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions
and desires.
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one
another.
Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual
restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest
you also be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

Gospel
Luke 6:17-23

And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of
His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and
Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear
Him and be healed of their diseases,
as well as those who were tormented with unclean spirits. And they were
healed.
And the whole multitude sought to touch Him, for power went out from
Him and healed them all.
Then He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said: Blessed are
you poor, For yours is the kingdom of God.
Blessed are you who hunger now, For you shall be filled. Blessed are
you who weep now, For you shall laugh.
Blessed are you when men hate you, And when they exclude you, And
revile you, and cast out your name as evil, For the Son of Man's sake.
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy! For indeed your reward is great
in heaven, For in like manner their fathers did to the prophets.

Troparion:
A zealot of good deeds

First Reading
Ecclesiasticus 39:1-9

He seeks out the wisdom of all the ancients,
and is concerned with prophecies;
he preserves the sayings of the famous
and penetrates the subtleties of parables;
he seeks out the hidden meanings of proverbs
and is at home with the obscurities of parables.
He serves among the great
and appears before rulers;
he travels in foreign lands
and learns what is good and evil in the human lot.
He sets his heart on rising early
to seek the Lord who made him,
and to petition the Most High;
he opens his mouth in prayer
and asks pardon for his sins.

If the great Lord is willing,
he will be filled with the spirit of understanding;
he will pour forth words of wisdom of his own
and give thanks to the Lord in prayer.
The Lord will direct his counsel and knowledge,
as he meditates on his mysteries.
He will show the wisdom of what he has learned,
and will glory in the law of the Lord’s covenant.
Many will praise his understanding;
it will never be blotted out.
His memory will not disappear,
and his name will live through all generations.
Psalm 34
Benedicam Domine

1
I will bless the LORD at all times; *
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.

2
I will glory in the LORD; *
let the humble hear and rejoice.

3
Proclaim with me the greatness of the LORD; *
let us exalt his Name together.

4
I sought the LORD, and he answered me *
and delivered me out of all my terror.

5
Look upon him and be radiant, *
and let not your faces be ashamed.

6
I called in my affliction and the LORD heard me *
and saved me from all my troubles.

7
The angel of the LORD encompasses those who fear him, *
and he will deliver them.

8
Taste and see that the LORD is good; *
happy are they who trust in him!

Or:
Psalm 33
Exultate, justi

1
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; *
it is good for the just to sing praises.

2
Praise the LORD with the harp; *
play to him upon the psaltery and lyre.

3
Sing for him a new song; *
sound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet.

4
For the word of the LORD is right, *
and all his works are sure.

5
He loves righteousness and justice; *
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.

20
Our soul waits for the LORD; *
he is our help and our shield.

21
Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, *
for in his holy Name we put our trust.

Gospel
Matthew 13:47-52

‘Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the
sea and caught fish of every kind; when it was full, they drew it
ashore, sat down, and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad.
So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come out and
separate the evil from the righteous and throw them into the furnace of
fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

‘Have you understood all this?’ They answered, ‘Yes.’ And he said to
them, ‘Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of
heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure
what is new and what is old.’
