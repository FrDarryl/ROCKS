Deus, qui ad animarum salutem beatum Franciscum episcopum omnibus omnia
factum esse voluisti, concede propitius, ut, eius exemplo, tuae
mansuetudinem caritatis in fratrum servitio semper ostendamus.
O God, who for the salvation of souls
willed that the Bishop Saint Francis de Sales
become all things to all,
graciously grant that, following his example,
we may always display the gentleness of your charity
in the service of our neighbor.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,

FIRST READING          Ephesians 3:8-12
Brothers and sisters:
To me, the very least of all the holy ones, this grace was given,
to preach to the Gentiles the inscrutable riches of Christ,
and to bring to light for all what is the plan of the mystery
hidden from ages past in God who created all things,
so that the manifold wisdom of God
might now be made known through the Church
to the principalities and authorities in the heavens.
This was according to the eternal purpose
that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have boldness of speech
and confidence of access through faith in him.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          37:3-4, 5-6, 30-31
R. (30a) The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Trust in the LORD and do good
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the LORD,
and he will grant you your heart's requests.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Commit to the LORD your way;
trust in him, and he will act.
He will make justice dawn for you like the light;
bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom
and his tongue utters what is right.
The law of his God is in his heart,
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
ALLELUIA          John 13:34
Mandátum novum do vobis, dicit Dóminus, ut diligátis ínvicem, sicut
diléxi vos.
I give you a new commandment:
Love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          John 15:9-17
Jesus said to his disciples:
�As the Father loves me, so I also love you.
Remain in my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love,
just as I have kept my Father's commandments
and remain in his love.

�I have told you this so that my joy be in you
and your joy be complete.
This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
No one has greater love than this,
to lay down one's life for one's friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you slaves,
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
I have called you friends,
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,
so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
This I command you: love one another.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Per hanc salutarem hostiam quam offerimus tibi, Domine, cor nostrum
divino illo Sancti Spiritus igne succende, quo mitissimum beati
Francisci animum mirabiliter inflammasti.

kindle in our hearts that divine fire of the Holy Spirit
with which you wonderfully inflamed
the most gentle soul of Saint Francis de Sales.
Through Christ our Lord.

Concede, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut, per sacramenta quae sumpsimus,
beati Francisci caritatem et mansuetudinem imitantes in terris, gloriam
quoque consequamur in caelis.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that through the Sacrament we have received,
we may imitate on earth
the charity and meekness of Saint Francis de Sales
and so attain like him the glory of heaven.
Through Christ our Lord.

Office of Readings

From The Introduction to the Devout Life, by Saint Francis de Sales
(Pars 1, Cap.3)
Devotion must be practised in different ways

When God the Creator made all things, he commanded the plants to bring
forth fruit each according to its own kind; he has likewise commanded
Christians, who are the living plants of his Church, to bring forth the
fruits of devotion, each one in accord with his character, his station
and his calling.

I say that devotion must be practised in different ways by the nobleman
and by the working man, by the servant and by the prince, by the widow,
by the unmarried girl and by the married woman. But even this
distinction is not sufficient; for the practice of devotion must be
adapted to the strength, to the occupation and to the duties of each
one in particular.

Tell me, please, my Philothea, whether it is proper for a bishop to
want to lead a solitary life like a Carthusian; or for married people
to be no more concerned than a Capuchin about increasing their income;
or for a working man to spend his whole day in church like a religious;
or on the other hand for a religious to be constantly exposed like a
bishop to all the events and circumstances that bear on the needs of
our neighbour. Is not this sort of devotion ridiculous, unorganised and
intolerable? Yet this absurd error occurs very frequently, but in no
way does true devotion, my Philothea, destroy anything at all. On the
contrary, it perfects and fulfils all things. In fact if it ever works
against, or is inimical to, anyone’s legitimate station and calling,
then it is very definitely false devotion.

The bee collects honey from flowers in such a way as to do the least
damage or destruction to them, and he leaves them whole, undamaged and
fresh, just as he found them. True devotion does still better. Not only
does it not injure any sort of calling or occupation, it even
embellishes and enhances it.

Moreover, just as every sort of gem, cast in honey, becomes brighter
and more sparkling, each according to its colour, so each person
becomes more acceptable and fitting in his own vocation when he sets
his vocation in the context of devotion. Through devotion your family
cares become more peaceful, mutual love between husband and wife
becomes more sincere, the service we owe to the prince becomes more
faithful, and our work, no matter what it is, becomes more pleasant and
agreeable.

It is therefore an error and even a heresy to wish to exclude the
exercise of devotion from military divisions, from the artisans’ shops,
from the courts of princes, from family households. I acknowledge, my
dear Philothea, that the type of devotion which is purely
contemplative, monastic and religious can certainly not be exercised in
these sorts of stations and occupations, but besides this threefold
type of devotion, there are many others fit for perfecting those who
live in a secular state.

Therefore, in whatever situations we happen to be, we can and we must
aspire to the life of perfection.
RESPONSORY           Job 23:11; Philippians 3:8-10
Be kind and compassionate to one another;
forgive each other as God has forgiven you in Christ.
-   Be imitators of God the Father who loves you as his own dear
children.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me,
for I am gentle and humble of heart.
-   Be imitators of God the Father who loves you as his own dear
children.
