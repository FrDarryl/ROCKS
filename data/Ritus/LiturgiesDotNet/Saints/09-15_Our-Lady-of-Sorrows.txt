MASS

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf. Lk 2: 34-35
Dixit Simeon ad Mariam: Ecce, positus est hic in ruinam et in
resurrectionem multorum in Israel, et in signum cui contradicetur; et
tuam ipsius animam pertransibit gladius.
Simeon said to Mary: Behold, this child is destined
for the ruin and rising of many in Israel,
and to be a sign of contradiction;
and your own soul a sword will pierce.
COLLECT
Deus, qui Filio tuo in cruce exaltato compatientem Matrem astare
voluisti, da Ecclesiae tuae, ut, Christi passionis cum ipsa consors
effecta, eiusdem resurrectionis particeps esse mereatur.
O God, who willed
that, when your Son was lifted high on the Cross,
his Mother should stand close by and share his suffering,
grant that your Church,
participating with the Virgin Mary in the Passion of Christ,
may merit a share in his Resurrection.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
The Gospel for this memorial is proper.
FIRST READING          Hebrews 5:7-9
In the days when Christ Jesus was in the flesh,
he offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears
to the one who was able to save him from death,
and he was heard because of his reverence.
Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered;
and when he was made perfect,
he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 31:2 and 3b, 3cd-4, 5-6, 15-16, 20
Salvum me fac, Domine, in misericordia tua.
R. Save me, O LORD, in your kindness.
In you, O LORD, I take refuge;
let me never be put to shame.
In your justice rescue me.
Make haste to deliver me.
R. Save me, O LORD, in your kindness.
Be my rock of refuge,
a stronghold to save me.
You are my rock and my fortress;
for your name's sake lead and guide me.
R. Save me, O LORD, in your kindness.
You will free me from the snare they set for me,
for you are my refuge.
Into your hands I commend my spirit;
you will redeem me, O LORD, O faithful God.
R. Save me, O LORD, in your kindness.
But my trust is in you, O LORD;
I say, "You are my God.
In your hands is my destiny; rescue me
from the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors.
R. Save me, O LORD, in your kindness.
How great is your goodness, O LORD
which you have in store for those who fear you
And which, toward those who take refuge in you,
you show in the sight of the children of men.
R. Save me, O LORD, in your kindness.
SEQUENCE (OPTIONAL)          Stabat Mater

English:

At the cross her station keeping,
Stood the mournful Mother weeping,
Close to Jesus to the last.

Through her heart, His sorrow sharing,
All His bitter anguish bearing,
Now at length the sword had pass'd.

Oh, how sad and sore distress'd
Was that Mother highly blest
Of the sole-begotten One!

Christ above in torment hangs;
She beneath beholds the pangs
Of her dying glorious Son.

Is there one who would not weep,
Whelm'd in miseries so deep
Christ's dear Mother to behold?

Can the human heart refrain
From partaking in her pain,
In that Mother's pain untold?

Bruis'd, derided, curs'd, defil'd,
She beheld her tender child
All with bloody scourges rent.

For the sins of His own nation,
Saw Him hang in desolation,
Till His spirit forth He sent.

O thou Mother! fount of love!
Touch my spirit from above;
Make my heart with thine accord.

Make me feel as thou hast felt;
Make my soul to glow and melt
With the love of Christ our Lord.

Holy Mother! pierce me through;
In my heart each wound renew
Of my Saviour crucified.

Let me share with thee His pain,
Who for all my sins was slain,
Who for me in torments died.

Let me mingle tears with thee,
Mourning Him who mourn'd for me,
All the days that I may live.

By the cross with thee to stay,
There with thee to weep and pray,
Is all I ask of thee to give.

Virgin of all virgins best,
Listen to my fond request
Let me share thy grief divine.

Let me, to my latest breath,
In my body bear the death
Of that dying Son of thine.

Wounded with His every wound,
Steep my soul till it hath swoon'd
In His very blood away.

Be to me, O Virgin, nigh,
Lest in flames I burn and die,
In His awful Judgment day.

Christ, when Thou shalt call me hence,
Be Thy Mother my defense,
Be Thy cross my victory.

While my body here decays,
May my soul Thy goodness praise,
Safe in Paradise with Thee.
Amen. Alleluia.
Latin:

Stabat Mater dolorosa
Juxta Crucem lacrimosa,
Dum pendebat Filius.

Cujus animam gementem,
Contristatam et dolentem,
Pertransivit gladius.

O quam tristis et afflicta
Fuit illa benedicta
Mater Unigeniti!

Quae maerebat, et dolebat,
Pia Mater, dum videbat
Nati poenas incliti.

Quis est homo, qui non fleret,
Matrem Christi si videret
In tanto supplicio?

Quis non posset contristari,
Christi Matrem contemplari
Dolentem cum Filio?

Pro peccatis suae gentis
Vidit Jesum in tormentis,
Et flagellis subditum.

Vidit suum dulcem natum
Moriendo desolatum,
Dum emisit spiritum.

Eja mater, fons amoris,
Me sentire vim doloris
Fac, ut tecum lugeam.

Fac, ut ardeat cor meum
In amando Christum Deum,
Ut sibi complaceam.

Sancta Mater, istud agas
Crucifixi fige plagas
Cordi meo valide.

Tui nati vulnerati,
Tam dignati pro me pati,
Poenas mecum divide.

Fac me tecum pie flere,
Crucifixo condolere,
Donec ego vixero.

Iuxta Crucem tecum stare,
Et me tibi sociare
In planctu desidero.

Virgo virginum praeclara,
Mihi iam non sis amara:
Fac me tecum plangere.

Fac, ut portem Christi mortem,
Passionis fac consortem,
Et plagas recolere.

Fac me plagis vulnerari,
Fac me Cruce inebriari,
Et cruore Filii.

Flammis ne urar succensus,
Per te, Virgo, sim defensus
In die iudicii.

Christe, cum sit hinc exire
Da per Matrem me venire
Ad palmam victoriae.

Quando corpus morietur,
Fac, ut animae donetur
Paradisi gloria.
Amen. Alleluia.

ALLELUIA
Blessed are you, O Blessed Virgin Mary;
without dying you won the martyr's crown beside the cross of the Lord.
GOSPEL (1st Option)           John 19:25-27
Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother
and his mother�s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,
and Mary Magdalene.
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved
he said to his mother, �Woman, behold, your son.�
Then he said to the disciple,
�Behold, your mother.�
And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.
or
GOSPEL (2nd Option)           Luke 2:33-35
Jesus� father and mother were amazed at what was said about him;
and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,
�Behold, this child is destined
for the fall and rise of many in Israel,
and to be a sign that will be contradicted
and you yourself a sword will pierce
so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, misericors Deus, ad tui nominis laudem preces hostiasque in
veneratione beatae Mariae Virginis exhibitas, quam, stantem iuxta
crucem Iesu, clementer nobis Matrem piissimam providisti.
Receive, O merciful God, to the praise of your name
the prayers and sacrificial offerings
which we bring to you
as we venerate the Blessed Virgin Mary,
whom you graciously gave to us
as a most devoted Mother
when she stood by the Cross of Jesus.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY I
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
and to praise, bless, and glorify your name
on the feast day of the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary.

For by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit
she conceived your Only Begotten Son,
and without losing the glory of virginity,
brought forth into the world the eternal Light,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven
and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in humble praise, as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
Or:
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY II
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
to praise your mighty deeds
in the exaltation of all the Saints,
and especially, as we celebrate
the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
to proclaim your kindness
as we echo her thankful hymn of praise.

For truly even to the earth's ends
you have done great things
and extended your abundant mercy from age to age:
when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid,
you gave us through her the author of our salvation,
your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise,
as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. 1 Pt 4: 13
Communicantes Christi passionibus gaudete, ut et in revelatione gloriae
eius gaudeteatis exsultantes.
Rejoice when you share in the sufferings of Christ,
that you may also rejoice exultantly when his glory is revealed.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Sumptis, Domine, sacramentis redemptionis aeternae, supplices
deprecamur, ut, compassionem beatae Mariae Virginis recolentes, ea in
nobis pro Ecclesia adimpleamus, quae desunt Christi passionum.
Having received the Sacrament of eternal redemption,
we humbly ask, O Lord,
that, honoring how the Blessed Virgin Mary
suffered with her Son,
we may complete in ourselves for the Church�s sake
what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
