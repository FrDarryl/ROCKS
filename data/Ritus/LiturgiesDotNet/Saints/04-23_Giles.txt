The Liturgy of the Hours
St. Giles of Assisi
From the Common of Holy Men, religious, except the following:
Office of Readings
From the Sayings of blessed Giles of Assisi
([Quaracchi 1905] 62-64)
It is a great thing to preserve devoutly and conscientiously till death
in religious life.
Speaking about himself Brother Giles used to say: �I would prefer
living in religious life with a small measure of grace to living in the
world with abundant grace because there are more dangers and fewer
means of assistance in the world than in religious life. A sinful man,
however, fears what is good for him more than what is harmful for him
because he is more afraid to do penance and enter religious life than
to be burdened with sin and remain in the world.�

A man in the world asked Brother Giles� advice whether it would be
better for him to enter religious life. Holy Brother Giles answered:
�If a very poor man knew that a valuable treasurer was buried in some
public field would he ask another�s advice whether he should go quickly
to the treasure? How much more should men hurry to dig up heavenly
treasure?

Brother Giles was wont to say: �Many enter religious life and yet do
not live as religious should. These men are like a simpleton who put on
Roland�s armor without knowing how to do battle in it. I do not
consider it a great thing to enter a king�s court, nor do I consider it
a great thing to accept a gift from a king, but I do consider it a
great thing to know how to conduct oneself at the king�s court.
Religious life is the court of the Great King. To enter it and to
receive some gifts from God is not great thing, but I do consider it a
great thing to live in it and to preserve in it devoutly and
conscientiously till death. I would, however, prefer to life in the
world devoutly and conscientiously, and to yearn to enter religious
life, rather than to live in religious life and be weary of it.�

He likewise used to say: �It seems to me that the religious life of the
Friars Minor was given to the world for the great benefit of mankind.
Woe to us if we are not the kind of men we ought to be. The religious
life of the Friars Minor seems to me to be the poorest and the richest
in the world. But this seems to me to be our greatest failing: we are
willing to live in religious life with standards that are too low. He
is rich who imitates a rich man; he is wise who imitates a wise man; he
is distinguished who imitates a distinguished person; he is noble who
imitates a noble person, namely, our Lord Jesus Christ.
RESPONSORY         Psalm 84:2-3,11
How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord of hosts.
- My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God, alleluia.
I had rather lie at the threshold of the house of my God than dwell in
the tents of the wicked.
- My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God, alleluia.
