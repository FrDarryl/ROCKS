John 4:19-24

Wisdom 7:24-8:1

For wisdom is more mobile than any motion;
because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things.
For she is a breath of the power of God,
and a pure emanation of the glory of the almighty;
therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her.
For she is a reflection of eternal light,
a spotless mirror of the working of God,
and an image of his goodness.
Although she is but one, she can do all things,
and while remaining in herself, she renews all things,
in every generation she passes into holy souls
and makes them friends of God, and prophets;
for God loves nothing so much as the person who lives with wisdom.
She is more beautiful than the sun,
and excels every constellation of the stars.
Compared with the light she is found to be superior,
for it is succeeded by the night,
but against wisdom evil does not prevail.
She reaches mightily from one end of the earth to the other,
and she orders all things well.

Psalm 96:7-13

^7 Ascribe to the Lord, you families of the peoples; *
ascribe to the Lord honour and strength.
^8 Ascribe to the Lord the honour due to his name; *
bring offerings and come into his courts.
^9 O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; *
let the whole earth tremble before him.
^10 Tell it out among the nations that the Lord is king. *
He has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved;
he will judge the peoples with equity.
^11 Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad; *
let the sea thunder and all that is in it;
^12 Let the fields be joyful and all that is in them; *
let all the trees of the wood shout for joy before the Lord.
^13 For he comes, he comes to judge the earth; *
with righteousness he will judge the world
and the peoples with his truth.
or

Psalm 37:3-6,32-33

^3 Trust in the Lord and be doing good; *
dwell in the land and be nourished with truth.
^4 Let your delight be in the Lord *
and he will give you your hearts desire.
^5 Commit your way to the Lord and put your trust in him, *
and he will bring it to pass.
^6 He will make your righteousness as clear as the light *
and your just dealing as the noonday.
^32 The law of their God is in their heart *
and their footsteps shall not slide.
^33 The wicked spy on the righteous *
and seek occasion to slay them.

John 4:19-24

The woman said to him, Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our
ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where
people must worship is in Jerusalem. Jesus said to her, Woman,
believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither
on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we
worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is
coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the
Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to
worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in
spirit and truth.
