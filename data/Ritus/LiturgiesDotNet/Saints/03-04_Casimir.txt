From the Common of Holy Men and Women: For One Saint
COLLECT
Deus omnipotens, cui servire regnare est, concede nobis, beati Casimiri
intercedente suffragio, tibi in sanctitate et iustitia perpetuo
famulari.
Almighty God, to serve you is to reign;
grant that, with the help of Saint Casimir's intercession,
we may constantly serve you in holiness and justice.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Philippians 3:8-14
Brothers and sisters:
I consider everything as a loss
because of the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
For his sake I have accepted the loss of all things
and I consider them so much rubbish,
that I may gain Christ and be found in him,
not having any righteousness of my own based on the law
but that which comes through faith in Christ,
the righteousness from God,
depending on faith to know him and the power of his resurrection
and the sharing of his sufferings by being conformed to his death,
if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

It is not that i have already taken hold of it
or have already attained perfect maturity,
but I continue my pursuit in hope that I may possess it,
since I have indeed been taken possession of by Christ Jesus.
Brothers and sisters, I for my part
do not consider myself to have taken possession.
Just one thing: forgetting what lies behind
but straining forward to what lies ahead,
I continue my pursuit toward the goal,
the prize of God's upward calling, in Christ Jesus.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          15:2-3ab,3cd-4ab,5
Iustus requiescet in monte sancto tuo, Domine.
R. (l) The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
He who walks blamelessly and does justice;
who thinks the truth in his heart
and slanders not with his tongue.
R. The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
Who harms not his fellow man,
nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;
By whom the reprobate is despised,
while he honors those who fear the LORD.
R. The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
Who lends not his money at usury
and accepts no bribe against the innocent.
He who does these things
shall never be disturbed.
R. The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          John 13:34
Mandatum novum do vobis, dicit Dominus, ut diligatis invicem, sicut
dilexi vos.
I give you a new commandment:
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL READING
John 15:9-17
Jesus said to his disciples:
"As the Father loves me, so I also love you.
Remain In my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love,
just as I have kept my Father's commandments
and remain in his love.

"I have told you this so that my joy might be in you
and your joy might be complete.
This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
No one has greater love than this,
to lay down one's life for one's friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you slaves,
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
I have called you friends,
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,
so that whatever you ask the Father In my name he may give you.
This I command you: love one another."

From the Common of Holy Men except the following:
Office of Readings
From the life of Saint Casimir written by an contemporary
(Cap. 2-3: Acta Sanctorum Martii 1, 347-348)
By fulfiling the commands of the Most High he stored up treasure for
himself

By the power of the Holy Spirit, Casimir burned with a sincere and
unpretentious love for almighty God that was almost unbelievable in its
strength. So rich was his love and so abundantly did it fill his heart,
that it flowed out from his inner spirit toward his fellow men. As a
result nothing was more pleasant, nothing more desirable for him, than
to share his belongings, and even to dedicate and give his entire self
to Christ�s poor, to strangers, to the sick, to those in captivity and
all who suffer. To widows, orphans and the afflicted, he was not only a
guardian and patron but a father, son and brother. One would have to
compose a long account to record here all his works of love and
dedication for God and for mankind. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine
or to express his passion for justice, his exercise of moderation, his
gift of prudence, his fundamental spiritual courage and stability,
especially in a most permissive age, when men tend to be headstrong and
by their very natures inclined to sin.

Daily he urged his father to practice justice throughout his kingdom
and in the governance of his people; and whenever anything in the
country had been overlooked because of human weakness or simple
neglect, he never failed to point it out quietly to the king.

He actively took up the cause of the needy and unfortunate and embraced
it as his own; for this reason the people called him the patron of the
poor. Though the son of a king and descendant of a noble line, he was
never unapproachable in his conversation or dealings with anyone, no
matter how humble or obscure.

He always preferred to be counted among the meek and poor of spirit,
among those who are promised the kingdom of heaven, rather than among
the famous and powerful men of this world. He had no ambition for the
power that lies in human rank and he would never accept it from his
father. He was afraid the barbs of wealth, which our Lord Jesus Christ
spoke of as thorns, would wound his soul, or that he would be
contaminated by contact with worldly goods.

Many who acted as his personal servants or secretaries are still alive
today; these men, of the highest integrity, who had personal knowledge
of his private life, testify that he preserved his chastity to the very
end of his life.
RESPONSORY          Sirach 29:11; 1 Timothy 6:11
Invest your wealth according to the command of the Most High.
- It will yield a profit far greater than gold.
Strive for justice, reverence, faith and love;
always be patient and gentle.
- It will yield a profit far greater than gold.
COLLECT
Almighty God, to serve you is to reign;
grant that, with the help of Saint Casimir's intercession,
we may constantly serve you in holiness and justice.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
