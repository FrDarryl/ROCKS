COLLECT
Deus, qui, ad tuendam catholicam fidem et universa in Christo
instauranda, beatum Pium papam caelesti sapientia et apostolica
fortitudine replevisti, concede propitius, ut, eius instituta et
exempla sectantes, praemia consequamur aeterna.
O God, who to safeguard the Catholic faith
and to restore all things in Christ,
filled Pope Saint Pius the Tenth
with heavenly wisdom and apostolic fortitude,
graciously grant
that, following his teaching and example,
we may gain an eternal prize.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING      1 Thessalonians 2:2b-8
Brothers and sisters:
We drew courage through our God
to speak to you the Gospel of God with much struggle.
Our exhortation was not from delusion or impure motives,
nor did it work through deception.
But as we were judged worthy by God to be entrusted with the Gospel,
that is how we speak,
not as trying to please men,
but rather God, who judges our hearts.
Nor, indeed, did we ever appear with flattering speech, as you know,
or with a pretext for greed�God is witness�nor did we seek praise
from men, either from you or from others,
although we were able to impose our weight as Apostles of Christ.
Rather, we were gentle among you,
as a nursing mother cares for her children.
With such affection for you,
we were determined to share with you not only the Gospel of God,
but our very selves as well, so dearly beloved had you become to us.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          119:9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Doce me, Domine, iustificationes tuas.
R. (12) Lord, teach me your statutes.
How shall a young man be faultless in his way?
By keeping to your words.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
With all my heart I seek you;
let me not stray from your commands.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
Within my heart I treasure your promise,
that I may not sin against you.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
Blessed are you,
O LORD; teach me your statutes.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
With my lips I declare
all the ordinances of your mouth.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
In the way of your decrees I rejoice,
as much as in all riches.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
GOSPEL             John 21:15-17
After Jesus had revealed himself to his disciples and eaten breakfast
with them,
he said to Simon Peter,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
Jesus said to him, "Feed my lambs."
He then said to Simon Peter a second time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
He said to him the third time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time,
"Do you love me?" and he said to him,
"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you."
Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Oblationibus nostris, Domine, benigne susceptis, da, quaesumus, ut haec
divina mysteria, beati Pii papae monita secuti, sinceris tractemus

and grant, O Lord, we pray,
that, following the teachings of Pope Saint Pius,

Through Christ our Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Memoriam beati Pii papae celebrantes, quaesumus, Domine Deus noster,
ut, virtute mensae caelestis, constantes efficiamur in fide, et in tua
simus caritate concordes.
Celebrating the Memorial of Pope Saint Pius,
we pray, O Lord our God,
that by the power of this heavenly table
we may be made constant in the faith
and be of one accord in your love.
Through Christ our Lord.

Liturgy of the Hours

From the Common of Pastors, except the following:

From the Office of Readings
From the apostolic constitution Divino Afflatu of Pope Saint Pius X
(AAS 3 , 633-635)
The song of the Church

The collection of psalms found in Scripture, composed as it was under
divine inspiration, has, from the very beginnings of the Church, shown
a wonderful power of fostering devotion among Christians as they offer
to God a continuous sacrifice of praise, the harvest of lips blessing
his name. Following a custom already established in the Old Law, the
psalms have played a conspicuous part in the sacred liturgy itself, and
in the divine office. Thus was born what Basil calls the voice of the
Church, that singing of psalms, which is the daughter of that hymn of
praise (to use the words of our predecessor, Urban VIII) which goes up
unceasingly before the throne of God and of the Lamb, and which teaches
those especially charged with the duty of divine worship, as Athanasius
says, the way to praise God, and the fitting words in which to bless
him. Augustine expresses this well when he says: God praised himself so
that man might give him fitting praise; because God chose to praise
himself man found the way in which to bless God.

The psalms have also a wonderful power to awaken in our hearts the
desire for every virtue. Athanasius says: Though all Scripture, both
old and new, is divinely inspired and has its use in teaching, as we
read in Scripture itself, yet the Book of Psalms, like a garden
enclosing the fruits of all the other books, produces its fruits in
song, and in the process of singing brings forth its own special fruits
to take their place beside them. In the same place Athanasius rightly
adds: The psalms seem to me to be like a mirror, in which the person
using them can see himself, and the stirrings of his own heart; he can
recite them against the background of his own emotions. Augustine says
in his Confessions: How I wept when I heard your hymns and canticles,
being deeply moved by the sweet singing of your Church. Those voices
flowed into my ears, truth filtered into my heart, and from my heart
surged waves of devotion. Tears ran down, and I was happy in my tears.

Indeed, who could fail to be moved by those many passages in the
psalms which set forth so profoundly the infinite majesty of God, his
omnipotence, his justice and goodness and clemency, too deep for words,
and all the other infinite qualities of his that deserve our praise?
Who could fail to be roused to the same emotions by the prayers of
thanksgiving to God for blessings received, by the petitions, so humble
and confident, for blessings still awaited, by the cries of a soul in
sorrow for sin committed? Who would not be fired with love as he looks
on the likeness of Christ, the redeemer, here so lovingly foretold? His
was the voice Augustine heard in every psalm, the voice of praise, of
suffering, of joyful expectation, of present distress.
RESPONSORY           1 Thessalonians 2:4, 3
God has found us worthy to be ministers of his Gospel, and so when we
speak,
� we strive to please God and not men.
Our preaching does not spring from error, or impure motives,
or a desire to deceive.
� We strive to please God and not men.
