GLORIA
COLLECT
Robora in nobis, Domine, fidem, qua Filio tuo beatus Bartholomaeus
apostolus sincero animo adhaesit, et praesta, ut, ipso deprecante,
Ecclesia tua cunctis gentibus salutis fiat sacramentum.
Strengthen in us, O Lord, the faith,
by which the blessed Apostle Bartholomew
clung wholeheartedly to your Son,
and grant that through the help of his prayers
your Church may become for all the nations
the sacrament of salvation.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Revelation 21:9b-14
The angel spoke to me, saying,
�Come here.
I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.�
He took me in spirit to a great, high mountain
and showed me the holy city Jerusalem
coming down out of heaven from God.
It gleamed with the splendor of God.
Its radiance was like that of a precious stone,
like jasper, clear as crystal.
It had a massive, high wall,
with twelve gates where twelve angels were stationed
and on which names were inscribed,
the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
There were three gates facing east,
three north, three south, and three west.
The wall of the city had twelve courses of stones as its foundation,
on which were inscribed the twelve names
of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 145:10-11, 12-13, 17-18
Sancti tui, Domine, notam faciant gloriam regni tui.
R. Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD,
and let your faithful ones bless you.
Let them discourse of the glory of your Kingdom
and speak of your might.
R. Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
Making known to men your might
and the glorious splendor of your Kingdom.
Your Kingdom is a Kingdom for all ages,
and your dominion endures through all generations.
R. Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
The LORD is just in all his ways
and holy in all his works.
The LORD is near to all who call upon him,
to all who call upon him in truth.
R. Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
ALLELUIA          John 1:49
Rabbi, tu es Filius Dei, tu es rex Israel.
Rabbi, you are the Son of God;
you are the King of Israel.
GOSPEL           John 1:45-51
Philip found Nathanael and told him,
�We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the law,
and also the prophets, Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth.�
But Nathanael said to him,
�Can anything good come from Nazareth?�
Philip said to him, �Come and see.�
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him,
�Here is a true child of Israel.
There is no duplicity in him.�
Nathanael said to him, �How do you know me?�
Jesus answered and said to him,
�Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.�
Nathanael answered him,
�Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.�
Jesus answered and said to him,
�Do you believe
because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree?
You will see greater things than this.�
And he said to him, �Amen, amen, I say to you,
you will see heaven opened and the angels of God
ascending and descending on the Son of Man.�
