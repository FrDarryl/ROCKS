FIRST READING          Deuteronomy 6:3-9
Moses said to the people:
"Hear, Israel, and be careful to observe these commandments,
that you may grow and prosper the more,
in keeping with the promise of the LORD, the God of your fathers,
to give you a land flowing with milk and honey.

"Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone!
Therefore, you shall love the LORD, your God,
with all your heart,
and with all your soul,
and with all your strength.
Take to heart these words which I enjoin on you today.
Drill them into your children.
Speak of them at home and abroad, whether you are busy or at rest.
Bind them at your wrist as a sign
and let them be as a pendant on your forehead.
Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates."

ALLELUIA          Jn 14:23
Si quis diligit me, sermonem meam servabit, dicit Dominus et Pater meus
diliget eum; et ad eum veniemus.
Whoever loves me will keep my word
and my Father will love him and we will come to him.
GOSPEL           Matthew 25: 14-30 (Short Form: Matthew 25:14-23)
Jesus told his disciples this parable:
"A man who was going on a journey
called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one--
to each according to his ability.
Then he went away.
Immediately the one who received five talents went and traded with
them,
and made another five.
Likewise, the one who received two made another two.
But the one who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground
and buried his master's money.
After a long time
the master of those servants came back
and settled accounts with them.
The one who had received five talents
came forward bringing the additional five.
He said, 'Master, you gave me five talents.
See, I have made five more.'
His master said to him,
`Well done, my good and faithful servant.
Since you were faithful in small matters,
I will give you great responsibilities.
Come, share your master's joy.'
Then the one who had received two talents also came forward and said,
`Master, you gave me two talents.
See, I have made two more.'
His master said to him,
`Well done, my good and faithful servant.
Since you were faithful in small matters,
I will give you great responsibilities.
Come, share your master's joy.'
[Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said,
`Master, I knew you were a demanding person,
harvesting where you did not plant
and gathering where you did not scatter;
so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground.
Here it is back.'
His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant!
So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant
and gather where I did not scatter?
Should you not then have put my money in the bank
so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?
Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.
For to everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich;
but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside,
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth!"']

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From admonitions to his son by Saint Stephen
(Cap. 1, 2, 10; PL 151, 1236-1237, 1242-1244)
Son, listen to your father's instruction
My dearest son, if you desire to honor the royal crown, I advise, I
counsel, I urge you above all things to maintain the Catholic and
apostolic faith with such diligence and care that you may be an example
for all those placed under you by God and that all the clergy may
rightly call you a man of true Christian profession.  Failing to do
this, you may be sure that you will not be called a Christian or a son
of the Church. Indeed, in the royal palace after the faith itself, the
Church holds second place, first propagated as she was by our head,
Christ; then transplanted, firmly constituted and spread through the
whole world by his members, the apostles and holy fathers. And though
she always produced fresh offspring, nevertheless in certain places she
is regarded as ancient.

However, dearest son, even now in our kingdom the Church is proclaimed
as young and newly planted; and for that reason she needs more prudent
and trustworthy guardians lest a benefit which the divine mercy
bestowed on us undeservedly should be destroyed and annihilated through
your idleness, indolence or neglect.

My beloved son, delight of my heart, hope of your posterity, I pray, I
command, that at every time and in everything, strengthened by your
devotion to me, you may show favor not only to relations and kin, or to
the most eminent, be they leaders or rich men or neighbors or
fellow-countrymen, but also to foreigners and to all who come to you.
By fulfilling your duty in this way you will reach the highest state of
happiness. Be merciful to all who are suffering violence, keeping
always in your heart the example of the Lord who said: I desire mercy
and not sacrifice.  Be patient with everyone, not only with the
powerful, but also with the weak.

Finally be strong lest prosperity lift you up too much or adversity
cast you down. Be humble in this life, that God may raise you up in the
next. Be truly moderate and do not punish or condemn anyone
immoderately. Be gentle so that you may never oppose justice. Be
honorable so that you may never voluntarily bring disgrace upon anyone.
Be chaste so that you may avoid all the foulness of lust like the pangs
of death.

All these virtues I have noted above make up the royal crown and
without them no one is fit to rule here on earth or attain the heavenly
kingdom.
RESPONSORY          Tobit 4:8-9; Sirach 35:11,12
Give alms in proportion to your means;
- if you have many possessions, give generously;
if you have little, give some of what you have.
And when you give, give with a cheerful face;
give to the Most High as he has given to you.
- If you have many possessions, give generously;
if you have little, give some of what you have.
COLLECT
Grant your Church, we pray, almighty God,
that she may have Saint Stephen of Hungary,
who fostered her growth while a king on earth,
as her glorious defender in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
