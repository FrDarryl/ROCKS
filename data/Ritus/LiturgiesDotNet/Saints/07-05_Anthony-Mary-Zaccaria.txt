Da nobis, Domine, ut supereminentem Iesu Christi scientiam spiritu
Pauli apostoli prosequamur, qua beatus Antonius Maria eruditus verbum
salutis in Ecclesia tua iugiter praedicavit.
Grant, O Lord, that in the spirit of the Apostle Paul
we may pursue the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ,
for, having learned it,
Saint Anthony Zaccaria
constantly preached your saving word in the Church.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Timothy 1:13-14, 2:1-3
Beloved:
Take as your norm the sound words that you heard from me,
in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
Guard this rich trust with the help of the Holy Spirit
who dwells within us.

My child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
And what you heard from me through many witnesses
entrust to faithful people
who will have the ability to teach others as well.
Bear your share of hardship along with me
like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 1:1-2, 3, 4 and 6
Vincente dabo edere de ligno vitae.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
Blessed the man who follows not
the counsel of the wicked,
nor walks in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the company of the insolent,
but delights in the law of the Lord
and meditates on his law day and night.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
He is like a tree
planted near running water,
that yields its fruit in due season,
and whose leaves never fade.
Whatever he does, prospers.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
Not so the wicked, not so;
they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
For the Lord watches over the way of the just,
but the way of the wicked vanishes.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
ALLELUIA          Cf. Mt 11:25
Benedictus es, Pater, Domine caeli et terrae, quia mysteria regni
parvulis revelasti.
Blessed are you, Father, lord of heaven and earth;
you have revealed to little ones the mysteries of the Kingdom.
GOSPEL           Mark 10:13-16
People were bringing children to Jesus that he might touch them,
but the disciples rebuked them.
When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them,
"Let the children come to me; do not prevent them,
for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
Amen, I say to you,
whoever does not accept the Kingdom of God like a child
will not enter it."
Then he embraced them and blessed them,
placing his hands on them.

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a sermon to fellow members of his society by Saint Anthony
Zaccaria, priest
(J.A. Gabutio, Historia Congregationis Clericorum Regularium S. Pauli,
1,8)
The follower of the apostle Paul
We are fools for Christ's sake: our holy guide and most revered patron
was speaking about himself and the rest of the apostles, and about the
other people who profess the Christian and apostolic way of life. But
there is no reason, dear brothers, that we should be surprised or
afraid; for the disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor the slave
to his master. We should love and feel compassion for those who oppose
us, rather than abhor and despise them, since they harm themselves and
do us good, and adorn us with crowns of everlasting glory while they
incite God's anger against themselves. And even more than this, we
should pray for them and not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil by
goodness. We should heap good works like red-hot coals of burning love
upon their heads, as our Apostle urges us to do, so that when they
become aware of our tolerance and gentleness they may undergo a change
of heart and be prompted to turn in love to God.

In his mercy God has chosen us, unworthy as we are, out of the world,
to serve him and thus to advance in goodness and to bear the greatest
possible fruit of love in patience. We should take encouragement not
only from the hope of sharing in the glory of God's children, but also
from the hardships we undergo.

Consider your calling, dearest brothers; if we wish to think
carefully about it we shall see readily enough that its basis demands
that we who have set out to follow, admittedly from afar, the footsteps
of the holy apostles and the other soldiers of Christ, should not be
unwilling to share in their sufferings as well. We should keep running
steadily in the race we have started, not losing sight of Jesus, who
leads us in our faith and brings it to perfection. And so since we have
chosen such a great Apostle as our guide and father and claim to follow
him, we should try to put his teaching and example into practice in our
lives. Such a leader should not be served by faint-hearted troops, nor
should such a parent find his sons unworthy of him.
RESPONSORY          Acts 20:21,24; Romans 1:16
I have preached faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,
and now I fear no danger.
- I do not count my life more precious than my work,
which is to finish my course,
the task of preaching and proclaiming
the good news of God's grace.

I am not ashamed of the Gospel.
- I do not count my life more precious than my work,
which is to finish my course,
the task of preaching and proclaiming
the good news of God's grace.
