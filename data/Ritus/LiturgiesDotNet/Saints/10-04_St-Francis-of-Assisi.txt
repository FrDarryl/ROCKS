FIRST READING          Galatians 6:14-18
Brothers and sisters:
May I never boast except in the cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through which the world has been crucified to me,
and I to the world.
For neither does circumcision mean anything,
nor does uncircumcision,
but only a new creation.
Peace and mercy be to all who follow this rule
and to the Israel of God.

From now on, let no one make troubles for me;
for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit,
brothers and sisters. Amen.

Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;
I say to the LORD, “My Lord are you.”
O LORD, my allotted portion and cup,
you it is who hold fast my lot.
R.      You are my inheritance, O Lord.
I bless the LORD who counsels me;
even in the night my heart exhorts me.. I set the LORD ever before me;
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.
R.      You are my inheritance, O Lord.
You will show me the path to life,
fullness of joys in your presence,
the delights at your right hand forever.
R.      You are my inheritance, O Lord.
ALLELUIA          Cf. Mt 11:25
Benedictus es, Pater, Domine caeli et terrae, quia mysteria regni
parvulis revelasti.
Blessed are you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
you have revealed to little ones the mysteries of the Kingdom.
GOSPEL          Matthew 11:25-30
At that time Jesus exclaimed,
"I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
for although you have hidden these things
from the wise and the learned
you have revealed them to little ones.
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.
No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.

"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart;
and you will find rest for your selves.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."

Liturgy of the Hours
Francis of Assisi
From the Common of Holy Men: religious, except for the following:
Morning Prayer
HYMN

[in_caelesti_collegio.jpg] Literal translation
In the heavenly company,
Francis shines in glory,
bearing the marks of Christ
by a distinguished privilege.

This brother of the poor
announcing the cross of the Lord,
the sign of the covenant
has become companion of the apostles.

This martyr by desire
carries the cross after Jesus
Christ unites him with the
gathering of martyrs in heaven.

Francis was always bearing
the cross through abstinence.
Now he has happily obtained
the glory of the Confessors.

Shining with sparkling splendour,
following the Lord who suffered,
now by way of reward of his chastity
he rejoices in the choir of virgins.

May the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
through the wounds of Francis,
make us shine with divine light,
and give us the gifts without end. Amen.
Verse translation:
St. Francis shines in glorious light
among the heavnly college bright,
for by a grace of special kind
Christs marks are on St. Francis signed.

He lived with friends in poverty,
an apostolic company,
and bears the cross that signals peace,
the covenant that shall not cease.

A martyr by desire, he bears
the cross of Christ, whose sign he wears,
so in the heavns Christ makes him be
one with the martyrs company.

He always bore the cross of Christ.
Through abstinence he sacrificed.
So with confessors now he reigns
and with them their reward he gains.

In gleaming robes as white as snow
he follows where Christs footsteps go,
and joys in chastitys great prize
in angel choirs above the skies.

O Father, Son, and Spirit, by
The wounds of Francis purify
Your servants who these gifts implore
Forever and forevermore.

BENEDICTUS (Canticle of Zechariah)
Antiphon: Francis left this earth a poor and lowly man; he enters
heaven rich in God's favor, greeted with songs of rejoicing.

Office of Readings
A letter from St Francis of Assisi to all the faithful
(Opuscula, edit. Quaracchi 1949, 87-94)
We must be simple, humble and pure

It was through his archangel, Saint Gabriel, that the Father above made
known to the holy and glorious Virgin Mary that the worthy, holy and
glorious Word of the Father would come from heaven and take from her
womb the real flesh of our human frailty. Though he was wealthy beyond
reckoning, he still willingly chose to be poor with his blessed mother.
And shortly before his passion he celebrated the Passover with his
disciples. Then he prayed to his Father saying: "Father, if it be
possible, let this cup be taken from me."
Nevertheless, he reposed his will in the will of his Father. The Father
willed that his blessed and glorious Son, whom he gave to us and who
was born for us, should through his own blood offer himself as a
sacrificial victim on the altar of the cross. This was to be done not
for himself through whom all things were made, but for our sins. It was
intended to leave us an example of how to follow in his footsteps. And
he desires all of us to be saved through him, and to receive him with
pure heart and chaste body.
O how happy and blessed are those who love the Lord and do as the Lord
himself said in the gospel: "You shall love the Lord your God with your
whole heart and your whole soul; and your neighbour as yourself."
Therefore, let us love God and adore him with pure heart and mind. This
is his particular desire when he says: "True worshippers adore the
Father in spirit and truth." For all who adore him must do so in the
spirit of truth. Let us also direct to him our praises and prayers
saying: "Our Father, who art in heaven," since "we must always pray and
never grow slack."
Furthermore, let us produce worthy fruits of penance. Let us also love
our neighbours as ourselves. Let us have charity and humility. Let us
give alms because these cleanse our souls from the stains of sin. Men
lose all the material things they leave behind them in this world, but
they carry with them the reward of their charity and the alms they
give. For these they will receive from the Lord the reward and
recompense they deserve. We must not be wise and prudent according to
the flesh. Rather we must be simple, humble and pure. We should never
desire to be over others. Instead, we ought to be servants who are
submissive to every human being for Gods sake. The Spirit of the Lord
will rest on all who live in this way and persevere in it to the end.
He will permanently dwell in them. They will be the Fathers children
who do his work. They are the spouses, brothers and mothers of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
RESPONSORY           Matthew 5:3-4,6
Blessed are you who are poor,
for the kingdom of God is yours.
- Blessed are those of gentle spirit;
they shall inherit the land.
Blessed are you who hunger now;
you shall be satisfied.
- Blessed are those of gentle spirit;
they shall inherit the land.
COLLECT
O God, by whose gift Saint Francis
was conformed to Christ in poverty and humility,
grant that, by walking in Francis’ footsteps,
we may follow your Son,
and, through joyful charity,
come to be united with you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
