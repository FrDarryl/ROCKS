Concede nos, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, beati Petri episcopi monita et
exempla sectari, ut, Christo nihil praeponentes et Ecclesiae tuae
servitio semper intenti, ad aeternae lucis gaudia perducamur.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that we may so follow the teaching and example
of the Bishop Saint Peter Damian,
that, putting nothing before Christ
and always ardent in the service of your Church,
we may be led to the joys of eternal light.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Timothy 4:1-5
Beloved:
I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
who will judge the living and the dead,
and by his appearing and his kingly power:
proclaim the word;
be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient;
convince, reprimand, encourage through all patience and teaching.
For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine
but, following their own desires and insatiable curiosity,
will accumulate teachers and will stop listening to the truth
and will be diverted to myths.
But you, be self-possessed in all circumstances;
put up with hardship;
perform the work of an evangelist;
fulfill your ministry.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          16:1b-2a;5,7-8;11
Tu es, Domine, pars heredidatis meae.
R. (see 5a)   You are my inheritance, O Lord.
Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;
I say to the LORD, “My Lord are you.”
O LORD, my allotted portion and cup,
you it is who hold fast my lot.
R.      You are my inheritance, O Lord.
I bless the LORD who counsels me;
even in the night my heart exhorts me.
I set the LORD ever before me;
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.
R.      You are my inheritance, O Lord.
You will show me the path to life,
fullness of joys in your presence,
the delights at your right hand forever.
R.      You are my inheritance, O Lord.
ALLELUIA          John 15:9b, 5b
Remain in my love, says the Lord;
Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit.
GOSPEL READING          John 15:1-8
Jesus said to his disciples:
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower.
He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit,
and every one that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit.
You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.
Remain in me, as I remain in you.
Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own
unless it remains on the vine,
so neither can you unless you remain in me.
I am the vine, you are the branches.
Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit,
because without me you can do nothing.
Anyone who does not remain in me
will be thrown out like a branch and wither;
people will gather them and throw them into a fire
and they will be burned.
If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you.
By this is my Father glorified,
that you bear much fruit and become my disciples."

Office of Readings
From a letter by Saint Peter Damian, bishop
(Lib. 8, 6: PL 144, 473-476)
Let us rejoice in the joy that follows sadness
You asked me to write you some words of consolation, my brother.
Embittered by so many tribulations, you are seeking some comfort for
your soul. You asked me to offer you some soothing suggestions.

But there is no need for me to write. Consolation is already within
your reach, if your good sense has not been dulled. My son, come to the
service of God. Stand in justice and fear. Prepare your soul; it is
about to be tested. These words of Scripture show that you are a son of
God and, as such, should take possession of your inheritance. What
could be clearer than this exhortation?

Where there is justice as well as fear, adversity will surely test the
spirit. But it is not the torment of a slave. Rather it is the
discipline of a child by its parent.

Even in the midst of his many sufferings, the holy man Job could say:
Whip me, crush me, cut me in slices! And he would always add: This at
least would bring me relief, yet my persecutor does not spare me.

But for God's chosen ones there is great comfort; the torment lasts but
a short time. Then God bends down, cradles the fallen figure, whispers
words of consolation. With hope in his heart, man picks himself up and
walks again toward the glory of happiness in heaven.

Craftsmen exemplify this same practice. By hammering gold, the smith
beats out the dross. The sculptor files metal to reveal a shining vein
underneath. The potter's furnace puts vessels to the test. And the fire
of suffering tests the mettle of just men. The apostle James echoes
this thought: Think it a great joy, dear brothers and sisters, when you
stumble onto the many kinds of trials and tribulations.

When men suffer pain for the evil they have perpetrated in life, they
should take some reassurance. They also know that for their good deeds
undying rewards await them in the life to come.

Therefore, my brother, scorned as you are by men, lashed as it were by
God, do not despair. Do not be depressed. Do not let your weakness make
you impatient, Instead, let the serenity of your spirit shine through
your face. Let the joy of your mind burst forth. Let words of thanks
break from your lips.

The way that God deals with men can only be praised. He lashes them in
this life to shield them from the eternal lash in the next. He pins
people down now; at a later time he will raise them up. He cuts them
before healing; he throws them down to raise them anew.

The Scriptures reassure us: let your understanding strengthen your
patience. In serenity look forward to the joy that follows sadness.
Hope leads you to that joy and love enkindles your zeal. The
well-prepared mind forgets the suffering inflicted from without and
glides eagerly to what it has contemplated within itself.
RESPONSORY          Sirach 31:8, 11, 10
Blessed is the man who is found without fault,
who does not make gold his life's object,
who does not put his trust in wealth.
- His future will be secure in the Lord.
He was able to sin, but did not;
he was able to do wrong, but would not.
- His future will be secure in the Lord.
