Invitatory
Antiphon: Come let us worship the Lord, whom the angels worship.
Venite (Psalm 95:1-7)
Come let us sing to the Lord; *
let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *
and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God, *
and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are the caverns of the earth, *
and the heights of the hills are his also.
The sea is his, for he made it, *
and his hands have molded the dry land.
Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, *
and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is our God,*
and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.
Today if you would hear his voice*
harden not your hearts.
Antiphon: Come let us worship the Lord, whom the angels worship.
Hymn
[EMBED]
Tune: Bath
The mighty host on high,
their joys beyond compare,
their glories in the sky,
the deeds they bravely dare;
for these the church today
pours forth he joyous lay,
to heaven's great princes praise to pay.
Captains of mighty race
and noble champions, they
the evil spirits chase,
undaunted in the fray;
they speed, in ranks arrayed,
the upright soul to aid,
and crown him victor undismayed.
What tongue can here declare,
or imagery imply,
the joys that you prepare
for these your hosts on high?
They, for their warfare decked,
their earthly friends protect
and in right paths to heaven direct.
To you, O Lord Most High,
One in Three Person, still
to pardon us we cry,
and to preserve from ill,
that after perils sore
your Name we may adore
with holy angels evermore. Amen.

Psalms are from the current weekday in the Psalter.

Mid Morning

Reading: Acts 5:17-20
The high priest took action; he and all who were with him (that is, the
sect of the Sadducees), being filled with jealousy, arrested the
apostles and put them in the public prison. But during the night an
angel of the Lord opened the prison doors, brought them out, and said,
�Go, stand in the temple and tell the people the whole message about
this life.�
In the presence of the angels, I will sing to you my God.
- I will worship in your holy temple and praise your name.

Midday

Reading: Acts 12:7
Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell.
He tapped Peter on the side and woke him, saying, �Get up quickly.� And
the chains fell off his wrists.
The Lord has sent his angel.
- Who rescued me from the power of Herod.

Mid Afternoon

Reading: Acts 10:3-5
One afternoon at about three o�clock he had a vision in which he
clearly saw an angel of God coming in and saying to him, �Cornelius.�
He stared at him in terror and said, �What is it, Lord?� He answered,
�Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. Now
send men to Joppa for a certain Simon who is called Peter.
The prayer of the saints rose like incense.
- It went forth from the angel's hand in the presence of God.

Prayer

watch over us. Hear our prayers, defend us always by their protection

Hymn

[EMBED]
Tune: Tallis Canon
Creator of the hosts on high,
as well as earth and sea and sky,
your providence will never cease
to rule your works in might and peace.
Be present, Lord to hear our call:
from sin restore us when we fall;
and as we run our earthly race,
illume our minds with heavenly grace.
To each of us an angel send,
assigned to counsel and defend,
that he may help us judge aright
and put all evil powers to flight.
Let him expose the hidden snares
that Satan for our doom prepares,
lest we be captured in the net
before our heedless footsteps set.
To you our grateful praise we bring,
O Christ, of men and angels King,
Whom with the Father we adore
and Holy Spirit evermore. Amen.
The Psalms
Antiphon 1: The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear
him, to rescue them.

Psalm 34
I

I will bless the Lord continually *
his praise shall be always in my mouth.
Let my soul boast of the Lord *
the humble shall hear it and rejoice.
O praise the Lord with me *
let us exalt his name together.
For I sought the Lord's help and he answered *
and he freed me from all my fears.
Look towards him and be bright with joy *
your faces shall not be ashamed.
Here is a wretch who cried, and the Lord heard him *
and saved him from all his troubles.
The angel of the Lord encamps round those who fear him *
and delivers them in their need.
O taste and see that the Lord is good *
happy the man who hides in him!
Fear the Lord, all you his holy ones *
for those who fear him never lack.
Lions may suffer want and go hungry *
but those who seek the Lord lack nothing good.
Antiphon 1: The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear
him, to rescue them.
Antiphon 2: Our God is a living God, for his angel has protected
me.

II

Come, my children, listen to me *
and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
Which of you relishes life *
wants time to enjoy good things?
Keep your tongue from evil *
and your lips from telling lies.
Turn from evil and do good *
seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of God are on the righteous *
and his ears towards their cry.
The Lord sets his face against wrongdoers *
to root out their memory from the earth.
The righteous cry; the Lord hears it *
and frees them from all their afflictions.
The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted *
and the crushed in spirit he saves.
The trials of the righteous are many *
but our God delivers him from them all.
He guards all his bones *
so that not one is broken.
Evil will slay the wicked *
and those who hate the righteous will be destroyed.
The Lord ransoms the lives of his servants *
Antiphon 2: Our God is a living God, for his angel has protected
me.
Antiphon 3: Glorify the God of heaven, sing praise to him before
all living creatures, for he has shown you such great mercy.
Revelation 11:17-18, 12:10-12
'We give you thanks, Lord God Almighty,
who are and who were,
for you have taken your great power
and begun to reign.
The nations raged,
but your wrath has come,
and the time for judging the dead,
for rewarding your servants, the prophets
and saints and all who fear your name,
both small and great,
and for destroying those who destroy the earth.'
'Now have come the salvation and the power
and the kingdom of our God
and the authority of his Messiah,
for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down,
who accuses them day and night before our God.
But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb
and by the word of their testimony,
for they did not cling to life even in the face of death.
Rejoice then, you heavens
and those who dwell in them!
Antiphon 3: Glorify the God of heaven, sing praise to him before
all living creatures, for he has shown you such great mercy.

Gospel
Matthew 18:1-5,10

greatest in the kingdom of heaven?� He called a child, whom he
put among them, and said, �Truly I tell you, unless you change
and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of
heaven. Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever welcomes one such child in my
name welcomes me.

for, I tell you, in heaven their angels continually see the face
of my Father in heaven.

Psalms
Ant 1. The Lord God + of heaven and earth / shall send his Angel
before you.

Psalm 97
Dominus regnavit

The Lord is king, let earth rejoice,
let all the coastlands be glad.

Cloud and darkness are his raiment;
his throne, justice and right.

A fire prepares his path;
it burns up his foes on every side.

His lightnings light up the world,
the earth trembles at the sight.

The mountains melt like wax
before the Lord of all the earth.

The skies proclaim his justice;
all peoples see his glory.

Let those who serve idols be ashamed,
those who boast of their worthless gods.
All you spirits, worship him.

Zion hears and is glad;
the people of Judah rejoice
because of your judgments, O Lord.

For you indeed are the Lord
most high above all the earth,
exalted far above all spirits.

The Lord loves those who hate evil;
he guards the souls of his saints;
he sets them free from the wicked.

Light shines forth for the just
and joy for the upright of heart.

Rejoice, you just, in the Lord;
give glory to his holy name.
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy
Spirit,
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
world without end.
Amen.
Ant. 1. The Lord God + of heaven and earth / shall send
his Angel before you.
Ant. 2. My God + has sent his Angel, and has shut the
lions' mouths, / that they have not hurt me.

Psalm 103
Benedic, anima mea

I

My soul, give thanks to the Lord
all my being, bless his holy name.

My soul, give thanks to the Lord
and never forget all his blessings.

It is he who forgives all your guilt,
who heals every one of your ills,

who redeems your life from the grave,
who crowns you with love and compassion,

who fills your life with good things,
renewing your youth like an eagle's.

The Lord does deeds of justice,
gives judgment for all who are oppressed.

He made known his ways to Moses
and his deeds to Israel's sons.

The Lord is compassion and love,
slow to anger and rich in mercy.

His wrath will come to an end;
he will not be angry for ever.

He does not treat us according to our sins
nor repay us according to our faults.

For as the heavens are high above the earth
so strong is his love for those who fear him.
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the
Holy Spirit,
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
be,
world without end.
Amen.
Ant. 2. My God + has sent his Angel, and has shut
the lions' mouths, / that they have not hurt me.
Ant. 3. Go prosperously, + and the Lord be with you
in your journey, / and his Angel keep you company.
II

As far as the east is from the west
so far does he remove our sins.

As a father has compassion on his sons,
the Lord has pity on those who fear him;

for he knows of what we are made,
he remembers that we are dust.

As for man, his days are like grass;
he flowers like the flower of the field;

the wind blows and he is gone
and his place never sees him again.

But the love of the Lord is everlasting
upon those who hold him in fear;
his justice reaches out to children's children

when they keep his covenant in truth,
when they keep his will in their mind.

The Lord has set his sway in heaven
and his kingdom is ruling over all.

Give thanks to the Lord, all his angels,
mighty in power, fulfilling his word,
who heed the voice of his word.

Give thanks to the Lord, all his hosts,
his servants who do his will.

Give thanks to the Lord, all his works,
in every place where he rules.
My soul, give thanks to the Lord!
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the
Holy Spirit,
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
be,
world without end.
Amen.
Ant. 3. Go prosperously, + and the Lord be with you
in your journey, / and his Angel keep you company.
Reading
Zechariah 1:7-11
On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the
month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the
word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son
of Berechiah son of Iddo; and Zechariah said, In the
night I saw a man riding on a red horse! He was
standing among the myrtle trees in the glen; and
behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses. Then
I said, �What are these, my lord?� The angel who
talked with me said to me, �I will show you what
they are.� So the man who was standing among the
myrtle trees answered, �They are those whom the Lord
has sent to patrol the earth.� Then they spoke to
the angel of the Lord who was standing among the
myrtle trees, �We have patrolled the earth, and lo,
the whole earth remains at peace.�
Reading
A sermon by St Bernard
"He has given his angels charge over you to guard
you in all your ways." Let them thank the Lord for
his mercy; his wonderful works are for the children
of men. Let them give thanks and say among the
nations, the Lord has done great things for them. O
Lord, what is man that you have made yourself known
to him, or why do you incline your heart to him? And
you do incline your heart to him; you show him your
care and your concern. Finally, you send your only
Son and the grace of your Spirit, and promise him a
vision of your countenance. And so, that nothing in
heaven should be wanting in your concern for us, you
send those blessed spirits to serve us, assigning
them as our guardians and our teachers.
"He has given his angels charge over you to guard
you in all your ways." These words should fill you
with respect, inspire devotion and instill
confidence; respect for the presence of angels,
devotion because of their loving service, and
confidence because of their protection. And so the
angels are here; they are at your side, they are
with you, present on your behalf. They are here to
protect you and to serve you. But even if it is God
who has given them this charge, we must nonetheless
be grateful to them for the great love with which
they obey and come to help us in our great need.
So let us be devoted and grateful to such great
protectors; let us return their love and honour them
as much as we can and should. Yet all our love and
honour must go to him, for it is from him that they
receive all that makes them worthy of our love and
respect.
We should then, my brothers, show our affection for
the angels, for one day they will be our co-heirs
just as here below they are our guardians and
trustees appointed and set over us by the Father. We
are God�s children although it does not seem so,
because we are still but small children under
guardians and trustees, and for the present little
better than slaves.
Even though we are children and have a long, a very
long and dangerous sway to go, with such protectors
what have we to fear? They who keep us in all our
ways cannot be overpowered or led astray, much less
lead us astray. They are loyal, prudent, powerful.
Why then are we afraid? We have only to follow them,
stay close to them, and we shall dwell under the
protection of God�s heaven.
Te Deum laudamus
You are God: we praise you;
You are the Lord; we acclaim you;
You are the eternal Father:
All creation worships you.
To you all angels, all the powers of heaven,
Cherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise:
Holy, holy, holy Lord, God of power and might,
heaven and earth are full of your glory.
The glorious company of apostles praise you.
The noble fellowship of prophets praise you.
The white-robed army of martyrs praise you.
Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you;
Father, of majesty unbounded,
your true and only Son, worthy of all worship,
and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.
You, Christ, are the king of glory,
the eternal Son of the Father.
When you became man to set us free
you did not shun the Virgin's womb.
You overcame the sting of death
and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.
You are seated at God's right hand in glory.
We believe that you will come and be our judge.
Come then, Lord, and help your people,
bought with the price of your own blood,
and bring us with your saints
to glory everlasting.
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the
Holy Spirit,
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
be,
world without end.
Amen.

Prayer

God, our Father,
in your loving providence
you send your holy angels to watch over us.
Hear our prayers, defend us always by their
protection
and let us share your life with them for ever.
We ask this through Christ our Lord, who lives and
reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, God, for ever
and ever. Amen.
