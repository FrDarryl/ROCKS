SECOND READING
From the letters of Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos, Priest
Place nothing ahead of God's love
This desire to bring a sacrifice to God again and again extends to
everything that I ever loved in this life, and upon which my heart was
set.

When I think of the beauties of nature, these do not stir up longing
and melancholy, but I am filled with the greatest joy, because, since I
am not giving God any real and true gifts, I can give him imagined and
pretended ones. At the same time, in the overflowing of my good
fortune, I cannot at all get away from the thought that in heaven God
will give me those that, for him, I have forsaken in the world, and for
this I also constantly pray.

And so, the novitiate and its completion, the taking of vows, the life
with confreres of the Order, and above all, the insight to cherish
these goods to the best of my ability, so that there is nothing left
for me to desire, except to fulfill my duties better�these were the
first blessings of divine mercy.

Everything was completely against my nature. But precisely the joyful
acceptance of them, in God's boundless grace, made so clear to me the
mystery of renunciation and patience in this world that I feel that I
am much too fortunate in the possession of my religious confreres and
all the spiritual and temporal blessings that are bound together with
it. And what is still more, that God has exalted me so high as to
announce the Gospel to the poor, and to teach, and share with them his
treasures.

Every offering has value only insofar as one snatches it away from
one's own benefit and dedicates it to God through this self-conquest.
One loves and gives precisely because one loves, and because one
considers what is given as a good, as a treasure. Love of creatures
must be subordinated to the love of God, whom one is pledged to love
above all things.

Time, in which we have found nothing to offer up to God, is lost for
eternity. If it is only the duties of our vocation that we fulfill with
dedication to the will of God; if it is the sweat of our faces that, in
resignation, we wipe from our brow without murmuring; if it is
suffering, temptations, difficulties with our fellowmen�everything we
can present to God as an offering and can, through them, become like
Jesus his Son. Where the sacrifice is great and manifold, there, in the
same proportion, is the hope of glory more deeply and more securely
grounded in the heart of him who makes it.
RESPONSORY          Psalm 119:1-2; Mark 8:34
Blessed are those whose way is blameless,
who walk in the law of the Lord.
�Blessed are they who keep his decrees,
who seek him with all their heart.

Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself,
take up his cross and follow me.
�Blessed are they who keep his decrees,
who seek him with all their heart.
