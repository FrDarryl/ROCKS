Deus, in te sperantium fortitudo, qui beatum Ioannem Chrysostomum
episcopum mira eloquentia et tribulationis experimento clarescere
voluisti, da nobis, quaesumus, ut, eius doctrinis eruditi, invictae
patientiae roboremur exemplo.
O God, strength of those who hope in you,
who willed that the Bishop Saint John Chrysostom
should be illustrious by his wonderful eloquence
and his experience of suffering,
grant us, we pray,
that, instructed by his teachings,
we may be strengthened through the example
of his invincible patience.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 4: 1-7,11-13
Brothers and sisters:
I, a prisoner for the Lord,
urge you to live in a manner worthy of the call you have received,
with all humility and gentleness, with patience,
bearing with one another through love,
striving to preserve the unity of the Spirit
through the bond of peace:
one Body and one Spirit,
as you were also called to the one hope of your call;
one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
one God and Father of all,
who is over all and through all and in all.
But grace was given to each of us
according to the measure of Christ's gift.
And he gave some as Apostles, others as prophets,
others as evangelists, others as pastors and teachers,
to equip the holy ones for the work of ministry,
for building up the Body of Christ,
until we all attain to the unity of faith
and knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,
to the extent of the full stature of Christ.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          40:2; 4ab,7-8a,8b-9,10-11
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD,
and he stooped toward me.
And he put a new song into my mouth,
a hymn to our God.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,
but ears open to obedience you gave me.
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;
then said I, "Behold I come."
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly;
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart;
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of;
I have made no secret of your kindness and your truth
in the vast assembly.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
ALLELUIA
The seed is the word of God, Christ is the sower;
all who come to him will live forever.
GOSPEL (Long Form)         Mark 4: 1-10, 13-20 (Short Form: Mark
4:1-9)
On another occasion, Jesus began to teach by the sea.
A very large crowd gathered around him
so that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.
And the whole crowd was beside the sea on land.
And he taught them at length in parables,
and in the course of his instruction he said to them,
"Hear this! A sower went out to sow.
And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path,
and the birds came and ate it up.
Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil.
It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep.
And when the sun rose, it was scorched and it withered for lack of
roots.
Some seed fell among thorns,
and the thorns grew up and choked it
and it produced no grain.
And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit.
It came up and grew and yielded thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."
He added, "Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear."

And when he was alone,
those present along with the Twelve
questioned him about the parables.
Jesus answered them,
"Do you not understand this parable?
Then how will you understand any of the parables?
The sower sows the word.
These are the ones on the path where the word is sown.
As soon as they hear, Satan comes at once
and takes away the word sown in them.
And these are the ones sown on rocky ground who,
when they hear the word, receive it at once with joy.
But they have no root; they last only for a time.
Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word,
they quickly fall away.
Those sown among thorns are another sort.
They are the people who hear the word,
but worldly anxiety, the lure of riches,
and the craving for other things intrude and choke the word,
and it bears no fruit.
But those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept
it
and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold."

Office of Readings
SECOND READING
From a homily by Saint John Chrysostom , bishop
(Ante exsilium, nn 1-3: PG 52, 427*-430))
Life to me means Christ, and death is gain
The waters have risen and severe storms are upon us, but we do not fear
drowning, for we stand firmly upon a rock. Let the sea rage, it cannot
break the rock. Let the waves rise, they cannot sink the boat of Jesus.
What are we to fear? Death? Life to me means Christ, and death is gain.
Exile? 'The earth and its fullness belong to the Lord. The confiscation
of goods? We brought nothing into this world, and we shall surely take
nothing from it. I have only contempt for the world's threats, I find
its blessings laughable. I have no fear of poverty, no desire for
wealth. I am not afraid of death nor do I long to live, except for your
good. I concentrate therefore on the present situation, and I urge you,
my friends, to have confidence.

Do you not hear the Lord saying: Where two or three are gathered in my
name, there am I in their midst? Will he be absent, then, when so many
people united in love are gathered together? I have his promise; I am
surely not going to rely on my own strength! I have what he has
written; that is my staff, my security, my peaceful harbour. Let the
world be in upheaval. I hold to his promise and read his message; that
is my protecting wall and garrison. What message? Know that I am with
you always, until the end of the world!

If Christ is with me, whom shall I fear? Though the waves and the sea
and the anger of princes are roused against me, they are less to me
than a spider's web. Indeed, unless you, my brothers, had detained me,
I would have left this very day. For I always say "Lord, your will be
done"; not what this fellow or that would have me do, but what you want
me to do. That is my strong tower, my immovable rock, my staff that
never gives way. If God wants something, let it be done! If he wants me
to stay here, I am grateful. But wherever he wants me to be, I am no
less grateful.

Yet where I am, there you are too, and where you are, I am. For we are
a single body, and the body cannot be separated from the head nor the
head from the body. Distance separates us, but love unites us, and
death itself cannot divide us. For though my body die, my soul will
live and be mindful of my people.

You are my fellow citizens, my fathers, my brothers, my sons, my limbs,
my body. You are my light, sweeter to me than the visible light. For
what can the rays of the sun bestow on me that is comparable to your
love? The sun's light is useful in my earthly life, but your love is
fashioning a crown for me in the life to come.
RESPONSORY          2 Timothy 2:9-10; Psalm 27:1
Because I preach the gospel, I suffer hardships
even to the point of being thrown into chains like a criminal,
but the word of God is not chained.
- I endure all of this for the sake of the chosen.
The Lord is my light and my salvation;
whom should I fear?
- I endure all of this for the sake of the chosen.
COLLECT
O God, strength of those who hope in you,
who willed that the Bishop Saint John Chrysostom
should be illustrious by his wonderful eloquence
and his experience of suffering,
grant us, we pray,
that, instructed by his teachings,
we may be strengthened through the example
of his invincible patience.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
