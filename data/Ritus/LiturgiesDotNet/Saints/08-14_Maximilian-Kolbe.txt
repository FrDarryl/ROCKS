ENTRANCE SONG          Mt 25: 34, 40
Venite, benedicti Patris mei, dicit Dominus. Amen dico vobis: quamdiu
fecistis uni de his fratribus meis minimis, mihi fecistis.
Come, you blessed of my Father, says the Lord.
Amen I say to you:
Whatever you did for one of the least of my brethren,
you did it for me.
COLLECT
Deus, qui sanctum Maximilianum Mariam, presbyterum et martyrem, amore
Virginis Immaculatae succensum, animarum zelo et proximi dilectione
replevisti, concede propitius, ut, eo intercedente, pro tua gloria in
servitio hominum strenue laborantes, usque ad mortem Filio tuo
conformari valeamus.
O God, who filled the Priest and Martyr Saint Maximilian Kolbe
with a burning love for the Immaculate Virgin Mary
and with zeal for souls and love of neighbor,
graciously grant, through his intercession,
that, striving for your glory by eagerly serving others,
we may be conformed, even until death, to your Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Wisdom 3:1-9
The souls of the just are in the hand of God,
and no torment shall touch them.
They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead;
and their passing away was thought an affliction
and their going forth from us, utter destruction.
But they are in peace.
For if before men, indeed they be punished,
yet is their hope full of immortality;
Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,
because God tried them
and found them worthy of himself.
As gold in the furnace, he proved them,
and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.
In the time of their visitation they shall shine,
and shall dart about as sparks through stubble;
They shall judge nations and rule over peoples,
and the LORD shall be their King forever.
Those who trust in him shall understand truth,
and the faithful shall abide with him in love:
Because grace and mercy are with his holy ones,
and his care is with his elect.
Or:          1 John 3:14-18
Beloved:
We know that we have passed from death to life
because we love our brothers.
Whoever does not love remains in death.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,
and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.
The way we came to know love
was that he laid down his life for us;
so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
If someone who has worldly means
sees a brother in need and refuses him compassion,
how can the love of God remain in him?
Children, let us love not in word or speech
but in deed and truth.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Psalm 116:10-11, 12-13, 16ac-17
Gloriosa in conspectu Domini mors sanctorum eius.
R. (15) Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his faithful
ones.
I believed, even when I said,
"I am greatly afflicted";
I said in my alarm,
"No man is dependable."
R. Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his faithful ones.
How shall I make a return to the LORD
for all the good he has done for me?
The cup of salvation I will take up,
and I will call upon the name of the LORD.
R. Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his faithful ones.
O LORD, I am your servant;
you have loosed my bonds.
To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving,
and I will call upon the name of the LORD.
R. Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his faithful ones.
ALLELUIA          Jn 12:25
Qui odit animam suam in hoc mundo in vitam aeternam custodit eam.
If you hate your life in this world,
you will preserve it to life eternal.
GOSPEL          John 15:12-16
Jesus said to his disciples:
"This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
No one has greater love than this,
to lay down one's life for one's friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you slaves,
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
I have called you friends,
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
I was not you who chose me, but I who chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,
so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Munera nostra tibi, Domine, exhibemus, suppliciter exorantes, ut sancti
Maximiliani Mariae exemplo, vitam nostram tibi discamus offerre.
We present our oblations to you, O Lord,
humbly praying that we may learn
from the example of Saint Maximilian
to offer our very lives to you.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. Jn 15: 13
Maiorem caritatem nemo habet, ut animam suam ponat quis pro amicis
suis, dicit Dominus.
Greater love has no one
than to lay down his life for his friends, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Quaesumus, Domine, ut refecti Corpore et Sanguine Filii tui, eo
caritatis igne accendamur, quem ex hoc convivio sanctus Maximilianus
Maria accepit.
We pray, O Lord,
that, renewed by the Body and Blood of your Son,
we may be inflamed with the same fire of charity
that Saint Maximilian received from this holy banquet.
Through Christ our Lord.

SECOND READING

From a letter of Maximillian Mary Kolbe
(Scritti del P. Massimiliano M. Kolbe, Italian translation, vol. I, pt,
1 [Padua, 1971], 75-77,166)

Apostolic zeal for the salvation and sanctification of souls
The burning zeal for God�s glory that motivates you fills my heart with
joy. It is sad for us to see in our own time that indifferentism in its
many forms is spreading like an epidemic not only among the laity but
also among religious. But God is worthy of glory beyond measure, and
therefore it is of absolute and supreme importance to seek that glory
with all the power of our feeble resources. Since we are mere creatures
we can never return to him all that is his due. The most resplendent
manifestation of God�s glory is the salvation of souls, whom Christ
redeemed by shedding his blood. To work for the salvation and
sanctification of as many souls as possible, therefore, is the
preeminent purpose of the apostolic life. Let me, then, say a few words
that may show the way toward achieving God�s glory and the
sanctification of many souls.

God, who is all-knowing and all-wise, knows best what we should do to
increase his glory. Through his representatives on earth he continually
reveals his will to us; thus it is obedience and obedience alone that
is the sure sign to us of the divine will. A superior may, it is true,
make a mistake; but it is impossible for us to be mistaken in obeying a
superior�s command. The only exception to this rule is the case of a
superior commanding something that in even the slightest way would
contravene God�s law. Such a superior would not be conveying God�s
will.

God alone is infinitely wise, holy, merciful, our Lord, Creator, and
Father; he is beginning and end, wisdom and power and love; he is all.
Everything other than God has value to the degree that it is referred
to him, the maker of all and our own redeemer, the final end of all
things. It is he who, declaring his adorable will to us through his
representatives on earth, draws us to himself and whose plan is to draw
others to himself through us and to join us all to himself in an ever
deepening love.

Look, then, at the high dignity that by God�s mercy belongs to our
state in life. Obedience raises us beyond the limits of our littleness
and puts us in harmony with God�s will. In boundless wisdom and care,
his will guides us to act rightly. Holding fast to that will, which no
creature can thwart, we are filled with unsurpassable strength.

Obedience is the one and the only way of wisdom and prudence for us to
offer glory to God. If there were another, Christ would certainly have
shown it to us by word and example. Scripture, however, summed up his
entire life at Nazareth in the words: He was subject to them; Scripture
set obedience as the theme of the rest of his life, repeatedly
declaring that he came into the world to do his Father�s will. Let us
love our loving Father with all our hearts. Let our obedience increase
that love, above all when it requires us to surrender our own will.
Jesus Christ crucified is our sublime guide toward growth in God�s
love.

We will learn this lesson more quickly through the Immaculate Virgin,
whom God has made the dispenser of his mercy. It is beyond all doubt
that Mary�s will represents to us the will of God himself. By
dedicating ourselves to her we become in her hands instruments of God�s
mercy even as she was such an instrument in God�s hands. We should let
ourselves be guided and led by Mary and rest quiet and secure in her
hands. She will watch out for us, provide for us, answer our needs of
body and spirit; she will dissolve all our difficulties and worries.
RESPONSORY           Ephesians 5:1-2; 6:6
Be imitators of God as his dear children.
Follow the way of love, even as Christ loved us
and gave himself up for us as an offering to God.
� A gift of pleasing fragrance.

Do God�s will with your whole heart as servants of Christ.
� A gift of pleasing fragrance.
