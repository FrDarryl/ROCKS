Deus, qui beatum Dionysium eiusque socios ad praedicandam gentibus
gloriam tuam misisti, eosque virtute constantiae in passione roborasti,
tribue nobis, quaesumus, ex eorum imitatione prospera mundi despicere,
et nulla eius adversa formidare.
O God, who sent Saint Denis and his companions
to preach your glory to the nations
and strengthened them for their mission
with the virtue of constancy in suffering,
grant, we pray, that we may imitate them
in disdaining prosperity in this world
and in being undaunted by any trial.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 6:4-10
Brothers and sisters:
In everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God,
through much endurance, in afflictions, hardships, constraints,
beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, vigils, fasts;
by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness,
in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love, in truthful speech,
in the power of God;
with weapons of righteousness at the right and at the left;
through glory and dishonor, insult and praise.
We are treated as deceivers and yet are truthful;
as unrecognized and yet acknowledged;
as dying and behold we live;
as chastised and yet not put to death;
as sorrowful yet always rejoicing;
as poor yet enriching many;
as having nothing and yet possessing all things.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
"The LORD has done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
regnum caelorum.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness;
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Matthew 5:13-16
Jesus said to his disciples:
"You are the salt of the earth.
But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned?
It is no longer good for anything
but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world.
A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket;
it is set on a lampstand,
where it gives light to all in the house.
Just so, your light must shine before others,
that they may see your good deeds
and glorify your heavenly Father."

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a commentary on Psalm 118 by Saint Ambrose, bishop
(Sermo 20, 47-50; CSEL 62, 467-469)
Be a Faithful and Courageous Witness
As there are many kinds of persecution, so there are many kinds of
martyrdom. Every day you are a witness to Christ. You were tempted by
the spirit of fornication, but feared the coming judgment of Christ and
did not want your purity of mind and body to be defiled: you are a
martyr for Christ. You were tempted by the spirit of avarice to seize
the property of a child and violate the rights of a defenseless widow,
but remembered God�s law and saw your duty to give help, not act
unjustly: you are a witness to Christ. Christ wants witnesses like this
to stand ready, as Scripture says: Do justice for the orphan and defend
the widow. You were tempted by the spirit of pride but saw the poor and
the needy and looked with loving compassion on them, and loved humility
rather than arrogance: you are a witness to Christ. What is more, your
witness was not in word only but also in deed.

Who can give greater witness than one who acknowledges that the Lord
Jesus has come in the flesh and keeps the commandments of the Gospel?
One who hears but does not act, denies Christ. Even if he acknowledges
him by his words, he denies him by his deeds. How many will say to
Christ: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy and cast out devils and work
many miracles, all in your name? On that day he will say to them:
Depart from me, all you evildoers. The true witness is one who bears
witness to the commandments of the Lord Jesus and supports that witness
by deeds.

How many hidden martyrs there are, bearing witness to Christ each day
and acknowledging Jesus as the Lord! The Apostle knew this kind of
martyrdom, this faithful witness to Christ. This is our boast, he said,
the witness of our conscience. How many have borne witness in public
but denied it in private! Do not believe every spirit, he said, but
know from their fruits whom you should believe. Be faithful and
courageous when you are persecuted within, so that you may win approval
when you are persecuted in public. Even in those unseen persecutions
there are kings and governors, judges with terrible power. You have an
example in the temptation endured by the Lord.

In another place we read: Do not let sin be king in your mortal body.
You see the kings before whom you are made to stand, those who sit in
judgment over sinners, where sin is in control. There are as many kings
as there are sins and vices; it is before these kings that we are led
and before these we stand. These kings have their thrones in many
hearts. But if anyone acknowledges Christ, he immediately makes a
prisoner of this kind of king and casts him down from the throne of his
own heart. How shall the devil maintain his throne in one who builds a
throne for Christ in his heart?
RESPONSORY
These saints of God underwent a great struggle;
passing through fire and water, they were saved
- and received crowns of glory
from the Lord our God.
They sacrificed their lives to bear witness to God.
- and received crowns of glory
from the Lord our God.
COLLECT
O God, who sent Saint Denis and his companions
to preach your glory to the nations
and strengthened them for their mission
with the virtue of constancy in suffering,
grant, we pray, that we may imitate them
in disdaining prosperity in this world
and in being undaunted by any trial.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
