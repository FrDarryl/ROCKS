Beatus iste sanctus, qui annumerari meruit inter Apostolos: erat enim
vir bonus, et plenus Spiritu Sancto et fide.
Blessed is this holy man,
who was worthy to be numbered among the Apostles,
for he was a good man,
filled with the Holy Spirit and with faith (E.T. alleluia).
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Barnabam, plenum fide et Spiritu Sancto, ad gentium
conversionem segregare praecepisti, concede, ut Evangelium Christi,
quod strenue praedicavit, ore et opere fideliter nuntietur.
O God, who decreed that Saint Barnabas,
a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit,
should be set apart to convert the nations,
grant that the Gospel of Christ,
which he strenuously preached,
may be faithfully proclaimed by word and by deed.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Acts 11:21b-26; 13:1-3
In those days a great number who believed turned to the Lord.
The news about them reached the ears of the Church in Jerusalem,
and they sent Barnabas to go to Antioch.
When he arrived and saw the grace of God,
he rejoiced and encouraged them all
to remain faithful to the Lord in firmness of heart,
for he was a good man, filled with the Holy Spirit and faith.
And a large number of people was added to the Lord.
Then he went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch.
For a whole year they met with the Church
and taught a large number of people,
and it was in Antioch that the disciples
were first called Christians.

Now there were in the Church at Antioch prophets and teachers:
Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger,
Lucius of Cyrene,
Manaen who was a close friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
�Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul
for the work to which I have called them.�
Then, completing their fasting and prayer,
they laid hands on them and sent them off.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 98:1, 2-3ab, 3cd-4, 5-6
In conspectu gentium revelavit Dominus iustitiam suam.
R. (see 2b) The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.
Sing to the LORD a new song,
for he has done wondrous deeds;
His right hand has won victory for him,
his holy arm.
R. The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.
The LORD has made his salvation known:
in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.
He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness
toward the house of Israel.
R. The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.
All the ends of the earth have seen
the salvation by our God.
Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands;
break into song; sing praise.
R. The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.
Sing praise to the LORD with the harp,
with the harp and melodious song.
With trumpets and the sound of the horn
sing joyfully before the King, the LORD.
R. The Lord has revealed to the nations his saving power.
ALLELUIA          Matt 28:19a,20b
Euntes docete omnes gentes, dicit Dominus. Ego vobiscum sum omnibus
diebus usque ad consummationem saeculi.
Go and teach all nations, says the Lord;
I am with you always; until the end of the world.
GOSPEL          Matthew 10:7-13
Jesus said to the Twelve:
"As you go, make this proclamation:
'The Kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons.
Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give.
Do not take gold or silver or copper for your belts;
no sack for the journey, or a second tunic,
or sandals, or walking stick.
The laborer deserves his keep.
Whatever town or village you enter,
look for a worthy person in it,
and stay there until you leave.
As you enter a house, wish it peace.
If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it;
if not, let your peace return to you."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Oblata munera, quaesumus, Domine, tua benedictione sanctifica, quae, te
donante, nos flamma tuae dilectionis accendant, per quam beatus
Barnabas lumen Evangelii gentibus apportavit.
Sanctify with your blessing, we pray, O Lord,
the offerings presented here,
so that by your grace they may set us on fire
with the flame of your love,
by which Saint Barnabas
brought the light of the Gospel to the nations.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE
Preface I of the Apostles
Preface II of the Apostles
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. Jn 15: 15
Iam non dicam vos servos, quia servus nescit quid faciat Dominus eius.
Vos autem dixi amicos, quia omnia quaecumque audivi a Patre meo, nota
feci vobis.
I no longer call you slaves,
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
But I have called you friends,
because I have told you
everything I have heard from my Father (E.T. alleluia).
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Aeternae pignus vitae capientes, te, Domine, humiliter imploramus, ut,
quod pro beati Barnabae apostoli memoria in imagine gerimus sacramenti,
manifesta perceptione sumamus.
As we receive the pledge of eternal life,
we humbly implore you, Lord,
that what we celebrate in sacramental signs
on the Memorial of the blessed Apostle Barnabas
we may one day behold unveiled.
Through Christ our Lord.
