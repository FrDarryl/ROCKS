Deus, qui spem beatam regni aeterni sanctorum Ioannis et Isaac eorumque
sociorum opere et sanguinis effusione manifestare voluisti, concede
propitius, ut, eorum intercessione, fides christianorum in dies

O God, who chose to manifest
the blessed hope of your eternal kingdom
by the toil of Saints John de Brébeuf,
Isaac Jogues and their companions
and by the shedding of their blood,
graciously grant that through their intercession
the faith of Christians may be strengthened day by day.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 4:7-15
Brothers and sisters:
We hold this treasure in earthen vessels,
that the surpassing power may be of God and not from us.
We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained;
perplexed, but not driven to despair;
persecuted, but not abandoned;
struck down, but not destroyed;
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus,
so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.
For we who live are constantly being given up to death
for the sake of Jesus,
so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.

So death is at work in us, but life in you.
Since, then, we have the same spirit of faith,
according to what is written, I believed, therefore I spoke,
we too believe and therefore speak,
knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus
will raise us also with Jesus
and place us with you in his presence.
Everything indeed is for you,
so that the grace bestowed in abundance on more and more people
may cause the thanksgiving to overflow for the glory of God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
�The LORD has done great things for them.�
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Jas 1:12
Blessed is the man who perseveres in temptation,
for when he has been proved he will receive the crown of life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 28:16-20
The Eleven disciples went to Galilee,
to the mountain to which Jesus had ordered them.
When they saw him, they worshiped, but they doubted.
Then Jesus approached and said to them,
"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age."

SECOND READING
From the spiritual diaries by Saint John de Brebeuf, priest and martyr
(The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents, The Burrow Brothers C,
Cleveland 1898,164,166)
May I die only for you, Jesus, who willingly died for me
For two days now I have experienced a great desire to be a martyr and
to endure all the torments the martyrs suffered.
Jesus, my Lord and Savior, what can I give you in return for all the
favors you have first conferred on me? I will take from your hand the
cup of your sufferings and call on your name. I vow before your eternal
Father and the Holy Spirit, before your most holy Mother and her most
chaste spouse, before the angels, apostles and martyrs, before my
blessed fathers Saint Ignatius and Saint Francis Xavier�in truth I vow
to you, Jesus my Savior, that as far as I have the strength I will
never fail to accept the grace of martyrdom, if some day you in your
infinite mercy would offer it to me, your most unworthy servant.
I bind myself in this way so that for the rest of my life I will have
neither permission nor freedom to refuse opportunities of dying and
shedding my blood for you, unless at a particular juncture I should
consider it more suitable for your glory to act otherwise at that time.
Further, I bind myself to this so that, on receiving the blow of death,
I shall accept it from your hands with the fullest delight and joy of
spirit. For this reason, my beloved Jesus, and because of the surging
joy which moves me, here and now I offer my blood and body and life.
May I die only for you, if you will grant me this grace, since you
willingly died for me. Let me so live that you may grant me the gift of
such a happy death. In this way, my God and Savior, I will take from
your hand the cup of your sufferings and call on your name: Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus!
My God, it grieves me greatly that you are not known, that in this
savage wilderness all have not been converted to you, that sin has not
been driven from it. My God, even if all the brutal tortures which
prisoners in this region must endure should fall on me, I offer myself
most willingly to them and I alone shall suffer them all.
RESPONSORY           Hebrews 11:33, 34, 39; Wisdom 3:5
Through faith the saints conquered kingdoms and did what was just.
They secured promises and were strong in battle.
� All of them have won approval for their witness to the faith.
God tried them, and found them worthy of himself.
� All of them have won approval for their witness to the faith.
