FIRST READING          Song of Solomon 8:6-7
Set me as a seal on your heart,
as a seal on your arm;
For stern as death is love,
relentless as the nether world is devotion;
its flames are a blazing fire.
Deep waters cannot quench love,
nor floods sweep it away.
Were one to offer all he owns to purchase love,
he would be roundly mocked.

Praise him, all you his angels,
praise him, all you his hosts.
R. Young men and women, praise the name of the Lord. or; R. Alleluia.
Let the kings of the earth and all peoples,

Young men, too, and maidens,

for his name alone is exalted.
R. Young men and women, praise the name of the Lord. or; R. Alleluia.
His majesty is above earth and heaven.

ALLELUIA          Jn 14:23
Si quis díligit me, sermónem meam servábit, dicit Dóminus et Pater meus
díliget eum; et ad eum veniémus.
Whoever loves me will keep my word,
and my Father will love him, and we will come to him.
GOSPEL          Luke 10:38-42
Jesus entered a village
where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him.
She had a sister named Mary
who sat beside the Lord at his feet listening to him speak.
Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said,
"Lord, do you not care
that my sister has left me by myself to do the serving?
Tell her to help me."
The Lord said to her in reply,
"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things.
There is need of only one thing.
Mary has chosen the better part
and it will not be taken from her."

Office of Readings

From the books of Dialogues by Saint Gregory the Great
(Lib. 2, 33; PL 66, 194-196)
She who loved more could do more
Scholastica, the sister of Saint Benedict, had been consecrated to God
from her earliest years. She was accustomed to visiting her brother
once a year. He would come down to meet her at a place on the monastery
property, not far outside the gate.

One day she came as usual and her saintly brother went with some of his
disciples; they spent the whole day praising God and talking of sacred
things. As night fell they had supper together.

Their spiritual conversation went on and the hour grew late. The holy
nun said to her brother: �Please do not leave me tonight; let us go on
until morning talking about the delights of the spiritual life.�
�Sister,� he replied, �what are you saying? I simply cannot stay
outside my cell.�

When she heard her brother refuse her request, the holy woman joined
her hands on the table, laid her head on them and began to pray. As she
raised her head from the table, there were such brilliant flashes of
lightning, such great peals of thunder and such a heavy downpour of
rain that neither Benedict nor his brethren could stir across the
threshold of the place where they had been seated. Sadly he began to
complain: �May God forgive you, sister. What have you done?� �Well,�
she answered, �I asked you and you would not listen; so I asked my God
and he did listen. So now go off, if you can, leave me and return to
your monastery.�

Reluctant as he was to stay of his own will, he remained against his
will. So it came about that they stayed awake the whole night,
engrossed in their conversation about the spiritual life.

It is not surprising that she was more effective than he, since as John
says, God is love, it was absolutely right that she could do more, as
she loved more.

Three days later, Benedict was in his cell. Looking up to the sky, he
saw his sister�s soul leave her body in the form of a dove, and fly up
to the secret places of heaven. Rejoicing in her great glory, he
thanked almighty God with hymns and words of praise. He then sent his
brethren to bring her body to the monastery and lay it in the tomb he
had prepared for himself.

Their minds had always been united in God; their bodies were to share a
common grave.
RESPONSORY
When the saintly nun begged the Lord that her brother might not leave
her,
- she received more than her brother did from the Lord of her heart
because she loved him so much.

How good, how delightful it is
for brothers and sisters to live in unity.
- she received more than her brother did from the Lord of her heart
because she loved him so much.
