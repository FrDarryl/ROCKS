From the Common of Virgins: For One Virgin.

COLLECT
Gracious God,
you filled the heart of Philippine Duchesne
with charity and missionary zeal,
and gave her the desire
to make you known among all peoples.
Fill us who honor her memory today,
with that same love and zeal
to extend your kingdom to the ends of the earth.
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
