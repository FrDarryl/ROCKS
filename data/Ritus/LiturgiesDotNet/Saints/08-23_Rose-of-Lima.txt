Deus, qui beatam Rosam, tuo amore succensam, mundum relinquere et tibi
soli in austeritate paenitentiae vacare fecisti, da nobis, eius
intercessione, ut, vias vitae sectantes in terris, torrente deliciarum
tuarum perfruamur in caelis.
O God, you set Saint Rose of Lima on fire with your love,
so that, secluded from the world
in the austerity of a life of penance,
she might give herself to you alone;
grant, we pray, that through her intercession,
we may tread the paths of life on earth
and drink at the stream of your delights in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 10:17-11:2
Brothers and sisters:
Whoever boasts, should boast in the Lord.
For it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved,
but the one whom the Lord recommends.

If only you would put up with a little foolishness from me!
Please put up with me.
For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God,
since I betrothed you to one husband
to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM 148:1bc-2, 11-13a, 13c-14

Praise him, all you his angels,
praise him, all you his hosts.
R./ Young men and women, praise the name of the Lord. or: R./ Alleluia.

Young men, too, and maidens,

Praise the name of the LORD,
for his name alone is exalted.
R./ Young men and women, praise the name of the Lord. or: R./ Alleluia.

ALLELUIA          John 15:9b,5b
Remain in my love, says the Lord;
whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit.
GOSPEL          Matthew 13:44-46
Jesus said to his disciples:
�The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field,
which a person finds and hides again,
and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant
searching for fine pearls.
When he finds a pearl of great price,
he goes and sells all that he has and buys it.

SECOND READING
From the writings of Saint Rose of Lima, virgin
(Ad medicum Castillo: edit. L. Getino, La Patrona de America, madrid
1928, pp. 54-55)
Let us know the love of Christ which surpasses all understanding
Our Lord and Saviour lifted up his voice and said with incomparable
majesty: “Let all men know that grace comes after tribulation. Let them
know that without the burden of afflictions it is impossible to reach
the height of grace. Let them know that the gifts of grace increase as
the struggles increase. Let men take care not to stray and be deceived.
This is the only true stairway to paradise, and without the cross they
can find no road to climb to heaven.”

When I heard these words, a strong force came upon me and seemed to
place me in the middle of a street, so that I might say in a loud voice
to people of every age, sex and status: “Hear, O people; hear, O
nations. I am warning you about the commandment of Christ by using
words that came from his own lips: We cannot obtain grace unless we
suffer afflictions. We must heap trouble upon trouble to attain a deep
participation in the divine nature, the glory of the sons of God and
perfect happiness of soul.”

That same force strongly urged me to proclaim the beauty of divine
grace. It pressed me so that my breath came slow and forced me to sweat
and pant. I felt as if my soul could no longer be kept in the prison of
the body, but that it had burst its chains and was free and alone and
was going very swiftly through the whole world saying:

“If only mortals would learn how great it is to possess divine grace,
how beautiful, how noble, how precious. How many riches it hides within
itself, how many joys and delights! Without doubt they would devote all
their care and concern to winning for themselves pains and afflictions.
All men throughout the world would seek trouble, infirmities and
torments, instead of good fortune, in order to attain the unfathomable
treasure of grace. This is the reward and the final gain of patience.
No one would complain about his cross or about troubles that may happen
to him, if he would come to know the scales on which they are weighed
when they are distributed to men.”
RESPONSORY          1 Cor. 1:27,28-29; Ps. 138:6
To shame the wise, God chose what the world considers foolish.
God chose those who were nothing at all
to humble those who were everything
- so that no one might boast in his presence.
Though the Lord is exalted,
he cares for the lowly,
but the proud he looks down on from afar.
- So that no one might boast in his presence.
