From the Common of Martyrs: For Several Martyrs

COLLECT
Deus, qui Romanae Ecclesiae copiosa primordia martyrum sanguine
consecrasti, concede, quaesumus, ut firma virtute de tanti agone
certaminis solidemur, et pia semper victoria gaudeamus.
O God, who consecrated
the abundant first fruits of the Roman Church
by the blood of the Martyrs,
grant, we pray, that with firm courage
we may together draw strength from so great a struggle
and ever rejoice at the triumph of faithful love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Romans 8:31b-39
Brothers and sisters:
If God is for us, who can be against us?
He did not spare his own Son
but handed him over for us all,
how will he not also give us everything else along with him?
Who will bring a charge against God's chosen ones?
It is God who acquits us.
Who will condemn?
It is Christ Jesus who died, rather, was raised,
who also is at the right hand of God,
who indeed intercedes for us.
What will separate us from the love of Christ?
Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or the sword? As it is written:
For your sake we are being slain all the day,
we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered.
No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly
through him who loved us.
For I am convinced that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor present things, nor future things,
nor powers, nor height, nor depth,
nor any other creature will be able to separate us
from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          89:2-3,4-5,21-22,25,27
R./ (7) Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler’s snare.
Had not the Lord been with us,
When men rose up against us,
then would they have swallowed us alive,
When their fury was inflamed against us.
R./ Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler’s snare.
Then would the waters have overwhelmed us;
The torrent would have swept over us;
over us then would have swept
the raging waters.
R./ Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler’s snare.
Broken was the snare,
and we were freed.
Our help is in the name of the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.
R./ Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler’s snare.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:10
Blessed are they who persecuted for the sake of righteousness;
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Matthew 24:4-13
Jesus said to his disciples:
"See that no one deceives you.
For many will come in my name, saying,
`I am the Christ,' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and reports of wars;
see that you are not alarmed,
for these things must happen, but it will not yet be the end.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
there will be famines and earthquakes from place to place.
All these are the beginning of the labor pains.
Then they will hand you over to persecution,
and they will kill you.
You will be hated by all nations because of my name.
And then many will be led into sin;
they will betray and hate one another.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many;
and because of the increase of evildoing,
the love of many will grow cold.
But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved."

SECOND READING
From a letter written to the Corinthians by Clement I, pope
(Cap 5, 1-7,4; Fink 1, 67-71)
Though victims of jealousy, they gave the finest example
Let us leave behind the examples from times of old, and come to those
who struggled closest to us; let us consider the noble models of our
own generation. It was through jealousy and envy that the greatest and
most upright pillars of the Church were persecuted and struggled unto
death. Let us set before our eyes the good apostles. First of all,
Peter, who because of unreasonable jealousy, suffered not merely once
or twice but many times, and, having thus given his witness, went to
the place of glory that he deserved. It was through jealousy and
conflict that Paul showed the way to the prize for perseverance. He was
put in chains seven times, sent into exile, and stoned; a herald both
in the east and the west, he achieved a noble fame by his faith. He
taught justice to all the world and, when he had reached the limits of
the western world, he gave his witness before those in authority; then
he left this world and was taken up into the holy place, a superb
example of endurance.

Around these men with their holy lives gathered a great throng of the
elect, who, though victims of jealousy, gave us the finest example of
endurance in the midst of many indignities and tortures. Through
jealousy women were tormented like Dirce or the daughters of Danaus,
suffering terrible and unholy acts of violence. But they courageously
finished the course of faith and despite their bodily weakness won a
noble prize. It was jealousy that separated wives from husbands, and
violated the words of our father Adam: This is now bone of my bone and
flesh of my flesh. Jealousy and strife have overthrown great cities and
uprooted mighty nations.

We are writing this, beloved, not only for your admonition but also as
a reminder to ourselves; for we are placed in the same arena, and the
same contest lies before us. Hence we ought to put aside vain and
useless concerns and go straight to the glorious and venerable norm
which is our tradition, and we should consider what is good, pleasing
and acceptable in the sight of him who made us. Let us fix our gaze on
the blood of Christ, realizing how precious it is to his Father, since
it was shed for our salvation and brought the grace of repentance to
all the world.
RESPONSORY          Revelation 7:14
They handed their bodies over to be tortured for their faith in God,
- and so they earned an everlasting reward.

They have undergone great persecution
and have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb.
- and so they earned an everlasting reward.
