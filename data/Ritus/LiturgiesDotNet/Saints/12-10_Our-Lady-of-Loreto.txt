COLLECT
Concede, misericors Deus, fragilitati nostrae praesidium, ut, qui
sanctae Dei Genetricis memoriam agimus, intercessionis eius auxilio a
nostris iniquitatibus resurgamus.
Grant us, O merciful God,
protection in our weakness,
that we, who keep the Memorial of the holy Mother of God,

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
Readings from the Common of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or:
FIRST READING          Isaiah 7:10-14; 8:10
The LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying:
Ask for a sign from the LORD, your God;
let it be deep as the nether world, or high as the sky!
But Ahaz answered,
�I will not ask! I will not tempt the LORD!�
Then Isaiah said:
Listen, O house of David!
Is it not enough for you to weary people,
must you also weary my God?
Therefore the Lord himself will give you this sign:
the virgin shall be with child, and bear a son,
and shall name him Emmanuel,
which means �God is with us!�
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Luke 1:46-47, 48-49, 50-51, 52-53, 54-55
R./ The Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
or:
R./ O blessed Virgin Mary, you carried the Son of the eternal Father.
"My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior."
R./
"For he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed.
The Almighty has done great things for me,
holy is his Name."
R./
"He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit."
R./
"He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty."
R./
"He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children forever."
R./
ALLELUIA          See Luke 1:28
Ave, Maria, gratia plena; Dominus tecum; benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you;
blessed are you among women.
GOSPEL          Luke 1:26-38
The angel Gabriel was sent from God
to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,
to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph,
of the house of David,
and the virgin's name was Mary.
And coming to her, he said,
"Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you."
But she was greatly troubled at what was said
and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
Then the angel said to her,
"Do not be afraid, Mary,
for you have found favor with God.
Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,
and you shall name him Jesus.
He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,
and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,
and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,
and of his Kingdom there will be no end."
But Mary said to the angel,
"How can this be,
since I have no relations with a man?"
And the angel said to her in reply,
"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
Therefore the child to be born
will be called holy, the Son of God.
And behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
has also conceived a son in her old age,
and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;
for nothing will be impossible for God."
Mary said, "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.
May it be done to me according to your word."
Then the angel departed from her.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Genetricis Filii tui memoriam venerantes, quaesumus, Domine, ut
sacrificii huius oblatio nosmetipsos, gratia tua largiente, tibi
perficiat munus aeternum.
As we honor the memory of the Mother of your Son,
we pray, O Lord,
that the oblation of this sacrifice
may, by your grace, make of us an eternal offering to you.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY I
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
and to praise, bless, and glorify your name
on the feast day of the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary.

For by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit
she conceived your Only Begotten Son,
and without losing the glory of virginity,
brought forth into the world the eternal Light,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven
and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in humble praise, as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
Or:
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY II
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
to praise your mighty deeds
in the exaltation of all the Saints,
and especially, as we celebrate
the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
to proclaim your kindness
as we echo her thankful hymn of praise.

For truly even to the earth's ends
you have done great things
and extended your abundant mercy from age to age:
when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid,
you gave us through her the author of our salvation,
your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise,
as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. Luke 1:45
Fecit mihi magna, qui potens est, et sanctum nomen eius.
He who is mighty has done great things for me,
and holy is his name.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Redemptionis aeternae participes effecti, quaesumus, Domine, ut, qui
Genetricis Filii tui memoriam agimus, et de gratiae tuae plenitudine
gloriemur, et salvationis continuum sentiamus augmentum.
Having been made partakers of eternal redemption,
we pray, O Lord,
that we, who commemorate the Mother of your Son,
may glory in the fullness of your grace
and experience its continued increase for our salvation.
Through Christ our Lord.
