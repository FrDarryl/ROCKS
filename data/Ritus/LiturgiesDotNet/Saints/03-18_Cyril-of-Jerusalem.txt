MASS

From the Common of Pastors: For a Bishop or from the Common of
Doctors of the Church

COLLECT
O God, who through the Bishop Saint Cyril of Jerusalem
led your Church in a wonderful way
to a deeper sense of the mysteries of salvation,
grant us, through his intercession,
that we may so acknowledge your Son
as to have life ever more abundantly.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 5:1-5
Beloved:
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God,
and everyone who loves the Father
loves also the one begotten by him.
In this way we know that we love the children of God
when we love God and obey his commandments.
For the love of God is this,
that we keep his commandments.
And his commandments are not burdensome,
for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world.
And the victory that conquers the world is our faith.
Who indeed is the victor over the world
but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
RESPONSORIAL PSALM                    Ps. 19:8,9,10,11
Iustitae Domini rectae, laefiacantes corda.
R. (9ab) The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
The law of the LORD is perfect,
refreshing the soul.
The decree of the LORD is trustworthy,
giving wisdom to the simple.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
The precepts of the LORD are right,
rejoicing the heart.
The command of the LORD is clear,
enlightening the eye.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
The fear of the LORD is pure,
enduring forever;
The ordinances of the LORD are true,
all of them just.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
They are more precious than gold,
than a heap of purest gold;
Sweeter also than syrup
or honey from the comb.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          Mark 1:17
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          John 15:1-8
Jesus said to his disciples:
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower.
He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit,
and everyone that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit.
You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.
Remain in me, as I remain in you.
Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own
unless it remains on the vine,
so neither can you unless you remain in me.
I am the vine, you are the branches.
Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit,
because without me you can do nothing.
Anyone who does not remain in me
will be thrown out like a branch and wither,
people will gather them and throw them into a fire
and they will be burned.
If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you.
By this is my Father glorified,
that you bear much fruit and become my disciples."

Office of Readings

From a catechetical instruction by Saint Cyril of Jerusalem, bishop
(Catech. 3:1-3: PG 33, 426-430)
Prepare for the Holy Spirit
Rejoice, ye heavens, and let the earth be glad, for those who are to be
sprinkled with hyssop, and cleansed with the spiritual hyssop, the
power of Him to whom at His Passion drink was offered on hyssop and a
reed. And while the Heavenly Powers rejoice, let the souls that are to
be united to the spiritual Bridegroom make themselves ready. For the
voice is heard of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the Lord. For this is no light matter, no ordinary and indiscriminate
union according to the flesh, but the All-searching Spirit's election
according to faith. For the inter-marriages and contracts of the world
are not made altogether with judgment: but wherever there is wealth or
beauty, there the bridegroom speedily approves: but here it is not
beauty of person, but the soul's clear conscience; not the condemned
Mammon, but the wealth of the soul in godliness.

Listen then, O ye children of righteousness, to John's exhortation when
he says, Make straight the way of the Lord. Take away all obstacles and
stumbling-blocks, that ye may walk straight onward to eternal life.
Make ready the vessels of the soul, cleansed by unfeigned faith, for
reception of the Holy Ghost. Begin at once to wash your robes in
repentance, that when called to the bride-chamber ye may be found
clean. For the Bridegroom invites all without distinction, because His
grace is bounteous; and the cry of loud-voiced heralds assembles them
all: but the same Bridegroom afterwards separates those who have come
in to the figurative marriage. O may none of those whose names have now
been enrolled hear the words, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not
having a wedding garment? But may you all hear, Well done, good and
faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee
over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

For now meanwhile thou standest outside the door: but God grant that
you all may say, The King hath brought me into His chamber. Let my soul
rejoice in the Lord: for He hath clothed me with a garment of
salvation, and a robe of gladness: He hath crowned me with a garland as
a bridegroom, and decked me with ornaments as a bride: that the soul of
every one of you may be found not having spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; I do not mean before you have received the grace, for how could
that be? since it is for remission of sins that ye have been called;
but that, when the grace is to be given, your conscience being found
uncondemned may concur with the grace.

This is in truth a serious matter, brethren, and you must approach it
with good heed. Each one of you is about to be presented to God before
tens of thousands of the Angelic Hosts: the Holy Ghost is about to seal
your souls: ye are to be enrolled in the army of the Great King.
Therefore make you ready, and equip yourselves, by putting on I mean,
not bright apparel, but piety of soul with a good conscience.
RESPONSORY          Malachi 2:6; Psalm 89:22
True teaching was in his mouth;
no evil was ever found on his lips.
- He walked with me in goodness and peace.
My hand will be a steady help to him,
my arm will give him strength.
- He walked with me in goodness and peace.
