Revelation 7:13-17
Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, "Who are these, robed in
white, and where have they come from?" I said to him, "Sir, you are the
one that knows." Then he said to me, "These are they who have come out
of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb.

For this reason they are before the throne of God,
and worship him day and night within his temple,
and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them.

They will hunger no more, and thirst no more;
the sun will not strike them,
nor any scorching heat;

for the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd,
and he will guide them to springs of the water of life,

and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." Psalm 116:1-8
Dilexi, quoniam

^1 I love the Lord,
for he has heard the voice of my supplication; *
because he inclined his ear to me
on the day I called to him.
^2 The snares of death encompassed me;
the pains of hell took hold of me; *
by grief and sorrow was I held.
^3 Then I called upon the name of the Lord: *
O Lord, I beg you, deliver my soul.
^4 Gracious is the Lord and righteous; *
our God is full of compassion.
^5 The Lord watches over the simple; *
I was brought very low and he saved me.
^6 Turn again to your rest, O my soul, *
for the Lord has been gracious to you.
^7 For you have delivered my soul from death, *
my eyes from tears and my feet from falling.
^8 I will walk before the Lord *
in the land of the living.
or
Psalm 124
Nisi quia Dominus

^1 If the Lord himself had not been on our side, *
now may Israel say;
^2 If the Lord had not been on our side, *
when enemies rose up against us;
^3 Then would they have swallowed us alive *
when their anger burned against us;
^4 Then would the waters have overwhelmed us
and the torrent gone over our soul; *
over our soul would have swept the raging waters.
^5 But blessed be the Lord *
who has not given us over to be a prey for their teeth.
^6 Our soul has escaped
as a bird from the snare of the fowler; *
the snare is broken and we are delivered.
^7 Our help is in the name of the Lord, *
who has made heaven and earth.
Luke 12:2-12

Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret
that will not become known. Therefore whatever you have said in the
dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind
closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops. I tell you, my
friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that can do
nothing more. But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he
has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is
forgotten in Gods sight. But even the hairs of your head are all
counted. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.
And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before others, the Son of
Man also will acknowledge before the angels of God; but whoever denies
me before others will be denied before the angels of God. And everyone
who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever
blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. When they
bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do
not worry about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to
say; for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that very hour what you
ought to say.
