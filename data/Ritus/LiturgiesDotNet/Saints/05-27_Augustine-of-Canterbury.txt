Deus, qui beati Augustini episcopi praedicatione Anglorum gentes ad
Evangelium perduxisti, tribue, quaesumus, ut eius laborum fructus in
Ecclesia tua perenni fecunditate persistant.
O God, who by the preaching
of the Bishop Saint Augustine of Canterbury
led the English peoples to the Gospel,
grant, we pray, that the fruits of his labors
may remain ever abundant in your Church.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Thessalonians 2:2-8
Brothers and sisters:
We drew courage through our God
to speak to you the Gospel of God with much struggle.
Our exhortation was not from delusion or impure motives,
nor did it work through deception.
But as we were judged worthy by God to be entrusted with the Gospel,
that is how we speak,
not as trying to please men,
but rather God, who judges our hearts.
Nor, indeed, did we ever appear with flattering speech, as you know,
or with a pretext for greed�God is witness�
nor did we seek praise from men,
either from you or from others,
although we were able to impose our weight as Apostles of Christ.
Rather, we were gentle among you,
as a nursing mother cares for her children.
With such affection for you, we were determined to share with you
not only the Gospel of God, but our very selves as well,
so dearly beloved had you become to us.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          96:1-2a, 2b-3, 7-8a, 10
Annuntiate in omnibus populis mirabilia Domini.
R. (3) Proclaim God�s marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Sing to the LORD a new song;
sing to the LORD, all you lands.
Sing to the LORD; bless his name.
R. Proclaim God�s marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Announce his salvation, day after day.
Tell his glory among the nations;
among all peoples, his wondrous deeds.
R. Proclaim God�s marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Give to the LORD, you families of nations,
give to the LORD glory and praise;
give to the LORD the glory due his name!
R. Proclaim God�s marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Say among the nations: The LORD is king.
He has made the world firm, not to be moved;
he governs the peoples with equity.
R. Proclaim God�s marvelous deeds to all the nations.
ALLELUIA          Jn 10:14 Ego sum pastor bonus, dicit Dominus; et
cognosco oves meas, et cognoscunt me meae.
I am the good shepherd, says the Lord;
I know my sheep and mine know me.
GOSPEL          Matthew 9:35-38
Jesus went around to all the towns and villages,
teaching in their synagogues,
proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom,
and curing every disease and illness.
At the sight of the crowds,
his heart was moved with pity for them
because they were troubled and abandoned,
like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples,
"The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest."

SECOND READING
From a letter by Saint Gregory the Great, pope
(Lib 9, 36: MGH Epistolae, 2, 305-306)
The nation of Angles was bathed with the light of holy faith
Glory to God in the highest and peace to his people on earth, because
the grain of wheat has fallen into the earth and has died. Christ has
died in order to reign in heaven. Not only that: by his death we live;
by his weakness we are strengthened; by his passion we are freed from
suffering; impelled by his love, we are seeking in Britain brothers
whom we do not know; through his help we have found those for whom we
were searching, although we were not acquainted with them.

Who, dear brother, is capable of describing the great joy of believers
when they have learned what the grace of Almighty God and your own
cooperation achieved among the Angles? They abandoned the errors of
darkness and were bathed with the light of holy faith. With full
awareness they trampled on the idols which they had previously adored
with savage fear. They are now committed to Almighty God. The
guidelines given them for their preaching restrain them from falling
into evil ways. In their minds they are submissive to the divine
precepts and consequently feel uplifted. They bow down to the ground in
prayer lest their minds cling too closely to earthly things. Whose
achievement is this? It is the achievement of him who said: My Father
is at work until now and I am at work as well.

God chose illiterate preachers and sent them into the world in order to
show the world that conversion is brought about not by men’s wisdom but
rather by his own power. So in like manner God worked through weak
instruments and wrought great things among the Angles. Dear brother, in
this heavenly gift there is something which should inspire us with
great fear and great joy.

For I know through your love for that people, specially chosen for you,
that Almighty God has performed great miracles. But it is necessary
that the same heavenly gift should cause you to rejoice with fear and
to fear with gladness. You should be glad because by means of external
miracles the souls of the Angles have been led to interior grace. But
you should tremble, lest on account of these signs, the preacher’s own
weak soul be puffed up with presumption; lest, while seeming externally
raised aloft in honour, it fall internally as a result of vainglory.

We should remember that when the disciples on their joyous return from
their preaching mission said to their heavenly master: Lord, in your
name even devils were subjected to us, he immediately retorted: Do not
rejoice about this but rather that your names are inscribed in heaven.
RESPONSORY          Phil. 3:17; 4:9; 1 Cor. 1:10
Be imitators of me, my brothers,
and, as you have us as a model,
observe those who follow the example we set.
- Live, according to what you have learned and accepted,
what you have heard me say or seen me do,
and the God of peace will be with you.

I plead with you, my brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to agree among yourselves.
- Live, according to what you have learned and accepted,
what you have heard me say or seen me do,
and the God of peace will be with you.
