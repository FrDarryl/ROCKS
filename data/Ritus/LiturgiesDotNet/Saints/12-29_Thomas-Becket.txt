Deus, qui beato Thomae martyri pro iustitia magno animo vitam
profundere tribuisti, da nobis, eius intercessione, nostram pro Christo
vitam in hoc saeculo abnegare, ut eam in caelo invenire possimus.
O God, who gave the Martyr Saint Thomas Becket
the courage to give up his life for the sake of justice,
grant, through his intercession,
that, renouncing our life
for the sake of Christ in this world,
we may find it in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever
FIRST READING          2 Timothy 2:8-13; 3:10-12
Beloved:
Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David:
such is my Gospel, for which I am suffering,
even to the point of chains, like a criminal.
But the word of God is not chained.
Therefore, I bear with everything for the sake of those who are chosen,
so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus,
together with eternal glory.
This saying is trustworthy:
If we have died with him
we shall also live with him;
if we persevere
we shall also reign with him.
But if we deny him
he will deny us.
If we are unfaithful
he remains faithful,
for he cannot deny himself.
You have followed my teaching, way of life,
purpose, faith, patience, love,
endurance, persecutions, and sufferings,
such as happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra,
persecutions that I endured.
Yet from all these things the Lord delivered me.
In fact, all who want to live religiously in Christ Jesus
will be persecuted.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9
R. (5) The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
his praise shall be ever in my mouth.
Let my soul glory in the LORD;
the lowly will hear and be glad.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
Glorify the LORD with me,
let us together extol his name.
I sought the LORD, and he answered me
and delivered me from all my fears.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
Look to him that you may be radiant with joy,
and your faces may not blush with shame.
When the poor one called out, the LORD heard,
and from all his distress he saved him.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
The angel of the LORD encamps
around those who fear him, and delivers them.
Taste and see how good the LORD is;
blessed the man who takes refuge in him.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:6
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they will be satisfied.
GOSPEL          Matthew 16:24-27
Jesus said to all,
"Whoever wishes to come after me, must deny himself,
take up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world
and forfeit his life? Or what can one give
in exchange for his life?
For the Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father's glory,
and then he will repay each one according to his conduct."

SECOND READING
From a Letter by Saint Thomas Becket, Bishop
(Epist. 74: PL 190, 533-536)
Without real effort, no one wins the crown
If we who are called bishops desire to understand the meaning of our
calling and to be worthy of it, we must strive to keep our eyes on him
whom God appointed high priest for ever, and to follow in his
footsteps. For our sake he offered himself to the Father upon the altar
of the cross. He now looks down from heaven on our actions and secret
thoughts, and one day he will give each of us the reward his deeds
deserve.

As successors of the apostles, we hold the highest rank in our
churches; we have accepted the responsibility of acting as Christ's
representatives on earth; we receive the honor belonging to that
office, and enjoy the temporal benefits of our spiritual labors. It
must therefore be our endeavor to destroy the reign of sin and death,
and by nurturing faith and uprightness of life, to build up the Church
of Christ into a holy temple in the Lord.

There are a great many bishops in the Church, but would to God we were
the zealous teachers and pastors that we promised to be at our
consecration, and still make profession of being. The harvest is good
and one reaper or even several would not suffice to gather all of it
into the granary of the Lord. Yet the Roman Church remains the head of
all the churches and the source of Catholic teaching. Of this there can
be no doubt. Everyone knows that the keys of the kingdom of heaven were
given to Peter. Upon his faith and teaching the whole fabric of the
Church will continue to be built until we all reach full maturity in
Christ and attain to unity in faith and knowledge of the Son of God.

Of course many are needed to plant and many to water now that the faith
has spread so far and the population become so great. Even in ancient
times when the people of God had only one altar, many teachers were
needed; how much more now for an assembly of nations which Lebanon
itself could not provide with fuel for sacrifice, and which neither
Lebanon nor the whole of Judea could supply with beasts for burnt
offerings! Nevertheless, no matter who plants or waters, God gives no
harvest unless what he plants is the faith of Peter, and unless he
himself assents to Peter's teaching. All important questions that arise
among God's people are referred to the judgment of Peter in the person
of the Roman Pontiff. Under him the ministers of Mother Church exercise
the powers committed to them, each in his own sphere of responsibility.

Remember then how our fathers worked out their salvation; remember the
sufferings through which the Church has grown, and the storms the ship
of Peter has weathered because it has Christ on board. Remember how the
crown was attained by those whose sufferings gave new radiance to their
faith. The whole company of saints bears witness to the unfailing truth
that without real effort no one wins the crown.
RESPONSORY
The Lord crowned you with holiness;
- he clothed you in glory.
God, the Holy One of Israel, dwells in you.
You have fought the good fight,
you have run the race to the finish,
now a crownof holiness awaits you.
- He clothed you in glory.
God, the Holy One of Israel, dwells in you.
COLLECT
O God, who gave the Martyr Saint Thomas Becket
the courage to give up his life for the sake of justice,
grant, through his intercession,
that, renouncing our life
for the sake of Christ in this world,
we may find it in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever
