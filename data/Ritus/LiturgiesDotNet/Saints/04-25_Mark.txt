ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Mark 16:15

GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Marcum evangelistam tuum evangelicae praedicationis
gratia sublimasti, tribue, quaesumus, eius nos eruditione ita
proficere, ut vestigia Christi fideliter sequamur.
O God, who raised up Saint Mark, your Evangelist,
and endowed him with the grace to preach the Gospel,
grant, we pray,
that we may so profit from his teaching
as to follow faithfully in the footsteps of Christ.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Peter 5:5b-14
Beloved:
Clothe yourselves with humility
in your dealings with one another, for:

God opposes the proud
but bestows favor on the humble.

So humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,
that he may exalt you in due time.
Cast all your worries upon him because he cares for you.

Be sober and vigilant.
Your opponent the Devil is prowling around like a roaring lion
looking for someone to devour.
Resist him, steadfast in faith,
knowing that your brothers and sisters throughout the world
undergo the same sufferings.
The God of all grace
who called you to his eternal glory through Christ Jesus
will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you
after you have suffered a little.
To him be dominion forever. Amen.

I write you this briefly through Silvanus,
whom I consider a faithful brother,
exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God.
Remain firm in it.
The chosen one at Babylon sends you greeting, as does Mark, my son.
Greet one another with a loving kiss.
Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 89:2-3, 6-7, 16-17
Misericordias tuas, Domine, in aeternum cantabo.
R. (2) For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord. or: Alleluia.
The favors of the LORD I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall
proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever";
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord. or: Alleluia.
The heavens proclaim your wonders, O LORD,
and your faithfulness, in the assembly of the holy ones.
For who in the skies can rank with the LORD?
Who is like the LORD among the sons of God?
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord. or: Alleluia.
Blessed the people who know the joyful shout;
in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk.
At your name they rejoice all the day,
and through your justice they are exalted.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord. or: Alleluia.
ALLELUIA          1 Cor 1:23a-24b
Nos praedicamus Christum crucifixum. Dei virtutem et Dei sapientiam.
We proclaim Christ crucified;
he is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
GOSPEL          Mark 16:15-20
Jesus appeared to the Eleven and said to them:
�Go into the whole world
and proclaim the Gospel to every creature.
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved;
whoever does not believe will be condemned.
These signs will accompany those who believe:
in my name they will drive out demons,
they will speak new languages.
They will pick up serpents with their hands,
and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them.
They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.�

Then the Lord Jesus, after he spoke to them,
was taken up into heaven
and took his seat at the right hand of God.
But they went forth and preached everywhere,
while the Lord worked with them
and confirmed the word through accompanying signs.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Gloriam beati Marci venerantes, tibi, Domine, hostias laudis offerimus,
teque suppliciter deprecamur, ut evangelica praedicatio in Ecclesia tua
iugiter perseveret.
As we venerate the glory of Saint Mark,
we offer you, Lord, the sacrifice of praise
and humbly beseech you,
that your Church may always persevere
in the preaching of the Gospel.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE II OF THE APOSTLES
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Quoniam Ecclesiam tuam in apostolicis
tribuisti consistere fundamentis, ut signum sanctitatis tuae in terris
maneret ipsa perpetuum, et caelestia praeberet cunctis hominibus
documenta. Quapropter nunc et usque in saeculum cum omni militia
Angelorum devota tibi mente concinimus, clamantes atque dicentes:
Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord

For you have built your Church
to stand firm on apostolic foundations,
to be a lasting sign of your holiness on earth
and offer all humanity your heavenly teaching.

Therefore, now and for ages unending,
with all the host of Angels,
we sing to you with all our hearts,
crying out as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

Ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque ad consummationem saeculi,
dicit Dominus, alleluia.

even to the end of the age, says the Lord, alleluia.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Praesta, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut, quod de sancto altari tuo
accepimus, nos sanctificet, et in fide Evangelii, quod beatus Marcus
praedicavit, fortes efficiat.

that what we have received from your holy altar
may sanctify us and make us strong
in the faith of the Gospel which Saint Mark proclaimed.
