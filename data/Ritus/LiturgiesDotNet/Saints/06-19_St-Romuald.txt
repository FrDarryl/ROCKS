Deus, qui per beatum Romualdum in Ecclesia tua eremiticam vitam
renovasti, concede, ut, nosmetipsos abnegantes et Christum sequentes,
feliciter ad caelestia regna mereamur ascendere.
O God, who through Saint Romuald renewed
the manner of life of hermits in your Church,
grant that, denying ourselves and following Christ,
we may merit to reach the heavenly realms on high.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Philippians 3:8-14
Brothers and sisters:
I consider everything as a loss
because of the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
For his sake I have accepted the loss of all things
and I consider them so much rubbish,
that I may gain Christ and be found in him,
not having any righteousness of my own based on the law
but that which comes through faith in Christ,
the righteousness from God,
depending on faith to know him and the power of his resurrection
and the sharing of his sufferings by being conformed to his death,
if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

It is not that I have already taken hold of it
or have already attained perfect maturity,
but I continue my pursuit in hope that I may possess it,
since I have indeed been taken possession of by Christ Jesus.
Brothers and sisters, I for my part
do not consider myself to have taken possession.
Just one thing: forgetting what lies behind
but straining forward to what lies ahead,
I continue my pursuit toward the goal,
the prize of God's upward calling, in Christ Jesus.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 131:1bcde,2,3
Custodi, animam meam in pace apud te, Domine.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
O LORD, my heart is not proud,
nor are my eyes haughty;
I busy not myself with great things,
nor with things too sublime for me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
Nay rather, I have stilled and quieted
my soul like a weaned child.
Like a weaned child on its mother's lap,
so is my soul within me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
O Israel, hope in the LORD,
both now and forever.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:3
Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are the poor in spirit;
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Luke 14:25-33
Great crowds were traveling with Jesus,
and he turned and addressed them,
"If anyone comes to me without hating his father and mother,
wife and children, brothers and sisters,
and even his own life,
he cannot be my disciple.
Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me
cannot be my disciple.
Which of you wishing to construct a tower
does not first sit down and calculate the cost
to see if there is enough for its completion?
Otherwise, after laying the foundation
and finding himself unable to finish the work
the onlookers should laugh at him and say,
`This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.'
Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down
and decide whether with ten thousand troops
he can successfully oppose another king
advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops?
But if not, while he is still far away,
he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms.
In the same way,
everyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions
cannot be my disciple."

SECOND READING
From the life of Saint Romuald by Saint Peter Damian
(Cap.31 et 69: PL 144, 982-983, 1005-1006)
Denying oneself and following Christ

Romuald lived in the vicinity of the city of Parenzo for three years.
In the first year he built a monastery and appointed an abbot with
monks.  For the next two years he remained there in seclusion.  In that
setting, divine holiness transported him to such a summit of perfection
that, breathed upon by the Holy Spirit, he foresaw many future events
and comprehended with the rays of his intelligence hidden mysteries of
the Old and New Testaments.

Frequently he was seized by so great a contemplation of divinity that
he would be reduced to tears with the boiling, indescribable heat of
divine love.  In this condition he would cry out:  Beloved Jesus,
beloved, sweet honey, indescribable longing, delight of the saints,
sweetness of the angels, and other things of this kind.  We are unable
to express the ecstasy of these utterances, dictated by the Holy
Spirit.

Wherever the holy man might arrange to live, he would follow the same
pattern.  First he would build an oratory with an altar in a cell; then
he would shut himself in and forbid access.

Finally, after he had lived in many places, perceiving that his end was
near, he returned to the monastery he had built in the valley of
Castro.  While he awaited with certainty his approaching death, he
ordered a cell to be constructed there with an oratory in which he
might isolate himself and preserve in silence until death.

Accordingly the hermitage was built, since he had made up his mind that
he would die there.  His body began to grow more and more oppressed by
afflictions and was already failing, not so much from weakness as from
the exhaustion of great age.  One day he began to feel the loss of his
physical strength under all the harassment of increasingly violent
afflictions.  As the sun was beginning to set, he instructed two monks
who were standing by to go out and close the door of the cell behind
them; they were to come back to him at daybreak to celebrate matins.
They were so concerned about his end that they went out reluctantly and
did not rest immediately.  On the contrary, since they were worried
that their master might die, they lay hidden near the cell and watched
this precious treasure.  For some time they continued to listen
attentively until they heard neither movement nor sound.  Rightly
guessing what had happened, they pushed open the door, rushed in
quickly, lit a candle and found the holy man lying on his back, his
blessed soul snatched up into heaven.  As he lay there, he seemed like
a neglected heavenly pearl that was soon to be given a place of honor
in the treasury of the King of kings.
RESPONSORY          Deuteronomy 2:7; 8:5
The Lord has blessed you in all that you have done;
he has watched over your progress
as you journeyed through the vast desert.
- The Lord your God has been with you;
no need of yours has been forgotten.
As a father teaches his son,
so the Lord your God was disciplining you.
- The Lord your God has been with you;
no need of yours has been forgotten.
