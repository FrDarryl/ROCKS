Euntes, docete omnes gentes, baptizantes eos, et docentes eos servare

GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui ineffabili misericordia beatum Matthaeum ex publicano
Apostolum es dignatus eligere, da nobis, eius exemplo et intercessione
suffultis, ut, te sequentes, tibi firmiter adhaerere mereamur.
O God, who with untold mercy
were pleased to choose as an Apostle
Saint Matthew, the tax collector,
grant that, sustained by his example and intercession,
we may merit to hold firm in following you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 4:1-7, 11-13
Brothers and sisters:
I, a prisoner for the Lord,
urge you to live in a manner worthy of the call you have received,
with all humility and gentleness, with patience,
bearing with one another through love,
striving to preserve the unity of the Spirit
through the bond of peace:
one Body and one Spirit,
as you were also called to the one hope of your call;
one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
one God and Father of all,
who is over all and through all and in all.

But grace was given to each of us
according to the measure of Christ�s gift.

And he gave some as Apostles, others as prophets,
others as evangelists, others as pastors and teachers,
to equip the holy ones for the work of ministry,
for building up the Body of Christ,
until we all attain to the unity of faith
and knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,
to the extent of the full stature of Christ.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           19:2-3,4-5
In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
The heavens declare the glory of God,
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
Day pours out the word to day,
and night to night imparts knowledge.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
Not a word nor a discourse
whose voice is not heard;
Through all the earth their voice resounds,
and to the ends of the world, their message.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
ALLELUIA           Cf. Te Deum
Te deum laudamus, te Dominum confitemur. Te gloriosus Apostolorum
chorus laudat, Domine.
We praise you, O God, we acclaim you as Lord;
the glorious company of Apostles praise you.
GOSPEL          Matthew 9:9-13
As Jesus passed by,
he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the customs post.
He said to him, �Follow me.�
And he got up and followed him.
While he was at table in his house,
many tax collectors and sinners came
and sat with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples,
�Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?�
He heard this and said,
�Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do.
Go and learn the meaning of the words,
I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
I did not come to call the righteous but sinners.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Memoriam beati Matthaei recensentes, preces et hostias tibi, Domine,
deferimus, suppliciter exorantes, ut Ecclesiam tuam benignus aspicias,
cuius fidem Apostolorum praedicationibus nutrivisti.
As we celebrate anew the memory of Saint Matthew,
we bring you sacrifices and prayers, O Lord,
humbly imploring you to look kindly on your Church,
whose faith you have nourished by the preaching of the Apostles.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE OF THE APOSTLES I
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.

For you, eternal Shepherd,
do not desert your flock,
but through the blessed Apostles
watch over it and protect it always,
so that it may be governed
by those you have appointed shepherds
to lead it in the name of your Son.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
PREFACE OF THE APOSTLES II
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord

For  you have built your Church
to stand firm on apostolic foundations,
to be a lasting sign of your holiness on earth
and offer all humanity your heavenly teaching.

Therefore, now and for ages unending,
with all the host of Angels,
we sing to you with all our hearts,
crying out as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Matthew 9:13
Non veni vocare iustos, sed peccatores, dicit Dominus.
I did not come to call the just,
but sinners, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Salutaris gaudii participes, Domine, quo laetus Salvatorem in domo sua
convivam beatus Matthaeus excepit, da, ut cibo semper reficiamur
illius, qui non iustos sed peccatores vocare venit ad salutem.
Sharing in that saving joy, O Lord,
with which Saint Matthew welcomed
the Savior as a guest in his home, we pray:
grant that we may always be renewed
by the food we receive from Christ,
who came to call not the just, but sinners to salvation.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
SOLEMN BLESSING OF THE APOSTLES
May God, who has granted you
to stand firm on apostolic foundations,
graciously bless you through the glorious merits
of the holy Apostle Matthew.
R. Amen.

And may he who endowed you
with the teaching and example of the Apostles,
make you, under their protection,
witnesses to the truth before all.
R. Amen.

So that through the intercession of the Apostles,
you may inherit the eternal homeland,
for by their teaching you possess firmness of faith.
R. Amen.

And may the blessing of almighty God,
the Father, and the Son, + and the Holy Spirit,
come down on you and remain with you for ever.
R. Amen.
