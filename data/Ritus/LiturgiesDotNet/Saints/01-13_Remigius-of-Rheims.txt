Collect
O God, by the teaching of your faithful servant and bishop Remigius you
turned the nation of the Franks from vain idolatry to the worship of
you, the true and living God, in the fullness of the catholic faith:
Grant that we who glory in the name of Christian may show forth our
faith in worthy deeds; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and
reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.
First Reading
1 John 4:1-6

Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see
whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into
the world. 2By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that
confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3and
every spirit that does not confess Jesus* is not from God. And this is
the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is
coming; and now it is already in the world. 4Little children, you are
from God, and have conquered them; for the one who is in you is greater
than the one who is in the world. 5They are from the world; therefore
what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6We are
from God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and whoever is not from God
does not listen to us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the
spirit of error.
Psalm 135:13-21
Laudate nomen

13
O LORD, your Name is everlasting; *
your renown, O LORD, endures from age to age.

14
For the LORD gives his people justice *
and shows compassion to his servants.

15
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, *
the work of human hands.

16
They have mouths, but they cannot speak; *
eyes have they, but they cannot see.

17
They have ears, but they cannot hear; *
neither is there any breath in their mouth.

18
Those who make them are like them, *
and so are all who put their trust in them.

19
Bless the LORD, O house of Israel; *
O house of Aaron, bless the LORD.

20
Bless the LORD, O house of Levi; *
you who fear the LORD, bless the LORD.

21
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, *
who dwells in Jerusalem.
Hallelujah!

or
Psalm 103:1-4,13-18
Benedic, anima mea

1
Bless the LORD, O my soul, *
and all that is within me, bless his holy Name.

2
Bless the LORD, O my soul, *
and forget not all his benefits.

3
He forgives all your sins *
and heals all your infirmities;

4
He redeems your life from the grave *
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness.

13
As a father cares for his children, *
so does the LORD care for those who fear him.

14
For he himself knows whereof we are made; *
he remembers that we are but dust.

15
Our days are like the grass; *
we flourish like a flower of the field;

16
When the wind goes over it, it is gone, *
and its place shall know it no more.

17
But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever on those
who fear him, *
and his righteousness on children's children;

18
On those who keep his covenant *
and remember his commandments and do them.

Gospel Reading
John 14:3-7

Jesus said to his disciples, "If I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, there
you may be also. And you know the way to the place where I am going."
Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can
we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and
the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you know me,
you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen
him."
