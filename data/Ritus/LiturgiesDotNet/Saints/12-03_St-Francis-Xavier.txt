Deus, qui beati Francisci praedicatione multos tibi populos acquisisti,
da, ut fidelium animi eodem fidei zelo ferveant, et uberrima ubique
prole Ecclesia sancta laetetur.
O God, who through the preaching of Saint Francis Xavier

grant that the hearts of the faithful

and that Holy Church may everywhere rejoice
in an abundance of offspring.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 9:16-19,22-23
Brothers and sisters:
If I preach the Gospel, this is no reason for me to boast,
for an obligation has been imposed on me,
and woe to me if I do not preach it!
If I do so willingly, I have a recompense,
but if unwillingly, then I have been entrusted with a stewardship.
What then is my recompense?
That, when I preach,
I offer the Gospel free of charge
so as not to make full use of my right in the Gospel.
Although I am free in regard to all,
I have made myself a slave to all
so as to win over as many as possible.
To the weak I became weak, to win over the weak.
I have become all things to all, to save at least some.
All this I do for the sake of the Gospel,
so that I too may have a share in it.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 117:1bc, 2
Euntes in mundum universum, praedicate Evangelium.
R. (Mark 16:15) Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
Praise the LORD, all you nations;
glorify him, all you peoples!
R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
For steadfast is his kindness for us,
and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever.
ALLELUIA          Mt. 28:19a, 20b
Euntes docete omnes gentes, dicit Dominus: ego vobiscum sum omnibus
diebus usque ad consummationem saeculi.
Go and teach all nations, says the Lord
I am with you always, until the end of the world.
GOSPEL          Mark 16:15-20
Jesus appeared to the Eleven and said to them:
"Go into the whole world
and proclaim the Gospel to every creature.
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved;
whoever does not believe will be condemned.
These signs will accompany those who believe:
in my name they will drive out demons,
they will speak new languages.
They will pick up serpents with their hands,
and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them.
They will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."
So the Lord Jesus, after he spoke to them,
was taken up into heaven
and took his seat at the right hand of God.
But they went forth and preached everywhere,
while the Lord worked with them
and confirmed the word through accompanying signs.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, Domine, munera, quae tibi in beati Francisci commemoratione
deferimus, et praesta, ut, sicut ille desiderio salutis hominum ad
terras longinquas est progressus, ita et nos, testimonium Evangelio
efficaciter perhibentes, ad te cum fratribus properare festinemus.
Receive, O Lord, these offerings we bring you
in commemoration of Saint Francis Xavier,
and grant that, as he journeyed to distant lands
out of longing for the salvation of souls,
so we, too, bearing effective witness to the Gospel,
may, with our brothers and sisters,
eagerly hasten towards you.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Mt 10: 27
Quod dico vobis in tenebris, dicite in lumine, dicit Dominus, et quod
in aure auditis, praedicate super tecta.
What I say to you in the darkness speak in the light, says the Lord;
what you hear whispered proclaim on the housetops.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Mysteria tua, Deus, eum in nobis accendant caritatis ardorem, quo
beatus Franciscus pro animarum salute flagravit, ut, vocatione nostra
dignius ambulantes, promissum bonis operariis praemium cum eo
consequamur.
May your mysteries, O God,
kindle in us that fire of charity
with which Saint Francis Xavier burned for the salvation of souls,
so that, walking ever more worthily in our vocation,
we may obtain with him the reward you promise
to those who labor well in your harvest.
Through Christ our Lord.

SECOND READING
From the letters to Saint Ignatius by Saint Francis Xavier, priest
(E Vita Francisci Xaverii, auctore H. Tursellini, Romae, 1956, Lib. 4,
epist. 4  et 5 )
Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel
We have visited the villages of the new converts who accepted the
Christian religion a few years ago. No Portuguese live here the country
is so utterly barren and poor. The native Christians have no priests.
They know only that they are Christians. There is nobody to say Mass
for them; nobody to teach them the Creed, the Our Father, the Hail Mary
and the Commandments of God�s Law.
I have not stopped since the day I arrived. I conscientiously made the
rounds of the villages. I bathed in the sacred waters all the children
who had not yet been baptised. This means that I have purified a very
large number of children so young that, as the saying goes, they could
not tell their right hand from their left. The older children would not
let me say my Office or eat or sleep until I taught them one prayer or
another. Then I began to understand: �The kingdom of heaven belongs to
such as these.�
I could not refuse so devout a request without failing in devotion
myself. I taught them, first the confession of faith in the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, then the Apostles� Creed, the Our Father and
Hail Mary. I noticed among them persons of great intelligence. If only
someone could educate them in the Christian way of life, I have no
doubt that they would make excellent Christians.
Many, many people hereabouts are not becoming Christians for one reason
only: there is nobody to make them Christians. Again and again I have
thought of going round the universities of Europe, especially Paris,
and everywhere crying out like a madman, riveting the attention of
those with more learning than charity: �What a tragedy: how many souls
are being shut out of heaven and falling into hell, thanks to you!�
I wish they would work as hard at this as they do at their books, and
so settle their account with God for their learning and the talents
entrusted to them.
This thought would certainly stir most of them to meditate on spiritual
realities, to listen actively to what God is saying to them. They would
forget their own desires, their human affairs, and give themselves over
entirely to God�s will and his choice. They would cry out with all
their heart: Lord, I am here! What do you want me to do? Send me
anywhere you like � even to India.
RESPONSORY        Luke 10:2; Acts 1:8
So great a harvest, and so few to gather it in;
- pray to the Lord of the harvest,
beg him to send out laborers for his harvest.

You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
and you will be my witnesses to the ends of the earth.
- Pray to the Lord of the harvest,
beg him to send out laborers for his harvest.
