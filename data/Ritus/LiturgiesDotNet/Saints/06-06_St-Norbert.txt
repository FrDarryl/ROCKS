Deus, qui beatum Norbertum episcopum Ecclesiae tuae oratione ac
pastorali zelo ministrum eximium effecisti, praesta, quaesumus, ut,
eius interveniente suffragio, fidelium grex pastores iuxta cor tuum et
salutaria pascua semper inveniat.
O God, who made the Bishop Saint Norbert
a servant of your Church
outstanding in his prayer and pastoral zeal,
grant, we ask, that by the help of his intercession,
the flock of the faithful
may always find shepherds after your own heart
and be fed in the pastures of salvation.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ezekiel 34:11-16
Thus says the Lord GOD:
I myself will look after and tend my sheep.
As a shepherd tends his flock
when he finds himself among his scattered sheep,
so will I tend my sheep.
I will rescue them from every place where they were scattered
when it was cloudy and dark.
I will lead them out from among the peoples
and gather them from the foreign lands;
I will bring them back to their own country
and pasture them upon the mountains of Israel
in the land's ravines and all its inhabited places.
In good pastures will I pasture them,
and on the mountain heights of Israel
shall be their grazing ground.
There they shall lie down on good grazing ground,
and in rich pastures shall they be pastured
on the mountains of Israel.
I myself will pasture my sheep;
I myself will give them rest, says the Lord GOD.
The lost I will seek out,
the strayed I will bring back,
the injured I will bind up,
the sick I will heal,
but the sleek and the strong I will destroy,
shepherding them rightly.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 23:1-3a,4,5,6
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;
Beside restful waters he leads me;
he refreshes my soul.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Even though I walk in the dark valley
I fear no evil; for you are at my side
With your rod and your staff
that give me courage.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
You spread the table before me
in the sight of my foes;
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Only goodness and kindness follow me
all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD
for years to come.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:3
Beti puperes spritu, quniam ipsrum est regnum clrum.
Blessed are the poor in spirit;
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Luke 14:25-33
Great crowds were traveling with Jesus,
and he turned and addressed them,
"If anyone comes to me without hating his father and mother,
wife and children, brothers and sisters,
and even his own life,
he cannot be my disciple.
Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me
cannot be my disciple.
Which of you wishing to construct a tower
does not first sit down and calculate the cost
to see if there is enough for its completion?
Otherwise, after laying the foundation
and finding himself unable to finish the work
the onlookers should laugh at him and say,
`This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.'
Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down
and decide whether with ten thousand troops
he can successfully oppose another king
advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops?
But if not, while he is still far away,
he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms.
In the same way,
everyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions
cannot be my disciple."

SECOND READING
From the life of Saint Norbert, bishop
(The words in quotation marks below have been taken from the biography
of Saint Norbert, written by a Premonstratensian canon who was a
contemporary of the saint: PL 170, 1262, 1269, 1294, 1295. Pope
Innocent�s Apostolic Letter was issued under leaden seal to Saint
Norbert on June 5, 1133. Acta Sanctorum, 21, in Appendice p.50.)
At ease in the company of the humble and great
Norbert is deservedly numbered by historians among those who made an
effective contribution to the reform movement under Pope Gregory VII.
He established a clergy dedicated to the ideals of the Gospel and the
apostolic Church. They were chaste and poor. They wore �the clothing
and the symbols of the new man; that is to say, they wore the religious
habit and exhibited the dignity proper to the priesthood.� Norbert
asked them �to live according to the norms of the Scriptures with
Christ as their model.� They were �to be clean in all matters
pertaining to the altar and divine worship, to correct their faults and
failings in their chapter meeting, and to care for and give shelter to
the poor.�

The priests lived in community, where they continued the work of the
apostles. Inspired by the practice of the early Church, Norbert
exhorted the faithful to join the monastic life in some capacity. So
many men and women responded to the invitation that many asserted that
no man since the apostles themselves had inspired so many to embrace
the monastic life.

When Norbert was appointed an archbishop, he urged his brothers to
carry the faith to the lands of the Wends. In his own diocese he tried
unsuccessfully to convince the clergy of the need for reform and was
confronted with noisy protests both in the street and in the church.

One of the principal goals of Norbert�s life was to foster harmony
between the Apostolic See and the German empire. At the same time he
wanted to maintain Rome�s freedom in the matter of ecclesiastical
appointments. Apparently his efforts were so successful that Pope
Innocent II thanked him profusely in a letter in which he called him a
�devoted son,� and Lothair made him chancellor of the realm.

Norbert did all these things with a steadfast faith: �Faith was the
outstanding virtue of Norbert�s life, as charity had been the hallmark
of Bernard of Clairvaux�.� Affable and charming, amiable to one and
all, �he was at ease in the company of the humble and the great alike.�
Finally, he was a most eloquent preacher; after long meditation �he
would preach the word of God� and with his fiery eloquence purged
vices, refined virtues and filled souls of good will with the warmth of
wisdom.� He spent many hours in contemplation of the divine mysteries
and fearlessly spread the spiritual insights which were the fruit of
his meditation.
RESPONSORY          2 Timothy 4:2,5; Acts 20:28
Proclaim the message, in season and out of season;
refute falsehood, correct error, call to obedience;
- endure all hardships and spread the Gospel.

Keep watch over the whole flock
which the Holy Spirit
has given you in rule and guide,
as a shepherd of the Church of God.
- endure all hardships and spread the Gospel.
