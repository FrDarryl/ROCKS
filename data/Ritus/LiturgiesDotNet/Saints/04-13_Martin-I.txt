From the Common of Martyrs: For one Martyr (or during Easter

COLLECT
Da nobis, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, adversa mundi invicta mentis
constantia tolerare, qui beatum Martinum papam et martyrem nec minis
terreri nec poenis passus es superari.
Grant, almighty God,
that we may withstand the trials of this world
with invincible firmness of purpose,
just as you did not allow your Martyr Pope Saint Martin the First
to be daunted by threats or broken by suffering.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING           2 Timothy 2:8-13; 3:10-12
Beloved:
Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David:
such is my Gospel, for which I am suffering,
even to the point of chains, like a criminal.
But the word of God is not chained.
Therefore, I bear with everything for the sake of those who are chosen,
so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus,
together with eternal glory.
This saying is trustworthy:

If we have died with him
we shall also live with him;
if we persevere
we shall also reign with him.
But if we deny him
he will deny us.
If we are unfaithful
he remains faithful,
for he cannot deny himself.

You have followed my teaching, way of life,
purpose, faith, patience, love,
endurance, persecutions, and sufferings,
such as happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra,
persecutions that I endured.
Yet from all these things the Lord delivered me.
In fact, all who want to live religiously in Christ Jesus
will be persecuted.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           126:1bc-2, 2-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears, shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears, shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
"The LORD has done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears, shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears, shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears, shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA           Cf. Te Deum
Te deum laudámus, te Dóminum confitémur. Te gloriósus Apostolórum
chorus laudat, Dómine.
We praise you, O God, we acclaim you as Lord;
the glorious company of Apostles praise you.
GOSPEL           John 15:18-21
Jesus said to his disciples:
"If the world hates you, realize that it hated me first.
If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own;
but because you do not belong to the world,
and I have chosen you out of the world,
the world hates you.
Remember the word I spoke to you,
'No slave is greater than his master.'
If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.
If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
And they will do all these things to you on account of my name,
because they do not know the One who sent me."

St. Martin I, Pope and Martyr
From the Common of One Martyr or of Pastors, except the
following:
Office of Readings
From a letter by Saint Martin, pope
(Epist. 17; PL 87, 203-204)
Why am I anxious? The Lord is near.

At all times in our letters we have desired to encourage you in your
charity and to alleviate any anxiety you may have for us, as we have
for all the saints and all our brothers who share this concern for us
in the Lord. But now I am writing to you of things which do oppress us,
and I speak the truth in the name of Christ our God.

Removed from all the turmoil of the world and cast aside by our sins,
we are separated from life itself. For the people who live in this
region are all pagans, and Christians who are known to live in the area
have taken on pagan ways, showing none of that charity which human
beings, even barbarians, regularly display in numerous compassionate
deeds.

Indeed, I have been amazed and continue to be amazed at the lack of
perception and the callousness of those who were once connected with
me, both my friends and my relatives. They have all completely
forgotten about my unhappy state, and do not care to know where I am,
whether I am alive or dead.

What sort of conscience, I ask, do we have, we who are to be brought
before the tribunal of Christ, where all who are formed out of the same
clay will be the accusers and all will have to justify their lives?
What is this terror�or fear, if you will, though there is no reason for
it�that men seem to have for fulfilling God�s commandments even in the
slightest degree? Have the evil spirits so succeeded in concealing me
by this enforced exile? Have I been shown so clearly to be an enemy to
the entire assembly of the Church, an adversary to all my people?

But God wishes all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the
truth through the prayers of Peter. Hence I pray that God will
strengthen their hearts in the orthodox faith, help them to stand firm
against every heretic and enemy of the church, and guard them unshaken.
And this I ask especially for their shepherd, now designated to be over
them, that none may fall or go astray or renounce anything, however
trifling, which they professed in writing in the sight of the Lord and
his holy angels. In this way, together with me in my humiliation, they
will receive the crown of justice in the true faith from the hand of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. For the Lord himself will take care
of this lowly body of mine as befits his providence, whether this means
unending suffering or some small consolation. Why am I anxious? The
Lord is near. But my hope is in his compassion that he will not delay
in putting an end to this course which he has assigned to me.

Greet in the Lord all your people and all who for love of God have had
compassion for my chains. May God on high shield you with his mighty
arm from all temptation and preserve you for his kingdom.
RESPONSORY          2 Timothy 4:7-8; Philippians 3:8-10
I have fought the good fight,
I have run the race to the finish,
I have kept the faith;
- now a crown of holiness awaits me (alleluia).
Nothing has seemed worthwhile to me except to know Christ,
to be one with him in is sufferings,
to bear his death in my body.
- Now a crown of holiness awaits me (alleluia).
COLLECT

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
