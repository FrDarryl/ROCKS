From the Common of Pastors: For One Pastor
COLLECT
Omnipotens et misericors Deus, qui beatum Ioannem Mariam presbyterum
pastorali studio mirabilem effecisti, da, quaesumus, ut, eius exemplo
et intercessione, fratres in caritate Christo lucremur, et cum eis
aeternam gloriam consequi valeamus.
Almighty and merciful God,
who made the Priest Saint John Vianney
wonderful in his pastoral zeal,
grant, we pray,
that through his intercession and example
we may in charity win brothers and sisters for Christ
and attain with them eternal glory.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ezekiel 3:17-21
The word of the LORD came to me:
Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman
for the house of Israel.
When you hear a word from my mouth,
you shall warn them for me.

If I say to the wicked man,
You shall surely die;
and you do not warn him or speak out
to dissuade him from his wicked conduct so that he may live:
the wicked man shall die for his sins,
but I will hold you responsible for his death.
If, on the other hand, you have warned the wicked man,
yet he has not turned away from his evil
nor from his wicked conduct,
then he shall die for his sin,
but you shall save your life.

If a virtuous man turns away from virtue and does wrong
when I place a stumbling block before him, he shall die.
He shall die for his sin,
and his virtuous deeds shall not be remembered;
but I will hold you responsible for his death
if you did not warn him.
When, on the other hand, you have warned a virtuous man not to sin,
and he has in fact not sinned,
he shall surely live because of the warning,
and you shall save your own life.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 117:1bc, 2
Euntes in mundum universum, praedicate Evangelium.
R. (Mark 16:15) Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
Praise the LORD, all you nations;
glorify him, all you peoples!
R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
For steadfast is his kindness for us,
and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever.
ALLELUIA          Matt 23:11,12b
Qui maior est vestrum, erit minister vester, dicit Dominus; qui autem
se humiliaverit exaltabitur
The greatest among you must be your servant, says the Lord.
Whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
GOSPEL          Matthew 9:35–10:1
Jesus went around to all the towns and villages,
teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom,
and curing every disease and illness.
At the sight of the crowds,
his heart was moved with pity for them
because they were troubled and abandoned,
like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples,
"The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest."

Then he summoned his twelve disciples
and gave them authority over unclean spirits
to drive them out and to cure every disease and every illness.

SECOND READING
From the Catechetical Instructions by St. John Mary Vianney, priest

The glorious duty of man: to pray and to love

My little children, reflect on these words: the Christian’s treasure is
not on earth but in heaven. Our thoughts, then ought to be directed to
where our treasure is. This is the glorious duty of man: to pray and to
love. If you pray and love, that is where a man’s happiness lies.

Prayer is nothing else but union with God. When one has a heart that is
pure and united with God, he is given a kind of serenity and sweetness
that makes him ecstatic, a light that surrounds him with marvelous
brightness. In this intimate union, God and the soul are fused together
like two bits of wax that no one can ever pull apart. This union of God
with a tiny creature is a lovely thing. It is a happiness beyond
understanding.

We had become unworthy to pray, but God in his goodness allowed us to
speak with him. Our prayer is incense that gives him the greatest
pleasure.

My little children, your hearts are small, but prayer stretches them
and makes them capable of loving God. Through prayer we receive a
foretaste of heaven and something of paradise comes down upon us.
Prayer never leaves us without sweetness. It is honey that flows into
the soul and makes all things sweet. When we pray properly, sorrows
disappear like snow before the sun.

Prayer also makes time pass very quickly and with such great delight
that one does not notice its length. Listen: Once when I was a purveyor
in Bresse and most of my companions were ill, I had to make a long
journey. I prayed to the good God, and believe me, the time did not
seem long.

Some men immerse themselves as deeply in prayer as fish in water,
because they give themselves totally to God. There is not division in
their hearts. O, how I love these noble souls! Saint Francis of Assisi
and Saint Colette used to see our Lord and talk to him just as we talk
to one another.

How unlike them we are! How often we come to church with no idea of
what to do or what to ask for. And yet, whenever we go to any human
being, we know well enough why we go. And still worse, there are some
who seem to speak to the good God like this: “I will only say a couple
of things to you, and then I will be rid of you.” I often think that
when we come to adore the Lord, we would receive everything we ask for,
if we would ask with living faith and with a pure heart.
RESPONSORY      2 Cor. 4:17; 1 Cor 2:9
Our troubles pass quickly,
and their burden seems light
when we compare them to the weight of eternal glory
- which far exceeds the burden of our suffering.
No eye has seen, no ear heard,
nor has the heart of man conceived,
the marvels God has prepared for those who love him.
- Which far exceeds the burden of our suffering.
