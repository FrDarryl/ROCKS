From the Common of Martyrs: For One Martyr
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum martyrem Venceslaum caelesti regno terrenum postponere
docuisti, eius precibus concede, ut, nosmetipsos abnegantes, tibi toto
corde adhaerere valeamus.
O God, who taught the Martyr Saint Wenceslaus
to place the heavenly Kingdom before an earthly one,
grant through his prayers that, denying ourselves,
we may hold fast to you with all our heart.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Peter 3:14-17
Beloved:
Even if you should suffer because of righteousness, blessed are you.
Do not be afraid or terrified with fear of them,
but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts.
Always be ready to give an explanation
to anyone who asks you for a reason for your hope,
but do it with gentleness and reverence,
keeping your conscience clear,
so that, when you are maligned,
those who defame your good conduct in Christ
may themselves be put to shame.
For it is better to suffer for doing good,
if that be the will of God, than for doing evil.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3,4-5,6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
"The LORD has done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are they who are persecued for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Matthew 10:34-39
Jesus said to his Apostles:
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth.
I have come to bring not peace but the sword.
For I have come to set
a man against his father,
a daughter against her mother,
and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
and one's enemies will be those of his household.

"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,
and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;
and whoever does not take up his cross
and follow after me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds his life will lose it,
and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."

SECOND READING
From the first old Slavic legend
(Edit. M. Weingart, Prague 1934, 974-983)
The throne of the king who judges the poor in honesty shall be
strengthened for ever
At the death of Vratislaus the people of Bohemia made his son
Wenceslaus their king. He was by God�s grace a man of utmost faith. He
was charitable to the poor, and he would clothe the naked, feed the
hungry and offer hospitality to travelers according the summons of the
Gospel. He would not allow widows to be treated unjustly; he loved all
his people, both rich and poor; he also provided for the servants of
God, and he adorned many churches.

The men of Bohemia, however, became arrogant and prevailed upon
Boleslaus, his younger brother. They told him, �Your brother Wenceslaus
is conspiring with his mother and his men to kill you.�

On the feasts of the dedication of the churches in various cities,
Wenceslaus was in the habit of paying them a visit. One Sunday he
entered the city of Boleslaus on the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian,
and after hearing Mass, he planned to return to Prague. But Boleslaus,
with his wicked plan in mind, detained him with the words: �Why are you
leaving, brother?� The next morning when they rang the bell for matins,
Wenceslaus, on hearing the sound, said: �Praise to you, Lord; you have
allowed me to live to this morning.� And so he rose and went to
matins.�

Immediately Boleslaus followed him to the church door. Wenceslaus
looked back at him and said: �Brother, you were a good subject to me
yesterday.� But the devil had already blocked the ears of Boleslaus and
perverted his heart. Drawing his sword Boleslaus replied: �And now I
intend to be a better one!� With these words he struck his brother�s
head with his sword. But Wenceslaus turned and said: �Brother, what are
you trying to do?� And with that he seized Boleslaus and threw him to
the ground. But one of Boleslaus� counselors ran up and stabbed
Wenceslaus in the hand. With his hand wounded, he let go of his brother
and took refuge in the church. But two evil men struck him down at the
church door; and then another rushed up and ran him through with a
sword. Thereupon Wenceslaus died with the words: Into your hands, O
Lord, I commend my spirit!�
RESPONSORY          See Hosea 14:6; Psalm 92:13-14
The just man shall blossom like the lily;
- he shall flourish for ever in the presence of the Lord.
He shall be planted in the house of the Lord,
in the courts of the house of our God.
- He shall flourish for ever in the presence of the Lord.
