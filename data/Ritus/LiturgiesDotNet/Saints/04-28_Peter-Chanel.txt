O God, who for the spreading of your Church
crowned Saint Peter Chanel with martyrdom,
grant that, in these days of paschal joy,
we may so celebrate the mysteries of Christ's Death and Resurrection
as to bear worthy witness to newness of life.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 1:18-25
Brothers and sisters:
The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
For it is written:

I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
and the learning of the learned I will set aside.

Where is the wise one?
Where is the scribe?
Where is the debater of this age?
Has not God made the wisdom of the world foolish?
For since in the wisdom of God
the world did not come to know God through wisdom,
it was the will of God through the foolishness of the proclamation
to save those who have faith.
For Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,
but we proclaim Christ crucified,
a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,
but to those who are called, Jews and Greeks alike,
Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom,
and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 117:1bc, 2
Euntes in mundum universum praedicate Evangelium
R. (Mark 16:15) Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
Praise the LORD, all you nations;
glorify him, all you peoples!
R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
For steadfast is his kindness for us,
and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever.
R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
ALLELUIA          Jn 13:34
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Mark 1:14-20
After John the Baptist had been arrested,
Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the Gospel of God:
"This is the time of fulfillment.
The Kingdom of God is at hand.
Repent, and believe in the Gospel."

As he passed by the Sea of Galilee,
he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea;
they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them,
"Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Then they left their nets and followed him.
He walked along a little farther
and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
They too were in a boat mending their nets.
Then he called them.
So they left their father Zebedee in the boat
along with the hired men and followed him.

Office of Readings
From a Eulogy for Saint Peter, Priest and Martyr
The blood of martyrs is the seed of Christians
As soon as Peter embraced religious life in the Society of Mary, he was
sent at his own request to the missions of Oceania, and landed on the
island of Futuna in the Pacific Ocean, where the name of Christ had
never before been preached. A lay-brother who was constantly at his
side gave the following account of his life in the missions.

�Because of his labors he was often burned by the heat of the sun, and
famished with hunger, and he would return home wet with perspiration
and completely exhausted. Yet he always remained in good spirits,
courageous and energetic, as if he were returning from a pleasure
jaunt, and this would happen almost every day.

�He could never refuse anything to the Futunians, even to those who
persecuted him; he always made excuses for them and never rejected
them, even though they were often rude and troublesome. He displayed an
unparalleled mildness toward everyone on all occasions without
exception. It is no wonder then that the natives used to call him the
�good-hearted man.� He once told a fellow religious: �In such a
difficult mission one has to be holy.�

Quietly he preached Christ and the Gospel, but there was little
response. Still with invincible perseverance he pursued his missionary
tasks on both the human and religious level, relying on the example and
words of Christ: There is one who sows and another who reaps. And he
constantly prayed for help from the Mother of God, to whom he was
especially devoted.

By his preaching of Christianity he destroyed the cult of the evil
spirits, which the chieftains of the Futunians encouraged in order to
keep the tribe under their rule. This was the reason they subjected
Peter to a most cruel death, hoping that by killing him the seeds of
the Christian religion which he had sowed would be annihilated.

On the day before his martyrdom he had said: �It does not matter if I
die. Christ�s religion is so deeply rooted on this island that it
cannot be destroyed by my death.�

The blood of this martyr benefited, in the first place, the natives of
Futuna, for a few years later they were all converted to the faith of
Christ. But it benefited as well the other islands of Oceania, where
Christian churches, which claim Peter as their first martyr, are now
flourishing.
RESPONSORY         Luke 10:2; Acts 1:8
So great a harvest, and so few to gather it in;
- pray to the Lord of the harvest,
beg him to send out laborers for his harvest, alleluia.
You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
and you will be my witnesses to the ends of the earth.
- Pray to the Lord of the harvest,
beg him to send out laborers for his harvest, alleluia.
