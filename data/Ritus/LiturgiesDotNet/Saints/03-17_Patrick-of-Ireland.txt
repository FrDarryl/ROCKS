FIRST READING          1 Peter 4:7b-11
Beloved:
Be serious and sober-minded
so that you will be able to pray.
Above all, let your love for one another be intense,
because love covers a multitude of sins.
Be hospitable to one another without complaining.
As each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another
as good stewards of God's varied grace.
Whoever preaches, let it be with the words of God;
whoever serves, let it be with the strength that God supplies,
so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
to whom belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          Mk 1:17
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Luke 5:1-11
While the crowd was pressing in on Jesus and listening to the word of
God,
he was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.
He saw two boats there alongside the lake;
the fishermen had disembarked and were washing their nets.
Getting into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon,
he asked him to put out a short distance from the shore.
Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.
After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,
"Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch."
Simon said in reply,
"Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing,
but at your command I will lower the nets."
When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish
and their nets were tearing.
They signaled to their partners in the other boat
to come to help them.
They came and filled both boats
so that they were in danger of sinking.
When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said,
"Depart from me. Lord, for I am a sinful man."
For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him
and all those with him,
and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
who were partners of Simon.
Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid;
from now on you will be catching men."
When they brought their boats to the shore,
they left everything and followed him.

Office of Readings

From the Confession of Saint Patrick, Bishop
(Cap 14-16:PL 53, 808-809)
Through me many peoples have been reborn in God
I give unceasing thanks to my God, who kept me faithful in the day of
my testing. Today I can offer him sacrifice with confidence, giving
myself as a living victim to Christ, my Lord, who kept me safe through
all my trials. I can say now: Who am I, Lord, and what is my calling,
that you worked through me with such divine power? You did all this so
that today among the Gentiles I might constantly rejoice and glorify
your name wherever I may be, both in prosperity and in adversity. You
did it so that, whatever happened to me, I might accept good and evil
equally, always giving thanks to God. God showed me how to have faith
in him for ever, as one who is never to be doubted. He answered my
prayer in such a way that in the last days, ignorant though I am, I
might be bold enough to take up so holy and so wonderful a task, and
imitate in some degree those whom the Lord had so long ago foretold as
heralds of his Gospel, bearing witness to all nations.

How did I get this wisdom, that was not mine before? I did not know the
number of my days, or have knowledge of God. How did so great and
salutary a gift come to me, the gift of knowing and loving God, though
at the cost of homeland and family? I came to the Irish peoples to
preach the Gospel and endure the taunts of unbelievers, putting up with
reproaches about my earthly pilgrimage, suffering many persecutions,
even bondage, and losing my birthright of freedom for the benefit of
others.

If I am worthy, I am ready also to give up my life, without hesitation
and most willingly, for his name. I want to spend myself in that
country, even in death, if the Lord should grant me this favor. I am
deeply in his debt, for he gave me the great grace that through me many
peoples should be reborn in God, and then made perfect by confirmation
and everywhere among them clergy ordained for a people so recently
coming to believe, one people gathered by the Lord from the ends of the
earth. As God had prophesied of old through the prophets: The nations
shall come to you from the ends of the earth, and say: "How false are
the idols made by our fathers: they are useless." In another prophecy
he said: I have set you as a light among the nations, to bring
salvation to the ends of the earth.

It is among that people that I want to wait for the promise made by
him, who assuredly never tells a lie. He makes this promise in the
Gospel: They shall come from the east and west, and sit down with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This is our faith: believers are to come from
the whole world.
RESPONSORY       Romans 15:15-16;1:9
God has given me the grace
to be a minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles,
and to assume the priestly duty of preaching the Gospel,
- so that the Gentiles might be received as an acceptable offering,
consecrated by the Holy Spirit.

In my spirit I serve the Father
by preaching the Gospel of his Son.
- so that the Gentiles might be received as an acceptable offering,
consecrated by the Holy Spirit.
