Deus, qui beatam Birgittam per varias vitae semitas duxisti eamque
sapientiam crucis in contemplatione passionis Filii tui mirabiliter
docuisti, concede nobis, ut, digne in tua vocatione ambulantes, te in
omnibus quaerere valeamus.
O God, who guided Saint Bridget of Sweden
along different paths of life
and wondrously taught her the wisdom of the Cross
as she contemplated the Passion of your Son,
grant us, we pray,
that, walking worthily in our vocation,
we may seek you in all things.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Galatians 2:19-20
Brothers and sisters:
Through the law I died to the law,
that I might live for God.
I have been crucified with Christ;
yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me;
insofar as I now live in the flesh,
I live by faith in the Son of God
who has loved me and given himself up for me.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: Taste and see the goodness
of the Lord.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
praise shall be always in my mouth.
My soul will glory in the LORD
that the poor may hear and be glad.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: Taste and see the goodness
of the Lord.
Magnify the LORD with me;
let us exalt his name together.
I sought the LORD, who answered me,
delivered me from all my fears.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: Taste and see the goodness
of the Lord.
Look to God that you may be radiant with joy
and your faces may not blush for shame.
In my misfortune I called,
the LORD heard and saved me from all distress.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: Taste and see the goodness
of the Lord.
The angel of the LORD, who encamps with them,
delivers all who fear God.
Learn to savor how good the LORD is;
happy are those who take refuge in him.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: Taste and see the goodness
of the Lord.
Fear the LORD, you holy ones;
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.
The powerful grow poor and hungry,
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: Taste and see the goodness
of the Lord.
ALLELUIA      Jn 15: 9b; 5b
Remain in my love, says the Lord;
Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit.
GOSPEL READING           John 15:1-8
Jesus said to his disciples:
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower.
He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit,
and every one that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit.
You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.
Remain in me, as I remain in you.
Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own
unless it remains on the vine,
so neither can you unless you remain in me.
I am the vine, you are the branches.
Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit,
because without me you can do nothing.
Anyone who does not remain in me
will be thrown out like a branch and wither;
people will gather them and throw them into a fire
and they will be burned.
If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you.
By this is my Father glorified,
that you bear much fruit and become my disciples."

SECOND READING
From the prayers attributed to St. Bridget of Sweden
(Oratio 2: Revalationum S. Brigitae libri 2, Romae 1628, pp. 408-410)
A prayer to Christ our Savior
Blessed are you, my Lord Jesus Christ.  You foretold your death and at
the Last Supper you marvelously consecrated bread which became your
precious body.  And then you gave it to your apostles out of love as a
memorial of your most holy passion.  By washing their feet with your
holy hands, you gave them a supreme example of your deep humility.

Honor be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ.  Fearing your passion and death,
you poured forth blood from your innocent body like sweat, and still
you accomplished our redemption as you desired and gave us the clearest
proof of your love for all men.

Blessed may you be, my Lord Jesus Christ.  After you had been led to
Caiaphas, you, the judge of all men, humbly allowed yourself to be
handed over to the judgment of Pilate.

Glory be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ, for the mockery you endured when
you stood clothed in purple and wearing a crown of sharp thorns.  With
utmost endurance you allowed vicious men to spit upon your glorious
face, blindfold you and beat your cheek and neck with cruelest blows.

Praise be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ.  For with the greatest patience
you allowed yourself like an innocent lamb to be bound to a pillar and
mercilessly scourged, and then to be brought, covered with blood,
before the judgment seat of  Pilate to be gazed upon by all.

Honor be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ.  For after your glorious body
was covered with blood, you were condemned to death on the cross, you
endured the pain of carrying the cross on your sacred shoulders, and
you were led with curses to the place where you were to suffer.  Then
stripped of your garments, you allowed yourself to be nailed to the
wood of the cross.

Everlasting honor be to you, Lord Jesus Christ.  You allowed your most
holy mother to suffer so much, even though she had never sinned nor
ever even consented to the smallest sin.  Humbly you looked down upon
her with your gentle loving eyes, and to comfort her you entrusted her
to the faithful care of your disciple.

Eternal blessing be yours, my Lord Jesus Christ, because in your last
agony you held out to all sinners the hope of pardon, when in your
mercy you promised the glory of paradise to the penitent thief.

Eternal praise be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ, for the time you
endured on the cross the greatest torments and sufferings for us
sinners.  The sharp pain of your wounds fiercely penetrated even to
your blessed soul and cruelly pierced your most sacred heart till
finally you sent forth your spirit in peace, bowed your head, and
humbly commended yourself into the hands of God your Father, and your
whole body remained cold in death.

Blessed may you be, my Lord Jesus Christ.  You redeemed our souls with
your precious blood and most holy death, and in your mercy you led them
from exile back to eternal life.

Blessed may you be, my Lord Jesus Christ.  For our salvation you
allowed your side and heart to be pierced with a lance; and from that
side water and your precious blood flowed out abundantly for our
redemption.

Glory be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ.  You allowed your blessed body
to be taken down from the cross by your friends and laid in the arms of
your most sorrowing mother, and you let her wrap your body in a shroud
and bury it in a tomb to be guarded by soldiers.

Unending honor be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ.  On the third day you
rose from the dead and appeared to those you had chosen.  And after
forty days you ascended into heaven before the eyes of man witnesses,
and there in heaven you gathered together in glory those you love, whom
you had freed from hell.

Rejoicing and eternal praise be to you, my Lord Jesus Christ, who sent
the Holy Spirit into the hearts of your disciples and increased the
boundless love of God in their spirits.

Blessed are you and praiseworthy and glorious for ever, my Lord Jesus.
You sit upon your throne in your kingdom of heaven, in the glory of
your divinity, living in the most holy body you took from a virgin’s
flesh.  So will you appear on that last day to judge the souls of all
the living and the dead; you who live and reign with the Father and the
Holy Spirit for ever and ever.  Amen.
RESPONSORY          See Revelation 1:5-6; Ephesians 5:2
Christ loved us, and poured out his blood
to free us from our sins.
- He has made of us a kingdom of priests.
Live then in love, even as Christ loved us
and gave himself up for us.
- He has made of us a kingdom of priests.
