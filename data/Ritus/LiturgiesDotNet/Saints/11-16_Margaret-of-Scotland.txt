of Mercy
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatam Margaritam eximia in pauperes caritate mirabilem
effecisti, da, ut, eius intercessione et exemplo, imaginem bonitatis
tuae inter homines referamus.
O God,
who made Saint Margaret of Scotland wonderful
in her outstanding charity towards the poor,
grant that through her intercession and example
we may reflect among all humanity
the image of your divine goodness.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 58:6-11
Thus says the LORD:
This is the fasting that I wish:
releasing those bound unjustly,
untying the thongs of the yoke;
Setting free the oppressed,
breaking every yoke;
Sharing your bread with the hungry,
sheltering the oppressed and the homeless;
Clothing the naked when you see them,
and not turning your back on your own.
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,
and your wound shall quickly be healed;
Your vindication shall go before you,
and the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.
Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer,
you shall cry for help, and he will say: Here I am!
If you remove from your midst oppression,
false accusation and malicious speech;
If you bestow your bread on the hungry
and satisfy the afflicted;
Then light shall rise for you in darkness,
and the gloom shall become for you like midday;
Then the LORD will guide you always
and give you plenty even on the parched land.
He will renew your strength,
and you shall be like a watered garden,
like a spring whose water never fails.

ALLELUIA          John 13:34

GOSPEL          John 15:9-17
Jesus said to his disciples:
"As the Father loves me, so I also love you.
Remain in my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love,
just as I have kept my Father's commandments
and remain in his love.

"I have told you this so that my joy might be in you
and your joy might be complete.
This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
No one has greater love than this,
to lay down one's life for one's friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you slaves,
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
I have called you friends,
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,
so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
This I command you: love one another."

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From the pastoral constitution on the Church in the modern world of the
Second Vatican Council
(Gaudium et spes, n. 48)
The sanctity of marriage and the family
Husband and wife, by the covenant of marriage, are no longer.. two, but
one flesh. By their intimate union of persons and of actions they give
mutual help and service to each other, experience the meaning of their
unity, and gain an ever deeper understanding of it day by day.

This intimate union in the mutual self-giving of two persons, as well
as the good of the children, demands full fidelity from both, and an
indissoluble unity between them.

Christ the Lord has abundantly blessed this richly complex love which
springs from the divine source of love and is founded on the model of
his union with the Church.

In earlier times God met his people in a covenant of love and fidelity.
So now the Savior of mankind, the Bridegroom of the Church, meets
Christian husbands and wives in the sacrament of matrimony. Further, he
remains with them in order that, as he loved the Church and gave
himself up for her, so husband and wife may, in mutual self-giving,
love each other with perpetual fidelity.

True married love is caught up into God�s love; it is guided and
enriched by the redeeming power of Christ and the saving action of the
Church, in order that the partners may be effectively led to God and
receive help and strength in the sublime responsibility of parenthood.

Christian partners are therefore strengthened, and as it were
consecrated, by a special sacrament for the duties and the dignity of
their state. By the power of this sacrament they fulfill their
obligations to each other and to their family and are filled with the
spirit of Christ. This spirit pervades their whole lives with faith,
hope and love. Thus they promote their own perfection and each other�s
sanctification, and so contribute together to the greater glory of God.

Hence, with parents leading the way by example and family prayer, their
children � indeed, all within the family circle � will find it easier
to make progress in natural virtues, in salvation and in holiness.
Husband and wife, raised to the dignity and the responsibility of
parenthood, will be zealous in fulfilling their task as educators,
especially in the sphere of religious education, a task that is
primarily their own.

Children, as active members of the family, contribute in their own way
to the holiness of their parents. With the love of grateful hearts,
with loving respect and trust, they will return the generosity of their
parents and will stand by them as true sons and daughters when they
meet with hardship and the loneliness of old age.
RESPONSORY          1 Thess 5:14,15,18; Rom. 15:7
The woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
- She is clothed with strength and dignity.

Give her the reward of her deeds;
they will proclaim her as she enters the gates.
- She is clothed with strength and dignity.
