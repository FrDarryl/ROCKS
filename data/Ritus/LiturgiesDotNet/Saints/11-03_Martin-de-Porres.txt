Deus, qui beatum Martinum per humilitatis iter ad caelestem gloriam
perduxisti, tribue nobis eius ita nunc persequi exempla praeclara, ut
exaltari cum ipso mereamur in caelis.
O God, who led Saint Martin de Porres
by the path of humility to heavenly glory,
grant that we may so follow his radiant example in this life
as to merit to be exalted with him in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Philippians 4:4-9
Brothers and sisters:
Rejoice in the Lord always.
I shall say it again: rejoice!
Your kindness should be known to all.
The Lord is near.
Have no anxiety at all, but in everything,
by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving,
make your requests known to God.
Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding
will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

Finally, brothers and sisters,
whatever is true, whatever is honorable,
whatever is just, whatever is pure,
whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious,
if there is any excellence
and if there is anything worthy of praise,
think about these things.
Keep on doing what you have learned and received
and heard and seen in me.
Then the God of peace will be with you.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 131:1bcde,2,3
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
O LORD, my heart is not proud,
nor are my eyes haughty;
I busy not myself with great things,
nor with things too sublime for me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
Nay rather, I have stilled and quieted
my soul like a weaned child.
Like a weaned child on its mother's lap,
so is my soul within me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
O Israel, hope in the LORD,
both now and forever.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
ALLELUIA          John 13:34
I give you a new commandment:
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          Matthew 22:34-40
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,
they gathered together, and one of them
a scholar of the law, tested him by asking,
"Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?"
He said to him,
"You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart,
with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the greatest and the first commandment.
The second is like it:
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The whole Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments."

The Office of Readings

From a homily given at the canonization of Saint Martin de Porres by
Pope John XXIII
(Die 6 maii 1962: AAS 54 , 306-309)
"Martin the charitable"

The example of Martin's life is ample evidence that we can strive for
holiness and salvation as Christ Jesus has shown us: first, by loving
God "with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind;
and second, by loving your neighbor as yourself."

When Martin had come to realize that Christ Jesus "suffered for us and
that he carried our sins on his body to the cross, he would meditate
with remarkable ardor and affection about Christ on the cross. He had
an exceptional love for the great sacrament of the Eucharist and often
spent long hours in prayer before the blessed sacrament. His desire was
to receive the sacrament in Communion as often as he could.

Saint Martin, always obedient and inspired by his divine teacher, dealt
with his brothers and with that profound love which comes from pure
faith and humility of spirit. He loved men and because he honestly
looked on them as God's children and as his own brothers and sisters.
Such was his humility that he loved them even more than himself, and
considered them to be better and more righteous than he was.

He did not blame others for their shortcomings. Certain that he
deserved more severe punishment for his sins than others did, he would
overlook their worst offenses. He was tireless in his efforts to reform
the criminal, and he would sit up with the sick to bring them comfort.
For the poor he would provide food, clothing and medicine. He did all
he could to care for poor farmhands, blacks, and mulattoes who were
looked down upon as slaves, the dregs of society in their time. Common
people responded by calling him, "Martin the charitable."

The virtuous example and even the conversation of this saintly man
exerted a powerful influence in drawing men to religion. It is
remarkable how even today his influence can still move us toward the
things of heaven. Sad to say, not all of us understand these spiritual
values as well as we should, nor do we give them a proper place in our
lives. Many of us, in fact, strongly attracted by sin, may look upon
these values as of little moment, even something of a nuisance, or we
ignore them altogether. It is deeply rewarding for men striving for
salvation to follow in Christ's footsteps and to obey God's
commandments. If only everyone could learn this lesson from the example
that Martin gave us.
RESPONSORY
Blessed is the man who is found without fault,
who does not make gold his life's object,
who does not put his trust in wealth.
- His future will be secure in the Lord.
Who is this man that we may praise him,
for he has done wonders in his life?
- His future will be secure in the Lord.
COLLECT
O God, who led Saint Martin de Porres
by the path of humility to heavenly glory,
grant that we may so follow his radiant example in this life
as to merit to be exalted with him in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
