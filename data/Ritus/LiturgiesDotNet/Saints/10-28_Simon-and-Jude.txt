Deus, qui nos per beatos Apostolos ad agnitionem tui nominis venire
tribuisti, intercedentibus sanctis Simone et Iuda, concede propitius,
ut semper augeatur Ecclesia incrementis in te credentium populorum
O God, who by the blessed Apostles
have brought us to acknowledge your name,
graciously grant,
through the intercession of Saints Simon and Jude,
that the Church may constantly grow

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 2:19-22
Brothers and sisters:
You are no longer strangers and sojourners,
but you are fellow citizens with the holy ones
and members of the household of God,
built upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets, with Christ
Jesus himself as the capstone.
Through him the whole structure is held together
and grows into a temple sacred in the Lord;
in him you also are being built together
into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM 19:2-3,4-5
In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
The heavens declare the glory of God,
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
Day pours out the word to day,
and night to night imparts knowledge.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
Not a word nor a discourse
whose voice is not heard;
Through all the earth their voice resounds,
and to the ends of the world, their message.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth.
ALLELUIA           Cf. Te Deum
Te deum laudamus, te Dominum confitemur. Te gloriosus Apostolorum
chorus laudat, Domine.
We praise you, O God, we acclaim you as Lord;
the glorious company of Apostles praise you.
GOSPEL          Luke 6:12-19
Jesus went up to the mountain to pray,
and he spent the night in prayer to God.
When day came, he called his disciples to himself,
and from them he chose Twelve, whom he also named Apostles:
Simon, whom he named Peter, and his brother Andrew,
James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew,
Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,
Simon who was called a Zealot,
and Judas the son of James,
and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Gloriam, Domine, sanctorum apostolorum Simonis et Iudae perpetuam
venerantes, quaesumus, ut vota nostra suscipias et ad sacra mysteria
celebranda nos digne perducas.
As we venerate the perpetual glory
of the holy Apostles Simon and Jude, O Lord,
we ask that you receive our prayers
and lead us to worthy celebration of the sacred mysteries.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE OF THE APOSTLES I
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God.

For you, eternal Shepherd,
do not desert your flock,
but through the blessed Apostles
watch over it and protect it always,
so that it may be governed
by those you have appointed shepherds
to lead it in the name of your Son.

And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
PREFACE OF THE APOSTLES II

through Christ our Lord

For  you have built your Church
to stand firm on apostolic foundations,
to be a lasting sign of your holiness on earth
and offer all humanity your heavenly teaching.

Therefore, now and for ages unending,
with all the host of Angels,
we sing to you with all our hearts,
crying out as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy..
