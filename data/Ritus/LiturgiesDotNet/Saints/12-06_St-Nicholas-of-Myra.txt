From the Common of Pastors: For a Bishop
COLLECT
Misericordiam tuam, Domine, supplices imploramus, et, beati Nicolai
episcopi interveniente suffragio, nos in omnibus custodi periculis, ut
via salutis nobis pateat expedita.
We humbly implore your mercy, Lord:
protect us in all dangers
through the prayers of the Bishop Saint Nicholas,
that the way of salvation may lie open before us.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 6:1-8
In the year King Uzziah died,
I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, with the train of his
garment filling the temple.
Seraphim were stationed above; each of them had six wings: with two
they veiled their faces,
with two they veiled their feet,
and with two they hovered aloft.
"Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts!" they cried, one to the other.
"All the earth is filled with his glory!"
At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook
and the house was filled with smoke.
Then I said, "Woe is me, I am doomed!
For I am a man of unclean lips,
living among a people of unclean lips;
yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"
Then one of the seraphim flew to me,
holding an ember which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
He touched my mouth with it and said,
"See, now that this has touched your lips,
your wickedness is removed, your sin purged."
Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,
"Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?"
"Here I am," I said, "send me!"
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 40:2 and 4, 7-8a, 8b-9, 10, 11
R. (8a and 9a) Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD,
and he stooped toward me and heard my cry.
And he put a new song into my mouth,
a hymn to our God.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,
but ears open to obedience you gave me.
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;
then said I, "Behold I come."
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
"In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,
To do your will, O my God, is my delight,
and your law is within my heart!"
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly;
I did not restrain my lips,
as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart;
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of;
I have made no secret of your kindness
and your truth in the vast assembly.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
GOSPEL          Luke 10:1-9
The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two disciples whom he sent ahead of
him in pairs
to every town and place he intended to visit.
He said to them,
"The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest.
Go on your way;
behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the
way.
Into whatever house you enter,
first say, 'Peace to this household.'
If a peaceful person lives there,
your peace will rest on him;
but if not, it will return to you.
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you,
for the laborer deserves his payment.
Do not move about from one house to another.
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you,
eat what is set before you,
cure the sick in it and say to them,
`The Kingdom of God is at hand for you."'

SECOND READING
From a Treatise on John by Saint Augustine, bishop
(Tract. 123, 5: CCL 36, 678-680)

The strength of love ought to overcome the fear of death
When the Lord asks Peter if he loves him, he is asking something he
already knows. Yet he does not ask only once, but a second and third
time. Each time Peter�s answer is the same: You know I love you. Each
time the Lord gives him the same command: Tend my sheep.

Peter had denied Christ three times, and to counter this he must
profess his faith three times. Otherwise his tongue would seem quicker
to serve fear than love, and the threat of death would seem to have
made him more eloquent than did the presence of life. If denying the
shepherd was proof of fear, then the task of love is to tend his flock.

When those who are tending Christ�s flock wish that the sheep were
theirs rather than his, they stand convicted of loving themselves, not
Christ. And the Lord�s words are a repeated admonition to them and to
all who, as Paul writes sadly, are seeking their own ends, not
Christ�s.

Do you love me? Tend my sheep. Surely this means: �If you love me, your
thoughts must focus on taking care of my sheep, not taking care of
yourself. You must tend them as mine, not as yours; seek in them my
glory, not yours; my sovereign rights, not yours; my gain, not yours.
Otherwise you will find yourself among those who belong to the �times
of peril,� those who are guilty of self-love and the other sins that go
with that beginning of evils.�

So the shepherds of Christ�s flock must never indulge in self-love; if
they do they will be tending the sheep not as Christ�s but as their
own. And of all vices this is the one that the shepherds must guard
against most earnestly; seeking their own purposes instead of Christ�s,
furthering their own desires by means of those persons for whom Christ
shed his blood.

The love of Christ ought to reach such a spiritual pitch in his
shepherds that it overcomes the natural fear of death which makes us
shrink from the thought of dying even though we desire to live with
Christ. However distressful death may be, the strength of love ought to
master the distress. I mean the love we have for Christ who, although
he is our life, consented to suffer death for our sake.

Consider this: if death held little or no distress for us, the glory of
martyrdom would be less. But if the Good Shepherd, who laid down his
life for his sheep, has made so many of those same sheep martyrs and
witnesses for him, then how much more ought Christ�s shepherds fight
for the truth even to death and to shed their blood in opposing sin?
After all, the Lord has entrusted them with tending his flock and with
teaching and guiding his lambs.

With his passion for their example, Christ�s shepherds are most
certainly bound to cling to the pattern of his suffering, since even
the lambs have so often followed that pattern of the Chief Shepherd in
whose one flock the shepherds themselves are lambs. For the Good
Shepherd who suffered for all mankind has made all mankind his lambs,
since in order to suffer for them all he made himself a lamb.
RESPONSORY        Sirach 45:3; Psalm 78: 70,71
The Lord glorified him in the sight of kings,
and gave him commandments for his people.
God revealed to him his glory.
The Lord chose him to be his servant,
a shepherd of his own Israel.
God revealed to him his glory.
