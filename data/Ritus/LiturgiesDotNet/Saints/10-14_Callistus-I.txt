Deus, qui beatum Callistum papam, ad Ecclesiae servitium et pietatem
erga christifideles defunctos suscitasti, eius fidei testimonio,
quaesumus, nos robora, ut a servitute corruptionis erepti,
incorruptibilem hereditatem consequi mereamur.
O God, who raised up Pope Saint Callistus the First
to serve the Church
and attend devoutly to Christ's faithful departed,
strengthen us, we pray, by his witness to the faith,
so that, rescued from the slavery of corruption,
we may merit an incorruptible inheritance.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Peter 5:1-4
Beloved:
I exhort the presbyters among you,
as a fellow presbyter and witness to the sufferings of Christ
and one who has a share in the glory to be revealed.
Tend the flock of God in your midst,
overseeing it not by constraint but willingly,
as God would have it, not for shameful profit but eagerly.
Do not lord it over those assigned to you,
but be examples to the flock.
And when the chief Shepherd is revealed,
you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          40:2 and 4ab, 7-8a, 8b-9, 10, 11
R. (8a and 9a) Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD,
and he stooped toward me and heard my cry.
And he put a new song into my mouth,
a hymn to our God.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,
but ears open to obedience you gave me.
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;
then said I, "Behold I come."
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
"In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,
To do your will, O my God, is my delight,
and your law is within my heart!"
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly;
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart;
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of;
I have made no secret of your kindness and your truth
in the vast assembly.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
ALLELUIA          John 15:15b
I call you my friends, says the Lord,
for I have made known to you all that the Father has told me.
GOSPEL          Luke 22:24-30
An argument broke out among the Apostles
about which of them should be regarded as the greatest.
Jesus said to them,
"The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them
and those in authority over them are addressed as 'Benefactors';
but among you it shall not be so.
Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest,
and the leader as the servant.
For who is greater:
the one seated at table or the one who serves?
Is it not the one seated at table?
I am among you as the one who serves.
It is you who have stood by me in my trials;
and I confer a kingdom on you,
just as my Father has conferred one on me,
that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom;
and you will sit on thrones
judging the twelve tribes of Israel."

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From A Treatise to Fortunatus by Saint Cyprian, bishop and martyr
(Lib. 4, 20, 5-7; SC 100, 640-642, 644-648)
In times of peace the testimony of a good conscience wins the crown
The sufferings of this present time are not to be compared with the
glory that is to be revealed in us. Who would not strive wholeheartedly
to attain to such glory, to become a friend of God and straightway
rejoice with Christ, receiving heavenly rewards after earth�s torment
and suffering? Soldiers of this world take pride in returning to their
home country in triumph after they have defeated the enemy. How much
greater is the glory in returning triumphantly to heaven after
conquering the devil. The bold deceiver is laid low, the trophies of
victory are restored to the place from which Adam was cast out for his
sin. We offer to the Lord a most acceptable gift, our incorrupt faith,
the unshaken courage of our spirit and the glorious pride of our
dedication. We accompany him when he comes to take vengeance on his
enemies; sitting at his side at the judgment seat, sharing in Christ�s
inheritance, we are on an equal footing with the angels and enjoy the
possession of a heavenly kingdom together with the patriarchs, apostles
and prophets. What persecution can defeat such thoughts, what torture
overwhelm them?

The spirit of a strong and stable character strengthened by meditation
endures; the unshaken spirit, which is strengthened by a certain and
solid faith in the future will be enlivened against all the terrors of
the devil and threats of this world. During persecution the earth is
closed off from us, but heaven lies open; the Antichrist threatens, but
Christ protects us; death is brought on, but eternal life follows. What
an honor, what happiness to depart joyfully from this world, to go
forth in glory from the anguish and pain, in one moment to close the
eyes that looked on the world of men and in the next to open them at
once to look on God and Christ! The speed of this joyous departure! You
are suddenly withdrawn from earth to find yourself in the kingdom of
heaven.

These are the thoughts you must grasp with your heart and mind and
reflect on day and night. If persecution should overtake such a soldier
of God, it will not overcome one so virtuously prepared for battle.
Even if our summons should come sooner, our faith which was prepared
for the witness of martyrdom will not go unrewarded. For we would
immediately receive our reward by God�s judgment. In time of
persecution the battle wins the crown, but in peace it is the testimony
of a good conscience.
RESPONSORY          See Acts 20:28: 1 Cor 4:2
You must have at heart every member of the flock,
for the Holy Spirit has made you their shepherds.
- You must rule over the Church of God,
which he made his own through the blood of his Son.

The great quality of a steward is to be faithful to his duty.
- You must rule over the Church of God,
which he made his own through the blood of his Son.
