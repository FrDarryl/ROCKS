COLLECT
Deus, qui Genetricem Filii tui Matrem quoque nostram constituisti,
concede nobis, ut, in paenitentia et oratione pro mundi salute
perseverantes, in dies valeamus regnum Christi efficacius promovere.
O God, who chose the Mother of your Son to be our Mother also,
grant us that, persevering in penance and prayer
for the salvation of the world,
we may further more effectively each day the reign of Christ.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 61:9-11
Thus says the LORD:
The descendants of my people shall be known among the nations,
and their offspring in the midst of the peoples;
all who see them shall acknowledge them,
as a race the LORD has blessed.
I rejoice heartily in the LORD,
in my God is the joy of my soul;
For he has clothed me with a robe of salvation,
and wrapped me in a mantle of justice.
Like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem,
like a bride bedecked with her jewels.
As the earth brings forth its plants,
and a garden makes its growth spring up,
So will the Lord GOD make justice and praise
spring up before all the nations.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 45:11-12, 14-15, 16-17
Audi, filia, et vide, et inclina aurem tuam.
R./ (11) Listen to me, daughter, see and bend your ear.
Hear, O daughter, and see; turn your ear,
forget your people and your father's house.
So shall the king desire your beauty;
for he is your lord, and you must worship him.
R./ Listen to me, daughter, see and bend your ear.
All glorious is the king's daughter as she enters;
her raiment is threaded with spun gold.
In embroidered apparel she is borne in to the king;
behind her the virgins of her train are brought to you.
R./ Listen to me, daughter, see and bend your ear.
They are borne in with gladness and joy;
they enter the palace of the king.
The place of your fathers your sons shall have;
you shall make them princes through all the land.
R./ Listen to me, daughter, see and bend your ear.
ALLELUIA
Blessed are you, holy Virgin Mary and worthy of all praise.
For the sun of justice, Christ our God, was born of you.
GOSPEL          Luke 11:27-28
While Jesus was speaking,
a woman from the crowd called out and said to him,
'Blessed is the womb that carried you
and the breasts at which you nursed.'
He replied,
"Rather, blessed are those
who hear the word of God and observe it."
