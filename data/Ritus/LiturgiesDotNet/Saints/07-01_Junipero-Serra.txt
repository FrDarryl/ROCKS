MASS

From the Common of Pastors: For One Pastor
COLLECT
O God, who by your ineffable mercy
have been pleased through the labors
of your priest Saint Junipero Serra
to count many American peoples within your Church,
grant by his intercession
that we may so join our hearts to you in love,
as to carry always and everywhere before all people
the image of your Only Begotten Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
