ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Galatians 6:14
Mihi autem absit gloriari, nisi in cruce Domini nostri Iesu Christi,
per quem mihi mundus crucifixus est, et ego mundo.
May I never boast,
except in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through which the world has been crucified to me,
and I to the world.
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Ioannem presbyterum perfectae sui abnegationis et
crucis amatorem eximium effecisti, concede ut, eius imitationi iugiter
inhaerentes, ad contemplationem gloriae tuae perveniamus aeternam.
O God, who gave the Priest Saint John
an outstanding dedication to perfect self-denial
and love of the Cross,
grant that, by imitating him closely at all times,
we may come to contemplate eternally your glory.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 2:1-10a
When I came to you, brothers and sisters,
proclaiming the mystery of God,
I did not come with sublimity of words or of wisdom.
For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you
except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
I came to you in weakness and fear and much trembling,
and my message and my proclamation
were not with persuasive words of wisdom,
but with a demonstration of spirit and power,
so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom
but on the power of God.
Yet we do speak a wisdom to those who are mature,
but not a wisdom of this age,
nor of the rulers of this age who are passing away.
Rather, we speak God's wisdom, mysterious, hidden,
which God predetermined before the ages for our glory,
and which none of the rulers of this age knew
for, if they had known it,
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But as it is written:
What eye has not seen, and ear has not heard,
and what has not entered the human heart,
what God has prepared for those who love him,
this God has revealed to us through the Spirit.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 37:3-4, 5-6, 30-31
R. (30a) The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Trust in the LORD and do good
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the LORD,
and he will grant you your heart's requests.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Commit to the LORD your way;
trust in him, and he will act.
He will make justice dawn for you like the light;
bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom
and his tongue utters what is right.
The law of his God is in his heart,
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:3
Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs in the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Luke 14:25-33
Great crowds were traveling with Jesus,
and he turned and addressed them,
"If anyone comes to me without hating his father and mother,
wife and children, brothers and sisters,
and even his own life,
he cannot be my disciple.
Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me
cannot be my disciple.
Which of you wishing to construct a tower
does not first sit down and calculate the cost
to see if there is enough for its completion?
Otherwise, after laying the foundation
and finding himself unable to finish the work
the onlookers should laugh at him and say,
This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.'
Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down
and decide whether with ten thousand troops
he can successfully oppose another king
advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops?
But if not, while he is still far away,
he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms.
In the same way,
every one of you who does not renounce all his possessions
cannot be my disciple."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Respice quas offerimus hostias, omnipotens Deus, in commemoratione
beati Ioannis, et praesta, ut, qui dominicae passionis mysteria
celebramus, imitemur quod agimus.
Look upon the sacrificial gifts we offer, almighty God,
in commemoration of Saint John of the Cross
and grant that we, who celebrate
the mysteries of the Lord's Passion,
may imitate what we now enact.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. Mt 16: 24
Qui vult venire post me, abneget semetipsum, et tollat crucem suam, et
sequatur me, dicit Dominus.
Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself,
take up his cross, and follow me, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Deus, qui crucis mysterium in beato Ioanne mirabiliter illustrasti,
concede propitius, ut, ex hoc sacrificio roborati, Christo fideles
haereamus, et in Ecclesia ad salutem omnium operemur.
O God, who in Saint John
have wonderfully made known the mystery of the Cross,
graciously grant
that, drawing strength from this sacrifice,
we may cling faithfully to Christ
and labor in the Church for the salvation of all.
Through Christ our Lord.

SECOND READING
From a Spiritual Canticle of St John of the Cross, priest
(Red. B, str. 36-37))
The knowledge of the mystery hidden within Christ Jesus
Though holy doctors have uncovered many mysteries and wonders, and
devout souls have understood them in this earthly condition of ours,
yet the greater part still remains to be unfolded by them, and even to
be understood by them.
We must then dig deeply in Christ. He is like a rich mine with many
pockets containing treasures: however deep we dig we will never find
their end or their limit. Indeed, in every pocket new seams of fresh
riches are discovered on all sides.
For this reason the apostle Paul said of Christ: In him are hidden all
the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God. The soul cannot enter
into these treasures, nor attain them, unless it first crosses into and
enters the thicket of suffering, enduring interior and exterior
labours, and unless it first receives from God very many blessings in
the intellect and in the senses, and has undergone long spiritual
training.
All these are lesser things, disposing the soul for the lofty sanctuary
of the knowledge of the mysteries of Christ: this is the highest wisdom
attainable in this life.
Would that men might come at last to see that it is quite impossible to
reach the thicket of the riches and wisdom of God except by first
entering the thicket of much suffering, in such a way that the soul
finds there its consolation and desire. The soul that longs for divine
wisdom chooses first, and in truth, to enter the thicket of the cross.
Saint Paul therefore urges the Ephesians not to grow weary in the midst
of tribulations, but to be steadfast and rooted and grounded in love,
so that they may know with all the saints the breadth, the length, the
height and the depth � to know what is beyond knowledge, the love of
Christ, so as to be filled with all the fullness of God.
The gate that gives entry into these riches of his wisdom is the cross;
because it is a narrow gate, while many seek the joys that can be
gained through it, it is given to few to desire to pass through it.
RESPONSORY          1 Corinthians 2:9-10
No eye can see, no ear can hear, no heart can imagine
-  the marvels that God has prepared for those who love him.
Yet God has revealed them to us through his Spirit.
-  The marvels that God has prepared for those who love him.
