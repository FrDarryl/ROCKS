Deus, qui beatum Petrum servorum servum effecisti eumque mira in eis
iuvandis caritate et patientia roborasti, eius nobis intercessione
concede, ut, quae Iesu Christi sunt, quaerentes, proximos opere et
veritate diligamus.
O God, who made Saint Peter Claver a slave of slaves
and strenghtened him with wonderful charity and patience
as he came to their help,
grant, through his intercession,
that, seeking the things of Jesus Christ,
we may love our neighbor in deeds and in truth.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 58:6-11
Thus says the LORD:
This is the fasting that I wish:
releasing those bound unjustly,
untying the thongs of the yoke;
Setting free the oppressed,
breaking every yoke;
Sharing your bread with the hungry,
sheltering the oppressed and the homeless;
Clothing the naked when you see them,
and not turning your back on your own.
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,
and your wound shall quickly be healed;
Your vindication shall go before you,
and the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.
Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer,
you shall cry for help, and he will say: Here I am!
If you remove from your midst oppression,
false accusation and malicious speech;
If you bestow your bread on the hungry
and satisfy the afflicted;
Then light shall rise for you in darkness,
and the gloom shall become for you like midday;
Then the LORD will guide you always
and give you plenty even on the parched land.
He will renew your strength,
and you shall be like a watered garden,
like a spring whose water never fails.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 1:1-2, 3, 4 and 6
R. (40:5a) Blessed are they who hope in the Lord. or:
R. (2a) Blessed are they who delight in the law of the Lord. or:
R. (92:13-14) The just will flourish like the palm tree in the garden
of the Lord.
Blessed the man who follows not
the counsel of the wicked
Nor walks in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the company of the insolent,
But delights in the law of the LORD
and meditates on his law day and night.
R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord. or:
R. Blessed are they who delight in the law of the Lord. or:
R. The just will flourish like the palm tree in the garden of the Lord.
He is like a tree
planted near running water,
That yields its fruit in due season,
and whose leaves never fade.
Whatever he does, prospers.
R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord. or:
R. Blessed are they who delight in the law of the Lord. or:
R. The just will flourish like the palm tree in the garden of the Lord.
Not so, the wicked, not so;
they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
For the LORD watches over the way of the just,
but the way of the wicked vanishes.
R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord. or:
R. Blessed are they who delight in the law of the Lord. or:
R. The just will flourish like the palm tree in the garden of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Jn 13:34
I give you a new commandment:
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          Matthew 25:31-40
Jesus said to his disciples:
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
and all the angels with him,
he will sit upon his glorious throne,
and all the nations will be assembled before him.
And he will separate them one from another,
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right,
'Come, you who are blessed by my Father.
Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food,
I was thirsty and you gave me drink,
a stranger and you welcomed me,
naked and you clothed me,
ill and you cared for me,
in prison and you visited me.'
Then the righteous will answer him and say,
'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,
or thirsty and give you drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you,
or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?'
And the king will say to them in reply,
'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did
for one of the least brothers of mine you did for me.'"

Office of Readings

From a letter by Saint Peter Claver, priest
To preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to
proclaim pardon to captives
Yesterday, May 30, 1627, on the feast of the Most Holy Trinity,
numerous blacks, brought from the rivers of Africa, disembarked from a
large ship. Carrying two baskets of oranges, lemons, sweet biscuits,
and I know not what else, we hurried toward them. When we approached
their quarters, we thought we were entering another Guinea. We had to
force our way through the crowd until we reached the sick. Large
numbers of the sick were lying on the wet ground or rather in puddles
of mud. To prevent excessive dampness, someone had thought of building
up a mound with a mixture of tiles and broken pieces of bricks. This,
then, was their couch, a very uncomfortable one not only for that
reason, but especially because they were naked, without any clothing to
protect them.

We laid aside our cloaks, therefore, and brought from a warehouse
whatever was handy to build a platform. In that way we covered a space
to which we at last transferred the sick, by forcing a passage through
bands of slaves. Then we divided the sick into two groups: one group my
companion approached with an interpreter, while I addressed the other
group. There were two blacks, nearer death than life, already cold,
whose pulse could scarcely be detected. With the help of a tile we
pulled some live coals together and placed them in the middle near the
dying men. Into this fire we tossed aromatics. Of these we had two
wallets full, and we used them all up on this occasion. Then, using our
own cloaks, for they had nothing of this sort, and to ask the owners
for others would have been a waste of words, we provided for them a
smoke treatment, by which they seemed to recover their warmth and the
breath of life. The joy in their eyes as they looked at us was
something to see.

This was how we spoke to them, not with words but with our hands and
our actions. And in fact, convinced as they were that they had been
brought here to be eaten, any other language would have proved utterly
useless. Then we sat, or rather knelt, beside them and bathed their
faces and bodies with wine. We made every effort to encourage them with
friendly gestures and displayed in their presence the emotions which
somehow naturally tend to hearten the sick.

After this we began an elementary instruction about baptism, that is,
the wonderful effects of the sacrament on body and soul. When by their
answers to our questions they showed they had sufficiently understood
this, we went on to a more extensive instruction, namely, about the one
God, who rewards and punishes each one according to his merit, and the
rest. We asked them to make an act of contrition and to manifest their
detestation of their sins. Finally, when they appeared sufficiently
prepared, we declared to them the mysteries of the Trinity, the
Incarnation and the Passion. Showing them Christ fastened to the cross,
as he is depicted on the baptismal font on which streams of blood flow
down from his wounds, we led them in reciting an act of contrition in
their own language
RESPONSORY           Matthew 25:35, 40
I was hungry and you gave me food;
I was thirsty and you gave me drink;
I was homeless and you took me in.
� Now I tell you this:
When you did these things for the most neglected of my brothers,
you did them for me.

This is what I command:
Love one another as I have loved you.
� Now I tell you this:
When you did these things for the most neglected of my brothers,
you did them for me
