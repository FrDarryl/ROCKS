COLLECT
Fac nos, Domine Deus, in asserenda Filii tui divinitate, beati Eusebii
episcopi constantiam imitari, ut, fidem servantes quam ipse docuit,
eiusdem Filii tui vitae participes esse mereamur.
Lead us, Lord God, to imitate the constancy of Saint Eusebius
in affirming the divinity of your Son,
so that, by preserving the faith he taught as your Bishop,
we may merit a share in the very life of your Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 5:1-5
Beloved:
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God,
and everyone who loves the Father
loves also the one begotten by him.
In this way we know that we love the children of God
when we love God and obey his commandments.
For the love of God is this,
that we keep his commandments.
And his commandments are not burdensome,
for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world.
And the victory that conquers the world is our faith.
Who indeed is the victor over the world
but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          89:2-3, 21-22, 25 and 27
R. (2)  For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The favors of the LORD I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, �My kindness is established forever�;
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
�I have found David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
That my hand may be always with him,
and that my arm may make him b.�
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
�My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,
and through my name shall his horn be exalted.
He shall say of me, �You are my father,
my God, the Rock, my savior.��
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA      Mt 5:3
Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are the poor in spirit;
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL           Matthew 5:1-12a
When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain,
and after he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
He began to teach them, saying:

"Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek,
for they will inherit the land.
Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they will be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the clean of heart,
for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you
and utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me.
Rejoice and be glad,
for your reward will be great in heaven."

SECOND READING
From a letter by Saint Eusebius of Vercelli, bishop
(Epist. 2,1-3-2,3;1-.1-11,1:ccl 9, 104-105,109)
I have run the race; I have kept the faith
Dearly beloved, I know now that you are safe, as I was hoping, and I
felt that I had paid you a visit, by being suddenly transported over
the face of the earth like Habakkuk, when the angel brought him to
Daniel. When I receive a letter from one of you and see in your
writings your goodness and love, joy mingles with tears, and my desire
to continue reading is checked by my weeping. Both emotions are
inescapable, as they vie with each other in discharging their duty of
affection, when such a letter satisfies my longing for you.
Days pass in this way as I imagine myself in conversation with you, and
so I forget my past sufferings. Consolations surround me on all sides:
your firm faith, your love, your good works. In the midst of so many
great blessings I soon imagine myself in your company, in exile no
longer.
Dearly beloved, I rejoice in your faith, in the salvation that comes
from faith, in your good works, which are not confined to your own
surroundings but spread far and wide. Like a farmer tending a sound
tree, untouched by ax or fire because of its fruit, I want not only to
serve you in the body, good people that you are, but also to give my
life for your well-being.
Somehow or other I have managed with difficulty to complete this
letter. I asked God constantly to keep the guards away hour by hour,
and to allow the deacon to bring you some kind of greeting in writing,
not simply news of my suffering. So I beg you to keep the faith with
all vigilance, to preserve harmony, to be earnest in prayer, to
remember me always, so that the Lord may grant freedom to his Church
which is suffering throughout the world, and that I may be set free
from the sufferings that weigh upon me, and so be able to rejoice with
you.
I also ask and beseech you in God�s mercy, that each one of you should
add his own name to the greeting in this letter. Of necessity I cannot
write to each of you as was my custom. So in this letter I ask you all
- brothers and holy sisters, sons and daughters, men and women, old and
young - to be content with this greeting and to be good enough to give
my respectful good wishes to those who are outside the community and
are kind enough to be my friends.
RESPONSORY          Luke 12:35-36; Matthew 24:42
Let your belts be fastened around your waists,
and have your lamps burning ready.
- You must be as men who wait
for their master's return from the wedding feast.
Keep watch, therefore,
for you do not know on what day your Lord will return.
- You must be as men who wait
for their master's return from the wedding feast.
