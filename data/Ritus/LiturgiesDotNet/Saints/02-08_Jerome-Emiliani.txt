Deus, Pater misericordiarum, qui beatum Hieronymum adiutorem et patrem
orphanis providisti, eius nobis intercessione concede, ut spiritum
adoptionis, quo filii tui nominamur et sumus, fideliter custodiamus.
O God, Father of mercies,
who sent Saint Jerome Emiliani as a helper and father to orphans,
grant, through his intercession,
that we may preserve faithfully the spirit of adoption,
by which we are called, and truly are, your children.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Tobit 12:6-13
The angel Raphael said to Tobit and his son:
"Thank God! Give him the praise and the glory.
Before all the living,
acknowledge the many good things he has done for you,
by blessing and extolling his name in song.
Honor and proclaim God's deeds,
and do not be slack in praising him.
A king's secret it is prudent to keep,
but the works of God are to be declared and made known.
Praise them with due honor.
Do good, and evil will not find its way to you.
Prayer and fasting are good,
but better than either is almsgiving accompanied by righteousness.
A little with righteousness is better than abundance with wickedness.
It is better to give alms than to store up gold;
for almsgiving saves one from death and expiates every sin.
Those who regularly give alms shall enjoy a full life;
but those habitually guilty of sin are their own worst enemies.

"I will now tell you the whole truth;
I will conceal nothing at all from you.
I have already said to you,
'A king's secret it is prudent to keep,
but the works of God are to be made known with due honor.'
I can now tell you that when you, Tobit, and Sarah prayed,
it was I who presented and read the record of your prayer
before the Glory of the Lord;
and I did the same thing when you used to bury the dead.
When you did not hesitate to get up
and leave your dinner in order to go and bury the dead,
I was sent to put you to the test."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM Ps. 103:1-2, 13-14, 17-18
R. (2) I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. (9) Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
Bless the LORD, O my soul;
and all my being, bless his holy name.
Bless the LORD, O my soul,
and forget not all his benefits.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
As a father has compassion on his children,
so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him,
For he knows how we are formed;
he remembers that we are dust.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
But the kindness of the LORD is from eternity
to eternity toward those who fear him,
And his justice toward children�s children
among those who keep his covenant.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Mt. 5:3
Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Mark 10:17-30
As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up,
knelt down before him, and asked him,
"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you call me good?
No one is good but God alone.
You know the commandments: You shall not kill;
you shall not commit adultery;
you shall not steal;
you shall not bear false witness;
you shall not defraud;
honor your father and your mother."
He replied and said to him,
"Teacher, all of these I have observed from my youth."
Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said to him,
"You are lacking in one thing.
Go, sell what you have, and give to the poor
and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me."
At that statement his face fell,
and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,
"How hard it is for those who have wealth
to enter the Kingdom of God!"
The disciples were amazed at his words.
So Jesus again said to them in reply,
"Children, how hard it is to enter the Kingdom of God!
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
than for one who is rich to enter the Kingdom of God."
They were exceedingly astonished and said among themselves,
"Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said,
"For men it is impossible, but not for God.
All things are possible for God."
Peter began to say to him,
"We have given up everything and followed you."
Jesus said, "Amen, I say to you,
there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters
or mother or father or children or lands
for my sake and for the sake of the Gospel
who will not receive a hundred times more now in this present age:
houses and brothers and sisters
and mothers and children and lands,
with persecutions, and eternal life in the age to come."

Office of Readings

From a letter to his brothers by Saint Jerome Emiliani
(Venetius die 21 iuni 1535)
Place your trust in God alone

Sons of the Society of the Servants of the Poor, and dearly beloved
brothers in Christ: Greetings from your poor father. I urge you to
persevere in your love for Christ and your faithful observance of the
law of Christ. In word and work I set an example for you when I was
with you. And so the Lord is glorified in you through me. Our goal is
God, the source of all good. As we say in our prayer, we are to place
our trust in God and in no one else. In His kindness, our Lord wished
to strengthen your faith, for without it, as the evangelist points out,
Christ could not have performed many of His miracles. He also wished to
listen to your prayer, and so He ordained that you experience poverty,
distress, abandonment, weariness and universal scorn. It was also His
desire to deprive you of my physical presence, even though I am with
you in spirit as your poor, dear, beloved father. God alone knows the
reasons for all this, yet we can recognize three causes. In the first
place, our blessed Lord is telling you that He desires to include you
among His beloved sons, provided that you remain steadfast in His ways,
for this is the way He treats His friends and makes them holy. The
second reason is that He is asking you to grow continually in your
confidence in Him alone and not in others. For God, as I said before,
does not work in those who refuse to place all their confidence and
hope in Him alone. But he does impart the fullness of His love upon
those who possess a deep faith and hope; for them he does great things.
So if you have been endowed with faith and hope, He will do great
things for you; He will raise up the lowly. In depriving you of myself
and everyone else you have loved, He will offer you an opportunity to
choose one of these alternatives; either you will forsake your faith
and return to the ways of the world, or you will remain steadfast in
your faith and pass the test. Now there is a third reason. God wishes
to test you like gold in the furnace. The dross is consumed by the
fire, but the pure gold remains and its value increases. It is in this
manner that God acts with His good servant, who puts his hope in Him
and remains unshaken in times of distress. God raises him up and, in
return for the things he has left out of love for God, He repays him a
hundred-fold in this life with eternal life hereafter. This is the way
God has dealt with all His saints. So it was with His people Israel
after their period of trial in Egypt. He not only led them out of Egypt
with many miracles and fed them with manna in the desert, He also gave
them the promised land. If then you remain constant in faith in the
face of trial, the Lord will give you peace and rest for a time in this
world, and forever in the next.
RESPONSORY          1 Peter 3:7,8; Romans 12:10-11
Be of one heart and soul; be sympathetic, and love the brothers;
have sympathy for everyone and be self-effacing.
- You are called to this way of life so that you will inherit a
blessing.
Love each other in the way real brothers should,
and always respect each other.
Serve the Master and never grow tired;
keep your spirit alive and willing.
- You are called to this way of life so that you will inherit a
blessing.
