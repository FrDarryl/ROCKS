Liturgy of the Hours
St. Andre Bessette

From the Common of Holy Men: For Religious.
FIRST READING           Ephesians 4:1-24
I, then, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to live in a manner worthy
of the call you have received, with all humility and gentleness, with
patience, bearing with one another through love, striving to preserve
the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace: one body and one
Spirit, as you were also called to the one hope of your call; one Lord,
one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and
through all and in all.

But grace was given to each of us according to the measure of Christ�s
gift. Therefore, it says:

�He ascended on high and took prisoners captive;
he gave gifts to men.�

What does �he ascended� mean except that he also descended into the
lower regions of the earth? The one who descended is also the one who
ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.

And he gave some as apostles, others as prophets, others as
evangelists, others as pastors and teachers, to equip the holy ones for
the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all
attain to the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to mature
manhood, to the extent of the full stature of Christ, so that we may no
longer be infants, tossed by waves and swept along by every wind of
teaching arising from human trickery, from their cunning in the
interests of deceitful scheming.

Rather, living the truth in love, we should grow in every way into him
who is the head, Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held
together by every supporting ligament, with the proper functioning of
each part, brings about the body�s growth and builds itself up in love.

So I declare and testify in the Lord that you must no longer live as
the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds; darkened in
understanding, alienated from the life of God because of their
ignorance, because of their hardness of heart, they have become callous
and have handed themselves over to licentiousness for the practice of
every kind of impurity to excess.

That is not how you learned Christ, assuming that you have heard of him
and were taught in him, as truth is in Jesus, that you should put away
the old self of your former way of life, corrupted through deceitful
desires, and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new
self, created in God�s way in righteousness and holiness of truth.
RESPONSORY          Matthew 19:29, 27
If you leave your home, your brothers or sisters, father or mother,
wife or children, or lands for love of me,
� you will have it all returned a hundredfold
and will inherit eternal life.

Lord, we have left everything to follow you;
what will become of us!
� You will have it all returned a hundredfold
and will inherit eternal life.
FIRST READING
From a homily on the Gospels by Saint Gregory the Great, pope
(Lib. 2, hom 36, 11-13: PL 76, 1272-1274)

In the world, yet not of it

I would like to urge you to forsake everything, but that I do not
presume to do. Yet, if you cannot give up everything of this world, at
least keep what belongs to the world in such a way that you yourself
are not kept prisoner by the world. Whatever you possess must not
possess you; whatever you own must be under the power of your soul; for
if your soul is overpowered by the love of this world�s goods, it will
be totally at the mercy of its possessions.

In other words, we make use of temporal things, but our hearts are set
on what is eternal. Temporal goods help us on our way, but our desire
must be for those eternal realities which are our goal. We should give
no more than a side glance at all that happens in the world, but the
eyes of our soul are to be focused right ahead; for our whole attention
must be fixed on those realities which constitute our goal.

Whatever is vicious must be utterly eradicated, wrenched away not
merely from being put into act but even from being so much as thought
of. No carnal pleasure, no worldly curiosity, no surge of ambition must
keep us from the Lord�s Supper. But further, our minds should merely
skirt even the good deeds we perform in this life; in this way, the
physical things which give us pleasure will serve our bodily needs
without hindering the soul�s progress. You see, my brothers, I dare not
say to you, give up everything. Yet, if you will, you can give
everything up while keeping it, provided you handle temporal things in
such a way that your whole mind is directed toward what is eternal. A
man can use the world as if he were not using it, if he makes all
external needs minister to the support of his life without allowing
them to dominate his soul. They remain external to him and under his
control, serving him without halting the soul�s drive to higher things.
For such men, everything in this world is there for their use, not to
be desired. Nothing should interfere with your soul�s longing; no
created pleasure in the world should ensnare you.

If the object of love is what is good, then the soul should take its
delight in the higher good, the things of heaven. If the object of fear
is what is evil, then we should keep before ourselves the things that
are eternally evil. In this way, if the soul sees that we should have a
greater love and a greater fear about what concerns the next life, it
will never cling to this life.

To help us to achieve all this we have the help of the mediator between
God and man. Through him we shall obtain all this the more quickly, the
more we burn with a great love for him, who lives and reigns with the
Father and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.
RESPONSORY          1 Corinthians7:29, 30, 31; 2:12
The time is growing short,
so we must rejoice as though we were not rejoicing;
we must work in the world yet without becoming immersed in it,
� for the world as we know it is passing away.

We have not adopted the spirit of the world.
� For the world as we know it is passing away.
