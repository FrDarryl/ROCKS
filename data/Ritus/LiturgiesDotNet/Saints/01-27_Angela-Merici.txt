Pietati tuae, quaesumus, Domine, nos beata virgo Angela commendare non
desinat, ut, eius caritatis et prudentiae documenta sectantes, tuam
valeamus doctrinam custodire et moribus profiteri.
May the Virgin Saint Angela never fail to commend us
to your compassion, O Lord, we pray,
that, following the lessons of her charity and prudence,
we may hold fast to your teaching
and express it in what we do.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Peter 4:7b-11
Beloved:
Be serious and sober-minded
so that you will be able to pray.
Above all, let your love for one another be intense,
because love covers a multitude of sins.
Be hospitable to one another without complaining.
As each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another
as good stewards of God's varied grace.
Whoever preaches, let it be with the words of God;
whoever serves, let it be with the strength that God supplies,
so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
to whom belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

The disciples of Jesus had been discussing on the way
who was the greatest.
Jesus sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them,
�If anyone wishes to be first,
he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.�
Taking a child, he placed it in their midst,
and putting his arms around him, he said to them,
�Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me;
and whoever receives me,
receives not me but the One who sent me.�

The Office of Readings

From the Spiritual Testament by Saint Angela Merici, virgin
He has disposed all things pleasantly
Mothers and sisters most dear to me in Christ: in the first place
strive with all your power and zeal to be open. With the help of God,
try to receive such good counsel that, led solely by the love of God
and an eagerness to save souls, you may fulfil your charge.

Only if the responsibilities committed to you are rooted firmly in this
twofold charity will they bear beneficial and saving fruit. As our
Saviour says: A good tree is not able to produce bad fruit.

He says: A good tree, that is, a good heart as well as a soul inflamed
with charity, can do nothing but good and holy works. For this reason
Saint Augustine said: Love, and do what you will, namely, possess love
and charity and then do what you will. It is as if he had said: Charity
is not able to sin.

I also beg you to be concerned about every one of your daughters. Bear
them, so to speak, engraved upon your heart � not merely their names,
but their conditions and states, whatever they may be. This will not be
difficult for you if you embrace them with a living love.

Mothers of children, even if they have a thousand, carry each and every
one fixed in their hearts, and because of the strength of their love
they do not forget any of them. In fact, it seems that the more
children they have the more their love and care for each one is
increased. Surely those who are mothers in spirit can and must act all
the more in the same way, because spiritual love is more powerful than
the love that comes from a blood relationship.

Therefore, mothers most dear to me, if you love these your daughters
with a living and unaffected charity, it will be impossible for you not
to have each and every one of them engraved upon your memory and in
your mind. I beg you again, strive to draw them by love, modesty,
charity, and not by pride and harshness. Be sincerely kind to every one
according to the words of our Lord: Learn of me, for I am meek and
humble of heart. Thus you are imitating God, of whom it is said: He has
disposed all things pleasantly. And again Jesus said: My yoke is easy
and my burden is light.

You also ought to exercise pleasantness toward all, taking great care
especially that what you have commanded may never be done by reason of
force. For God has given free will to everyone, and therefore he forces
no one but only indicates, calls, persuades. Sometimes, however,
something will have to be done with a stronger command, yet in a
suitable manner and according to the state and necessities of
individuals; but then also we should be impelled only by charity and
zeal for souls.
RESPONSORY          Ephesians 5:8-9; Matt 5:14,16
Now you are light in the Lord;
live as men native to the light.
- Such light bears fruit in goodness, holiness and truth.
I have given you to the world as its light,
and you must shine for all to see.
- Such light bears fruit in goodness, holiness and truth.
