From the Common of Pastors: For A Pope

COLLECT
O God, who in your providence
raised up Pope Saint Pius the Fifth in your Church
that the faith might be safeguarded
and more fitting worship be offered to you,
grant, through his intercession,
that we may participate in your mysteries
with lively faith and fruitful charity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God,
for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 4:1-5
Brothers and sisters:
Thus should one regard us: as servants of Christ
and stewards of the mysteries of God. Now it is of course required of
stewards
that they be found trustworthy.
It does not concern me in the least
that I be judged by you or any human tribunal; I do not even
pass judgment on myself; I am not conscious of anything against me,
but I do not thereby stand acquitted; the one who judges me
is the Lord.
Therefore do not make any judgment before the appointed time,
until the Lord comes,
for he will bring to light what is hidden in darkness
and will manifest the motives of our hearts,
and then everyone will receive praise from God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 110:1,2,3,4
Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech.
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORD said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand
till I make your enemies your footstool."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The scepter of your power the LORD will stretch forth from Zion:
"Rule in the midst of your enemies."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
"Yours is princely power in the day of your birth, in holy splendor;
before the daystar, like the dew, I have begotten you."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORD has sworn, and he will not repent:
"You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
ALLELUIA          John 10:14
Ego sum pastor bonus, dicit Dominus; et cognosco oves meas, et
cognoscunt me meae.
I am the good shepherd, says the Lord;
I know my sheep and mine know me.
GOSPEL          John 21:15-17
After Jesus had revealed himself to his disciples
and eaten breakfast with them, he said to Simon Peter,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
Jesus said to him, "Feed my lambs."
He then said to Simon Peter a second time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
Jesus said to him, "Tend my sheep."
He said to him the third time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Peter was distressed that
Jesus had said to him a third time,
"Do you love me?" and he said to him,
"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.
"Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."

SECOND READING
From a treatise on John by Saint Augustine, bishop
(Tract. 124, 5: CCL: 36, 684-685)
The Church is founded upon the rock which Peter acknowledged

God never ceases to provide the human race with consolations in
misfortune. But in addition to these, in the fullness of time, when he
himself knew it should be done, he sent his own only-begotten Son
through whom he created all things. While remaining God, his Son was to
become man and be the mediator between God and men, the man Jesus
Christ.

Those who believed in him through baptism were freed from the guilt of
all their sins, freed from eternal damnation to live in faith, hope and
love. On their journey among the trials and dangers of this world, they
received the consolations of God, both in body and in spirit. They were
to walk in his sight, keeping to the path which Christ made for them.

But even while walking on this path they are not without sin, since it
develops subtly out of human weakness. Therefore Christ gave the saving
remedy of charity to help them in their prayers, for he taught them to
say: Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.

Such is the practice which the Church in blessed hope carries out in
this life of suffering. Now the apostle Peter, because of the primacy
of his apostleship, stood as a symbol of the entire Church.

In himself he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, by a more
abundant grace an apostle and the chief of the apostles. But Christ
said to him: To you I shall give the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
whatever you will bind upon the earth will be bound also in heaven and
whatever you will forgive upon the earth will be forgiven also in
heaven. Now these words applied to the entire Church. In this life it
is shaken by various trials, as if by rains, floods and tempests, but
it does not fall because it is founded upon the rock from which Peter
received his name.

The Lord said: Upon this rock I shall build my Church because Peter has
first said: You are Christ, the Son of the living God. The Lord was
really saying: I shall build my Church upon the rock which you have
acknowledged. For the rock was Christ, and upon this foundation even
Peter himself was raised up. Another foundation indeed no one can lay
except that which was laid, which is Jesus Christ.

The Church, which is founded upon '"Christ, received from him the keys
of the kingdom of heaven, that is, the power of binding and forgiving
sins, in the person of Peter. Therefore this Church, by loving and
following Christ, is set free from evil. But this is even more the case
with those who fight in behalf of truth even to the death.
RESPONSORY       Ezekiel 3:21; 1 Timothy 4:16
If you warn the virtuous man to avoid sin,
and he does not sin, he shall surely live - and you shall save your own
life, alleluia.
Be careful of what you do and teach,
and you will save yourself and all who listen to you.
- And you shall save your own life, alleluia.
