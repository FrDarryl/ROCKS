FIRST READING      Song of Songs 8:6-7
Set me as a seal on your heart,
as a seal on your arm;
For stern as death is love,
relentless as the nether world is devotion;
its flames are a blazing fire.

Deep waters cannot quench love,
nor floods sweep it away.
Were one to offer all he owns to purchase love,
he would be roundly mocked.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Psalm 45:11-12, 14-15, 16-17
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord
Listen, my daughter, and understand; pay me careful heed.
Forget your people and your father's house,
that the king might desire your beauty.
He is your lord.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord
All glorious is the king's daughter as she enters,
her raiment threaded with gold;
In embroidered apparel she is led to the king.
The maids of her train are presented to the king.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord
They are led in with glad and joyous acclaim;
they enter the palace of the king.
The throne of your fathers your sons will have;
you shall make them princes through all the land.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord
ALLELUIA          John 14:23
Whoever loves me willl keep my word,
and my Father will love him, and we will come to him.
GOSPEL       Matthew 25:1-13
Jesus told his disciples this parable:
�The Kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins
who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
The foolish ones, when taking their lamps,
brought no oil with them,
but the wise brought flasks of oil with their lamps.
Since the bridegroom was long delayed,
they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
At midnight, there was a cry,
�Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!�
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise,
�Give us some of your oil,
for our lamps are going out.�
But the wise ones replied,
�No, for there may not be enough for us and you.
Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.�
While they went off to buy it,
the bridegroom came
and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him.
Then the door was locked.
Afterwards the other virgins came and said,
�Lord, Lord, open the door for us!�
But he said in reply,
�Amen, I say to you, I do not know you.�
Therefore, stay awake,
for you know neither the day nor the hour.�

The Office of Readings

From the Common of Virgins.
A homily by Pope Pius XII
(July 7, 1946)
A humble woman who lived a virtuous life
Inspired by the grace of God, we join the saints in honouring the holy
virgin Frances Xavier Cabrini. She was a humble woman who became
outstanding not because she was famous, or rich or powerful, but
because she lived a virtuous life. From the tender years of her youth,
she kept her innocence as white as a lily and preserved it carefully
with the thorns of penitence; as the years progressed, she was moved by
a certain instinct and a supernatural zeal to dedicate her whole life
to the service and greater glory of God.
She welcomed delinquent youths into safe homes and taught them to live
upright and holy lives. She consoled those who were in prison and
recalled to them the hope of eternal life. She encouraged prisoners to
reform themselves and to live honest lives.
She comforted the sick and the infirm in the hospitals and diligently
cared for them. She extended a friendly and helping hand especially to
immigrants and offered them necessary shelter and relief, for having
left their homeland behind, they were wandering about in a foreign land
with no place to turn for help. Because of their condition she saw that
they were in danger of deserting the practice of Christian virtues and
their Catholic faith.
Where did she acquire all that strength and the inexhaustible energy by
which she was able to perform so many good works and to surmount so
many difficulties involving material things, travel and men?
Undoubtedly she accomplished all this through the faith which was
always so vibrant and alive in her heart; through the divine love which
burned within her; and, finally, through constant prayer by which she
was so closely united with God from whom she humbly asked and obtained
whatever her human weakness could not obtain.
In the face of the endless cares and anxieties of life, she never let
anything turn her aside from striving and aiming to please God and to
work for his glory for which nothing, aided by God�s grace, seemed too
laborious, or difficult, or beyond human strength.
RESPONSORY
I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink;
I was homeless and you took me in.
- Now I tell you this:
When you did these things for the most neglected of my brothers,
you did them for me.
This is what I command: Love one another as I have loved you.
- Now I tell you this:
When you did these things for the most neglected of my brothers,
you did them for me.
