readings are below.
ENTRANCE ANTIPHON           See Ps 21 (20): 2-3
In your strength, O Lord, the just one rejoices;
how greatly your salvation makes him glad!
You have granted him his soul's desire.
COLLECT
O God, who by means of Saint Juan Diego showed
the love of the most holy Virgin Mary for your people,
grant, through his intercession,
that, by following the counsels our Mother gave at Guadalupe,
we may be ever constant in fulfilling your will.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING      Micah 6:6-8
With what shall I come before the LORD,
and bow before God most high?
Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
with calves a year old?
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
with myriad streams of oil?
Shall I give my firstborn for my crime,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
You have been told, O mortal, what is good,
and what the LORD requires of you:
Only to do justice and to love goodness,
and to walk humbly with your God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 1:1-2, 3, 4 and 6
R./ Blessed are they who hope in the Lord. or
R./ Blessed are they who delight in the law of the Lord. or
R./ The just will flourish like the palm tree in the garden of the
Lord.
Blessed the man who follows not
the counsel of the wicked,
nor walks in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the company of the insolent,
but delights in the law of the Lord
and meditates on his law day and night.
R./
He is like a tree
planted near running water,
that yields its fruit in due season,
and whose leaves never fade.
Whatever he does, prospers.
R./
Not so the wicked, not so;
they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
For the Lord watches over the way of the just,
but the way of the wicked vanishes.
R./
GOSPEL READING       Matthew 7:21-27
Jesus said: "Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter
the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in
heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not
prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many
mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never
knew you; depart from me, you evildoers.'

"Every one then who hears these words of mine and does them will be
like a wise man who built his house upon the rock; and the rain fell,
and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but
it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And every one
who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a
foolish man who built his house upon the sand; and the rain fell, and
the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it
fell; and great was the fall of it."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Through the present oblation, O Lord,
which we offer in commemoration of blessed Juan Diego,
bestow on your faithful, we pray,
the gifts of unity and peace.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON           See Mt 16: 24
Whoever wishes to come after me,
must deny himself, take up his cross,
and follow me, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
May the Sacrament we have received, O Lord,
in commemoration of blessed Juan Diego,
sanctify our minds and hearts,
that we may merit to be made sharers in the divine nature.
Through Christ our Lord.

The Liturgy of the Hours
Juan Diego

From the Common of Holy Men The following is suggested as a second
reading and responsory:

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a Homily on the Canonization of Juan Diego by Pope John Paul II
What was Juan Diego like? Why did God look upon him? The Book of
Sirach, as we have heard, teaches us that God alone "is mighty; he is
glorified by the humble." Saint Paul's words, also proclaimed at this
celebration, shed light on the divine way of bringing about salvation:
"God chose what is low and despised in the world ... so that no human
being might boast in the presence of God." The Virgin Mary, the
handmaid "who glorified the Lord," reveals herself to Juan Diego as the
Mother of the true God. As a sign, she gives him precious roses, and as
he shows them to the Bishop, he discovers the blessed image of Our Lady
imprinted on his tilma. "The Lord looks down from heaven, he sees all
the sons of men," we recited with the Psalmist, once again confessing
our faith in God, who makes no distinctions of race or culture. In
accepting the Christian message without forgoing his indigenous
identity, Juan Diego discovered the profound truth of the new humanity,
in which all are called to be children of God. Thus he facilitated the
fruitful meeting of two worlds and became the catalyst for the new
Mexican identity, closely united to Our Lady of Guadalupe, whose
mestizo face expresses her spiritual motherhood which embraces all
Mexicans. This is why the witness of his life must continue to be the
inspiration for the building up of the Mexican nation, encouraging
brotherhood among all its children and ever helping to reconcile Mexico
with its origins, values and traditions. Blessed Juan Diego, a good,
Christian Indian, whom simple people have always considered a saint! We
ask you to accompany the Church on her pilgrimage in Mexico, so that
she may be more evangelizing and more missionary each day. Encourage
the Bishops, support the priests, inspire new and holy vocations, help
all those who give their lives to the cause of Christ and the spread of
his Kingdom. Happy Juan Diego, true and faithful man! We entrust to you
our lay brothers and sisters so that, feeling the call to holiness,
they may imbue every area of social life with the spirit of the Gospel.
Bless families, strengthen spouses in their marriage, sustain the
efforts of parents to give their children a Christian upbringing. Look
with favour upon the pain of those who are suffering in body or in
spirit, on those afflicted by poverty, loneliness, marginalization or
ignorance. May all people, civic leaders and ordinary citizens, always
act in accordance with the demands of justice and with respect for the
dignity of each person, so that in this way peace may be reinforced.
Beloved Juan Diego, "the talking eagle"! Show us the way that leads to
the "Dark Virgin" of Tepeyac, that she may receive us in the depths of
her heart, for she is the loving, compassionate Mother who guides us to
the true God. Amen.
RESPONSORY          See 1 Cor 1:27-29; Lk 1:51-5
God chose the weak of the world to shame the strong,
and even those who count for nothing
- so that no human being might boast before God.

He has shown might with his arm,
and lifted up the lowly.
- so that no human being might boast before God.
COLLECT
O God, who by means of Saint Juan Diego showed
the love of the most holy Virgin Mary for your people,
grant, through his intercession,
that, by following the counsels our Mother gave at Guadalupe,
we may be ever constant in fulfilling your will.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
