FIRST READING          Proverbs 31:10-13,19-20,30-31
When one finds a worthy wife,
her value is far beyond pearls.
Her husband, entrusting his heart to her,
has an unfailing prize.
She brings him good, and not evil,
all the days of her life.
She obtains wool and flax
and makes cloth with skillful hands.
She puts her hands to the distaff,
and her fingers ply the spindle.
She reaches out her hands to the poor,
and extends her arms to the needy.
Charm is deceptive and beauty fleeting;
the woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
Give her a reward of her labors,
and let her works praise her at the city gates.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 131:1bcde, 2, 3
Custodi te, animam meam in pace apud, Domine.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
O LORD, my heart is not proud,
nor are my eyes haughty;
I busy not myself with great things,
nor with things too sublime for me.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
Nay rather, I have stilled and quieted
my soul like a weaned child.
Like a weaned child on its mother's lap,
so is my soul within me.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
O Israel, hope in the LORD,
both now and forever.
R. In you, O Lord, I have found my peace.
ALLELUIA          John 8:31b-32
Si manseritis in sermone meo, vere discipuli mei estis, et cognoscetis
veritatem, dicit Dominus.
If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples,
and you will know the truth, says the Lord.
GOSPEL          Mark 3:31-35
The mother of Jesus and his brothers arrived at the house.
Standing outside, they sent word to Jesus and called him.
A crowd seated around him told him,
�Your mother and your brothers and your sisters
are outside asking for you.�
But he said to them in reply,
�Who are my mother and my brothers?�
And looking around at those seated in the circle he said,
�Here are my mother and my brothers.
For whoever does the will of God
is my brother and sister and mother.�

SECOND READING
From The Memoirs by the secretary of St. Jane Frances de Chantal
Love is as strong as death

One day Saint Jane spoke the following eloquent words, which listeners
took down exactly as spoken:

"My dear daughters, many of our holy fathers in the faith, men who were
pillars of the Church, did not die martyrs. Why do you think this was?"
Each one present offered an answer; then their mother continued. "Well,
I myself think it was because there is another martyrdom: the martyrdom
of love. Here God keeps his servants and handmaids in this present life
so that they may labor for him, and he makes of them both martyrs and
confessors. I know," she added, "that the Daughters of the Visitation
are meant to be martyrs of this kind, and that, by the favor of God,
some of them, more fortunate than others in that their desire has been
granted, will actually suffer such a martyrdom."

One sister asked what form this martyrdom took. The saint answered:
"Yield yourself fully to God, and you will find out! Divine love takes
its sword to the hidden recesses of our inmost soul and divides us from
ourselves. I know one person whom love cut off from all that was
dearest to her, just as completely and effectively as if a tyrant's
blade had severed spirit from body."

We realized that she was speaking of herself. When another sister asked
how long the martyrdom would continue, the Saint replied: "From the
moment when we commit ourselves unreservedly to God, until our last
breath. I am speaking, of course, of great-souled individuals who keep
nothing back for themselves, but instead are faithful in love. Our Lord
does not intend this martyrdom for those who are weak in love and
perseverance. Such people he lets continue on their mediocre way, so
that they will not be lost to him; he never does violence to our free
will."

Finally, the saint was asked whether this martyrdom of love could be
put on the same level as martyrdom of the body. She answered: "We
should not worry about equality. I do think, however, that the
martyrdom of love cannot be relegated to a second place, for love is as
strong as death. For the martyrs of love suffer infinitely more in
remaining in this life so as to serve God, than if they died a thousand
times over in testimony to their faith and love and fidelity."
