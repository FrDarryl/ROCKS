ENTRANCE ANTIPHON
Salve, sancta Parens, enixa puerpera Regam, qui caelum terramque regit
in saecula saeculorum.
Hail, Holy Mother, who gave birth to the King,
who rules heaven and earth for ever.
Or:          Is 9: 1, 5; Lk 1: 33
Lux fulgebit hodie super nos: quia natus est nobis Dominus: et
vocabitur admirabilis, Deus, Princeps pacis, Pater futuri saeculi:
cuius regni non erit finis.
Today a light will shine upon us, for the Lord is born for us;
and he will be called Wondrous God,
Prince of peace, Father of future ages:
and his reign will be without end.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui salutis aeternae, beatae Mariae virginitate fecunda, humano
generi praemia praestitisti, tribue, quaesumus, ut ipsam pro nobis
intercedere sentiamus, per quam meruimus Filium tuum auctorem vitae
suscipere.
O God, who through the fruitful virginity of Blessed Mary
bestowed on the human race
the grace of eternal salvation,
grant, we pray,
that we may experience the intercession of her,
through whom we were found worthy
to receive the author of life,
our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Numbers 6:22-27
The LORD said to Moses:
“Speak to Aaron and his sons and tell them:
This is how you shall bless the Israelites.
Say to them:
The LORD bless you and keep you!
The LORD let his face shine upon
you, and be gracious to you!
The LORD look upon you kindly and
give you peace!
So shall they invoke my name upon the Israelites,
and I will bless them.”
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          67:2-3, 5, 6, 8
Deus miseratur nostri, et benedicat nobis.
R. (2a) May God bless us in his mercy.
May God have pity on us and bless us;
may he let his face shine upon us.
So may your way be known upon earth;
among all nations, your salvation.
R. May God bless us in his mercy.
May the nations be glad and exult
because you rule the peoples in equity;
the nations on the earth you guide.
R. May God bless us in his mercy.
May the peoples praise you, O God;
may all the peoples praise you!
May God bless us,
and may all the ends of the earth fear him!
R. May God bless us in his mercy.
SECOND READING          Galatians 4:4-7
Brothers and sisters:
When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son,
born of a woman, born under the law,
to ransom those under the law,
so that we might receive adoption as sons.
As proof that you are sons,
God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
crying out, “Abba, Father!”
So you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son then also an heir,
through God.
ALLELUIA          Hebrews 1:1-2
Multifariam olim Deus locutus patribus in prophetis, in novissimis his
diebus locutus est nobis in Filio.
In the past, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets;
in these last days, he has spoken to us through the Son.
GOSPEL          Luke 2:16-21
The shepherds went in haste to Bethlehem and found Mary and Joseph,
and the infant lying in the manger.
When they saw this,
they made known the message
that had been told them about this child.
All who heard it were amazed
by what had been told them by the shepherds.
And Mary kept all these things,
reflecting on them in her heart.
Then the shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God
for all they had heard and seen,
just as it had been told to them.

When eight days were completed for his circumcision,
he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel
before he was conceived in the womb.
The CREED is said.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Deus, qui bona cuncta inchoas benignus et perficis, da nobis, de
sollemnitate sanctae Dei Genetricis laetantibus, sicut de initiis tuae
gratiae gloriamur ita de perfectione gaudere.
O God, who in your kindness begin all good things
and bring them to fulfillment,
grant to us, who find joy in the Solemnity of the holy Mother of God,
that, just as we glory in the beginnings of your grace,
so one day we may rejoice in its completion.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE I OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY           (on the Solemnity of the
Motherhood)
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus: Et
te in ... beatae Mariae semper Virginis collaudare, benedicere et
praedicare. Quae et Unigenitum tuum Sancti Spiritus obumbratione
concepit, et, virginitatis gloria permanente, lumen aeternum mundo
effudit, Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Per quem maiestatem tuam
laudant Angeli, adorant Dominationes, tremunt Potestates. Caeli
caelorumque Virtutes, ac beata Seraphim, socia exsultatione
concelebrant. Cum quibus et nostras voces ut admitti iubeas,
deprecamur, supplici confessione dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
and praise, bless and glorify your name
on the Solemnity of the Motherhood
of the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary.

For by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit,
she conceived your Only Begotten Son,
and without losing the glory of virginity,
brought forth into the world the eternal Light,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in humble praise as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hosts...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Heb 13: 8
Iesus Christus heri et hodie; ipse et in saecula.
Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday, today, and for ever.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Sumpsimus, Domine, laeti sacramenta caelestia: praesta, quaesumus, ut
ad vitam nobis proficiant sempiternam, qui beatam semper Virginem
Mariam Filii tui Genetricem et Ecclesiae Matrem profiteri gloriamur.
We have received this heavenly Sacrament with joy, O Lord:
grant, we pray,
that it may lead us to eternal life,
for we rejoice to proclaim the blessed ever-Virgin Mary
Mother of your Son and Mother of the Church.
Through Christ our Lord.
SOLEMN BLESSING
May God, who through the childbearing of the Blessed Virgin Mary
willed in his great kindness to redeem the human race,
be pleased to enrich you with his blessing.
Amen.

May you know always and everywhere the protection of her,
through whom you have been found worthy to receive the author of life.
Amen.

May you, who have devoutly gathered on this day,
carry away with you the gifts of spiritual joys and heavenly
rewards.
Amen.

And may the blessing of almighty God,
the Father, and the Son, † and the Holy Spirit,
come down on you and remain with you for ever.
Amen.
