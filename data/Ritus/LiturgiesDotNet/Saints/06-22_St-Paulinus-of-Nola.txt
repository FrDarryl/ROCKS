COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Paulinum episcopum paupertatis amore et pastorali
sollicitudine clarescere voluisti, concede propitius, ut, cuius merita
celebramus, caritatis imitemur exempla.
O God, who made the Bishop Saint Paulinus of Nola
outstanding for love of poverty and for pastoral care,
graciously grant that, as we celebrate his merits,
we may imitate the example of his charity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 8:9-15
Brothers and sister: You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that by his
poverty you might become rich. And in this matter I give my advice: it
is best for you now to complete what a year ago you began not only to
do but to desire, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched
by your completing it out of what you have. For if the readiness is
there, it is acceptable according to what a man has, not according to
what he has not. I do not mean that others should be eased and you
burdened, but that as a matter of equality your abundance at the
present time should supply their want, so that their abundance may
supply your want, that there may be equality. As it is written, "He who
gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no
lack."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          40:2; 4ab,7-8a,8b-9,10-11
R. (8a and 9a)  Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD,
and he stooped toward me.
And he put a new song into my mouth,
a hymn to our God.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,
but ears open to obedience you gave me.
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;
then said I, �Behold I come.�
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly;
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart;
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of;
I have made no secret of your kindness and your truth
in the vast assembly.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:3
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Luke 12:32-34
Jesus said to his disciples: "Fear not, little flock, for it is your
Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions,
and give alms; provide yourselves with purses that do not grow old,
with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief
approaches and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also."

SECOND READING
From a letter by Saint Paulinus of Nola, bishop
(Epist. 3 ad Alypium, 1.5.6: CSEL 29, 13-14, 17-18)
God everywhere produces his love in his people through the Holy Spirit
You have shown, my lord, that you bear within you true charity and
perfect love toward my humble person. Truly holy and deservedly
blessed, you are a most desirable friend, for my cousin Julian on his
return from Carthage delivered the letter which conveyed to us the
shining light of your sanctity. As a result it seems to me that I am
not just now coming to know your love for me but rather recognizing it
as something I was already aware of. For clearly this love of yours
came forth from the one who predestined us for himself from the
foundation of the world. In him, the maker of all that is to be, we
were made before we were born, because he made us and not we ourselves.
Shaped by his work and his foreknowledge, then, we were already joined
by charity into a likeness of wills and a union of faith, or a faith of
unity, that anticipated our present acquaintance. So before we met in
person, we became known to each other in the revelation of the Spirit.

Hence I give thanks and boast in the Lord, who, one and the same
throughout the world, produces his love in his people through the Holy
Spirit whom he pours out upon all flesh. With the flow of the river he
gladdens his city among whose citizens he rightly established you to be
the first among the princes of his people in your apostolic see.
Likewise, he wanted me, whom he raised up when I was downtrodden, and
lifted up from the earth when I was destitute, to be numbered among
your associates. But I am more grateful for that gift of the Lord by
which he established a place for me in your heart and allowed me so to
penetrate your affections that I might claim a personal trust in your
love. Moved by such kindnesses and gifts, I could not love you in a
merely casual or negligent way.

But you should know everything about me and you should be aware that I
am a sinner of long standing, it is not so long ago that I was led out
of darkness and the shadow of death; only recently have I begun to
breathe in the air of life; only recently have I put my hand to the
plough and taken up the cross of Christ. I need to be helped by your
prayers to persevere to the end. And if you should lighten my burden by
your intercession, this is the reward that will be added on to your
merits, for the holy man who helps a laborer (I dare not call myself a
brother) will be exalted like a great city.

We have sent to you a loaf of bread in token of our unity; it
symbolizes as well the substance of the Trinity. By accepting it you
will make it a bread of blessing.
RESPONSORY          Sirach 31:8,11,10
Blessed is the man who is found without fault,
who does not make gold his life's object,
who does not put his trust in wealth.
- His future will be secure in the Lord.

He was able to sin, but did not;
he was able to do wrong, but would not.
- His future will be secure in the Lord.
