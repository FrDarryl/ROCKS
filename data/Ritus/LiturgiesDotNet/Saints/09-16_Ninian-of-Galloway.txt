The Collect
O God, by the preaching of your blessed servant and bishop Ninian you
caused the light of the Gospel to shine in the land of Britain: Grant,
we pray, that having his life and labors in remembrance we may show our
thankfulness by following the example of his zeal and patience; through
Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
Spirit, God, for ever and ever. Amen.

First Reading
Isaiah 49:1-6

Listen to me, O coastlands,
pay attention, you peoples from far away!
The LORD called me before I was born,
while I was in my mother's womb he named me.
He made my mouth like a sharp sword,
in the shadow of his hand he hid me;
he made me a polished arrow,
in his quiver he hid me away.
And he said to me, "You are my servant,
Israel, in whom I will be glorified."
But I said, "I have labored in vain,
I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;
yet surely my cause is with the LORD,
and my reward with my God."
And now the LORD says,
who formed me in the womb to be his servant,
to bring Jacob back to him,
and that Israel might be gathered to him,
for I am honored in the sight of the LORD,
and my God has become my strength--
he says,
"It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
to raise up the tribes of Jacob
and to restore the survivors of Israel;
I will give you as a light to the nations,
that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth."

The Psalm

Psalm 97:1-2,7-12
Dominus regnavit

1
The LORD is King;
let the earth rejoice; *
let the multitude of the isles be glad.

2
Clouds and darkness are round about him, *
righteousness and justice are the foundations of his
throne.

7
Confounded be all who worship carved images
and delight in false gods! *
Bow down before him, all you gods.

8
Zion hears and is glad, and the cities of Judah rejoice, *
because of your judgments, O LORD.

9
For you are the LORD,
most high over all the earth; *
you are exalted far above all gods.

10
The LORD loves those who hate evil; *
he preserves the lives of his saints
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

11
Light has sprung up for the righteous, *
and joyful gladness for those who are truehearted.

12
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, *
and give thanks to his holy Name.

or
Psalm 96:1-7
Cantate Domino

1
Sing to the LORD a new song; *
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.

2
Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.

3
Declare his glory among the nations *
and his wonders among all peoples.

4
For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *
he is more to be feared than all gods.

5
As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.

6
Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!

7
Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; *
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.

Gospel Reading
Matthew 28:16-20

Jesus said to his disciples, "Keep awake therefore, for you do not know
on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of
the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he
would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken
into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at
an unexpected hour.

The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus
had directed them. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some
doubted. And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and
on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have
commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the
age."
