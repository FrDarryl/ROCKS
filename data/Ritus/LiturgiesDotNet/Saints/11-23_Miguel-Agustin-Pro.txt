COLLECT
Our God and Father,
who conferred upon your servant Blessed Miguel Agustn Pro
the grace of ardently seeking your greater glory
and the salvation of others,
grant through his intercession and example,
that by faithfully and joyfully performing our daily duties
and effectively assisting those around us,
we may serve you with zeal
and ever seek your glory.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Sirach 51:1-8
I give you thanks, O God of my father;
I praise you, O God my savior!
I will make known your name, refuge of my life;
you have been my helper against my adversaries.
You have saved me from death,
and kept back my body from the pit,
From the clutches of the nether world you have snatched my feet;
you have delivered me, in your great mercy
From the scourge of a slanderous tongue,
and from lips that went over to falsehood;
From the snare of those who watched for my downfall,
and from the power of those who sought my life;
From many a danger you have saved me,
from flames that hemmed me in on every side;
From the midst of unremitting fire,
from the deep belly of the nether world;
From deceiving lips and painters of lies,
from the arrows of dishonest tongues.
I was at the point of death,
my soul was nearing the depths of the nether world;
I turned every way, but there was no one to help me,
I looked for one to sustain me, but could find no one.
But then I remembered the mercies of the Lord,
his kindness through ages past;
For he saves those who take refuge in him,
and rescues them from every evil.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
�The LORD has done great things for them.�
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Jas 1:12
Blessed is the man who perseveres in temptation,
for when he has been proved he will receive the crown of life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 10:28-33
Jesus said to his disciples:
"Do not be afraid of those who kill the body
but cannot kill the soul;
rather, be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in
Gehenna.
Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?
Yet not one of them falls to the ground
without your Father's knowledge.
Even all the hairs of your head are counted.
So do not be afraid;
you are worth more than many sparrows.
Everyone who acknowledges me before others
I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.
But whoever denies me before others,
I will deny before my heavenly Father.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Lord,
bless our offerings and make them holy.
May these Gifts fill our hearts
with the love which gave Blessed Miguel Agustn
victory over all his suffering.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Lord,
may the mysteries we receive
give us the spiritual courage which made your martyr Blessed Miguel
Agustn
faithful in your service and victorious in his suffering.
