Omnipotens sempiterna Deus,
qui sanctum Gregorium, magistrum et decus Armeni populi,
mystica doctrina imbuere dignatus es,
concede nobis, ipso docente,
artem tecum loquendi apprehendere
vitamque nostram Ecclesiae sacramentis constanter fulcire.
Per Dominum.
FIRST READING          Wisdom 7:7-10, 15-16
Therefore I prayed, and prudence was given me;
I pleaded and the spirit of Wisdom came to me.
I preferred her to scepter and throne,
And deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,
nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;
Because all gold, in view of her, is a bit of sand,
and before her, silver is to be accounted mire.
Beyond health and beauty I loved her,
And I chose to have her rather than the light,
because her radiance never ceases.

Now God grant I speak suitably
and value these endowments at their worth:
For he is the guide of Wisdom
and the director of the wise.
For both we and our words are in his hand,
as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           37:3-4, 5-6, 30-31
R. (30a) The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Trust in the LORD and do good
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the LORD,
and he will grant you your heart�s requests.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Commit to the LORD your way;
trust in him, and he will act.
He will make justice dawn for you like the light;
bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
The mouth of the just man tells of wisdom
and his tongue utters what is right.
The law of his God is in his heart,
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
GOSPEL ACCLAMATION          See John 6:63c, 68c (no. 729-3)
Your words, Lord, are Spirit and life;
you have the words of everlasting life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 7:21-29
"Not everyone who says to me, �Lord, Lord,� will enter the kingdom of
heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. Many
will say to me on that day, �Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your
name? Did we not drive out demons in your name? Did we not do mighty
deeds in your name?� Then I will declare to them solemnly, �I never
knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers.�
"Everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them will be
like a wise man who built his house on rock. The rain fell, the floods
came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house. But it did not
collapse; it had been set solidly on rock. And everyone who listens to
these words of mine but does not act on them will be like a fool who
built his house on sand. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds
blew and buffeted the house. And it collapsed and was completely
ruined."
When Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his
teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their
scribes.
