Deus, qui beatum Ioannem presbyterum ad annuntiandum investigabiles
Christi divitias mirabiliter elegisti, da nobis, eius exemplis et
monitis, ut, in tua scientia crescentes, secundum Evangelii lumen
fideliter conversemur.
O God, who wonderfully chose the Priest Saint John Eudes
to proclaim the unfathomable riches of Christ,
grant us, by his example and teachings,
that, growing in knowledge of you,
we may live faithfully by the light of the Gospel.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 3:14-19
Brothers and sisters:
I kneel before the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that he may grant you, in accord with the riches of his glory,
to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self,
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith;
that you, rooted and grounded in love,
may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM      Psalm 131:1bcde, 2, 3
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
O LORD, my heart is not proud,
nor are my eyes haughty;
I busy not myself with great things,
nor with things too sublime for me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
Nay rather, I have stilled and quieted
my soul like a weaned child.
Like a weaned child on its mother's lap,
so is my soul within me.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
O Israel, hope in the LORD,
both now and forever.
R. In you, Lord, I have found my peace.
ALLELUIA      See Mt 11:25
Blessed are you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth;
you have revealed to little ones the mysteries of the kingdom.
GOSPEL          Matthew 11:25-30
At that time Jesus answered:
"I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
for although you have hidden these things
from the wise and the learned
you have revealed them to the childlike.
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.
No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.
"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart;
and you will find rest for yourselves.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."

SECOND READING
From a treatise on the admirable Heart of Jesus by St. John Eudes,
priest
(Lib 1, 5: Opera omnia 6, 107, 113-115)

The source of salvation and true life

I ask you to consider that our Lord Jesus Christ is your true head and
that you are a member of his body. He belongs to you as the head
belongs to the body. All that is his is yours; breath, heart, body,
soul and all his qualities. All of these you must use as if they
belonged to you, so that in serving him you may give him praise, love
and glory. You belong to him as a member belongs to the head. This is
why he earnestly desires you serve and glorify the Father by using all
our faculties as if they were his.

He belongs to you, but more than that, he longs to be in you, living
and ruling in you, as the head lives and rules in the body. He desires
that whatever is in him may live and rule in you: his breath in your
breath, his heart in your heart , all the faculties of his soul in the
faculties of your soul, so that these words may be fulfilled in you:
Glorify God and bear him in your body, so that the life of Jesus may be
made manifest in you.

You belong to the Son of God but more than that you ought to be in Him
as members are in the head. All that is in you must be incorporated
into him. You must receive life from him and be ruled by him. There
will be no true life for you except in him, for he is the one source of
true life. Apart from him you will find only death and destruction. Let
him be the only source of your movements, of the actions and the
strength of your life.

He must be both the source and the purpose of your life, so that you
may fulfil these words: None of us lives as his own master and none of
us dies as his own master. While we live, we are responsible to the
Lord, and when we die we die as his servants. Both in life and death we
are the Lord’s. That is why Christ died and came to life again, so that
he may be Lord of both the dead and the living.

Finally you are one with Jesus as the body is one with the head. You
must then have one breath with him, one soul, one life, one will, one
mind, one heart, And he must be your breath, heart, love, life, your
all. These great gifts in the follower of Christ originate from
baptism. They are increased and strengthened through confirmation and
making good use of other graces that are given by God. Through the holy
eucharist they are brought to perfection.
RESPONSORY        Romans 14:9
Christ died and rose to life,
that he might be the Lord of the living and the dead.
- Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
None of us lives just for himself,
and none of us dies for himself alone.
- Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
