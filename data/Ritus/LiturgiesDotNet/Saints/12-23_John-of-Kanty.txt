From the Common of Pastors: For One Pastor
COLLECT
Da, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut, exemplo beati Ioannis presbyteri,
in sanctorum scientia procedamus, atque, misericordiam omnibus
exhibentes, apud te indulgentiam consequamur.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that by the example of the Priest Saint John of Kanty
we may advance in knowledge of holy things
and by showing compassion to all,
may gain forgiveness in your sight.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          James 2:14-17
What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
if someone says he has faith but does not have works?
Can that faith save him?
If a brother or sister has nothing to wear
and has no food for the day,
and one of you says to them,
"Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well,"
but you do not give them the necessities of the body,
what good is it?
So also faith of itself,
if it does not have works, is dead.

ALLELUIA          John 13:34

dilexi vos.
I give you a new commandment:
Love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          Luke 6:27-38
Jesus said to his disciples:
"To you who hear I say,
love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
To the person who strikes you on one cheek,
offer the other one as well,
and from the person who takes your cloak,
do not withhold even your tunic.
Give to everyone who asks of you,
and from the one who takes what is yours do not demand it back.
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
For if you love those who love you,
what credit is that to you?
Even sinners love those who love them.
And if you do good to those who do good to you,
what credit is that to you?
Even sinners do the same.
If you lend money to those from whom you expect repayment,
what credit is that to you?
Even sinners lend to sinners,
and get back the same amount.
But rather, love your enemies and do good to them,
and lend expecting nothing back;
then your reward will be great
and you will be children of the Most High,
for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.
Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
"Stop judging and you will not be judged.
Stop condemning and you will not be condemned.
Forgive and you will be forgiven.
Give and gifts will be given to you;
a good measure, packed together, shaken down, and overflowing,
will be poured into your lap.
For the measure with which you measure
will in return be measured out to you."

John of Kanty

The Office of Readings
SECOND READING
From a Letter by Pope Clement XIII
(2 Febr. 1767, Bullarii romani continuatio, IV, pars. II, Pratis 1843,
pp. 1314-1316.)

In heart and speech he was attuned to God

St. John of Kanty deserves a high place among the great saints and
scholars who practice what they preach and defend the true faith
against those who attack it. When heresy and schism were gaining ground
in neighboring territories, his teaching at the University of Krakow
was untainted by any error. At the pulpit he fought to raise the
standard of holiness among the faithful, and his preaching was
reinforced by his humility, his chastity, his sympathy, his bodily
penance, and the other qualities of a dedicated priest and Emissary.

He was a unique contribution to the reputation and credit of the
professors of the university; he also bequeathed a wonderful example to
those of his profession, an inspiration of complete dedication to duty
and to their teaching�in theology and other sciences�for the honor and
glory of the one God.

With the sense of worship that he brought to his teaching of the sacred
sciences, he combined humility. He never put himself above anyone else,
and treated himself as not mattering, even though he was acknowledged
by everyone as their master. He was so far from pretenses that he even
wished to be an object of contempt in the eyes of everyone who
underestimated his worth. He could take their insults and cutting
remarks in stride.

With his humility went a rare and childlike simplicity; the thoughts of
his heart were revealed in his words and actions. If he suspected that
someone had felt insulted by his speaking the truth, before going to
the altar, he would ask forgiveness for what was not so much his own
sin as the other person�s misunderstanding. Every day after his round
of duties, he would go straight from the lecture room to church, where
he would spend long hours in contemplation and prayer before the hidden
Prince of the eucharist. The God in his heart and the God on his lips
were one and the same God.
RESPONSORY      Isaiah 58:7-8
Share your bread with the hungry
and take the poor and homeless into your own house.
- Then your light will break forth like the dawn,
and your holiness will go before you.

When you see a man who is naked, clothe him,
and do not scorn your brother.
- Then your light will break forth like the dawn,
and your holiness will go before you.
