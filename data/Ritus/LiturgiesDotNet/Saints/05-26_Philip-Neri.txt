Brothers and sisters:
Rejoice in the Lord always.
I shall say it again: rejoice!
Your kindness should be known to all.
The Lord is near.
Have no anxiety at all, but in everything,
by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving,
make your requests known to God.
Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding
will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

Finally, brothers and sisters,
whatever is true, whatever is honorable,
whatever is just, whatever is pure,
whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious,
if there is any excellence
and if there is anything worthy of praise,
think about these things.
Keep on doing what you have learned and received
and heard and seen in me.
Then the God of peace will be with you

Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said:
"Holy Father, I pray not only for these,
but also for those who will believe in me through their word,
so that they may all be one,
as you, Father, are in me and I in you,
that they also may be in us,
that the world may believe that you sent me.
And I have given them the glory you gave me,
so that they may be one, as we are one,
I in them and you in me,
that they may be brought to perfection as one,
that the world may know that you sent me,
and that you loved them even as you loved me.
Father, they are your gift to me.
I wish that where I am they also may be with me,
that they may see my glory that you gave me,
because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
Righteous Father, the world also does not know you,
but I know you, and they know that you sent me.
I made known to them your name and I will make it known,
that the love with which you loved me
may be in them and I in them."

SECOND READING
From a sermon by Saint Augustine, bishop
(Sermo 171,103,5; PL 38, 933-935)

Rejoice in the Lord always

The Apostle tells us to rejoice, but in the Lord, not in the world.
Whoever wishes to be a friend of this world, says Scripture, will be
reckoned an enemy of God. As a man cannot serve two masters, so one
cannot rejoice both in the world and in the Lord.

Let joy in the Lord prevail, then, until joy in the world is no more.
Let joy in the Lord go on increasing; let joy in the world go on
decreasing until it is no more. This is said, not because we are not to
rejoice while we are in this world, but in order that, even while we
are still in this world, we may already rejoice in the Lord.

You may object: I am in the world; if I rejoice I certainly rejoice
where I am. What is this? Do you mean that because you are in the world
you are not in the Lord? Listen again to the Apostle, speaking now to
the Athenians: in the Acts of the Apostles he says this is of God and
the Lord our creator: In him we live and move and have our being. If he
is everywhere, where is he not? Surely this was what he was exhorting
us to realize. The Lord is near, do not be anxious about anything.

This is a great truth, that he ascended above all the heavens, yet is
near to those on earth. Who is this stranger and neighbor if not the
one who became our neighbor out of compassion?

The man lying on the road, left half-dead by robbers, the man treated
with contempt by the priest and the levite who passed by, the man
approached by the passing Samaritan to take care of him and help him,
that man is the whole human race. When the immortal one, the holy one,
was far removed from us because we were mortal and sinners, he came
down to us, so that he, the stranger, might become our neighbor.

He did not treat us as our sins deserved. For we are now sons of God.
How do we show this? The only Son of God died for us, so that he might
not remain alone. He who died as the only Son did not want to remain as
the only Son. For the only Son of God made many sons of God. he bought
brothers for himself by his blood; he made them welcome by being
rejected; he ransomed them by being sold; he honored them by being
dishonored; he gave them life by being put to death.

So, brethren, rejoice in the Lord, not in the world. That is, rejoice
in the truth, not in wickedness; rejoice in the hope of eternity, not
in the fading flower of vanity. That is the way to rejoice. Wherever
you are on earth, however long you remain on earth, the Lord is near,
do not be anxious about anything.
RESPONSORY        2 Corinthians 13:11; Romans 15:13
Rejoice, brothers.
Strive for perfection;
encourage one another.
Live in harmony and peace,
- and the God of peace and love will be with you.

May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
through your faith in him.
- and the God of peace and love will be with you.
COLLECT
O God, who never cease to bestow the glory of holiness
on the faithful servants you raise up for yourself,
graciously grant
that the Holy Spirit may kindle in us that fire
with which he wonderfully filled
the heart of Saint Philip Neri.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
