ENTRANCE ANTIPHON
Haec est virgo sapiens, et una de numero prudentum, quae obviam Christo
cum lampade accensa exiit, alleluia.
Here is a wise virgin, from among the number of the prudent,
who went forth with lighted lamp to meet Christ, alleluia.
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatam Catharinam in contemplatione Dominicae Passionis et in
Ecclesiae tuae servitio divino amore flagrare fecisti, ipsius
intercessione concede, ut populus tuus, Christi mysterio sociatus, in
eius gloriae revelatione semper exsultet.
O God, who set Saint Catherine of Siena on fire with divine love
in her contemplation of the Lord's Passion
and her service of your Church,
grant, through her intercession,
that your people,
participating in the mystery of Christ,
may ever exult in the revelation of his glory.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 1:5-2:2
Beloved:
This is the message that we have heard from Jesus Christ
and proclaim to you:
God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all.
If we say, �We have fellowship with him,�
while we continue to walk in darkness,
we lie and do not act in truth.
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light,
then we have fellowship with one another,
and the Blood of his Son Jesus cleanses us from all sin.
If we say, �We are without sin,�
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just
and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
If we say, �We have not sinned,� we make him a liar,
and his word is not in us.

My children, I am writing this to you
so that you may not commit sin.
But if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous one.
He is expiation for our sins,
and not for our sins only but for those of the whole world.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          103:1-2, 3-4, 8-9, 13-14, 17-18
Benedic anima mea Domino.
R. (1) O bless the Lord, my soul!
Bless the LORD, O my soul;
and all my being, bless his holy name!
Bless the LORD, O my soul;
and forget not all his benefits.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
He pardons all your iniquities,
he heals all your ills.
He redeems your life from destruction,
he crowns you with kindness and compassion.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
Merciful and gracious is the LORD,
slow to anger and abounding in kindness.
He will not always chide,
nor does he keep his wrath forever.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
As a father has compassion on his children,
so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him,
For he knows how we are formed;
he remembers that we are dust.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
But the kindness of the LORD is from eternity
to eternity toward those who fear him,
And his justice toward his children's children
among those who keep his covenant.
R. O bless the Lord, my soul!
ALLELUIA          Cf. Matthew 11:25
Benedictus es, Pater, Domine caeli et terrae, quia mysteria regni
parvula revelasti.
Blessed are you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth;
you have revealed to little ones the mysteries of the Kingdom.
GOSPEL          Matthew 11:25-30
At that time Jesus responded:
"I give praise to you, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth,
for although you have hidden these things
from the wise and the learned
you have revealed them to the childlike.
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.
No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him."
"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart;
and you will find rest for yourselves.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, Domine, quam in beatae Catharinae commemoratione offerimus
hostiam salutarem, ut, illius monitis eruditi, tibi vero Deo ferventius
gratias agere valeamus.
Accept, O Lord, the saving sacrifice we offer
in commemoration of Saint Catherine,
so that, instructed by her teaching,
we may give ever more fervent thanks
to you, the one true God.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. i Jn 1:7
Si in luce ambulamus, sicut Deus est in luce, societatem habemus ad
invicem, et sanguis Iesu Christi, Filii eius, emundat nos ab omni
peccato, alleluia.
If we walk in the light, as God is in the light,
then we have fellowship with one another,
and the blood of his Son Jesus Christ
cleanses us from all sin, alleluia.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Aeternitatem nobis, Domine, conferat, qua pasti sumus, mensa caelestis,
quae beatae Catharinae vitam etiam aluit temporalem.
May the heavenly table
at which we have been fed, O Lord,
confer eternal life upon us,
as even in this world
it nourished the life of Saint Catherine.
Through Christ our Lord.

Office of Readings

From the dialogue On Divine Providence by Saint Catherine of Siena
(Cap 167, Gratiarum actio ad Trinitatem)
I tasted and I saw
Eternal God, eternal Trinity, you have made the blood of Christ so
precious through his sharing in your divine nature. You are a mystery
as deep as the sea; the more I search, the more I find, and the more I
find the more I search for you. But I can never be satisfied; what I
receive will ever leave me desiring more. When you fill my soul I have
an even greater hunger, and I grow more famished for your light. I
desire above all to see you, the true light, as you really are.

I have tasted and seen the depth of your mystery and the beauty of your
creation with the light of my understanding. I have clothed myself with
your likeness and have seen what I shall be. Eternal Father, you have
given me a share in your power and the wisdom that Christ claims as his
own, and your Holy Spirit has given me the desire to love you. You are
my Creator, eternal Trinity, and I am your creature. You have made of
me a new creation in the blood of your Son, and I know that you are
moved with love at the beauty of your creation, for you have
enlightened me.

Eternal Trinity, Godhead, mystery deep as the sea, you could give me no
greater gift than the gift of yourself. For you are a fire ever burning
and never consumed, which itself consumes all the selfish love that
fills my being. Yes, you are a fire that takes away the coldness,
illuminates the mind with its light and causes me to know your truth.
By this light, reflected as it were in a mirror, I recognise that you
are the highest good, one we can neither comprehend nor fathom. And I
know that you are beauty and wisdom itself. The food of angels, you
gave yourself to man in the fire of your love.

You are the garment which covers our nakedness, and in our hunger you
are a satisfying food, for you are sweetness and in you there is no
taste of bitterness, O triune God!
RESPONSORY
My sister and my beloved, open yourself to me,
you are a coheir of my kingdom
and you have understood the hidden mysteries of my truth.
- You are enriched with the gift of my Spirit,
cleansed of all sin by the shedding of my blood, alleluia.
Go forth from the quiet of contemplation
and courageously bear witness to my truth.
- You are enriched with the gift of my Spirit,
cleansed of all sin by the shedding of my blood, alleluia.
COLLECT
O God, who set Saint Catherine of Siena on fire with divine love
in her contemplation of the Lord's Passion
and her service of your Church,
grant, through her intercession,
that your people,
participating in the mystery of Christ,
may ever exult in the revelation of his glory.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
