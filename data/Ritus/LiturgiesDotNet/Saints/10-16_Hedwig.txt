Concede, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut veneranda nobis beatae Hedvigis
intercessio tribuat caeleste subsidium, cuius vita mirabilis omnibus
humilitatis praestat exemplum.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that the revered intercession of Saint Hedwig
may bring us heavenly aid,
just as her wonderful life
is an example of humility for all.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Sirach 26: 1-4, 16-21
Blessed the husband of a good wife,
twice-lengthened are his days;
A worthy wife brings joy to her husband,
peaceful and full is his life.
A good wife is a generous gift
bestowed upon him who fears the LORD;
Be he rich or poor, his heart is content,
and a smile is ever on his face.

A gracious wife delights her husband,
her thoughtfulness puts flesh on his bones;
A gift from the LORD is her governed speech,
and her firm virtue is of surpassing worth.
Choicest of blessings is a modest wife,
priceless her chaste soul.
A holy and decent woman adds grace upon grace;
indeed, no price is worthy of her temperate soul.
Like the sun rising in the LORD's heavens,
the beauty of a virtuous wife is the radiance of her home.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          128:1-2, 3, 4-5
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
Blessed are you who fear the LORD,
who walk in his ways!
For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork;
blessed shall you be, and favored.
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine
in the recesses of your home;
your children like olive plants
around your table.
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
Behold, thus is the man blessed
who fears the LORD.
The LORD bless you from Zion:
may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
all the days of your life.
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
ALLELUIA          John 8:31b-32
Si manseritis in sermone meo, vere discipuli mei estis, et cognoscetis
veritatem, dicit Dominus.
If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples,
and you will know the truth, says the Lord.
GOSPEL          Mark 3:31-35
Jesus' mother and his brothers arrived.
Standing outside, they sent word to him and called him.
A crowd seated around him told him,
"Your mother and your brothers and your sisters
are outside asking for you."
But he said to them in reply,
"Who are my mother and my brothers?"
And looking around at those seated in the circle he said,
"Here are my mother and my brothers.
For whoever does the will of God
is my brother and sister and mother."

SECOND READING
From the life of Saint Hedwig by a contemporary author
(Acta Sanctorum Octobria 8 , 201-202a)
She Was Always Directed Towards God
Hedwig knew that those living stones that were to be placed in the
building of the heavenly Jerusalem had to be smoothed out by buffetings
and pressures in this world, and that many tribulations would be needed
before she could cross over into the glory of her heavenly homeland.
And so she exposed herself completely to the waters of suffering and
continually exhausted her body with rigorous chastisement. Because of
such great daily fasts and abstinences she grew so thin that many
wondered how such a feeble and delicate woman could endure these
torments.

She afflicted herself with continual mortification of the flesh, but
she did so with prudent discretion. The more attentively she kept
watch, the more she grew in the strength of the spirit and in grace,
and the more the fire of devotion and divine love blazed within her.
She was often borne aloft with such ardent desire and impelled toward
God that she would no longer be aware of the things that were around
her.

Just as her devotion made her always seek after God, so her generous
piety turned her toward her neighbor, and she bountifully bestowed alms
on the needy. She gave aid to colleges and to religious persons
dwelling within or outside monasteries, to widows and orphans, to the
weak and the feeble, to leers and those bound in chains or imprisoned,
to travelers and needy women nursing infants. She allowed no one who
came to her for help to go away uncomforted.

And because this servant of God never neglected the practice of all
good works, God also conferred on her such grace that when she lacked
human means to do good, and her own powers failed, the divine power of
the sufferings of Christ strengthened her to respond to the needs of
her neighbors. And so through diving favor she had the power to relieve
the bodily and spiritual troubles of all who sought her help.
RESPONSORY          Cf. Proverbs 31:17-18
She set herself to work with courage;
she put forth all her strength;
- therefore her lamp will never go out.
She has discovered how good it is
to work for the God of wisdom.
- Therefore her lamp will never go out.
