Deus, qui beatum Raimundum presbyterum insignis in peccatores et in
captivos misericordiae virtute decorasti, eius nobis intercessione
concede, ut, a peccati servitute soluti, quae tibi sunt placita liberis
mentibus exsequamur.
O God, who adorned the Priest Saint Raymond
with the virtue of outstanding mercy and compassion
for sinners and for captives,
grant us, through his intercession,
that, released from slavery to sin,
we may carry out in freedom of spirit
what is pleasing to you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 5:14-20
Brothers and sisters:
The love of Christ impels us.
once we have come to the conviction that one died for all;
therefore, all have died.
He indeed died for all,
so that those who live might no longer live for themselves
but for him who for their sake died and was raised.

Consequently, from now on we regard no one according to the flesh;
even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh,
yet now we know him so no longer.
So whoever is in Christ is a new creation:
the old things have passed away;
behold, new things have come.
And all this is from God,
who has reconciled us to himself through Christ
and given us the ministry of reconciliation,
namely, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,
not counting their trespasses against them
and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
So we are ambassadors for Christ,
as if God were appealing through us.
We implore you on behalf of Christ,
be reconciled to God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 103:1bc-2, 3-4, 8-9,13-14,17-18
R. (1) O, bless the Lord, my soul!
Bless the LORD, O my soul;
and all my being, bless his holy name.
Bless the LORD, O my soul,
and forget not all his benefits.
R. O, bless the Lord, my soul!
He pardons all your iniquities,
heals all your ills,
He redeems your life from destruction,
crowns you with kindness and compassion.
R. O, bless the Lord, my soul!
Merciful and gracious is the LORD,
slow to anger and abounding in kindness.
He will not always chide,
nor does he keep his wrath forever.
R. O, bless the Lord, my soul!
As a father has compassion on his children,
so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him,
For he knows how we are formed;
he remembers that we are dust.
R. O, bless the Lord, my soul!
But the kindness of the LORD is from eternity
to eternity toward those who fear him,
And his justice toward his children's children
among those who keep his covenant.
R. O, bless the Lord, my soul!
ALLELUIA
Be vigilant at all times and pray
that you may have the strength to stand before the Son of Man.
GOSPEL          Luke 12:35-40
Jesus said to his disciples:
�Gird your loins and light your lamps
and be like servants who await their master's return from a wedding,
ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.
Blessed are those servants
whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival.
Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself,
have them recline at table, and proceed to wait on them.
And should he come in the second or third watch
and find them prepared in this way,
blessed are those servants.
Be sure of this:
if the master of the house had known the hour
when the thief was coming,
he would not have let his house be broken into.
You also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect,
the Son of Man will come.�

SECOND READING
From a letter by St Raymond Penyafort, priest
(Monumenta Ord. Praed. Hist. 6, 2, Romae 1901, pp 84-85)
May the God of love and peace set your hearts at rest
The preacher of God�s truth has told us that all who want to live
righteously in Christ will suffer persecution. If he spoke the truth
and did not lie, the only exception to this general statement is, I
think, the person who either neglects, or does not know how, to live
temperately, justly and righteously in this world.
May you never be numbered among those whose house is peaceful, quiet
and free from care; those on whom the Lord�s chastisement does not
descend; those who live out their days in prosperity, and in the
twinkling of an eye will go down to hell.
Your purity of life, your devotion, deserve and call for a reward;
because you are acceptable and pleasing to God your purity of life must
be made purer still, by frequent buffetings, until you attain perfect
sincerity of heart. If from time to time you feel the sword falling on
you with double or treble force, this also should be seen as sheer joy
and the mark of love.
The two-edged sword consists in conflict without, fears within. It
falls with double or treble force within, when the cunning spirit
troubles the depths of your heart with guile and enticements. You have
learned enough already about these kinds of warfare, or you would not
have been able to enjoy peace and interior tranquility in all its
beauty.
The sword falls with double and treble force externally when, without
cause being given, there breaks out from within the Church persecution
in spiritual matters, where wounds are more serious, especially when
inflicted by friends.
This is that enviable and blessed cross of Christ, which Andrew, that
manly saint, received with joyful heart: the cross in which alone we
must make our boast, as Paul, God�s chosen instrument, has told us.
Look then on Jesus, the author and preserver of faith: in complete
sinlessness he suffered, and at the hands of those who were his own,
and was numbered among the wicked. As you drink the cup of the Lord
Jesus (how glorious it is!), give thanks to the Lord, the giver of all
blessings.
May the God of love and peace set your hearts at rest and speed you on
your journey; may he meanwhile shelter you from disturbance by others
in the hidden recesses of his love, until he brings you at last into
that place of complete plenitude where you will repose for ever in the
vision of peace, in the security of trust and in the restful enjoyment
of his riches.
RESPONSORY
The light of his teaching has shone on those who dwell in darkness.
- By the strength of his love he has delivered the poor and freed
captives from their chains.
He led out those who wandered in the paths of sin.
and freed the poor man from the grasp of his oppressors.
- By the strength of his love he has delivered the poor and freed
captives from their chains
