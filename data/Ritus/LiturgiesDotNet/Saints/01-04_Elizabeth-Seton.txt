O God, who crowned with the gift of true faith
Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton�s burning zeal to find you,
grant by her intercession and example

Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,

The following readings were chosen from the Common of Holy Men and
Women.
FIRST READING          Deuteronomy 10:8-9
Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them:
"At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi
to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD,
to be in attendance before the LORD and minister to him,
and to give blessings in his name,
as they have done to this day.
For this reason,
Levi has no share in the heritage with his brothers;
the LORD himself is his heritage,
as the LORD, your God, has told him."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          128:1-2, 3, 4-5
R. (cf. 1a) Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
Blessed are you who fear the LORD,
who walk in his ways!
For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork;
blessed shall you be, and favored.
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine
in the recesses of your home;
Your children like olive plants
around your table.
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
Behold, thus is the man blessed
who fears the LORD.
The LORD bless you from Zion:
may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
all the days of your life.
R. Blessed are those who fear the Lord.
ALLELUIA
Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened
and I will give you rest, says the Lord
GOSPEL          Matthew 11:25-30
At that time Jesus exclaimed:
"I give praise to you. Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
for although you have hidden these things
from the wise and the learned
you have revealed them to the childlike.
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.
No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him."

"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart;
and you will find rest for yourselves.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
O Lord, we ask that you look graciously
upon our gifts placed on your altar

and grant by the power at work in this sacrifice,
that we may be more deeply inserted
into the mystery of your Son.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Jn 6:51
I am the living bread from heaven, says the Lord.
Whoever eats this bread will live forever;
the bread I shall give is my flesh for the life of the world.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
As we partake of the sacrament of our salvation,
while recalling the memory of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton,
we humbly ask you, O Lord,
that we may be inflamed with a burning desire for the heavenly table,
and by its power consecrate our life faithfully to you.
Through Christ our Lord.

From the Common of Holy Women, except the following:

The Office of Readings

From a conference to her spiritual daughters by Elizabeth Ann Seton
Our daily work is to do the will of God
I will tell you what is my own great help. I once read or heard that an
interior life means but the continuation of our Savior's life in us;
that the great object of all his mysteries is to merit for us the grace
of his interior life and communicate it to us, it being the end of his
mission to lead us into the sweet land of promise, a life of constant
union with himself. And what was the first rule of our dear Savior's
life? You know it was to do his Father's will. Well, then, the first
end I propose in our daily work is to do the will of God; secondly, to
do it in the manner he wills; and thirdly, to do it because it is his
will.
I know what his will is by those who direct me; whatever they bid me
do, if it is ever so small in itself, is the will of God for me. Then
do it in the manner he wills it, not sewing an old thing as if it were
new, or a new thing as if it were old; not fretting because the oven is
too hot, or in a fuss because it is too cold. You understand�not flying
and driving because you are hurried, not creeping like a snail because
no one pushes you. Our dear Savior was never in extremes. The third
object is to do his will because God wills it, that is, to be ready to
quit at any moment and to do anything else to which you may be called�.
You think it very hard to lead a life of such restraint unless you keep
your eye of faith always open. Perseverance is a great grace. To go on
gaining and advancing every day, we must be resolute, and bear and
suffer as our blessed forerunners did. Which of them gained heaven
without a struggle?...
What are our real trials? By what name shall we call them? One cuts
herself out a cross of pride; another, one of causeless discontent;
another, one of restless impatience or peevish fretfulness. But is the
whole any better than children's play if looked at with the common eye
of faith? Yet we know certainly that our God calls us to a holy life,
that he gives us every grace, every abundant grace; and though we are
so weak of ourselves, this grace is able to carry us through every
obstacle and difficulty.
But we lack courage to keep a continual watch over nature, and
therefore, year after year, with our thousand graces, multiplied
resolutions, and fair promises, we run around in a circle of misery and
imperfections. After a long time in the service of God, we come nearly
to the point from whence we set out, and perhaps with even less ardor
for penance and mortification than when we began our consecration to
him.
You are now in your first setout. Be above the vain fears of nature and
efforts of your enemy. You are children of eternity. Your immortal
crown awaits you, and the best of Fathers waits there to reward your
duty and love. You may indeed sow here in tears, but you may be sure
there to reap in joy.
RESPONSORY
The time is growing short,
so we must rejoice as though we were not rejoicing;
we must work in the world
yet without becoming immersed in it,
-   for the world as we know it is passing away.
We have not adopted the spirit of the world.
-   for the world as we know it is passing away.
COLLECT
O God, who crowned with the gift of true faith
Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton's burning zeal to find you,
grant by her intercession and example
that we may always seek you with diligent love
and find you in daily service with sincere faith.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
