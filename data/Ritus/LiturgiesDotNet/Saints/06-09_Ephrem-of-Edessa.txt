Cordibus nostris, quaesumus, Domine, Spiritum Sanctum benignus infunde,
cuius afflatu beatus Ephraem diaconus in tuis mysteriis decantandis
exsultavit, eiusque virtute tibi soli deserviit.
Pour into our hearts O Lord, we pray, the Holy Spirit,
at whose prompting the Deacon Saint Ephrem
exulted in singing of your mysteries
and from whom he received the strength
to serve you alone.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Colossians 3:12-17
Brothers and sisters:
Put on, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved,
heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,
bearing with one another and forgiving one another,
if one has a grievance against another;
as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do.
And over all these put on love,
that is, the bond of perfection.
And let the peace of Christ control your hearts,
the peace into which you were also called in one Body.
And be thankful.
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly,
as in all wisdom you teach and admonish one another,
singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
with gratitude in your hearts to God.
And whatever you do, in word or in deed,
do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,
giving thanks to God the Father through him.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 37:3-4, 5-6, 30-31
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Trust in the Lord and do good,
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the Lord
and he will grant you your heart's requests.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Commit to the Lord your way;
trust in him, and he will act.
He will make justice dawn for you like the light;
bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom
and his tongue utters what is right.
The law of his God is in his heart,
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
ALLELUIA          Jn 15:5
I am the vine, you are the branches, says the Lord;
whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit.
GOSPEL          Luke 6:43-45
Jesus said to his disciples:
"A good tree does not bear rotten fruit,
nor does a rotten tree bear good fruit.
For every tree is known by its own fruit.
For people do not pick figs from thornbushes,
nor do they gather grapes from brambles.
A good person, out of the store of goodness in his heart produces good,
but an evil person out of a store of evil produces evil,
for from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks."

St. Ephrem of Edessa

From the Common of Doctors, except the following:

Office of Readings

From a sermon by Saint Ephrem the Syrian, deacon
(Sermo 3, De fine et admonitione 2. 4-5: Opera, edición Lamy 3,
216-222)

The divine plan for the world is the mirror of the spiritual world.

Lord, shed upon our darkened souls the brilliant light of your wisdom
so that we may be enlightened and serve you with renewed purity.
Sunrise marks the hour for men to begin their toil, but in our souls,
Lord, prepare a dwelling for the day that will never end. Grant that we
may come to know the risen life and that nothing may distract us from
the delights you offer. Through our unremitting zeal for you, Lord, set
upon us the sign of your day that is not measured by the sun.

In your sacrament we daily embrace you and receive you into our bodies;
make us worthy to experience the resurrection for which we hope. We
have had your treasure hidden within us ever since we received
baptismal grace; it grows ever richer at your sacramental table. Teach
us to find our joy in your favor! Lord, we have within us your
memorial, received at your spiritual table; let us possess it in its
full reality when all things shall be made new.

We glimpse the beauty that is laid up for us when we gaze upon the
spiritual beauty your immortal will now creates within our mortal
selves.

Savior, your crucifixion marked the end of your mortal life; teach us
to crucify ourselves and make way for our life in the Spirit. May your
resurrection, Jesus, bring true greatness to our spiritual self and may
your sacraments be the mirror wherein we may know that self.

Savior, your divine plan for the world is a mirror for the spiritual
world; teach us to walk in that: world as spiritual men.

Lord, do not deprive our souls of the spiritual vision of you nor our
bodies of your warmth and sweetness. The mortality lurking in our
bodies spreads corruption through us; may the spiritual waters of your
love cleanse the effects of mortality from our hearts Grant, Lord, that
we may hasten to our true city and, like Moses on the mountaintop,
possess it now in vision.
RESPONSORY          Sirach 47:8, 9, 10
He loved the Lord with his whole heart
and daily sang praises to his Maker.
- He chose musicians to stand before the altar
to provide sweet music for the psalms.
He did this so that men might praise the holy name of the Lord
and the sanctuary might resound
with music from the rising to the setting of the sun.
- He chose musicians to stand before the altar
to provide sweet music for the psalms.
