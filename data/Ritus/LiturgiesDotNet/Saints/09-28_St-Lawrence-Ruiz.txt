From the Common of Several Martyrs, except the following:
SECOND READING
From a homily of Pope John Paul II
(Homily in Manila at the Mass of beatification of the Venerable Servant
of God Lawrence Ruiz and companions: AAS 73 , 340-342)
In shedding their blood they offered God the greatest act of worship
and love
According to his Gospel promise, Christ is truly acknowledging, in the
presence of his Father in heaven, those faithful martyrs who
acknowledged him before men.

The hymn of glory to God which has just been sung by numberless voices
is an echo of the Te Deum sung in the Church of Santo Domingo on the
evening of December 27, 1637, when the news arrived of the martyrdom at
Nagasaki of a group of six Christians. Among them were the head of the
mission, Father Antonio Gonzlez, a Spanish Dominican from Len, and
Lorenzo Ruiz, a married man with a family, born in Manila "extra
muros," in the suburb of Binondo. These witnesses had also in their
turn sung psalms to the Lord of mercy and power, both while they were
in prison and during their execution by the gallows and the pit, which
lasted three days.

Faith conquers the world. The preaching of this faith enlightens like
the sun all who wish to attain the knowledge of truth. Indeed, although
there are different languages in the world, the power of the Christian
tradition is the same.

The Lord Jesus by his blood truly redeemed his servants, gathered from
every race, tongue, people and nation, to make them a royal priesthood
for our God.

The sixteen blessed martyrs, by the exercise of their priesthood � that
of baptism or of Holy Orders � performed the greatest act of worship
and love of God by the sacrifice of their blood united with Christ�s
own Sacrifice of the Cross. In this way they imitated Christ the priest
and victim in the most perfect way possible for human creatures. It was
at the same time an act of the greatest possible love for their
brethren, for whose sake we are all called to sacrifice ourselves,
following the example of the Son of God who sacrificed himself for us.

This is what Lorenzo Ruiz did. Guided by the Holy Spirit to an
unexpected goal after an adventurous journey, he told the court that he
was a Christian, and must die for God: �Had I many thousands of lives I
would offer them all for him. Never shall I apostatize. You may kill me
if that is what you want. To die for God � such is my will�.

Here we have him summed up; here we have a description of his faith and
the reason for his death. It was at this moment that this young father
of a family professed and brought to completion the Christian
catechesis that he had received in the Dominican Friars� school in
Binondo: a catechesis that cannot be other than Christ-centered, by
reason both of the mystery it contains and the fact that it is Christ
who teaches through the lips of his messenger.

The example of Lorenzo Ruiz, the son of a Chinese father and Tagala
mother, reminds us that everyone�s life and the whole of one�s life
must be at Christ�s disposal. Christianity means daily giving, in
response to the gift of Christ who came into the world so that all
might have life and have it to the full.
RESPONSORY
These holy men and women poured out their blood for the Lord;
they loved Christ in life; they followed him in his death.
- They have won the glorious crown.
They shared the one Spirit;
they held fast to the faith.
- They have won the glorious crown.
