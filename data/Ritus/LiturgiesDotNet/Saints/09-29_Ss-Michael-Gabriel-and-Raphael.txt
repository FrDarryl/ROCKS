ENTRANCE ANTIPHON           Psalm 103:20
Benedicite Dominum, omnes Angeli eius, potentes virtute, qui facitis
verbum eius, ad audiendam vocem sermonum eius.
Bless the Lord, all you his angels, mighty in power,
fulfilling his word, and heeding his voice.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui miro ordine Angelorum ministeria hominumque dispensas,
concede propitius, ut, a quibus tibi ministrantibus in caelo semper
assistitur, ab his in terra vita nostra muniatur.
O God, who dispose in marvelous order
ministries both angelic and human,
graciously grant
that our life on earth may be defended
by those who watch over us
as they minister perpetually to you in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14
As I watched:
Thrones were set up
and the Ancient One took his throne.
His clothing was bright as snow,
and the hair on his head as white as wool;
His throne was flames of fire,
with wheels of burning fire.
A surging stream of fire
flowed out from where he sat;
Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him,
and myriads upon myriads attended him.
The court was convened, and the books were opened.
As the visions during the night continued, I saw
One like a son of man coming,
on the clouds of heaven;
When he reached the Ancient One
and was presented before him,
He received dominion, glory, and kingship;
nations and peoples of every language serve him.
His dominion is an everlasting dominion
that shall not be taken away,
his kingship shall not be destroyed.
Or:          Revelation 12:7-12ab
War broke out in heaven;
Michael and his angels battled against the dragon.
The dragon and its angels fought back,
but they did not prevail
and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
The huge dragon, the ancient serpent,
who is called the Devil and Satan,
who deceived the whole world,
was thrown down to earth,
and its angels were thrown down with it.
Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:
Now have salvation and power come,
and the Kingdom of our God
and the authority of his Anointed.
For the accuser of our brothers is cast out,
who accuses them before our God day and night.
They conquered him by the Blood of the Lamb
and by the word of their testimony;
love for life did not deter them from death.
Therefore, rejoice, you heavens,
and you who dwell in them.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 138:1-2ab, 2cde-3, 4-5
In conspectu angelorum psallam tibi, Domine.
R. In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.
I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with all my heart,
for you have heard the words of my mouth;
in the presence of the angels I will sing your praise;
I will worship at your holy temple
and give thanks to your name.
R. In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.
Because of your kindness and your truth;
for you have made great above all things
your name and your promise.
When I called, you answered me;
you built up strength within me.
R. In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.
All the kings of the earth shall give thanks to you, O LORD
when they hear the words of your mouth;
And they shall sing of the ways of the LORD
"Great is the glory of the LORD"
R. In the sight of the angels I will sing your praises, Lord.
ALLELUIA          Ps 103:21
Benedicite Domino, omnes virtutes eius, ministri eius, qui facitis
voluntatem eius.
Bless the LORD, all you angels
you ministers, who do his will.
GOSPEL          John 1:47-51
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him,
Here is a true child of Israel.
There is no duplicity in him.
Nathanael said to him, How do you know me?
Jesus answered and said to him,
Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.
Nathanael answered him,
Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.
Jesus answered and said to him,
Do you believe
because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree?
You will see greater things than this.
And he said to him, Amen, amen, I say to you,
you will see heaven opened
and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Hostias tibi, Domine, laudis offerimus, suppliciter deprecantes, ut
easdem, angelico ministerio in conspectum tuae maiestatis delatas, et
placatus accipias, et ad salutem nostram provenire concedas.
We offer you a sacrifice of praise, O Lord,
humbly entreating,
that, as these gifts are borne by the ministry of Angels
into the presence of your majesty,
so you may receive them favorably
and make them profitable for our salvation.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE          God glorified through the Angels
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus: Et
in Archangelis Angelisque tuis tua praeconia non tacere, quia ad
excellentiam tuam recurrit et gloriam quod angelica creatura tibi
probabilis honoretur: et, cum illa sit amplo decore dignissima, tu quam
sis immensus et super omnia praeferendus ostenderis, per Christum
Dominum nostrum. Per quem multitudo Angelorum tuam celebrat maiestatem,
quibus adorantes in exsultatione coniungimur, una cum eis laudis voce
clamantes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
and to praise you without end
in your Archangels and Angels.

For the honor we pay the angelic creatures
in whom you delight
redounds to your own surpassing glory,
and by their great dignity and splendor
you show how infinitely great you are,
to be exalted above all things,
through Christ our Lord.

Through him the multitude of Angels extols your majesty,
and we are united with them in exultant adoration,
as with one voice of praise we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts ...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Ps 138 (137): 1
Confitebor tibi, Domine, in toto corde meo, in conspectu Angelorum
psallam tibi.
I will thank you, Lord, with all my heart;
in the presence of the Angels I will praise you.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Pane caelesti refecti, supplices te, Domine, deprecamur, ut, eius
fortitudine roborati, sub Angelorum tuorum fideli custodia, fortes,
salutis progrediamur in via.
Having been nourished with heavenly Bread,
we beseech you humbly, O Lord,
that, drawing from it new strength,
under the faithful protection of your Angels,
we may advance boldly along the way of salvation.
Through Christ our Lord.
