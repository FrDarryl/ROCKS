Deus, qui nos sanctorum martyrum Marcellini et Petri confessione
gloriosa circumdas et protegis, praesta nobis ex eorum imitatione
proficere, et oratione fulciri.
O God, who surround us with protection
through the glorious confession
of the Martyrs Saints Marcellinus and Peter,
grant that we may profit by imitating them
and be upheld by their prayer.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 6:4-10
Brothers and sisters:
In everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God,
through much endurance, in afflictions, hardships,
constraints, beatings, imprisonments, riots,
labors, vigils, fasts;
by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness,
in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love, in truthful speech,
in the power of God;
with weapons of righteousness at the right and at the left;
through glory and dishonor, insult and praise.
We are treated as deceivers and yet are truthful;
as unrecognized and yet acknowledged;
as dying and behold we live;
as chastised and yet not put to death;
as sorrowful yet always rejoicing;
as poor yet enriching many;
as having nothing and yet possessing all things.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           124:2-3, 4-5, 7b-8
R. (7) Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler's snare.
Had not the LORD been with us
When men rose up against us,
then would they have swallowed us alive
When their fury was inflamed against us.
R. Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler's snare.
Then would the waters have overwhelmed us;
The torrent would have swept over us;
over us then would have swept
the raging waters.
R. Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler's snare.
Broken was the snare,
and we were freed.
Our help is in the name of the LORD,
who made heaven and earth.
R. Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the fowler's snare.
ALLELUIA          2 Cor 1:3b-4a
Blessed be the Father of compassion and God of all encouragement,
who encourages us in our every affliction.
GOSPEL          John 17:11b-19
Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and prayed, saying:
"Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me,
so that they may be one just as we are one.
When I was with them I protected them in your name that you gave me,
and I guarded them, and none of them was lost
except the son of destruction,
in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
But now I am coming to you.
I speak this in the world
so that they may share my joy completely.
I gave them your word, and the world hated them,
because they do not belong to the world
any more than I belong to the world.
I do not ask that you take them out of the world
but that you keep them from the Evil One.
They do not belong to the world
any more than I belong to the world.
Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is truth.
As you sent me into the world,
so I sent them into the world.
And I consecrate myself for them,
so that they also may be consecrated in truth."

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From the exhortation to martyrdom by Origen, priest
(Nn. 41-42; PG 11, 618-619)
Those who share in the sufferings of Christ will also share in his
consolation
If passing from unbelief to faith means that we have passed from death
to life, we should not be surprised to find that the world hates us.
Anyone who has not passed from death to life is incapable of loving
those who have departed from death�s dark dwelling place to enter a
dwelling made of living stones and filled with the light of life. Jesus
laid down his life for us; so we too should lay down our lives, I will
not say for him, but for ourselves and also, surely, for those who will
be helped by the example of our martyrdom.

Now is the time for Christians to rejoice, since Scripture says that we
should rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering trains us to
endure with patience, patient endurance makes us pleasing to God, and
being pleasing to God gives us ground for a hope that will not be
disappointed. Only let the love of God be poured forth in our hearts
through the Holy Spirit.

The more we share in the sufferings of Christ, the more we share,
through him, in his consolation. We should be extremely eager to share
in Christ�s sufferings and to let them be multiplied in us if we desire
the superabundant consolation that will be given to those who mourn.
This consolation will not perhaps be the same for all, for if it were,
Scripture would not say: The more we share in the sufferings of Christ,
the more we share in his consolation. Sharing in his consolation will
be proportionate to our sharing in his suffering. We learn this from
one who could say with all confidence: We know that as you share in the
sufferings, so you will share in the consolation as well.

God says through the prophet: At an acceptable time I heard you; on the
day of salvation I helped you. What time could be more acceptable than
when, for our fidelity to God in Christ, we are made a public spectacle
and led away under guard, not defeated but triumphant?

In Christ and with Christ the martyrs disarm the principalities and
powers and share in his triumph over them, for their share in Christ�s
sufferings makes them sharers also in the mighty deeds those sufferings
accomplished. What could more appropriately be called the day of
salvation than the day of such a glorious departure from this world?
But I entreat you not to give offense to anyone, so that our ministry
may not be blamed. Be very patient and show in every way that you are
servants of God. Say: And now, what do I wait for? Is it not the Lord?
RESPONSORY          Ephesians 6:12, 14, 13
Our struggle is not against human enemies
but against the principalities and powers, against the evil spirits.
- Stand firm and let the truth be the belt around your waist.
Put in the armor of God;
then you will be able to stand firm when the worst happens;
you will fulfill all your duties and hold your ground.
- Stand firm and let the truth be the belt around your waist.
