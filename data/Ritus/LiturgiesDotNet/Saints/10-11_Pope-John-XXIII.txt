From the Common of Pastors: For a Pope
COLLECT
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui per orbem terrarum in beato Ioanne,
papa, Christi boni pastoris vivum effulgere fecisti exemplum, concede
nobis, quaesumus, ut, eius intercessione, abundantiam christianae
caritatis laetanter effundere valeamus.
O almighty and eternal God,
who throughout all the world made in blessed Pope John
a living radiant example of Christ the Good Shepherd,
grant us, we ask, that through his intercession,
we may be enabled to pour out an abundance of Christian charity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING      Ezekiel 34:11-16
Thus says the Lord GOD:
I myself will look after and tend my sheep.
As a shepherd tends his flock
when he finds himself among his scattered sheep,
so will I tend my sheep.
I will rescue them from every place where they were scattered
when it was cloudy and dark.
I will lead them out from among the peoples
and gather them from the foreign lands;
I will bring them back to their own country
and pasture them upon the mountains of Israel
in the land's ravines and all its inhabited places.
In good pastures will I pasture them,
and on the mountain heights of Israel
shall be their grazing ground.
There they shall lie down on good grazing ground,
and in rich pastures shall they be pastured
on the mountains of Israel.
I myself will pasture my sheep;
I myself will give them rest, says the Lord GOD.
The lost I will seek out,
the strayed I will bring back,
the injured I will bind up,
the sick I will heal,
but the sleek and the strong I will destroy,
shepherding them rightly.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 23:1-3a,3b-4,5,6
Dominus pascit me, et nihil mehi déerit.
R/ (1) The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;
beside restful waters he leads me;
he refreshes my soul.
R/ The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Even though I walk in the dark valley
I fear no evil; for you are at my side
With your rod and your staff
that give me courage.
R/ The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
You spread the table before me
in the sight of my foes;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
R/ The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Only goodness and kindness follow me
all the days of my life;
and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD
for years to come.
R/ The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
ALLELUIA          John 10:14
Ego sum pastor bonus, dicit Dominus; et cognosco oves meas, et
cognoscunt me meae.
I am the good shepherd, says the Lord,
I know my sheep and mine know me.
GOSPEL          John 21:15-17
After Jesus had revealed himself to his disciples and
eaten breakfast with them, he said to Simon Peter,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.
Jesus said to him, "Feed my lambs."
He then said to Simon Peter a second time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.
Jesus said to him, "Tend my sheep."
He said to him the third time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time,
"Do you love me?" and he said to him,
"Lord, you know everything; you know that 1 love you."
Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."

Liturgy of the Hours

From the Common of Pastors, for a Pope, except the following:

From the Office of Readings
From the addresses of St. John XXIII, pope.
(In the solemn inauguration of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council,
11 October 1962: AAS 54 , 786-787. 792-793.)
The Church is the most loving mother of all

Today, Venerable Brethren, is a day of joy for Mother Church: through
God's most kindly providence the longed-for day has dawned for the
solemn opening of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, here at St.
Peter's shrine. And Mary, God's Virgin Mother, on this feast day of her
noble motherhood, gives it her gracious protection.

Certain it is that the critical issues, the thorny problems that wait
upon man's solution, have remained the same for almost twenty
centuries. And why? Because the whole of history and of life hinges on
the person of Jesus Christ. Either men anchor themselves on Him and His
Church, and thus enjoy the blessings of light and joy, right order and
peace; or they live their lives apart from Him; many positively oppose
Him, and deliberately exclude themselves from the Church. The result
can only be confusion in their lives, bitterness in their relations
with one another, and the savage threat of war.

In these days, which mark the beginning of this Second Vatican Council,
it is more obvious than ever before that the Lord's truth is indeed
eternal. Human ideologies change. Successive generations give rise to
varying errors, and these often vanish as quickly as they came, like
mist before the sun.

The Church has always opposed these errors, and often condemned them
with the utmost severity. Today, however, Christ's Bride prefers the
balm of mercy to the arm of severity. She believes that, present needs
are best served by explaining more fully the purport of her doctrines,
rather than by publishing condemnations. Not that the need to repudiate
and guard against erroneous teaching and dangerous ideologies is less
today than formerly. But all such error is so manifestly contrary to
rightness and goodness, and produces such fatal results, that our
contemporaries show every inclination to condemn it of their own
accord�especially that way of life which repudiates God and His law,
and which places excessive confidence in technical progress and an
exclusively material prosperity. It is more and more widely understood
that personal dignity and true self-realization are of vital importance
and worth every effort to achieve. More important still, experience has
at long last taught men that physical violence, armed might, and
political domination are no help at all in providing a happy solution
to the serious problems which affect them.

The great desire, therefore, of the Catholic Church in raising aloft at
this Council the torch of truth, is to show herself to the world as the
loving mother of all mankind; gentle, patient, and full of tenderness
and sympathy for her separated children. To the human race oppressed by
so many difficulties, she says what Peter once said to the poor man who
begged an alms: "Silver and gold I have none; but what I have, that I
give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk."
(Acts 3:6) In other words it is not corruptible wealth, nor the promise
of earthly happiness, that the Church offers the world today, but the
gifts of divine grace which, since they raise men up to the dignity of
being sons of God, are powerful assistance and support for the living
of a more fully human life. She unseals the fountains of her
life-giving doctrine, so that men, illumined by the light of Christ,
will understand their true nature and dignity and purpose. Everywhere,
through her children, she extends the frontiers of Christian love, the
most powerful means of eradicating the seeds of discord, the most
effective means of promoting concord, peace with justice, and universal
brotherhood.
RESPONSORY           cf. Mt 16:18; Ps 48:9
Jesus said to Simon, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
church, *
- And the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
God has established it forever. *
- And the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
