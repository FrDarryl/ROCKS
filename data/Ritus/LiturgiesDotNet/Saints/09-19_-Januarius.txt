COLLECT
Deus, qui nos concedis beati Ianuarii martyris memoriam venerari, da
nobis in aeterna beatitudine de eius societate gaudere.
O God, who grant us to venerate
the memory of the Martyr Saint Januarius,
give us, we pray, the joy of his company
in blessed happiness for all eternity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Hebrews 10:32-36
Brothers and sisters:
Remember the days past when, after you had been enlightened,
you endured a great contest of suffering.
At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and affliction;
at other times you associated yourselves with those so treated.
You even joined in the sufferings of those in prison
and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property,
knowing that you had a better and lasting possession.
Therefore, do not throw away your confidence;
it will have great recompense.
You need endurance to do the will of God and receive what he has
promised.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
�The LORD has done great things for them.�
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Jas 1:12
Blessed is the man who perseveres in temptation,
for when he has been proved he will receive the crown of life.
GOSPEL          John 12: 24-26
Jesus said to his disciples:
"Amen, amen, I say to you,
unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies,
it remains just a grain of wheat;
but if it dies, it produces much fruit.
Whoever loves his life loses it,
and whoever hates his life in this world
will preserve it for eternal life.
Whoever serves me must follow me,
and where I am, there also will my servant be.
The Father will honor whoever serves me."

SECOND READING
From a Sermon by Saint Augustine, Bishop
(Sermo 340,1 PL 38, 1483-1484)
For You I Am a Bishop, With You I Am a Christian
The day I became a bishop, a burden was laid on my shoulders for which
it will be no easy task to render an account. The honors I receive are
for me an ever present cause of uneasiness. Indeed, it terrifies me to
think that I could take more pleasure in the honor attached to my
office, which is where its danger lies, than in your salvation, which
ought to be its fruit. This is why being set above you fills me with
alarm, whereas being with you gives me comfort. Danger lies in the
first; salvation in the second.

To be honest with you, my obligations involve me in so much turmoil
that I feel as though I were tossed by storms on a great ocean. When I
remember by whose blood I have been redeemed, this thought brings me
peace, as though I were entering the safety of a harbor; and I am
consoled, as I carry out the arduous duties of my own particular
office, by the blessings which we all have in common. By finding my
chief joy therefore in the redemption, which I share with you, and not
in my office, which has placed me over you, I shall the more truly be
your servant; and so not only fulfill the Lord�s command, but also show
myself not ungrateful to him for making me your fellow servant. For my
Redeemer has a claim upon my love, and I do not forget how he
questioned Peter, and asked: Do you love me, Peter? Then feed my sheep.
He asked this once, then again and then a third time. He inquired about
his love, and then he gave him work to do; for the greater one�s love
is, the easier is the work.

How shall I repay the Lord for all the blessings he has given me? I
could say perhaps that I repay him by feeding his sheep, but even
though I do this, it is not really I who do it, but the grace of God
within me. So when all that I do is the gift of God�s grace, how can I
possibly repay him? As a matter of fact, I hope to be repaid myself,
and this for the very reason that I love him freely and feed his sheep.
But, you may ask, if I feed his sheep because I love him freely, how
can I demand payment for feeding them? It is indeed unthinkable to ask
for a recompense for love freely given unless that recompense is the
loved one himself.

But even if feeding his sheep could repay him for redeeming me, what
could repay him for having made me his shepherd? To be a good shepherd
I depend entirely on his grace, for without his help I should be a very
bad one, there is so much evil in me. Pray, then, that I may not be a
bad shepherd, but a good one.

And for you, my brothers, I also pray and warn you against failing to
cooperate with the grace you receive from God. Make my ministry a
fruitful one. You are God�s garden, and you should therefore welcome
the laborer who does the visible work of planting and watering the
seed, even though the growth comes from one who works invisibly within
you. Help me both by your prayers and by your obedience, for then it
will be a pleasure for me, not to preside over you, but to serve you.
RESPONSORY
He was a true martyr, who shed his blood for the name of Christ.
- Fearless of the threats of judges and indifferent to worldly honors,
he attained the kingdom of heaven.
The Lord guided the just man on the right path
and showed him God's kingdom.
- Fearless of the threats of judges and indifferent to worldly honors,
he attained the kingdom of heaven.
COLLECT
O God, who grant us to venerate
the memory of the Martyr Saint Januarius,
give us, we pray, the joy of his company
in blessed happiness for all eternity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
