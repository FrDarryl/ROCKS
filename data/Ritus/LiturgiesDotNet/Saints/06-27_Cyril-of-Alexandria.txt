Deus, qui beatum Cyrillum episcopum divinae maternitatis beatissimae
Virginis Mariae assertorem invictum effecisti, concede, ut, qui vere
eam Genetricem Dei credimus, per incarnationem Christi Filii tui
salvemur.
O God, who made the Bishop Saint Cyril of Alexandria
an invincible champion of the divine motherhood
of the most Blessed Virgin Mary,
grant, we pray,
that we, who believe she is truly the Mother of God,
may be saved through the Incarnation of Christ your Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Timothy 4:1-5
Beloved:
I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
who will judge the living and the dead,
and by his appearing and his kingly power:
proclaim the word;
be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient;
convince, reprimand, encourage through all patience and teaching.
For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine
but, following their own desires and insatiable curiosity,
will accumulate teachers and will stop listening to the truth
and will be diverted to myths.
But you, be self-possessed in all circumstances;
put up with hardship;
perform the work of an evangelist;
fulfill your ministry.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          89:2-3,4-5,21-22,25,27
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The favors of the Lord I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever";
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
I have sworn to David, my servant:
For ever will I confirm your posterity
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have found David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
That my hand may be always with him,
and that my arm may make him strong."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,
and through my name shall his horn be exalted.
He shall say of me, 'You are my father,
my God, the Rock, my savior.'"
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:16
Let your light shine before others,
that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.
GOSPEL          Matthew 5:13-19
Jesus said to his disciples:
"You are the salt of the earth.
But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned?
It is no longer good for anything
but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world.
A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket;
it is set on a lampstand,
where it gives light to all in the house.
Just so, your light must shine before others,
that they may see your good deeds
and glorify your heavenly Father.

"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.
Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away,
not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter
will pass from the law,
until all things have taken place.
Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
and teaches others to do so
will be called least in the Kingdom of heaven.
But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments
will be called greatest in the Kingdom of heaven."

SECOND READING
From a letter by Saint Cyril of Alexandria, bishop
(Epist. 1: PG 77, 14-18, 27-30)
Defender of the divine motherhood of the Virgin Mary
That anyone could doubt the right of the holy Virgin to be called the
mother of God fills me with astonishment. Surely she must be the Mother
of God if our Lord Jesus Christ is God, and she gave birth to him! Our
Lord�s disciples may not have used those exact words, but they
delivered to us the belief those words enshrine, and this has also been
taught us by the holy fathers.

In the third book of his work on the holy and consubstantial Trinity,
our father Athanasius, of glorious memory, several times refers to the
holy Virgin as �Mother of God.� I cannot resist quoting his own words:
�As I have often told you, the distinctive mark of holy Scripture is
that it was written to make a twofold declaration concerning our
Savior; namely, that he is and has always been God, since he is the
Word, Radiance and Wisdom of the Father; and that for our sake in these
latter days he took flesh from the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and
became man.�

Again further on he says: �There have been many holy men, free from all
sin. Jeremiah was sanctified in his mother�s womb, and John while still
in the womb leaped for joy at the voice of Mary, the Mother of God.�
Athanasius is a man we can trust, one who deserves our complete
confidence, for he taught nothing contrary to the sacred books.

The divinely inspired Scriptures affirm that the Word of God was made
flesh, that is to say, he was united to a human body endowed with a
rational soul. He undertook to help the descendants of Abraham,
fashioning a body for himself from a woman and sharing our flesh and
blood, to enable us to see in him not only God, but also, by reason of
this union, a man like ourselves.

It is held, therefore, that there are in Emmanuel two entities,
divinity and humanity. Yet our Lord Jesus Christ is nonetheless one,
the one true Son, both God and man; not a deified man on the same
footing as those who share the divine nature by grace, but true God who
for our sake appeared in human form. We are assured of this by Saint
Paul�s declaration: When the fullness of time came, God sent his Son,
born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the
law and to enable us to be adopted as sons.
RESPONSORY
This holy man worked wonders in the sight of God;
he praised the Lord with his whole heart.
- May he intercede for sinful mankind.

This priest of the Lord meditated on his commandments day and night.
- May he intercede for sinful mankind.
COLLECT
O God, who made the Bishop Saint Cyril of Alexandria
an invincible champion of the divine motherhood
of the most Blessed Virgin Mary,
grant, we pray,
that we, who believe she is truly the Mother of God,
may be saved through the Incarnation of Christ your Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
