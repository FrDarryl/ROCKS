The Collect

Almighty God, for the peace of the Church your servant Chad
relinquished cheerfully the honors that had been thrust upon him, only
to be rewarded with equal responsibility: Keep us, we pray, from
thinking of ourselves more highly than we ought to think, and ready at
all times to step aside for others, that the cause of Christ may be
advanced; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

First Reading
Philippians 4:10-13

I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your
concern for me; indeed, you were concerned for me, but had no
opportunity to show it. Not that I am referring to being in need; for I
have learned to be content with whatever I have. I know what it is to
have little, and I know what it is to have plenty. In any and all
circumstances I have learned the secret of being well-fed and of going
hungry, of having plenty and of being in need. I can do all things
through him who strengthens me.

The Psalm
Psalm 84:7-12
Quam dilecta!

7
LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; *
hearken, O God of Jacob.

8
Behold our defender, O God; *
and look upon the face of your Anointed.

9
For one day in your courts is better than a thousand in my own
room, *
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God
than to dwell in the tents of the wicked.

10
For the LORD God is both sun and shield; *
he will give grace and glory;

11
No good thing will the LORD withhold *
from those who walk with integrity.

12
O LORD of hosts, *
happy are they who put their trust in you!

or
Psalm 23
Dominus regit me

1
The LORD is my shepherd; *
I shall not be in want.

2
He makes me lie down in green pastures *
and leads me beside still waters.

3
He revives my soul *
and guides me along right pathways for his Name's sake.

4
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil; *
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

5
You spread a table before me in the presence of those who
trouble me; *
you have anointed my head with oil,
and my cup is running over.

6
Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
my life, *
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

Gospel Reading
Luke 14:1,7-14 On one occasion when Jesus was going to the house of a
leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal on the sabbath, they were
watching him closely.

When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them
a parable. "When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do
not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished
than you has been invited by your host; and the host who invited both
of you may come and say to you, `Give this person your place,' and then
in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. But when you are
invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host
comes, he may say to you, `Friend, move up higher'; then you will be
honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. For all
who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves
will be exalted."

He said also to the one who had invited him, "When you give a luncheon
or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your
relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and
you would be repaid. But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the
crippled, the lame, and the blind. And you will be blessed, because
they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of
the righteous."
