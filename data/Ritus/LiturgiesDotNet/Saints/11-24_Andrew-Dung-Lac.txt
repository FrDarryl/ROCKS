ENTRANCE SONG          Cf. Gal 6: 14; 1 Cor 1: 18
Nos autem gloriari oportet in cruce Domini nostri Jesu Christi: in quo
est salus, vita et resurrectio nostra per quem salvati et liberati
sumus.

For the word of the Cross is the power of God
to us who have been saved.
COLLECT
Deus, omnis paternitatis fons et origo, qui beatos martyres Andream et
socios eius Cruci Filii tui usque ad sanguinis effusionem fideles
effecisti, eorum intercessione concede, ut amorem tuum inter fratres
propagantes filii tui nominari et esse valeamus. Per Dominum.
O God, source and origin of all fatherhood,
who kept the Martyrs Saint Andrew Dung-Lac and his companions
faithful to the Cross of your Son,
even to the shedding of their blood,
grant, through their intercession,
that, spreading your love among our brothers and sisters,
we may be your children both in name and in truth.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
Readings are from the Common of Martyrs. The following are suggested
readings:
FIRST READING          Sirach 51:1-8
I give you thanks, O God of my father;
I praise you, O God my savior!
I will make known your name, refuge of my life;
you have been my helper against my adversaries.
You have saved me from death,
and kept back my body from the pit,
From the clutches of the nether world you have snatched my feet;
you have delivered me, in your great mercy
From the scourge of a slanderous tongue,
and from lips that went over to falsehood;
From the snare of those who watched for my downfall,
and from the power of those who sought my life;
From many a danger you have saved me,
from flames that hemmed me in on every side;
From the midst of unremitting fire,
from the deep belly of the nether world;
From deceiving lips and painters of lies,
from the arrows of dishonest tongues.
I was at the point of death,
my soul was nearing the depths of the nether world;
I turned every way, but there was no one to help me,
I looked for one to sustain me, but could find no one.
But then I remembered the mercies of the Lord,
his kindness through ages past;
For he saves those who take refuge in him,
and rescues them from every evil.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
"The LORD has done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Jas 1:12
Blessed is the man who perseveres in temptation,
for when he has been proved he will receive the crown of life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 10:28-33
Jesus said:" Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot
kill the soul;
rather, be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in
Gehenna.
Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?
Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's
knowledge.
Even all the hairs of your head are counted.
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
Everyone who acknowledges me before others
I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.
But whoever denies me before others,
I will deny before my heavenly Father."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, sancte Pater, munera quae offerimus, passionem venerantes
sanctorum martyrum, ut inter adversa vitae nostrae, fideles tibi semper
inveniri mereamur et hostiam tibi acceptabilem nosmetipsos exhibere.
Receive, O holy Father, the offerings we bring
as we venerate the passion of the holy Martyrs,
so that amid the trials of this life
we may always be found faithful
and may offer ourselves to you
as an acceptable sacrifice.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Mt 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam quoniam ipsorum est
regnum caelorum.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Unius panis alimonia refecti, in commemoratione sanctorum martyrum, te,
Domine, suppliciter deprecamur, ut, in tua dilectione unanimes
manentes, patientiae praemium mereamur consequi aeternum.
Renewed by the one Bread
as we commemorate the holy Martyrs,
we humbly beseech you, O Lord,
that, abiding as one in your love,
we may merit by endurance an eternal prize.
Through Christ our Lord.

Andrew Dung-Lac and Companions, Martyrs

From the Common of Several Martyrs, except the following:

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a letter of Saint Paul Le-Bao-Tinh sent to students of the
Seminary of Ke-Vinh in 1843
(A. Launay, Le clerg tonkinois et ses prtres martyrs [Paris Foreign
Mission Society, Paris, 1925], pp. 80-83)
The martyrs' share in Christ's victory
I, Paul, in chains for the name of Christ, wish to relate to you the
trials besetting me daily, in order that you may be inflamed with love
for God and join with me in his praises, for his mercy is for ever. The
prison here is a true image of everlasting hell: to cruel tortures of
every kind�shackles, iron chains, manacles�are added hatred, vengeance,
calumnies, obscene speech, quarrels, evil acts, swearing, curses, as
well as anguish and grief. But the God who once freed the three
children from the fiery furnace is with me always; he has delivered me
from these tribulations and made them sweet, for his mercy is for ever.

In the midst of these torments, which usually terrify others, I am, by
the grace of God, full of joy and gladness, because I am not
alone�Christ is with me.

Our master bears the whole weight of the cross, leaving me only the
tiniest, last bit. He is not a mere onlooker in my struggle, but a
contestant and the victor and champion in the whole battle. Therefore
upon his head is placed the crown of victory, and his members also
share in his glory.

How am I to bear with the spectacle, as each day I see emperors,
mandarins, and their retinue blaspheming your holy name, O Lord, who
are enthroned above the Cherubim and Seraphim? Behold, the pagans have
trodden your cross underfoot! Where is your glory? As I see all this, I
would, in the ardent love I have for you, prefer to be torn limb from
limb and to die as a witness to your love.

O Lord, show your power, save me, sustain me, that in my infirmity your
power may be shown and may be glorified before the nations; grant that
I may not grow weak along the way, and so allow your enemies to hold
their heads up in pride.

Beloved brothers, as you hear all these things may you give endless
thanks in joy to God, from whom every good proceeds; bless the Lord
with me, for his mercy is for ever. My soul proclaims the greatness of
the Lord, my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked with
favor on his lowly servant and from this day all generations will call
me blessed,for his mercy is for ever.

O praise the Lord, all you nations, acclaim him all you peoples, for
God chose what is weak in the world to confound the strong, God chose
what is low and despised to confound the noble. Through my mouth he has
confused the philosophers who are disciples of the wise of this world,
for his mercy is for ever.

I write these things to you in order that your faith and mine may be
united. In the midst of this storm I cast my anchor toward the throne
of God, the anchor that is the lively home in my heart.

Beloved brothers, for your part so run that you may attain the crown,
put on the breastplate of faith and take up the weapons of Christ for
the right hand and for the left, as my patron Saint Paul has taught us.
It is better for you to enter life with one eye or crippled than, with
all your members intact, to be cast away.

Come to my aid with your prayers, that I may have the strength to fight
according to the law, and indeed to fight the good fight and to fight
until the end and so finish the race. We may not again see each other
in this life, but we will have the happiness of seeing each other again
in the world to come, when, standing at the throne of the spotless
Lamb, we will together join in singing his praises and exult for ever
in the joy of our triumph. Amen.
RESPONSORY
Through patience let us run the race that is set before us.
� Looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.

Consider him who from sinners endured such hostility against himself,
so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.
� Looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
COLLECT
O God, source and origin of all fatherhood,
who kept the Martyrs Saint Andrew Dung-Lac and his companions
faithful to the Cross of your Son,
even to the shedding of their blood,
grant, through their intercession,
that, spreading your love among our brothers and sisters,
we may be your children both in name and in truth.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
