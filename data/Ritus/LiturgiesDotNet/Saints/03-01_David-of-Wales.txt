St. David is treated as a Solemnity in Wales. The following Propers are
those used by the Catholic Church in Wales.

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON           Is.52:7
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him
who brings glad tidings of peace,
bearing good news, announcing salvation!
COLLECT
O God,
you gave your servant David
the virtue of wisdom and the gift of eloquence,
and made him an example of prayer and pastoral zeal;
grant that, through his intercession,
your Church may ever prosper and render you joyful praise.
We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God for ever and ever.
FIRST READING           Isaiah 61:1-3,10-11
The Lord has anointed me
The spirit of the Lord has been given to me,
for the Lord has anointed me.
He has sent me to bring good news to the poor,
to bind up hearts that are broken;
to proclaim liberty to captives,
freedom to those in prison;
to proclaim a year of favour from the Lord,
a day of vengeance for our God,
to comfort all those who mourn and to give them
for ashes a garland;
for mourning robe the oil of gladness,
for despondency, praise.
�I exult for joy in the Lord,
my soul rejoices in my God,
for he has clothed me in the garments of salvation,
he has wrapped me in the cloak of integrity,
like a bridegroom wearing his wreath,
like a bride adorned in her jewels.
�For as the earth makes fresh things grow,
as a garden makes seeds spring up,
so will the Lord make both integrity and praise
spring up in the sight of the nations.�
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Psalm 1:1-4,6
R./ Happy the man who has placed his trust in the Lord.
Happy indeed is the man
who follows not the counsel of the wicked;
nor lingers in the way of sinners
nor sits in the company of scorners,
but whose delight is the law of the Lord
and who ponders his law day and night.
R./ Happy the man who has placed his trust in the Lord.
He is like a tree that is planted
beside the flowing waters,
that yields its fruit in due season
and whose leaves shall never fade;
and all that he does shall prosper.
R./ Happy the man who has placed his trust in the Lord.
Not so are the wicked, not so!
For they like winnowed chaff
shall be driven away by the wind:
for the Lord guards the way of the just
but the way of the wicked leads to doom.
R./ Happy the man who has placed his trust in the Lord.
SECOND READING           Philippians 3:8-14
I look on everything as so much rubbish if only I can have Christ
I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage
of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have accepted the loss of
everything, and I look on everything as so much rubbish if only I can
have Christ and be given a place in him. I am no longer trying for
perfection by my own efforts, the perfection that comes from the Law,
but I want only the perfection that comes through faith in Christ, and
is from God and based on faith. All I want is to know Christ and the
power of his resurrection and to share his sufferings by reproducing
the pattern of his death. That is the way I can hope to take my place
in the resurrection of the dead. Not that I have become perfect yet: I
have not yet won, but I am still running, trying to capture the prize
for which Christ Jesus captured me. I can assure you my brothers, I am
far from thinking that I have already won. All I can say is that I
forget the past and I strain ahead for what is still to come; I am
racing for the finish, for the prize to which God calls us upwards to
receive in Christ Jesus.
GOSPEL ACCLAMATION           John 8:31-32
Glory to you, O Christ, you are the Word of God.
If you make my word your home
you will indeed be my disciples,
and you will learn the truth, says the Lord.
Glory to you, O Christ, you are the Word of God.
GOSPEL           Matthew 5:13-16
Your light must shine in the sight of men
Jesus said to his disciples: �You are the salt of the earth. But if
salt becomes tasteless, what can make it salty again? It is good for
nothing, and can only be thrown out to be trampled underfoot by men.
�You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill-top cannot be
hidden. No one lights a lamp to put it under a tub; they put it on the
lamp-stand where it shines for everyone in the house. In the same way
your light must shine in the sight of men, so that, seeing your good
works, they may give the praise to your Father in heaven.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Lord,
accept the gifts we bring
on this feast of Saint David.
Let the offering they will become
win us your forgiveness
and give honour to your name.
We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON           Cf. 1 Cor 1:23-24
We proclaim Christ crucified;
Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Almighty God,
you have strengthened us with this sacrament.
Grant that we may follow Saint David
in seeking you above all things
and living always the new life of Christ.
We ask this in the name of Jesus, the Lord.
PRAYER OVER THE PEOPLE
Confirm the hearts of your faithful, O Lord, we pray,
and strengthen them by the power of your grace,
that they may be constant in making supplication to you
and sincere in love for one another.
Through Christ our Lord.

From the Office of Readings

First Reading            1 Thessalonians 2:1-13,19-20
For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was not in
vain; but though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at
Philippi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the
gospel of God in the face of great opposition. For our appeal does not
spring from error or uncleanness, nor is it made with guile; but just
as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we
speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our hearts. For
we never used either words of flattery, as you know, or a cloak for
greed, as God is witness; nor did we seek glory from men, whether from
you or from others, though we might have made demands as apostles of
Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nurse taking care of her
children. So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to
share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves,
because you had become very dear to us.
For you remember our labor and toil, brethren; we worked night and day,
that we might not burden any of you, while we preached to you the
gospel of God. You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous
and blameless was our behavior to you believers; for you know how, like
a father with his children, we exhorted each one of you and encouraged
you and charged you to lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into
his own kingdom and glory. And we also thank God constantly for this,
that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you
accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word
of God, which is at work in you believers.
For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus
at his coming? Is it not you? For you are our glory and joy.
Responsory
I have run the great race, I have finished the course, I have kept
faith,*
and now the prize, the garland of righteousness, awaits me.
I know who it is in whom I have trusted, and am confident of his power
to keep safe what I have put into his charge until the great Day,*
and now the prize, the garland of righteousness, awaits me.
Second Reading
From a Life of St David by Rhygyferch
The holy Father David prescribed an austere system of monastic
observance, requiring every monk to toil daily at manual labour and to
lead a common life. So with unflagging zeal they work with hand and
foot, they put the yoke to their own shoulders, and in their own holy
hands, they bear the tools for labour in the fields. So by their own
strength they procure every necessity for the community, while refusing
possessions and detesting riches. They make no use of oxen for
ploughing. Everyone is rich to himself and to the brethren, every man
is his own ox.
When the field work is done they return to the enclosure of the
monastery, to pass their time till evening at reading, writing, or in
prayer. Then when the signal is heard for evening prayer everyone
leaves what he is at and in silence, without any idle conversation,
they make their way to church. When, with heart and voice attuned, they
have completed the psalmody, they remain on their knees until stars
appearing in the heaven bring day to its close; yet when all have gone,
the father remains there alone making his own private prayer for the
well-being of the church.
Shedding daily abundance of tears, offering daily his sweet-scented
sacrifice of praise, aglow with an intensity of love, he consecrated
with pure hands the fitting oblation of the Lord�s body, and so, at the
conclusion of the morning offices, attaining alone to the converse of
angels. Then the whole day was spent undaunted and untired, in
teaching, praying, on his knees, caring for the brethren, and for
orphans and children, and widows, and everyone in need, for the weak
and the sick, for travellers and in feeding many. The rest of this
stern way of life would be profitable to imitate, but the shortness of
this account forbids our entering upon it, but in every way his life
was ordered in imitation of the monks of Egypt.
Responsory
I have found David, my servant, and with my holy oil anointed him.*
I will grant his heart�s desire.
I have exalted one chosen from the people.*
I will grant his heart�s desire.
