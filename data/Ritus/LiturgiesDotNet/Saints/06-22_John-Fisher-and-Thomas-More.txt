Deus, qui verae fidei formam in martyrio consummasti, concede
propitius, ut, beatorum Ioannis et Thomae intercessione roborati,
fidem, quam ore profitemur, testimonio vitae confirmemus.
O God, who in martyrdom
have brought true faith to its highest expression,
graciously grant
that, strengthened through the intercession
of Saints John Fisher and Thomas More,
we may confirm by the witness of our life
the faith we profess with our lips.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          I Peter 4:12-19
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal which comes upon you
to prove you, as though something strange were happening to you. But
rejoice in so far as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also
rejoice and be glad when His glory is revealed. If you are reproached
for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the spirit of glory
and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or
a thief, or a wrongdoer, or a mischief-maker; yet if one suffers as a
Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify
God. For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of
God; and if it begins with us, what will be the end of those who do not
obey the gospel of God? And "If the righteous man is scarcely saved,
where will the impious and sinner appear?" Therefore let those who
suffer according to God's will do right and entrust their souls to a
faithful Creator.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
"The LORD has done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those who sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:10
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Matthew 10:34-39
Jesus said: "Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I
have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man
against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be
those of his own household. He who loves father or mother more than me
is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is
not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is
not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses
his life for my sake will find it. "

SECOND READING
From a letter written in prison to his daughter Margaret by Saint
Thomas More
(The English Works of Sir Thomas More, London, 1557, p. 1454)
With good hope I shall commit myself wholly to God
Although I know well, Margaret, that because of my past wickedness I
deserve to be abandoned by God, I cannot but trust in his merciful
goodness.  His grace has strengthened me until now and made me content
to lose goods, land, and life as well, rather than to swear against my
conscience.  God�s grace has given the king a gracious frame of mind
toward me, so that as yet he has taken from me nothing but my liberty.
In doing this His Majesty has done me such great good with respect to
spiritual profit that I trust that among all the great benefits he has
heaped so abundantly upon me I count my imprisonment the very
greatest.  I cannot, therefore, mistrust the grace of God.  Either he
shall keep the king in that gracious frame of mind to continue to do me
no harm, or else, if it be his pleasure that for my other sins I suffer
in this case as I shall not deserve, then his grace shall give me the
strength to bear it patiently, and perhaps even gladly.

By the merits of his bitter passion joined to mine and far surpassing
in merit for me all that I can suffer myself, his bounteous goodness
shall release me from the pains of purgatory and shall increase my
reward in heaven besides.

I will not mistrust him, Meg, though I shall feel myself weakening and
on the verge of being overcome with fear.  I shall remember how Saint
Peter at a blast of wind began to sink because of his lack of faith,
and I shall do as he did: call upon Christ and pray to him for help.
And then I trust he shall place his holy hand on me and in the stormy
seas hold me up from drowning.
And if he permits me to play Saint Peter further and to fall to
the ground and to swear and forswear, may God our Lord in his tender
mercy keep me from this, and let me lose if it so happen, and never win
thereby!  Still, if this should happen, afterward I trust that in his
goodness he will look on me with pity as he did upon Saint Peter, and
make me stand up again and confess the truth of my conscience afresh
and endure here the shame and harm of my own fault.

And finally, Margaret, I know this well: that without my fault he will
not let me be lost.  I shall, therefore, with good hope commit myself
wholly to him.  And if he permits me to perish for my faults, then I
shall serve as praise for his justice.  But in good faith, Meg, I trust
that his tender pity shall keep my poor soul safe and make me commend
his mercy.

And, therefore, my own good daughter, do not let your mind be troubled
over anything that shall happen to me in this world.  Nothing can come
but what God wills.  And I am very sure that whatever that be, however
bad it may seem, it shall indeed be the best.
RESPONSORY
When the martyrs of Christ were suffering,
they turned their minds to heavenly things and cried out:
- Help us, O Lord, to complete your work without wavering.

Look down upon your servants
and upon the works of your hands.
- Help us, O Lord, to complete your work without wavering.
COLLECT
O God, who in martyrdom
have brought true faith to its highest expression,
graciously grant
that, strengthened through the intercession
of Saints John Fisher and Thomas More,
we may confirm by the witness of our life
the faith we profess with our lips.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
