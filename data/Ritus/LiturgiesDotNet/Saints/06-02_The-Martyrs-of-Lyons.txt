The Collect
Grant, O Lord, that we who keep the feast of the holy martyrs Blandina
and her companions may be rooted and grounded in love of you, and may
endure the sufferings of this life for the glory that shall be revealed
in us; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and
the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

The First Lesson
1 Peter 1:3-9

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great
mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance
that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
who are being protected by the power of God through faith for a
salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

In this you rejoice, even if now for a little while you have had to
suffer various trials, so that the genuineness of your faithbeing more
precious than gold that, though perishable, is tested by firemay be
found to result in praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is
revealed. Although you have not seen him, you love him; and even though
you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an
indescribable and glorious joy, for you are receiving the outcome of
your faith, the salvation of your souls.
Psalm 126
In convertendo

1
When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, *
then were we like those who dream.

2
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *
and our tongue with shouts of joy.

3
Then they said among the nations, *
"The LORD has done great things for them."

4
The LORD has done great things for us, *
and we are glad indeed.

5
Restore our fortunes, O LORD, *
like the watercourses of the Negev.

6
Those who sowed with tears *
will reap with songs of joy.

7
Those who go out weeping, carrying the seed, *
will come again with joy, shouldering their sheaves.

or
Psalm 34:1-8
Benedicam Domine

1
I will bless the LORD at all times; *
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.

2
I will glory in the LORD; *
let the humble hear and rejoice.

3
Proclaim with me the greatness of the LORD; *
let us exalt his Name together.

4
I sought the LORD, and he answered me *
and delivered me out of all my terror.

5
Look upon him and be radiant, *
and let not your faces be ashamed.

6
I called in my affliction and the LORD heard me *
and saved me from all my troubles.

7
The angel of the LORD encompasses those who fear him, *
and he will deliver them.

8
Taste and see that the LORD is good; *
happy are they who trust in him!

The Gospel
Mark 8:34-38

He called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, If any want
to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their
cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose
it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the
gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole
world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for
their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this
adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be
ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
