Praesta, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut humanae salutis mysteria, cuius
primordia beati Ioseph fideli custodiae commisisti, Ecclesia tua, ipso
intercedente, iugiter servet implenda.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that by Saint Joseph's intercession
your Church may constantly watch over

God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Sm 7:4-5a, 12-14a, 16
The LORD spoke to Nathan and said:
�Go, tell my servant David,
�When your time comes and you rest with your ancestors,
I will raise up your heir after you, sprung from your loins,
and I will make his kingdom firm.
It is he who shall build a house for my name.
And I will make his royal throne firm forever.
I will be a father to him,
and he shall be a son to me.
Your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before me;
your throne shall stand firm forever.��
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 89:2-3, 4-5, 27 and 29
Semen eius in aeternum manebit.
R.    (37)  The son of David will live for ever.
The promises of the LORD I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness,
For you have said, �My kindness is established forever�;
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R.    The son of David will live for ever.
�I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
I have sworn to David my servant:
Forever will I confirm your posterity
and establish your throne for all generations.�
R.    The son of David will live for ever.
�He shall say of me, �You are my father,
my God, the Rock, my savior.�
Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him,
and my covenant with him stands firm.�
R.    The son of David will live for ever.
SECOND READING          Rom 4:13, 16-18, 22
Brothers and sisters:
It was not through the law
that the promise was made to Abraham and his descendants
that he would inherit the world,
but through the righteousness that comes from faith.
For this reason, it depends on faith,
so that it may be a gift,
and the promise may be guaranteed to all his descendants,
not to those who only adhere to the law
but to those who follow the faith of Abraham,
who is the father of all of us, as it is written,
I have made you father of many nations.
He is our father in the sight of God,
in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead
and calls into being what does not exist.
He believed, hoping against hope,
that he would become the father of many nations,
according to what was said, Thus shall your descendants be.
That is why it was credited to him as righteousness.
VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          Ps 84:5
Beati qui habitant in domo tua, Domine, in perpetuum laudabunt te.
Blessed are those who dwell in your house, O Lord,
they will never cease to praise you.
GOSPEL (1st Option)          Mt 1:16, 18-21, 24a
Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary.
Of her was born Jesus who is called the Christ.
Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.
When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph,
but before they lived together,
she was found with child through the Holy Spirit.
Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man,
yet unwilling to expose her to shame,
decided to divorce her quietly.
Such was his intention when, behold,
the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
�Joseph, son of David,
do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home.
For it is through the Holy Spirit
that this child has been conceived in her.
She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus,
because he will save his people from their sins.�
When Joseph awoke,
he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him
and took his wife into his home.
GOSPEL (2nd Option)          Luke 2:41-51a
Each year Jesus� parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover,
and when he was twelve years old,
they went up according to festival custom.
After they had completed its days, as they were returning,
the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem,
but his parents did not know it.
Thinking that he was in the caravan,
they journeyed for a day
and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances,
but not finding him,
they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.
After three days they found him in the temple,
sitting in the midst of the teachers,
listening to them and asking them questions,
and all who heard him were astounded
at his understanding and his answers.
When his parents saw him,
they were astonished,
and his mother said to him,
�Son, why have you done this to us?
Your father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety.�
And he said to them,
�Why were you looking for me?
Did you not know that I must be in my Father�s house?�
But they did not understand what he said to them.
He went down with them and came to Nazareth,
and was obedient to them.

Liturgy of the Eucharist

PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Quaesumus, Domine, ut, sicut beatus Ioseph Unigenito tuo, nato de Maria
Virgine, pia devotione deserviit, ita et nos mundo corde tuis altaribus
mereamur ministrare.
We pray, O Lord,
that, just as Saint Joseph served with loving care
your Only Begotten Son, born of the Virgin Mary,
so we may be worthy to minister
with a pure heart at your altar.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE          The mission of St. Joseph
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus: Et
te in sollemnitate beati Ioseph debitis magnificare praeconiis,
benedicere et praedicare. Qui et vir iustus, a te Deiparae Virgini
Sponsus est datus, et fidelis servus ac prudens, super Familiam tuam
est constitutus, ut Unigenitum tuum, Sancti Spiritus obumbratione
conceptum, paterna vice custodiret, Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Per
quem maiestatem tuam laudant Angeli, adorant Dominationes, tremunt
Potestates. Caeli caelorumque Virtutes, ac beata Seraphim, socia
exsultatione concelebrant. Cum quibus et nostras voces ut admitti
iubeas, deprecamur, supplici confessione dicentes: Sanctus.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
and on the Solemnity of Saint Joseph
to give you fitting praise,
to glorify you and bless you.
For this just man was given by you
as spouse to the Virgin Mother of God
and set as a wise and faithful servant
in charge of your household,
to watch like a father over your Only Begotten Son,
who was conceived by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit,
our Lord Jesus Christ.
Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in humble praise, as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Mt 25: 21
Euge, serve bone et fidelis: intra in gaudium Domini tui.
Well done, good and faithful servant.
Come, share your master's joy.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Familiam tuam, quaesumus, Domine, quam de beati Ioseph sollemnitate
laetantem ex huius altaris alimonia satiasti, perpetua protectione
defende, et tua in ea propitiatus dona custodi.
Defend with unfailing protection,
O Lord, we pray,
the family you have nourished
with food from this altar,
as they rejoice at the Solemnity of Saint Joseph,
and graciously keep safe your gifts among them.
Through Christ our Lord.
