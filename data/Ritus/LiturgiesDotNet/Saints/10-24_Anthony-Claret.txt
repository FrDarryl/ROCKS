FIRST READING          Isaiah 52: 7-10
How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of him who brings glad tidings,
Announcing peace, bearing good news,
announcing salvation, and saying to Zion,
"Your God is King!"
Hark! Your sentinels raise a cry,
together they shout for joy,
For they see directly, before their eyes,
the LORD restoring Zion.
Break out together in song,
O ruins of Jerusalem!
For the LORD comforts his people,
he redeems Jerusalem.
The LORD has bared his holy arm
in the sight of all the nations;
All the ends of the earth will behold
the salvation of our God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 96: 1-2a, 2b-3, 7-8, 10
R.\ Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Sing to the LORD a new song;
sing to the LORD, all the earth.
Sing to the LORD, bless his name;
R.\ Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Announce his salvation day after day.
Tell God's glory among the nations;
among all peoples, God's marvelous deeds.
R.\ Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Give to the LORD, you families of nations,
give to the LORD glory and might;
give to the LORD the glory due his name!
Bring gifts and enter his courts;
R.\ Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Say among the nations: The LORD is king.
The world will surely stand fast, never to be moved.
God rules the peoples with fairness.
R.\ Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
ALLELUIA          Mk 1:17
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Mark 1: 14-20
After John the Baptist had been arrested,
Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the Gospel of God:
"This is the time of fulfillment.
The Kingdom of God is at hand.
Repent, and believe in the Gospel."

As he passed by the Sea of Galilee,
he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea;
they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them,
"Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Then they abandoned their nets and followed him.
He walked along a little farther
and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
They too were in a boat mending their nets.
Then he called them.
So they left their father Zebedee in the boat
along with the hired men and followed him.

SECOND READING
From a work by Saint Anthony Mary Claret, bishop
(L'Egosimo vinto, Romae 1869, 60)
The love of Christ drives us on
Driven by the fire of the Holy Spirit, the holy apostles traveled
throughout the earth. Inflamed with the same fire, apostolic
missionaries have reached, are now reaching, and will continue to reach
the ends of the earth, from one pole to the other, in order to proclaim
the word of God. They are deservedly able to apply to themselves those
words of the apostle Paul: "The love of Christ drives us on."
The love of Christ arouses us, urges us to run, and to fly, lifted on
the wings of holy zeal. The zealous man desires and achieves all great
things and he labors strenuously so that God may always be better
known, loved and served in this world and in the life to come, for this
holy love is without end.
Because he is concerned also for his neighbor, the man of zeal works to
fulfill his desire that all men be content on this earth and happy and
blessed in their heavenly homeland, that all may be saved, and that no
one may perish for ever, or offend God, or remain even for a moment in
sin. Such are the concerns we observe in the holy apostles and in all
who are driven by the apostolic spirit.
For myself, I say this to you: The man who burns with the fire of
divine love is a son of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and wherever he
goes, he enkindles that flame; he deserves and works with all this
strength to inflame all men with the fire of God's love. Nothing deters
him: he rejoices in poverty; he labors strenuously; he welcomes
hardships; he laughs off false accusations; he rejoices in anguish. He
thinks only of how he might follow Jesus Christ and imitate him by his
prayers, his labors, his sufferings, and by caring always and only for
the glory of God and the salvation of souls.
RESPONSORY          1 Thessalonians 2:8; Galatians 4:19
I have longed to give you the Gospel,
and more than that, to give you my very life,
- you have become very dear to me.
My little children, I am like a mother giving birth to you,
until Christ is formed in you.
- You have become very dear to me.
