Effunde super nos, quaesumus, Domine, spiritum, quo beatam Margaritam
Mariam singulariter ditasti, ut scire valeamus supereminentem scientiae
caritatem Christi, et impleamur in omnem plenitudinem tuam.
Pour out on us, we pray, O Lord,
the spirit with which you so remarkably endowed
Saint Margaret Mary,
so that we may come to know
that love of Christ which surpasses all understanding
and be utterly filled with your fullness.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 3:14-19
Brothers and sisters:
I kneel before the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory
to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self,
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith;
that you, rooted and grounded in love,
may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          23:1b-3a, 4, 5, 6
Dominus pascit me, et nihil mihi deerit.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;
Beside restful waters he leads me;
he refreshes my soul.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Even though I walk in the dark valley
I fear no evil; for you are at my side
With your rod and your staff
that give me courage.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
You spread the table before me
in the sight of my foes;
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Only goodness and kindness follow me
all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD
for years to come.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
ALLELUIA          Cf. Mt. 11:24
Benedictus es, Pater, Domine caeli et terrae, quia mysteria regni
parvulis revelasti.
Blessed are you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
you have revealed to little ones the mysteries of the kingdom.
GOSPEL          Matthew 11:25-30
At that time Jesus answered:
"I give praise to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
for although you have hidden these things
from the wise and the learned
you have revealed them to the childlike.
Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.
All things have been handed over to me by my Father.
No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son
and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.

"Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart;
and you will find rest for yourselves.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."

SECOND READING
From a letter of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, virgin
We must know the love of Christ which surpasses all knowledge
It seems to me that our Lord's earnest desire to have his Sacred Heart
honored in a special way is directed toward renewing the effects of
redemption in our souls. For the sacred heart is an inexhaustible
fountain and its sole desire is to pour itself out into the hearts of
the humble so as to free them and prepare them to lead lives according
to his good pleasure.

From this divine heart three streams flow endlessly. The first is the
stream of mercy for sinners; it pours into their hearts sentiments of
contrition and repentance. The second is the stream of charity which
helps all in need and especially aids those seeking perfection to find
the means of surmounting their difficulties. From the third stream flow
love and light for the benefit of his friends who have attained
perfection; these he wishes to unite to himself so that they may share
his knowledge and commandments and, in their individual ways, devote
themselves wholly to advancing his glory.

This divine heart is an abyss of all blessings, and into it the poor
should submerge all their needs. It is an abyss of joy in which all of
us can immerse our sorrows. It is an abyss of lowliness to counteract
our foolishness, an abyss of mercy for the wretched, an abyss of love
to meet our every need.

Therefore, you must unite yourselves to the heart of our Lord Jesus
Christ, both at the beginning of your conversion in order to obtain
proper dispositions, and at its end in order to make reparation. Are
you making no progress in prayer? Then you need only offer God the
prayers which the Savior has poured out for us in the sacrament of the
altar. Offer God his fervent love in reparation for your sluggishness.
In the course of every activity pray as follows: "My God, I do this or
I endure that in the heart of your Son and according to his holy
counsels. I offer it to you in reparation for anything blameworthy or
imperfect in my actions." Continue to do this in every circumstance of
life. And every time that some punishment, affliction or injustice
comes your way, say to yourself: "Accept this as sent to you by the
Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ in order to unite yourself to him."

But above all preserve peace of heart. This is more valuable than any
treasure. In order to preserve it there is nothing more useful than
renouncing your own will and substituting for it the will of the divine
heart. In this way his will can carry out for us whatever contributes
to his glory, and we will be happy to be his subjects and to trust
entirely in him.
RESPONSORY          Matthew 11:25-26; Ps 73:26
I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
for hiding these things from the learned and clever,
and revealing them to little children.
- Yes, Father, this is what you have willed.

The God of my heart is my portion for ever.
- Yes, Father, this is what you have willed.
