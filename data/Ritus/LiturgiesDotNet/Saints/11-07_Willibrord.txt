The Collect

O Lord our God, you call whom you will and send them where you choose:
We thank you for sending your servant Willibrord to be an apostle to
the Low Countries, to turn them from the worship of idols to serve you,
the living God; and we entreat you to preserve us from the temptation
to exchange the perfect freedom of your service for servitude to false
gods and to idols of our own devising; through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and
ever. Amen

First Reading
Acts 1:1-9

In the first book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus did and
taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven,
after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom
he had chosen. After his suffering he presented himself alive to them
by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and
speaking about the kingdom of God. While staying with them, he ordered
them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the
Father. "This," he said, "is what you have heard from me; for John
baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not
many days from now."

So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, is this the time
when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?" He replied, "It is not
for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own
authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." When he had said this, as they
were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their
sight.

The Psalm
Psalm 96:1-7
Cantate Domino

1
Sing to the LORD a new song; *
sing to the LORD, all the whole earth.

2
Sing to the LORD and bless his Name; *
proclaim the good news of his salvation from day to day.

3
Declare his glory among the nations *
and his wonders among all peoples.

4
For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; *
he is more to be feared than all gods.

5
As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; *
but it is the LORD who made the heavens.

6
Oh, the majesty and magnificence of his presence! *
Oh, the power and the splendor of his sanctuary!

7
Ascribe to the LORD, you families of the peoples; *
ascribe to the LORD honor and power.

or Psalm 98:1-4 Page 727, BCP
Cantate Domino

1
Sing to the LORD a new song, *
for he has done marvelous things.

2
With his right hand and his holy arm *
has he won for himself the victory.

3
The LORD has made known his victory; *
his righteousness has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.

4
He remembers his mercy and faithfulness to the house of Israel, *
and all the ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God.

Gospel Reading
Luke 10:1-9

The Lord appointed seventy others and sent them on ahead of him in
pairs to every town and place where he himself intended to go. He said
to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore
ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. Go
on your way. See, I am sending you out like lambs into the midst of
wolves. Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals; and greet no one on the
road. Whatever house you enter, first say, `Peace to this house!' And
if anyone is there who shares in peace, your peace will rest on that
person; but if not, it will return to you. Remain in the same house,
eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the laborer deserves to
be paid. Do not move about from house to house. Whenever you enter a
town and its people welcome you, eat what is set before you; cure the
sick who are there, and say to them, `The kingdom of God has come near
to you.'
