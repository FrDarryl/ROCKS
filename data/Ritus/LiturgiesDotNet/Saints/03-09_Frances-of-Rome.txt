Deus, qui nobis in beata Francisca singulare dedisti coniugalis et
monasticae conversationis exemplar, fac nos tibi perseveranter
deservire, ut in omnibus vitae adiunctis te conspicere et sequi

O God, who have given us in Saint Frances of Rome
a singular model of both married and monastic life,
grant us perseverance in your service,
that in every circumstance of life we may see and follow you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Proverbs 31:10-13, 19-20, 30-31
When one finds a worthy wife,
her value is far beyond pearls.
Her husband, entrusting his heart to her,
has an unfailing prize.
She brings him good, and not evil,
all the days of her life.
She obtains wool and flax
and makes cloth with skillful hands.
She puts her hands to the distaff,
and her fingers ply the spindle.
She reaches out her hands to the poor,
and extends her arms to the needy.
Charm is deceptive and beauty fleeting;
the woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
Give her a reward of her labors,
and let her works praise her at the city gates.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11
Benedicam Domino in omni tempore.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
praise shall be always in my mouth.
My soul will glory in the LORD
that the poor may hear and be glad.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
Magnify the LORD with me;
let us exalt his name together.
I sought the LORD, who answered me,
delivered me from all my fears.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
Look to God that you may be radiant with joy
and your faces may not blush for shame.
In my misfortune I called,
the LORD heard and saved me from all distress.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
The angel of the LORD, who encamps with them,
delivers all who fear God.
Learn to savor how good the LORD is;
happy are those who take refuge in him.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
Fear the LORD, you holy ones;
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.
The powerful grow poor and hungry,
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          John 13:34
Mandatum novum do vobis, dicit Dominus, ut diligatis invicem, sicut
dilexi vos.
I give you a new commandment;
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          Matthew 22:34-40
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,
they gathered together, and one of them,
a scholar of the law, tested him by asking,
"Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?"
He said to him,
"You shall love the Lord, your God,
with all your heart,
with all your soul,
and with all your mind.
This is the greatest and the first commandment.
The second is like it:
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."

Office of Readings

From the life of St. Frances of Rome by Mary Magdalene Anguillaria,
superior of the Oblates of the Tower of Specchi
Cap 6-7: Acta Sanctorum Martii 2, 188-189)
The patience and charity of St. Frances
God not only tested the patience of Frances with respect to her
material wealth, but, as I have said before and will reiterate, he also
tested her own body in a variety of ways, especially through long and
serious illnesses which she had to undergo. And yet no one ever
observed in her a tendency toward impatience. She never exhibited any
displeasure when she complied with an order, no matter how foolish.

Through the premature deaths of her sons whom she loved dearly, Frances
proved her constancy. With peace of soul she always reconciled herself
to the will of God and gave him thanks for all that happened. With the
same constancy she endured the slander of those who abused and reviled
her and her way of life. She did not show the least hint of aversion
toward them, even though she knew that they judged her rashly and spoke
falsely of her way of life. Rather, returning good for evil, she
habitually prayed to God for them.

God had not chosen her to be holy merely for her own advantage. Rather,
the gifts he conferred upon her were to be for the spiritual and
physical advantage of her neighbor. For this reason he made her so
lovable that anyone with whom she spoke would immediately feel
captivated by love for her and ready to help her in everything she
wanted. Divine power was present and working in her words, so that in a
few sentences she could bring consolation to the afflicted and the
anxious, calm the restless, pacify the angry, reconcile enemies and
extinguish long-standing hatreds and animosities. Again and again she
would prevent a planned revenge from being carried out. She seemed able
to subdue the passions of every type of person with a single word and
lead them to do whatever she asked.

For this reason people flocked to Frances from all directions, as to a
safe refuge. No one left her without being consoled, although she
openly rebuked them for their sins and fearlessly reproved them for
what was evil and displeasing to God.

Many different diseases were rampant in Rome. Fatal diseases and
plagues were everywhere, but the saint ignored the risk of contagion
and displayed the deepest kindness toward the poor and the needy. Here
empathy would first bring them to atone for their sins. Then she would
help them by her eager care, and urge them lovingly to accept their
trials, however difficult, from the hand of God. She would encourage
them to endure their sufferings for love of Christ, since he had
previously endured so much for them.

Frances was not satisfied with caring for the sick she could bring into
her home. She would seek them out in their cottages and in public
hospitals, and would refresh their thirst, smooth their beds, and bind
their sores. The more disgusting and sickening the stench, the greater
was the love and care with which she treated them.

She used to go to the Campo Santo with food and rich delicacies to be
distributed to the needy. On her return home she would bring pieces of
worn-out clothes and unclean rags which she would wash lovingly and
mend carefully, as if they were to be used for God himself. Then she
would fold them carefully and perfume them.

For thirty years Frances continued this service to the sick and the
stranger. While she was in her husband's house, she made frequent
visits to Saint Mary's and Saint Cecilia's hospitals in Trastevere, and
to the hospital of the Holy Spirit in Sassia and to a fourth hospital
in the Campo Santo. During epidemics like this it was not only
difficult to find doctors to care for the body but even priests to
provide remedies for the soul. She herself would seek them out and
bring them to those who were disposed to receive the sacraments of
penance and the Eucharist. In order to have a priest more readily
available to assist her in her apostolate, she supported, at her own
expense, a priest who would go to the hospitals and visit the sick whom
she had designated.
RESPONSORY       Ruth 3:10,11;Judith 13:25
May you be blessed by the Lord our God,
- for all the people know you are a woman of virtue.

The Lord has so glorified your name,
that your praise will never pass from memory.
- For all the people know you are a woman of virtue.
