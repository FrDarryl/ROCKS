Deus, qui beatum Ambrosium episcopum catholicae fidei doctorem et
apostolicae fortitudinis exemplum effecisti, excita in Ecclesia tua

FIRST READING          Ephesians 3:8-12
Brothers and sisters:
To me, the very least of all the holy ones, this grace was given,
to preach to the Gentiles the inscrutable riches of Christ,
and to bring to light for all what is the plan of the mystery
hidden from ages past in God who created all things,
so that the mani-fold wisdom of God
might now be made known through the Church
to the principalities and authorities in the heavens.
This was according to the eternal purpose
that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have boldness of speech
and confidence of access through faith in him.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          89:2-3,4-5,21-22,25,27
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The favors of the Lord I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever";
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
I have sworn to David, my servant:
For ever will I confirm your posterity
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have found David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
That my hand may be always with him,
and that my arm may make him strong."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,
and through my name shall his horn be exalted.
He shall say of me, 'You are my father,
my God, the Rock, my savior.'"
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Jn 10:14
Ego sum pastor bonus, dicit Dominus; et cognosco oves meas, et
cognoscunt me meae.
I am the good shepherd, says the Lord;
I know my sheep, and mine know me.
GOSPEL          John 10:11-16
Jesus said:
"I am the good shepherd.
A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
A hired man, who is not a shepherd
and whose sheep are not his own,
sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away,
and the wolf catches and scatters them.
This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd,
and I know mine and mine know me,
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father;
and I will lay down my life for the sheep.
I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold.
These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice,
and there will be one flock, one shepherd."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Illa nos, quaesumus, Domine, divina tractantes, Spiritus Sanctus fidei
luce perfundat, qua beatum Ambrosium ad gloriae tuae propagationem
iugiter collustravit.
As we celebrate the divine mysteries, O Lord, we pray,
may the Holy Spirit fill us with that light of faith
by which he constantly enlightened Saint Ambrose
for the spreading of your glory.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON         Cf. Ps 1: 2-3
Qui meditabitur in lege Domini die ac nocte, dabit fructum suum in
tempore suo.
He who ponders the law of the Lord day and night
will yield fruit in due season.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Huius sacramenti, Domine, virtute roboratos, fac nos beati Ambrosii
documentis ita proficere, ut, viriliter per tuas semitas festinantes,
ad aeterni suavitatem convivii praeparemur.
Lead us, who have been strengthened
by the power of this Sacrament, O Lord,
so to profit from the teaching of Saint Ambrose
that, hastening fearlessly along your paths,
we may be prepared for the delights of the eternal banquet.
Through Christ our Lord.

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a letter by St. Ambrose, bishop
(Epist. 2:1-2,4-5,7: PL edit. [845,] 879, 881)
By the grace of your words win over your people
You have entered upon the office of bishop. Sitting at the helm of the
Church, you pilot the ship against the waves. Take firm hold of the
rudder of faith so that the severe storms of this world cannot disturb
you. The sea is mighty and vast, but do not be afraid, for as Scripture
says: he has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the
waters.

The Church of the Lord is built upon the rock of the apostles among so
many dangers in the world; it therefore remains unmoved. The Church's
foundation is unshakeable and firm against the assaults of the raging
sea. Waves lash at the Church but do not shatter it. Although the
elements of this world constantly beat upon the Church with crashing
sounds, the Church possesses the safest harbour of salvation for all in
distress. Although the Church is tossed about on the sea, it rides
easily on rivers, especially those rivers that Scripture speaks of: The
rivers have lifted up their voice. These are the rivers flowing from
the heart of the man who is given drink by Christ and who receives from
the Spirit of God. When these rivers overflow with the grace of the
Spirit, they lift up their voice.

There is also a stream which flows down on God's saints like a torrent.
There is also a rushing river giving joy to the heart that is at peace
and makes for peace. Whoever has received from the fullness of this
river, like John the Evangelist, like Peter and Paul, lifts up his
voice. Just as the apostles lifted up their voices and preached the
Gospel throughout the world, so those who drink these waters begin to
preach the good news of the Lord Jesus.

Drink, then, from Christ, so that your voice may also be heard. Store
up in your mind the water that is Christ, the water that praises the
Lord. Store up water from many sources, the water that rains down from
the clouds of prophecy.

Whoever gathers water from the mountains and leads it to himself or
draws it from springs, is himself a source of dew like the clouds. Fill
your soul, then, with this water, so that your land may not be dry, but
watered by your own springs.

He who reads much and understands much, receives his fill. He who is
full, refreshes others. So Scripture says: If the clouds are full, they
will pour rain upon the earth.

Therefore, let your words be rivers, clean and limpid, so that in your
exhortations you may charm the ears of your people. And by the grace of
your words win them over to follow your leadership. Let your sermons be
full of understanding. Solomon says: The weapons of the understanding
are the lips of the wise; and in another place he says: Let your lips
be bound with wisdom. That is, let the meaning of your words shine
forth, let understanding blaze out. See that your addresses and
expositions do not need to invoke the authority of others, but let your
words be their own defence. Let no word escape your lips in vain or be
uttered without depth of meaning.
RESPONSORY          2 Timothy 4:2; Sirach 48: 4,8
Proclaim the message, in season and out of season;
- refute falsehood, correct error, call to obedience.
Who is able to boast as you can?
You have anointed kings as champions of righteousness.
- Refute falsehood, correct error, call to obedience.
COLLECT

a teacher of the Catholic faith

raise up in your Church men after your own heart
to govern her with courage and wisdom.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
