MASS

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON
Sanguis sanctorum martyrum pro Christo effusus est in terris; ideo
adepti sunt praemia sempiterna.
The blood of the holy Martyrs
was poured out for Christ upon the earth;
therefore they have gained everlasting rewards.
COLLECT
Deus, qui filios adoptionis in toto orbe terrarum multiplicare dignatus
es, et sanguinem beatorum martyrum Andreae et sociorum uberrimum semen
christianorum effecisti, concede, ut eorum muniamur auxilio et iugiter
proficiamus exemplo.
O God, who have been pleased to increase
your adopted children in all the world,
and who made the blood of the Martyrs
Saint Andrew Kim Tae-gon and his companions
a most fruitful seed of Christians,
grant that we may be defended by their help
and profit always from their example.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING (1st Option)         Wisdom 3:1-9
The souls of the just are in the hand of God,
and no torment shall touch them.
They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead;
and their passing away was thought an affliction
and their going forth from us, utter destruction.
But they are in peace.
For if before men, indeed they be punished,
yet is their hope full of immortality;
Chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,
because God tried them
and found them worthy of himself.
As gold in the furnace, he proved them,
and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.
In the time of their visitation they shall shine,
and shall dart about as sparks through stubble;
They shall judge nations and rule over peoples,
and the Lord shall be their King forever.
Those who trust in him shall understand truth,
and the faithful shall abide with him in love:
Because grace and mercy are with his holy ones,
and his care is with his elect.
FIRST READING (2nd Option)         Romans 8:31b-39
Brothers and sisters:
If God is for us, who can be against us?
He who did not spare his own Son
but handed him over for us all,
how will he not also give us everything else along with him?
Who will bring a charge against God's chosen ones?
It is God who acquits us.
Who will condemn?
It is Christ Jesus who died, rather, was raised,
who also is at the right hand of God,
who indeed intercedes for us.
What will separate us from the love of Christ?
Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?
As it is written:

For your sake we are being slain all the day;
we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered.

No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly
through him who loved us.
For I am convinced that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities,
nor present things, nor future things,
nor powers, nor height, nor depth,
nor any other creature will be able to separate us
from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
�The LORD has done great things for them.�
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          1 Peter 4:14
If you are insulted for the name of Christ, blessed are you,
for the Spirit of God rests upon you.
GOSPEL          Luke 9:23=26
Jesus said to all,
"If anyone wishes to come after me,
he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or
forfeit himself?
Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words,
the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his glory
and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Oblata populi tui respice propitius, omnipotens Deus, et beatorum
martyrum intercessione concede, nos ipsos sacrificium tibi acceptabile
in totius effici mundi salutem.
Look with favor, almighty God,
on the offerings of your people
and, through the intercession of the blessed Martyrs,
grant that we ourselves may become
a sacrifice acceptable to you
for the salvation of all the world.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Matthew 10:32
Omnis qui confitebitur me coram hominibus, confitebor et ego eum coram
Patre meo, qui est in caelis, dicit Dominus.
Everyone who acknowledges me before others
I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Fortium esca enutriti, in celebratione beatorum martyrum, te, Domine,
suppliciter exoramus, ut, Christo fideliter inhaerentes, in Ecclesia ad
salutem omnium operemur.
Nourished with the food of the valiant
as we celebrate the blessed Martyrs,
we humbly ask you, O Lord,
that, clinging faithfully to Christ,
we may labor in the Church for the salvation of all.
Through Christ our Lord.

SECOND READING
From the final exhortation of Andrew Kim Taegon, priest and martyr
(Pro Corea Documenta, ed. Mission Catholique Soul, Soul/Paris, 1938,
vol. 1, 74-75)
Love and perseverance are the crown of faith
My brothers and sisters, my dearest friends, think again and again on
this: God has ruled over all things in heaven and on earth from the
beginning of time; then reflect on why and for what purpose he chose
each one of us to be created in his own image and likeness. In this
world of perils and hardship if we did not recognize the Lord as our
Creator, there would be no benefit either in being born or in our
continued existence. We have come into the world by God�s grace; by
that same grace we have received baptism, entrance into the Church, and
the honor of being called Christians. Yet what good will this do us if
we are Christians in name alone and not in fact? We would have come
into the world for nothing, we would have entered the Church for
nothing, and we would have betrayed even God and his grace. It would be
better never to have been born than to receive the grace of God and
then to sin against him.

Look at the farmer who cultivates his rice fields. In season he plows,
then fertilizes the earth; never counting the cost, he labors under the
sun to nurture the seed he has planted. When harvest time comes and the
rice crop is abundant, forgetting his labor and sweat, he rejoices with
an exultant heart. But if the crop is sparse and there is nothing but
straw and husks, the farmer broods over his toil and sweat and turns
his back on that field with a disgust that is all the greater the
harder he has toiled.

The Lord is like a farmer and we are the field of rice that he
fertilizes with his grace and by the mystery of the incarnation and the
redemption irrigates with his blood, in order that we will grow and
reach maturity. When harvest time comes, the day of judgment, those who
have grown to maturity in the grace of God will find the joy of adopted
children in the kingdom of heaven; those who have not grown to maturity
will become God�s enemies and, even though they were once his children,
they will be punished according to their deeds for all eternity.

Dearest brothers and sisters: when he was in the world, the Lord Jesus
bore countless sorrows and by his own passion and death founded his
Church; now he gives it increase through the sufferings of his
faithful. No matter how fiercely the powers of this world oppress and
oppose the Church, they will never bring it down. Ever since his
ascension and from the time of the apostles to the present, the Lord
Jesus has made his Church grow even in the midst of tribulations.

For the last fifty or sixty years, ever since the coming of the Church
to our own land of Korea, the faithful have suffered persecution over
and over again. Persecution still rages and as a result many who are
friends in the household of the faith, myself among them, have been
thrown into prison and like you are experiencing severe distress.
Because we have become the one Body, should not our hearts be grieved
for the members who are suffering? Because of the human ties that bind
us, should we not feel deeply the pain of our separation?

But, as the Scriptures say, God numbers the very hairs of our head and
in his all-embracing providence he has care over us all. Persecution,
therefore, can only be regarded as the command of the Lord or as a
prize he gives or as a punishment he permits.

Hold fast, then, to the will of God and with all your heart fight the
good fight under the leadership of Jesus; conquer again the diabolical
power of this world that Christ has already vanquished.

I beg you not to fail in your love for one another, but to support one
another and to stand fast until the Lord mercifully delivers us from
our trials.

There are twenty of us in this place and by God�s grace we are so far
all well. If any of us is executed, I ask you not to forget our
families. I have many things to say, yet how can pen and paper capture
what I feel? I end this letter. As we are all near the final ordeal, I
urge you to remain steadfast in faith, so that at last we will all
reach heaven and there rejoice together. I embrace you all in love.
RESPONSORY          2 Corinthians 4:11; Psalm 44:3
These are the martyrs who bore witness to Christ.
Praising the Lord, they feared no evil.
� The blood of martyrs is the seed of Christians.

They are as unknown, yet well known,
as dying, yet living still,
as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
� The blood of martyrs is the seed of Christians.
COLLECT
O God, who have been pleased to increase
your adopted children in all the world,
and who made the blood of the Martyrs
Saint Andrew Kim Tae-gon and his companions
a most fruitful seed of Christians,
grant that we may be defended by their help
and profit always from their example.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
