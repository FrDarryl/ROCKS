ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          1 Samuel 2:35
I shall raise up for myself a faithful priest
who will act in accord with my heart and my mind, says the Lord.
COLLECT
O God, who are glorified in the Bishop Saint Martin
both by his life and death,
make new, we pray,
the wonders of your grace in our hearts,
that neither death nor life
may separate us from your love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 61:1-3abcd
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
because the LORD has anointed me;
He has sent me to bring glad tidings to the lowly,
to heal the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives
and release to the prisoners,
To announce a year of favor from the LORD
and a day of vindication by our God,
to comfort all who mourn;
To place on those who mourn in Zion
a diadem instead of ashes,
To give them oil of gladness in place of mourning,
a glorious mantle instead of a listless spirit.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 89:2-3, 4-5, 21-22, 25 and 27

R. (see 2a) For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The favors of the LORD I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever";
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
I have sworn to David my servant:
Forever will I confirm your posterity
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have found David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
That my hand may be always with him,
and that my arm may make him strong."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,
and through my name shall his horn be exalted.
He shall say of me, 'You are my father,
my God, the rock, my savior."'
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          John 13:34
I give you a new commandment:
Love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          Matthew 25:31-40
Jesus said to his disciples:
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
and all the angels with him,
he will sit upon his glorious throne,
and all the nations will be assembled before him.
And he will separate them one from another,
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right,
`Come, you who are blessed by my Father.
Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food,
I was thirsty and you gave me drink,
a stranger and you welcomed me,
naked and you clothed me,
ill and you cared for me,
in prison and you visited me.'
Then the righteous will answer him and say,
`Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,
or thirsty and give you drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you,
or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?'
And the king will say to them in reply,
`Amen, I say to you, whatever you did
for one of the least brothers of mine, you did for me."'
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Sanctify these offerings, we pray, Lord God,
which we joyfully present in honor of Saint Martin,
so that through them our life may always be directed
whether in tribulation or in prosperity.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Mt 25:40
Amen, I say to you:
Whatever you did for one of the least of my brethren,
you did it for me, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Grant to us who have been restored
by this Sacrament of unity, O Lord,
perfect harmony with your will in all things,
that, just as Saint Martin submitted himself entirely to you,
so we, too, may glory in being truly yours.
Through Christ our Lord.

A letter of Sulpicius Severus
(Epist. 3,6. 9-10. 11. 14-17. 21: SC 133.336-344)
Martin the poor and humble man
Martin knew long in advance the time of his death and he told his
brethren that it was near. Meanwhile, he found himself obliged to make
a visitation of the parish of Candes. The clergy of that church were
quarrelling, and he wished to reconcile them. Although he knew that his
days on earth were few, he did not refuse to undertake the journey for
such a purpose, for he believed that he would bring his virtuous life
to a good end if by his efforts peace was restored in the church.
He spent some time in Candes, or rather in its church, where he stayed.
Peace was restored, and he was planning to return to his monastery when
suddenly he began to lose his strength. He summoned his brethren and
told them he was dying. All who heard this were overcome with grief. In
their sorrow they cried to him with one voice: �Father, why are you
deserting us? Who will care for us when you are gone? Savage wolves
will attack your flock, and who will save us from their bite when our
shepherd is struck down? We know you long to be with Christ, but your
reward is certain and will not be any less for being delayed. You will
do better to show pity for us, rather than forsake us.�
Thereupon he broke into tears, for he was a man in whom the compassion
of our Lord was continually revealed. Turning to our Lord, he made this
reply to their pleading: �Lord, if your people still need me, I am
ready for the task; your will be done.�
Here was a man words cannot describe. Death could not defeat him nor
toil dismay him. He was quite without a preference of his own; he
neither feared to die nor refused to live. With eyes and hands always
raised to heaven he never withdrew his unconquered spirit from prayer.
It happened that some priests who had gathered at his bedside suggested
that he should give his poor body some relief by lying on his other
side. He answered: �Allow me, brothers, to look toward heaven rather
than at the earth, so that my spirit may set on the right course when
the time comes for me to go on my journey to the Lord.� As he spoke
these words, he saw the devil standing near. �Why do you stand there,
you bloodthirsty brute?� he cried. �Murderer, you will not have me for
your prey. Abraham is welcoming me into his embrace.�
With these words, he gave up his spirit to heaven. Filled with joy,
Martin was welcomed by Abraham. Thus he left this life a poor and lowly
man and entered heaven rich in God�s favour.
RESPONSORY
Happy this man who did not deceive, nor judge, nor condemn anyone.
- He spoke only of Christ, of his peace and his mercy.
Here is a man whom words cannot describe.
Death could not defeat him nor toil dismay him.
He neither feared to die nor refused to live.
- He spoke only of Christ, of his peace and his mercy.
COLLECT
O God, who are glorified in the Bishop Saint Martin
both by his life and death,
make new, we pray,
the wonders of your grace in our hearts,
that neither death nor life
may separate us from your love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
