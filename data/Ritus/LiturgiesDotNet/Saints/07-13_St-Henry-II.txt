Accepto pignore vitae aeternae, te, Domine, suppliciter deprecamur, ut,
beati Benedicti monitis obsequentes, operi tuo fideliter serviamus, et
fratres ferventi diligamus caritate.
O God, whose abundant grace prepared Saint Henry
to be raised by you in a wonderful way
from the cares of earthly rule to heavenly realms,
grant, we pray, through his intercession,
that amid the uncertainties of this world
we may hasten towards you with minds made pure.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING      Micah 6:6-8
With what shall I come before the LORD,
and bow before God most high?
Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
with calves a year old?
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
with myriad streams of oil?
Shall I give my first-born for my crime,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
You have been told, O man, what is good,
and what the LORD requires of you:
Only to do the right and to love goodness,
and to walk humbly with your God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 1:1-2, 3, 4 and 6
Vincente dabo edere de ligno vitae.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
Blessed the man who follows not
the counsel of the wicked,
nor walks in the way of sinners,
nor sits in the company of the insolent,
but delights in the law of the Lord
and meditates on his law day and night.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
He is like a tree
planted near running water,
that yields its fruit in due season,
and whose leaves never fade.
Whatever he does, prospers.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
Not so the wicked, not so;
they are like chaff which the wind drives away.
For the Lord watches over the way of the just,
but the way of the wicked vanishes.
R./ Those who are victorious I will feed from the tree of life.
ALLELUIA          2 Cor 1:3b-4a
Blessed be the Father of compassion and God of all encouragement,
who encourages us in our every affliction.
GOSPEL       Matthew 7:21-27
Jesus said to his disciples:
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,'
will enter the Kingdom of heaven,
but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day,
`Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?
Did we not drive out demons in your name?
Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?'
Then I will declare to them solemnly,
`I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers.'

"Everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them
will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain fell, the floods came,
and the winds blew and buffeted the house.
But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly on rock.
And everyone who listens to these words of mine
but does not act on them
will be like a fool who built his house on sand.
The rain fell, the floods came,
and the winds blew and buffeted the house.
And it collapsed and was completely ruined."

SECOND READING
From an Ancient Life of St. Henry
(MGH, Scriptores 4:792-799)
He provided the Church with the benefits of peace and tranquility
After the most blessed servant of God had been anointed king, he was
not satisfied with the anxieties of his realm; so, in order to attain
the crown of immortality, he determined to campaign for the King of
all, for to serve him is to rule. Accordingly, he applied the utmost
energy to the extension of religious worship and began to enrich the
churches with property and to furnish them with extensive adornment. He
re-established the see of Bamberg in his own domain, dedicating it to
Peter and Paul, the princes of the apostles, and to the most revered
Saint George, the martyr; by a special law he submitted it to the holy
Church of Rome, to pay the honour due by divine right to the first see
and also to secure his foundation under Rome’s patronage. But to show
more clearly how carefully this holy man provided his church with the
benefits of peace and tranquillity even after his death, we here
include his letter of establishment.

“Henry, king by the preordained mercy of God, to all the sons of the
Church, both future and present. By the most salutary instructions of
sacred eloquence we are taught and advised to abandon temporal riches,
to lay aside earthly goods, and to strive to reach the eternal and
everlasting dwelling-places in heaven. For present glory is fleeting
and meaningless, while it is possessed, unless in it we can glimpse
something of heaven’s eternity. But God’s mercy toward the human race
provided a useful remedy when he made the reward for earthly existence
a share in our heavenly country.

“Therefore, not unmindful of this clemency and aware that by the
gratuitous consideration of divine mercy we were raised up to a
position of regal dignity, we think it fitting not only to enlarge the
churches constructed by our ancestors, but for the greater glory of God
to build new ones and to raise them up as the most grateful gifts of
our devotion. Furthermore, not turning a deaf ear to the Lord’s
commandments and obediently following divine urgings, we desire to take
the treasures of divine generosity bestowed on us by his bounty and
store them in heaven, where thieves cannot dig them up or steal them
and rust or moth may not destroy them. Moreover, when we reflect upon
all that we have now stored up, our heart will be often drawn with
longing and love.

“Accordingly we wish to make known to all the faithful that we have
designated a portion of our paternal heritage called Babenberch to be
raised to the dignity of an episcopal see so that there we ourselves
and our parents may be held in glorious memory, and that the sacrifice
of salvation may be offered constantly for all the faithful.”
RESPONSORY          Wisdom 10:11-12,14,10
The Lord made him rich;
he protected him from his enemies,
and he saved him from ambush.
- He gave him unending glory.

He guided the just man on the straight path
and showed him God's kingdom.
- He gave him unending glory.
