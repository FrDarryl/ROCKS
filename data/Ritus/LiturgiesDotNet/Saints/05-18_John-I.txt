Deus, fidelium remunerator animarum, qui hunc diem beati Ioannis papae
martyrio consecrasti, exaudi preces populi tui, et praesta, ut, qui
eius merita veneramur, fidei constantiam imitemur.
O God, who reward faithful souls
and who have consecrated this day
by the martyrdom of Pope Saint John the First,
graciously hear the prayers of your people
and grant that we, who venerate his merits,
may imitate his constancy in the faith.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Revelation 3:14b:20-22
The Amen, the faithful and true witness,
the source of God's creation, says this:

"Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
If anyone hears my voice and opens the door,
then I will enter his house and dine with him
and he with me.
I will give the victor the right to sit with me on my throne,
as I myself first won the victory
and sit with my Father on his throne.

"Whoever has ears ought to hear
what the Spirit says to the churches."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          23:1-3a,4,5,6
Dominus pascit me, et nihil mihi deerit.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;
Beside restful waters he leads me;
he refreshes my soul.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Even though I walk in the dark valley
I fear no evil; for you are at my side
With your rod and your staff
that give me courage.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
You spread the table before me
in the sight of my foes;
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Only goodness and kindness follow me
all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD
for years to come.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
ALLELUIA          John 15:15
Vos dixi amicos, dicit Dominus, quia omnia quae audivi a Patre meo,
nota feci vobis.
I call you my friends, says the Lord,
for I have made known to you all that the Father has told me.
GOSPEL          Luke 22:24-30
An argument broke out among the Apostles
about which of them should be regarded as the greatest.
Jesus said to them,
"The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them
and those in authority over them are addressed as 'Benefactors';
but among you it shall not be so.
Rather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest,
and the leader as the servant.
For who is greater:
the one seated at table or the one who serves?
Is it not the one seated at table?
I am among you as the one who serves.
It is you who have stood by me in my trials;
and I confer a kingdom on you,
just as my Father has conferred one on me,
that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom;
and you will sit on thrones
judging the twelve tribes of Israel."

From the Common of One Martyr during the Easter Season or of
Pastors: popes, except the following:

Office of Readings

From a letter by Saint John of Avila
(Ep. 9, 1 et 8, 2-3: CSEL 3, 488-489, 487-488)
The life of Jesus revealed in us

Praise to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
mercy and God of all consolation who consoles us in all our trials and
enables us to console others who are being tried, for we urge them on
as God urges us on. As we share generously in the sufferings of Christ,
so do we share generously in his consolation.

The words are those of Saint Paul the apostle. He was beaten with rods
three times, flogged five times, stoned once and left for dead; he
suffered every persecution men can inflict, his body was twisted by
pain and toil. And all this was his lot not just on one or two
occasions, for he writes: We are constantly being handed over to death
for Jesus� sake, so that his life may be revealed in us.

In all these tribulations he does not murmur or complain about God, as
weaker men do. He is not saddened as those who love status and pleasure
are. He does not beg God to be relieved of them, as men do who are
unaware of their true value and therefore will have no part of them. He
does not make light of them, as men do who set little value upon them.
On the contrary, fully aware of the value of these tribulations and
rising above his own weakness, Paul blesses God amid his sufferings and
thanks him as though he had bestowed a fine reward. He thinks it an
honour to be able to suffer for him who subjected himself to so very
much shame in order to free us from the dreadful effects of sin; who
exalted us by giving us his Spirit and making us adopted sons of God;
and who gave us, in his own person and through his own efforts, a proof
and pledge of heavenly joy.

Dear brothers and sisters, I pray God may open your eyes and let you
see what hidden treasures he bestows on us in the trials from which the
world thinks only to flee. Shame turns into honour when we seek God�s
glory. Present affliction becomes the source of heavenly glory. To
those who suffer wounds in fighting his battles God opens his arms in
loving, tender friendship, which is more delightful by far than
anything our earthly efforts might produce. If we have any sense, we
shall yearn for these open arms of God. Can anyone but a man in whom
all desire is dead fail to desire him who is wholly lovable, wholly
desirable?

If you long for these festivals of heavenly joy, if you want to behold
them and take part in them, be assured that there is no better way to
reach them than the way of suffering. This is the way Christ and his
disciples have always travelled. He calls it a narrow way, but it leads
straight to life. That is why he tells us that if we want to join him,
we shall travel the way he took. It is surely not right that the Son of
God should go his way on the path of shame while the sons of men walk
the way of worldly honour: The disciple is not above his teacher, nor
the servant greater than his master.

God grant that our hearts may find no rest and seek no other food in
this world, save in hardship and suffering beside the Lord�s cross.
RESPONSORY           2 Corinthians 4:11,16
Though we are always alive,
we are continually being handed over to death
for the sake of Jesus,
- so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal bodies,
alleluia.
Even though our outward body is failing,
the inner man is being renewed with each passing day.
- So that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal bodies,
alleluia.
