Readings from the Common of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or:
FIRST READING          Isaiah 9:1-6
The people who walked in darkness
have seen a great light;
Upon those who lived in a land of gloom
a light has shone.
You have brought them abundant joy
and great rejoicing;
They rejoice before you as people rejoice at harvest,
as they exult when dividing the spoils.
For the yoke that burdened them,
the pole on their shoulder,
The rod of their taskmaster,
you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.
For every boot that tramped in battle,
every cloak rolled in blood,
will be burned as fuel for fire.
For a child is born to us, a son is given to us;
upon his shoulder dominion rests.
They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero,
Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.
His dominion is vast
and forever peaceful,
Upon David�s throne, and over his kingdom,
which he confirms and sustains
By judgment and justice,
both now and forever.
The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this!

To seat them with princes,
with the princes of his own people.

ALLELUIA          See Luke 1:28

GOSPEL          Luke 1:26-38
The angel Gabriel was sent from God
to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,
to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph,
of the house of David,
and the virgin�s name was Mary.
And coming to her, he said,
�Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you.�
But she was greatly troubled at what was said
and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
Then the angel said to her,
�Do not be afraid, Mary,
for you have found favor with God.
Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,
and you shall name him Jesus.
He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,
and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,
and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,
and of his Kingdom there will be no end.�
But Mary said to the angel,
�How can this be,
since I have no relations with a man?�
And the angel said to her in reply,
�The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
Therefore the child to be born
will be called holy, the Son of God.
And behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
has also conceived a son in her old age,
and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;
for nothing will be impossible for God.�
Mary said, �Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.
May it be done to me according to your word.�
Then the angel departed from her.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Memoriam recolentes beatae Virginis Mariae, tibi, Domine, munera nostra
offerimus, deprecantes, ut eius nobis succurrat humanitas, qui tibi
oblationem seipsum in cruce obtulit immaculatam.
As we observe this Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
we bring you our offerings, O Lord,
praying to be given strength by the humanity of Christ,
who offered himself to you on the Cross
as the unblemished oblation.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY I
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
and to praise, bless, and glorify your name
on the feast day of the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary.

For by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit
she conceived your Only Begotten Son,
and without losing the glory of virginity,
brought forth into the world the eternal Light,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven
and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in humble praise, as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

as we echo her thankful hymn of praise.

For truly even to the earth's ends
you have done great things
and extended your abundant mercy from age to age:
when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid,
you gave us through her the author of our salvation,
your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise,
as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...

Office of Readings

From a homily by St. Amadeus of Lausanne, bishop
(Hom. 7: SC 72, 188. 190. 192. 200)
Queen of the world and of peace

Observe how fitting it was that even before her assumption the name of
Mary shone forth wondrously throughout the world. Her fame spread
everywhere even before she was raised above the heavens in her
magnificence. Because of the honour due her Son, it was indeed fitting
for the Virgin Mother to have first ruled upon earth and then be raised
up to heaven in glory. It was fitting that her fame be spread in this
world below, so that she might enter the heights of heaven on
overwhelming blessedness. Just as she was borne from virtue to virtue
by the Spirit of the Lord, she was transported from earthly renown to
heavenly brightness.

So it was that she began to taste the fruits of her future reign while
still in the flesh. At one moment she withdrew to God in ecstasy; at
the next she would bend down to her neighbours with indescribable love.
In heaven angels served her, while here on earth she was venerated by
the service of men. Gabriel and the angels waited upon her in heaven.
The virgin John, rejoicing that the Virgin Mother was entrusted to him
at the cross, cared for her with the other apostles here below. The
angels rejoiced to see their queen; the apostles rejoiced to see their
lady, and both obeyed her with loving devotion.

Dwelling in the loftiest citadel of virtue, like a sea of divine grace
or an unfathomable source of love that has everywhere overflowed its
banks, she poured forth her bountiful waters on trusting and thirsting
souls. Able to preserve both flesh and spirit from death she bestowed
health-giving salve on bodies and souls. Has anyone ever come away from
her troubled or saddened or ignorant of the heavenly mysteries? Who has
not returned to everyday life gladdened and joyful because his request
had been granted by the Mother of God?

She is a bride, so gentle and affectionate, and the mother of the only
true bridegroom. In her abundant goodness she has channelled the spring
of reason's garden, the well of living and life-giving waters that pour
forth in a rushing stream from divine Lebanon and flow down from Mount
Zion until they surround the shores of every far-flung nation. With
divine assistance she has redirected these waters and made them into
streams of peace and pools of grace. Therefore, when the Virgin of
virgins was led forth by God and her Son, the King of kings, amid the
company of exulting angels and rejoicing archangels, with the heavens
ringing with praise, the prophecy of the psalmist was fulfilled, in
which he said to the Lord: At your right hand stands the queen, clothed
in gold of Ophir.
RESPONSORY
A great sign appeared in the heavens:
a woman clothed with the sun,
with the moon under her feet,
- and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
The queen, clothed in cloth of gold, stood on your right hand.
- And upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
COLLECT
O God, who made the Mother of your Son
to be our Mother and our Queen,
graciously grant that, sustained by her intercession,
we may attain in the heavenly Kingdom
the glory promised to your children.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
