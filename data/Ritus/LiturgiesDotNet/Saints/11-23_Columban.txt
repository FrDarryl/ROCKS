Deus, qui in beato Columbano evangelizandi munus et monasticae vitae
studium mirabiliter coniunxisti, praesta, quaesumus, ut, eius
intercessione et exemplo, te super omnia quaerere et credentium populum
augere studeamus.
O God, who in Saint Columban
wonderfully joined the work of evangelization
to zeal for the monastic life,
grant, we pray,
that through his intercession and example
we may strive to seek you above all things
and to bring increase to your faithful people.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 52:7-10
How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of him who brings glad tidings,
Announcing peace, bearing good news,
announcing salvation, and saying to Zion,
"Your God is King!"

Hark! Your sentinels raise a cry,
together they shout for joy,
For they see directly, before their eyes,
the LORD restoring Zion.
Break out together in song,
O ruins of Jerusalem!
For the LORD comforts his people,
he redeems Jerusalem.
The LORD has bared his holy arm
in the sight of all the nations;
All the ends of the earth will behold
the salvation of our God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 96: 1-2a, 2b-3, 7-8, 10

R.\ Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations. Or: Go out to

Bring gifts and enter his courts;

ALLELUIA          Jn 8:12
I am the light of the world, says the Lord;
whoever follows me will have the light of life
GOSPEL           Luke 9:57-62
As Jesus and his disciples were proceeding on their journey,
someone said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered him,
"Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests,
but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head."
And to another he said, "Follow me."
But he replied, "Lord, let me go first and bury my father."
But he answered him, "Let the dead bury their dead.
But you, go and proclaim the Kingdom of God."
And another said, "I will follow you, Lord,
but first let me say farewell to my family at home."
He said, "No one who sets a hand to the plow
and looks to what was left behind is fit for the Kingdom of God."

SECOND READING
From an instruction by Saint Columban, abbot
(Instr 11:1-2: Opera, Dublin 1957, 106-107)
Man's likeness to God, if preserved, imparts high dignity
Moses wrote in the law: God made man in his image and likeness.
Consider, I ask you, the dignity of these words. God is all-powerful.
We cannot see or understand him, describe or assess him. Yet he
fashioned man from clay and endowed him with the nobility of his own
image. What has man in common with God? Or earth with spirit? For God
is a spirit. It is a glorious privilege that God should grant men his
eternal image and the likeness of his character. Man's likeness to God,
if he preserves it, imparts high dignity.

If man applies the virtues planted in his soul to the right purpose, he
will be like God. God's commands have taught us to give him back the
virtues he sowed in us in our first innocence. The first command is to
love our Lord with our whole heart because he loved us first from the
beginning, before our existence. Loving God renews his image in us.
Anyone who loves God keeps his commandments, for he said: If you love
me, keep my commandments. His command is that we love each other. In
his own words: This is my command, that you love each other as I also
have loved you.

True love is shown not merely in word, but in deed and in truth. So we
must turn back our image undefiled and holy to our God and Father, for
his is holy; in the words of Scripture: Be holy, for I am holy. We must
restore his image with love, for he is love; in John's words: God is
love. We must restore it with loyalty and truth, for he is loyal and
truthful. The image we depict must not be that of one who is unlike
God; for one who is harsh and irascible and proud would display the
image of a despot.

Let us not imprint on ourselves the image of a despot, but let Christ
paint his image in us with his words: My peace I give you, my peace I
leave with you. But the knowledge that peace is good is of no benefit
to us if we do not practice it. The most valuable objects are usually
the most fragile; costly things require the most careful handling.
Particularly fragile is that which is lost by wanton talk and destroyed
with the slightest injury of a brother. Men like nothing better than
discussing and minding the business of others, passing superfluous
comments at random and criticizing people behind their backs. So those
who cannot say: The Lord has given me a discerning tongue, that I may
with a word support him who is weary should keep silent, or if they do
say anything it should promote peace.
RESPONSORY          Luke 6:47, 48; Sirach 25:15
Anyone who comes to me
and listens to my words and acts on them,
I will show you what he is like.
- He is like a man who while building his house
dug deeply and laid his foundation on rock.

Happy is the man who fears the Lord.
Who is his equal?
Who can compare the him?
- He is like a man who while building his house
dug deeply and laid his foundation on rock.
