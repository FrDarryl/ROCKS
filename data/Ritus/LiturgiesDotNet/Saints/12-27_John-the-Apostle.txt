ENTRANCE ANTIPHON
Iste est Ioannes qui supra pectus Domini in cena recubuit: beatus
Apostolus, cui revelata sunt secreta celestia, et verba vitae in toto
terrarum orbe diffudit.
This is John, who reclined on the Lord's breast at supper,
the blessed Apostle, to whom celestial secrets were revealed
and who spread the words of life through all the world.
Or:            Sir 15: 5
In medio ecclesiae aperuit os eius, et implevit eum Dominus spiritu
sapientiae et intellectus, stolam gloriae induit eum.
In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth,
and the Lord filled him
with the spirit of wisdom and understanding
and clothed him in a robe of glory.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui per beatum apostolum Ioannem Verbi tui nobis arcana
reserasti, praesta, quaesumus, ut, quod ille nostris auribus
excellenter infudit, intellegentiae competentis eruditione capiamus.
O God, who through the blessed Apostle John
have unlocked for us the secrets of your Word,
grant, we pray,
that we may grasp with proper understanding
what he has so marvelously brought to our ears.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 1:1-4
Beloved:
What was from the beginning,
what we have heard,
what we have seen with our eyes,
what we looked upon
and touched with our hands
concerns the Word of life
for the life was made visible;
we have seen it and testify to it
and proclaim to you the eternal life
that was with the Father and was made visible to us
what we have seen and heard
we proclaim now to you,
so that you too may have fellowship with us;
for our fellowship is with the Father
and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
We are writing this so that our joy may be complete.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          97:1-2, 5-6, 11-12
Laetamini, iusti, in Domino.
R. Rejoice in the Lord, you just!
The LORD is king; let the earth rejoice;
let the many isles be glad.
Clouds and darkness are around him,
justice and judgment are the foundation of his throne.
R. Rejoice in the Lord, you just!
The mountains melt like wax before the LORD,
before the LORD of all the earth.
The heavens proclaim his justice,
and all peoples see his glory.
R. Rejoice in the Lord, you just!
Light dawns for the just;
and gladness, for the upright of heart.
Be glad in the LORD, you just,
and give thanks to his holy name.
R. Rejoice in the Lord, you just!
ALLELUIA
Te deum laudamus, te Dominum confitemur; te gloriosus Apostolorum
chorus laudat, Domine.
We praise you, O God, we acclaim you as Lord:
the glorious company of Apostles praise you.
GOSPEL          Joh 20:1a, 2-8
On the first day of the week,
Mary Magdalene ran and went to Simon Peter
and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them,
“They have taken the Lord from the tomb,
and we do not know where they put him.”
So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb.
They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter
and arrived at the tomb first;
he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in.
When Simon Peter arrived after him,
he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there,
and the cloth that had covered his head,
not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place.
Then the other disciple also went in,
the one who had arrived at the tomb first,
and he saw and believed.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Munera, quaesumus, Domine, oblata sanctifica, et praesta, ut ex huius
cenae convivio aeterni Verbi secreta hauriamus, quae ex eodem fonte
apostolo tuo Ioanni revelasti.
Sanctify the offerings we have made, O Lord, we pray,
and grant that from the banquet of this supper
we may draw the hidden wisdom of the eternal Word,
just as, from this same source,
you revealed it to your Apostle John.
Through Christ our Lord.

and from his fullness we have all received.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Praesta, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut Verbum caro factum, quod beatus
Ioannes apostolus praedicavit, per hoc mysterium quod celebravimus
habitet semper in nobis.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that the Word made flesh,
proclaimed by the blessed Apostle John,
may, through this mystery which we have celebrated,
ever dwell among us.
