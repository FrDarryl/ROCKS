From the Common of Martyrs: For One Martyr

COLLECT
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, tuum in nobis Spiritum clementer infunde,
ut corda nostra ea dilectione valida potiantur, per quam sanctus martyr
Vincentius omnia corporis tormenta devicit.
Almighty ever-living God,
mercifully pour out your Spirit upon us,
so that our hearts may possess that strong love
by which the Martyr Saint Vincent
triumphed over all bodily torments.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 4:7-15
Brothers and sisters:
We hold this treasure in earthen vessels,
that the surpassing power may be of God and not from us.
We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained;
perplexed, but not driven to despair;
persecuted, but not abandoned;
struck down, but not destroyed;
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus,
so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.
For we who live are constantly being given up to death
for the sake of Jesus,
so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
So death is at work in us, but life in you.
Since, then, we have the same spirit of faith,
according to what is written, / believed, therefore I spoke,
we too believe and therefore speak,
knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus
will raise us also with Jesus
and place us with you in his presence.
Everything indeed is for you,
so that the grace bestowed in abundance on more and more people
may cause the thanksgiving to overflow for the glory of God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9
Ex omnibus tribulationibus meis eripuit me Dominus.
R. (5) The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
praise shall be always in my mouth.
My soul will glory in the LORD
that the poor may hear and be glad.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
Magnify the LORD with me;
let us exalt his name together.
I sought the LORD, who answered me,
delivered me from all my fears.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
Look to God that you may be radiant with joy
and your faces may not blush for shame.
In my misfortune I called,
the LORD heard and saved me from all distress.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
The angel of the LORD, who encamps with them,
delivers all who fear God.
Learn to savor how good the LORD is;
happy are those who take refuge in him.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
ALLELUIA      Matt 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
regnum caelorum.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL READING           Matthew 10:17-22
Jesus said to the Twelve:
"Beware of men, for they will hand you over to courts
and scourge you in their synagogues,
and you will be led before governors and kings for my sake
as a witness before them and the pagans.
When they hand you over,
do not worry about how you are to speak
or what you are to say.
You will be given at that moment what you are to say.
For it will not be you who speak
but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brother will hand over brother to death,
and the father his child;
children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
You will be hated by all because of my name,
but whoever endures to the end will be saved."

Liturgy of the Hours
St. Vincent

From the Common of One Martyr, except the following:

Office of Readings

From a sermon of St. Augustine of Hippo
(Sermo 276, 1-2: PL 38, 1256)
Christ the king of martyrs

To you, said the Apostle Paul, it has been granted for Christ, not only
to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.

Vincent had received both these gifts; he had received them, and he
kept them. After all, if he had not received them, what would he have
had? But he did have faithfulness in his words, he did have endurance
in his sufferings.

So do not any of you be too self-assured when offering a word; do not
be too confident in your own powers when suffering trials or
temptations; because it is from him that we have the wisdom to speak
good things wisely, from him the patience to endure bad things bravely.

Call to mind the Lord Christ warning and encouraging his disciples in
the gospel; call to mind the king of martyrs equipping his troops with
spiritual weapons, indicating the wars to be fought, lending
assistance, promising rewards; first saying to his disciples, In this
world you will have distress; then immediately adding words that would
allay their terrors: But have confidence: I myself have vanquished the
world.

So why should we be surprised, dearly beloved, if Vincent was
victorious in him by whom the world was vanquished? In this world, he
says, you will have distress; such that, even if it distresses, it
cannot oppress you; even if it knocks you down, it cannot knock you
out. The world mounts a double attack on the soldiers of Christ. It
wheedles in order to lead them astray; but it also terrifies, in order
to break them. Let us not be held fast by our own pleasures, let us not
be terrified by someone else�s cruelty, and the world has been
vanquished.

At each attack, Christ comes running to the defence, and the Christian
is not vanquished. If, in this passion of Vincent�s, one only gave
thought to human powers of endurance, it would begin to look
unbelievable; but if one acknowledges divine power, it ceases even to
be wonderful.

Such hideous cruelty was being unleashed on the martyr�s body, and such
calm serenity was displayed in his voice; such harsh, savage
punishments being applied to his limbs, but such assurance echoing in
his words, that we would have imagined that in some marvellous way,
while Vincent was suffering, that it was someone else and not the
speaker that was being tortured.

And indeed, my dearest brethren, that is how it was; undoubtedly that
is how it was: someone else was speaking. Christ, you see, promised
even this to his witnesses in the gospel, when he was preparing them
for this sort of contest. For he said: Do not think beforehand about
how or what you are to speak. For it is not you that are speaking, but
the Spirit of my Father who is speaking in you.

So the flesh was suffering, and the Spirit was speaking. And while the
Spirit was speaking, not only was ungodliness being confounded and
convicted, but weakness was even being strengthened and comforted.
RESPONSORY           Job 23:11; Philippians 3:8-10
The Lord has tried me as gold is assayed by fire;
- I have walked in his way;
I have not wandered from his path.
I count all the this world offers as worthless,
if only I may know Christ,
and share in his sufferings.
- I have walked in his way;
I have not wandered from his path.
