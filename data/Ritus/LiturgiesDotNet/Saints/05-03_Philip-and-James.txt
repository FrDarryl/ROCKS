ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Lk 22:32
Isti sunt viri sancti, quos elegit Dominus in caritate non ficta, et
dedit illis gloriam sempiternam, alleluia..
These are the holy men
whom the Lord chose in his own perfect love;
to them he gave eternal glory, alleluia.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui nos annua apostolorum Philippi et Iacobi festivitate
laetificas, da nobis, ipsorum precibus, in Unigeniti tui passione et
resurrectione consortium, ut ad perpetuam tui visionem pervenire
mereamur.
O God, who gladden us each year
with the feast day of the Apostles Philip and James,
grant us, through their prayers,
a share in the Passion and Resurrection
of your Only Begotten Son,
so that we may merit to behold you for eternity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 15:1-8
I am reminding you, brothers and sisters,
of the Gospel I preached to you,
which you indeed received and in which you also stand.
Through it you are also being saved,
if you hold fast to the word I preached to you,
unless you believed in vain.
For I handed on to you as of first importance what I also received:
that Christ died for our sins
in accordance with the Scriptures;
that he was buried;
that he was raised on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures;
that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.
After that, he appeared to more
than five hundred brothers and sisters at once,
most of whom are still living,
though some have fallen asleep.
After that he appeared to James,
then to all the Apostles.
Last of all, as to one born abnormally,
he appeared to me.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 19:2-3,4-5
In omnem terram exivit sonus eorum.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth. or: Alleluia.
The heavens declare the glory of God,
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.
Day pours out the word to day,
and night to night imparts knowledge.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth. or: Alleluia.
Not a word nor a discourse
whose voice is not heard;
Through all the earth their voice resounds,
and to the ends of the world, their message.
R. Their message goes out through all the earth. or: Alleluia.
ALLELUIA          Jn 14:6b, 9c
Ego sum via, veritas et vita, dicit Dominus; Phillipe, qui videt me,
videt et Patrem.
I am the way, the truth and the life, says the Lord;
Philip, whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
GOSPEL          John 14:6-14
Jesus said to Thomas, �I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.
If you know me, then you will also know my Father.
From now on you do know him and have seen him.�
Philip said to him,
�Master, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.�
Jesus said to him, �Have I been with you for so long a time
and you still do not know me, Philip?
Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.
How can you say, �Show us the Father�?
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?
The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own.
The Father who dwells in me is doing his works.
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me,
or else, believe because of the works themselves.
Amen, amen, I say to you,
whoever believes in me will do the works that I do,
and will do greater ones than these,
because I am going to the Father.
And whatever you ask in my name, I will do,
so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
If you ask anything of me in my name, I will do it.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, Domine, munera quae pro apostolorum Philippi et Iacobi
festivitate deferimus, et immaculatam nobis religionem mundamque

Receive, O Lord, the offerings we bring
for the feast day of the Apostles Philip and James
and bestow on us religion pure and undefiled.
Through Christ our Lord.

Whoever has seen me, Philip, has seen the Father also, alleluia.

sumpsimus, ut, cum apostolis Philippo et Iacobo te in Filio
contemplantes, vitam habere mereamur aeternam.
