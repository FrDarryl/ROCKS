Deus, qui ad multas illuminandas gentes beatum Ansgarium episcopum
mittere voluisti, eius nobis intercessione concede, ut in tuae
veritatis luce iugiter ambulemus.
O God, who willed to send the Bishop Saint Ansgar
to enlighten many peoples,
grant us, through his intercession,
that we may always walk in the light of your truth.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 52:7-10
How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of him who brings glad tidings,
Announcing peace, bearing good news,
announcing salvation, and saying to Zion,
"Your God is King!"

Hark! Your sentinels raise a cry,
together they shout for joy,
For they see directly, before their eyes,
the LORD restoring Zion.
Break out together in song,
O ruins of Jerusalem!
For the LORD comforts his people,
he redeems Jerusalem.
The LORD has bared his holy arm
in the sight of all the nations;
All the ends of the earth will behold
the salvation of our God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 96: 1-2a, 2b-3, 7-8, 10
Annuntiate in omnibus populis mirabilia Domini.
R. (3) Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Sing to the LORD a new song;
sing to the LORD, all you lands.
Sing to the LORD; bless his name.
R. Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Announce his salvation, day after day.
Tell his glory among the nations;
among all peoples, his wondrous deeds.
R. Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Give to the LORD, yon families of nations,
give to the LORD glory and praise;
give to the LORD the glory due his name!
R. Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Say among the nations: The LORD is king.
He has made the world firm, not to be moved;
he governs the peoples with equity.
R. Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
ALLELUIA          Mk 1:17
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Mark 1:14-20
After John had been arrested,
Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the Gospel of God:
"This is the time of fulfillment.
The Kingdom of God is at hand.
Repent, and believe in the Gospel."
As he passed by the Sea of Galilee,
he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea;
they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them,
"Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Then they left their nets and followed him.
He walked along a little farther
and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
They too were in a boat mending their nets.
Then he called them.
So they left their father Zebedee in the boat
along with the hired men and followed him.

From the Common of Pastors, except the following:

Office of Readings

From the decree on the missionary activity of the Church of the Second
Vatican Council
(Ad gentes, nn. 23-24)
We must boldly proclaim the mystery of Christ

Every disciple of Christ is responsible in his own measure for the
spread of the faith, but Christ the Lord is always calling from among
his followers those whom he wills, so that they may be with him and be
sent by him to preach to the nations.

Through the Holy Spirit, who distributes gifts as he wills for the good
of all, Christ implants in the hearts of individuals the vocation to be
a missionary, and at the same time he raises up in the Church
institutes which make their own the task of spreading the Gospel that
belongs to the whole Church.

A special vocation marks out those priests, religious and lay people
who are prepared to undertake the missionary task in their own country
or abroad, and have the right natural disposition for it, with suitable
gifts and talents. Sent by lawful authority, they go out in obedience
and faith to those who are far from Christ. They have been set apart
for the task to which they have been called as ministers of the gospel,
to make the Gentiles an acceptable offering, sanctified in the Holy
Spirit.

Those whom God calls must answer his call in such a way that, without
regard for purely human counsel, they may devote themselves wholly to
the work of the gospel. This response cannot be given except with the
inspiration and strength of the Holy Spirit.

The person who is sent enters into the life and mission of him who
emptied himself, taking the nature of a slave. He must be ready
therefore to be true to his vocation for life, to deny himself,
renouncing all that he had before, and to become all things to all men.

In preaching the Gospel to the nations he must boldly proclaim the
mystery of Christ, whose ambassador he is, so that in Christ he may
have the courage to speak as he ought, and not be ashamed of the
scandal of the cross. He must follow in the footsteps of his Master,
who was gentle and humble of heart, and reveal to others that his yoke
is easy and his burden light.

By a life that is truly according to the Gospel, by much endurance, by
forbearance, by kindness and sincere love, he must bear witness to his
Lord, even, if need be, by the shedding of his blood.

He will pray to God for strength and courage, so that he may come to
see that for one who experiences great hardship and extreme poverty
there can be abundant joy.
RESPONSORY       1 Corinthians 9:16-22
I do not boast of preaching the Gospel,
since it is a duty with which I am charged.
- It would go hard with me indeed if I did not preach the Gospel.
I have been all things to all men
in the hope of saving some of them at the least.
- It would go hard with me indeed if I did not preach the Gospel.
