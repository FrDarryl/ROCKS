ENTRANCE ANTIPHON
Fuit vir vitae venerabilis, gratia Benedictus et nomine, qui relicta
domo rebusque patris, soli Deo placere cupiens, sanctae conversationis
habitum quaesivit.
There was a man of venerable life,
Benedict, blessed by grace and by name,
who, leaving home and patrimony
and desiring to please God alone,
sought out the habit of holy living.
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Benedictum abbatem in schola divini servitii
praeclarum constituisti magistrum, tribue, quaesumus, ut, amori tuo
nihil praeponentes, viam mandatorum tuorum dilatato corde curramus.
O God, who made the Abbot Saint Benedict
an outstanding master in the school of divine service,
grant, we pray,
that, putting nothing before love of you,
we may hasten with a loving heart
in the way of your commands.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Proverbs 2:1-9
My son, if you receive my words
and treasure my commands,
Turning your ear to wisdom,
inclining your heart to understanding;
Yes, if you call to intelligence,
and to understanding raise your voice;
If you seek her like silver,
and like hidden treasures search her out:

Then will you understand the fear of the LORD;
the knowledge of God you will find;
For the LORD gives wisdom,
from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
He has counsel in store for the upright,
he is the shield of those who walk honestly,
Guarding the paths of justice,
protecting the way of his pious ones.

Then you will understand rectitude and justice,
honesty, every good path.

SECOND READING
From the Rule of Benedict, abbot
(Prologus 4-22; cap. 72, 1-12: CSEL 75, 2-5, 162-163)
Put Christ before everything
Whenever you begin any good work you should first of all make a most
pressing appeal to Christ our Lord to bring it to perfection; that he,
who has honored us by counting us among his children, may never be
grieved by our evil deeds. For we must always serve him with the good
things he has given us in such a way that he may never � as an angry
father disinherits his sons or even like a master who inspires fear �
grow impatient with our sins and consign us to everlasting punishment,
like wicked servants who would not follow him to glory.

So we should at long last rouse ourselves, prompted by the words of
Scripture: Now is the time for us to rise from sleep. Our eyes should
be open to the God-given light, and we should listen in wonderment to
the message of the divine voice as it daily cries out: Today, if you
shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts; and again: If anyone has
ears to hear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the
churches. And what does the Spirit say? Come my sons, listen to me; I
will teach you the fear of the Lord. Hurry, while you have the light of
life, so that death�s darkness may not overtake you.

And the Lord as he seeks the one who will do his work among the throng
of people to whom he makes that appeal, says again: Which of you wants
to live to the full; who loves long life and the enjoyment of
prosperity? And, if when you hear this you say, I do, God says to you:
If you desire true and everlasting life, keep your tongue from evil and
your lips from deceit; turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and
pursue it. And when you have done these things my eyes will be upon you
and my ears will be attentive to your prayers; and before you call upon
my name I shall say to you: Behold, I am here. What could be more
delightful, dearest brothers, than the voice of our Lord�s invitation
to us? In his loving kindness he reveals to us the way of life.

And so, girded with faith and the performance of good works, let us
follow in his paths by the guidance of the Gospel; then we shall
deserve to see him who has called us into his kingdom. If we wish to
attain a dwelling-place in his kingdom we shall not reach it unless we
hasten there by our good deeds.

Just as there exists an evil fervor, a bitter spirit, which divides us
from God and leads us to hell, so there is a good fervor which sets us
apart from evil inclinations and leads us toward God and eternal life.
Monks should put this fervor into practice with an overflowing love:
that is, they should surpass each other in mutual esteem, accept their
weaknesses, either of body or of behavior, with the utmost patience;
and vie with each other in acceding to requests. No one should follow
what he considers to be good for himself, but rather what seems good
for another. They should display brotherly love in a chaste manner;
fear God in a spirit of love; revere their abbot with a genuine and
submissive affection. Let them put Christ before all else; and may he
lead us all to everlasting life.
RESPONSORY
Wishing to please God alone,
Benedict left his home and patrimony
to enter the religious life.
- He lived as a hermit in the presence of the all-seeing God.
He withdrew from the world of men,
knowingly unacquainted with its ways
and wisely unlearned in its wisdom.
- He lived as a hermit in the presence of the all-seeing God.
COLLECT
O God, who made the Abbot Saint Benedict
an outstanding master in the school of divine service,
grant, we pray,
that, putting nothing before love of you,
we may hasten with a loving heart
in the way of your commands.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
