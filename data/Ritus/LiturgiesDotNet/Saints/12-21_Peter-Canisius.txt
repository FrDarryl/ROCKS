Deus, qui ad tuendam catholicam fidem virtute et doctrina beatum Petrum
presbyterum roborasti, eius intercessione concede, ut, qui veritatem
quaerunt, te Deum gaudenter inveniant, et in tua confessione populus
credentium perseveret.
O God, who for the defense of the Catholic faith
made the Priest Saint Peter Canisius
strong in virtue and in learning,
grant, through his intercession,
that those who seek the truth
may joyfully find you, their God,
and that your faithful people
may persevere in confessing you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Timothy 4:1-5
Beloved:
I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
who will judge the living and the dead,
and by his appearing and his kingly power:
proclaim the word;
be persistent whether it is convenient or inconvenient;
convince, reprimand, encourage through all patience and teaching.
For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine
but,
following their own desires and insatiable curiosity,
will accumulate teachers and will stop listening to the truth
and will be diverted to myths.
But you, be self-possessed in all circumstances;
put up with hardship;
perform the work of an evangelist;
fulfill your ministry.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           40:2 and 4, 7-8a, 8b-9, 10, 11
R. (8a and 9a) Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD,
and he stooped toward me and heard my cry.
And he put a new song into my mouth,
a hymn to our God.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,
but ears open to obedience you gave me.
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;
then said I, "Behold I come."
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
"In the written scroll it is prescribed for me,
To do your will, O my God, is my delight,
and your law is within my heart!"
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly;
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart;
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of;
I have made no secret of your kindness and your truth
in the vast assembly.
R. Here I am, Lord; I come to do your will.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:16
Sic luceat lux vestra coram hominibus ut videant vestra bona opera et
glorificent Patrem vestrum.
Let your light shine before others,
that they may see your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.
GOSPEL          Matthew 5:13-19
Jesus said to his disciples:
"You are the salt of the earth.
But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned?
It is no longer good for anything
but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world.
A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket;
it is set on a lampstand,
where it gives light to all in the house.
Just so, your light must shine before others,
that they may see your good deeds
and glorify your heavenly Father.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.
Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away,
not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter
will pass from the law,
until all things have taken place.
Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
and teaches others to do so
will be called least in the Kingdom of heaven.
But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments
will be called greatest in the Kingdom of heaven."

Office of Readings

From the writings of Saint Peter Canisius
(Edit. O. Brunsberger, Petri Canisii Epistulae er Acta , I, Friburgi
Brisgoviae, 1896, pp. 53-55)
A spiritual experience
Before he set out for Germany�he is rightly called the second apostle
of that country�Saint Peter Canisius received the apostolic blessing,
and underwent a profound spiritual experience. He describes it in these
words.
"Eternal High Priest, you allowed me in your boundless goodness to
commend the fruit and confirmation of that blessing to your apostles,
to whom men go on pilgrimage to the Vatican and who there work wonders
under your guidance. It was there that I experienced great consolation
and the presence of your grace, offered to me through these great
intercessors. They too gave their blessings, and confirmed the mission
to Germany; they seemed to promise their good will to me as an apostle
of that country. You know, Lord, how strongly and how often you
committed Germany to my care on that very day: I was to continue to be
solicitous for it thereafter, I was to desire to live and die for it.
"At length, it was as if you opened to me the heart in your most sacred
body: I seemed to see it directly before my eyes. You told me to drink
from this fountain, inviting me, that is, to draw the waters of my
salvation from your wellsprings, my Savior. I was most eager that
streams of faith, hope and love should flow into me from that source. I
was thirsting for poverty, chastity, obedience. I asked to be made
wholly clean by you, to be clothed by you, to be made resplendent by
you.
"So, after daring to approach your most loving heart and to plunge my
thirst in it, I received a promise from you of a garment made of three
parts: these were to cover my soul in its nakedness, and to belong
especially to my religious profession. They were peace, love and
perseverance. Protected by this garment of salvation, I was confident
that I would lack nothing but all would succeed and give you glory."
RESPONSORY
When a teacher of the law becomes a disciple of the kingdom of heaven,
- he is like the head of a household
who is able to take from his storeroom treasures new and old.
Wisdom makes its home in a discerning heart,
and it can even teach those who are foolish.
- He is like the head of a household
who is able to take from his storeroom treasures new and old.
