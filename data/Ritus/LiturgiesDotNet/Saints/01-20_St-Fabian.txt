Deus, tuorum gloria sacerdotum, praesta, quaesumus, ut, beati Fabiani
martyris tui interveniente suffragio, eiusdem proficiamus fidei
consortio dignoque servitio.
O God, glory of your Priests,
grant, we pray,
that, helped by the intercession of your Martyr Saint Fabian,
we may make progress by communion in the faith
and by worthy service.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Peter 5:1-4
Beloved:
I exhort the presbyters among you,
as a fellow presbyter and witness to the sufferings of Christ
and one who has a share in the glory to be revealed.
Tend the flock of God in your midst,
overseeing it not by constraint but willingly,
as God would have it, not for shameful profit but eagerly.
Do not lord it over those assigned to you,
but be examples to the flock.
And when the chief Shepherd is revealed,
you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM                    40:2; 4ab,7-8a,8b-9,10-11
Ecce venio, Domine, ut faciam voluntatem tuam.
R. (8a and 9a)  Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I have waited, waited for the LORD,
and he stooped toward me.
And he put a new song into my mouth,
a hymn to our God.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Sacrifice or oblation you wished not,
but ears open to obedience you gave me.
Burnt offerings or sin-offerings you sought not;
then said I, �Behold I come.�
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
I announced your justice in the vast assembly;
I did not restrain my lips, as you, O LORD, know.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
Your justice I kept not hid within my heart;
your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken of;
I have made no secret of your kindness and your truth
in the vast assembly.
R. Here am I Lord; I come to do your will.
ALLELUIA          John 10:14
Ego sum pastor bonus, dicit Dominus; et cognosco oves meas, et
cognoscunt me meae.
I am the good shepherd, says the Lord,
I know my sheep and mine know me.
GOSPEL          John 21:15-17
After Jesus had revealed himself to his disciples and
eaten breakfast with them, he said to Simon Peter,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.
Jesus said to him, "Feed my lambs."
He then said to Simon Peter a second time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Simon Peter answered him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.
Jesus said to him, "Tend my sheep."
He said to him the third time,
"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time,
"Do you love me?" and he said to him,
"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you."
Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."

From the Common of One Martyr or of Pastors, except the
following:

Office of Readings

From a letter about the death of St. Fabian, pope and martyr by Saint
Cyprian and the Roman Church
(Ep. 9, 1 et 8, 2-3: CSEL 3, 488-489, 487-488)
Fabian offers us a model of courage
We, the Christian community, assemble to celebrate the memory of the
martyrs with ritual solemnity because we want to be inspired to follow
their example, share in their merits, and be helped by their prayers.
Yet we erect no altars to any of the martyrs, even in the martyrs�
burial chapels themselves.
No bishop, when celebrating at an altar where these holy bodies rest,
has ever said, �Peter, we make this offering to you,� or �Paul, to
you,� or �Cyprian, to you.� No, what is offered is offered always to
God, who crowned the martyrs. We offer in the chapels where the bodies
of those he crowned rest, so the memories that cling to those places
will stir our emotions and encourage us to greater love both for the
martyrs whom we can imitate and for God whose grace enables us to do
so.
So we venerate the martyrs with the same veneration of love and
fellowship that we give to the holy men of God still with us. We sense
that the hearts of these latter are just as ready to suffer death for
the sake of the Gospel, and yet we feel more devotion toward those who
have already emerged victorious from the struggle. We honour those who
are fighting on the battlefield of this life here below, but we honour
more confidently those who have already achieved the victor�s crown and
live in heaven.
But the veneration strictly called �worship,� or latria, that is, the
special homage belonging only to the divinity, is something we give and
teach others to give to God alone. The offering of a sacrifice belongs
to worship in this sense (that is why those who sacrifice to idols are
called idol-worshippers), and we neither make nor tell others to make
any such offering to any martyr, any holy soul, or any angel. If anyone
among us falls into this error, he is corrected with words of sound
doctrine and must then either mend his ways or else be shunned.
The saints themselves forbid anyone to offer them the worship they know
is reserved for God, as is clear from the case of Paul and Barnabas.
When the Lycaonians were so amazed by their miracles that they wanted
to sacrifice to them as gods, the apostles tore their garments,
declared that they were not gods, urged the people to believe them, and
forbade them to worship them.
Yet the truths we teach are one thing, the abuses thrust upon us are
another. There are commandments that we are bound to give; there are
breaches of them that we are commanded to correct, but until we correct
them we must of necessity put up with them.
RESPONSORY       Philippians 1:23; 3:18; 1:21;2-17
I desire to leave this world and to be with Christ;
I consider all that this world offers worthless,
if only I can gain union with Christ.
- Life for me means Christ;
death is a prize to be won.
Even if I am to be poured out as a libation
on the sacrificial offering of your faith,
I rejoice and wish to share my happiness with you.
- Life for me means Christ;
death is a prize to be won.
