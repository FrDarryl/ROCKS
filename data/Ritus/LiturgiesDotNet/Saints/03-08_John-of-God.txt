From the Common of Holy Men and Women: For Religious or For Those
Who Practiced Works of Mercy

COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Ioannem misericordiae spiritu perfudisti, da,
quaesumus, ut, caritatis opera exercentes, inter electos in regno tuo
inveniri mereamur.
O God, who filled Saint John of God
with a spirit of compassion,
grant, we pray,
that, giving ourselves to works of charity,
we may merit to be found among the elect in your Kingdom.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 3:14-18
Beloved:
We know that we have passed from death to life
because we love our brothers.
Whoever does not love remains in death.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,
and you know that anyone who is a murderer
does not have eternal life remaining in him.
The way we came to know love
was that he laid down his life for us;
so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
If someone who has worldly means
sees a brother in need and refuses him compassion,
how can the love of God remain in him?
Children, let us love not In word or speech
but in deed and truth.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM                    Ps. 112:1-2,3-4,5-6,7-8
R. (Cf. 1a and 9a) Blessed the one who gives to the poor. or: Alleluia.
Blessed the man who fears the LORD,
who greatly delights in his commands.
His posterity shall be might upon the earth;
the upright generation shall be blessed.
R. Blessed the one who gives to the poor. or: Alleluia.
Wealth and riches shall be in his house;
his generosity shall endure forever.
Light shines through the darkness for the upright;
he is gracious and merciful and just.
R. Blessed the one who gives to the poor. or: Alleluia.
Well for the man who is gracious and lends,
who conducts his affairs with justice;
He shall never be moved;
the just one shall be in everlasting remembrance.
R. Blessed the one who gives to the poor. or: Alleluia.
An evil report he shall not fear.
His heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.
His heart is steadfast; he shall not fear
till he looks down upon his foes.
R. Blessed the one who gives to the poor. or: Alleluia.
Lavishly he gives to the poor,
his generosity shall endure forever;
his horn shall be exalted in glory.
R. Blessed the one who gives to the poor. or: Alleluia.
VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          John 13:34
Mandatum novum do vobis, dicit Dominus, ut diligatis invicem, sicut
dilexi vos.
I give you a new commandment;
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          Matthew 25:31-40
Jesus said to his disciples:
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
and all the angels with him,
he will sit upon his glorious throne,
and all the nations will be assembled before him.
And he will separate them one from another,
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right,
'Come, you who are blessed by my Father.
Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food,
I was thirsty and you gave me drink,
a stranger and you welcomed me,
naked and you clothed me,
ill and you cared for me,
in prison and you visited me.'
Then the righteous will answer him and say,
'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,
or thirsty and give you drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you,
or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?'
And the king will say to them in reply,
'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did
for one of the least brothers of mine, you did for me.'"

Office of Readings

From a letter by Saint John of God, religious
(Archiv. gen. Ord Hospit., Quaderno: De las cartas..., ffo 23v-24r;
27rv; O. Marcos, Cartas y escritos de Nuestro Glorioso Padre San Juan
de Dios, Madrid, 1935,pp. 18-19;48-50)
Christ is faithful and provides all things
If we look forward to receiving God�s mercy, we can never fail to do
good so long as we have the strength. For if we share with the poor,
out of love for God, whatever he has given to us, we shall receive
according to his promise a hundredfold in eternal happiness. What a
fine profit, what a blessed reward! Who would not entrust his
possessions to this best of merchants, who handles our affairs so well?
With outstretched arms he begs us to turn toward him, to weep for our
sins, and to become the servants of love, first for ourselves, then for
our neighbors. Just as water extinguishes a fire, so love wipes away
sin.
So many poor people come here that I very often wonder how we can care
for them all, but Jesus Christ provides all things and nourishes
everyone. Many of them come to the house of God, because the city of
Granada is large and very cold, especially now in winter. More than a
hundred and ten are now living here, sick and healthy, servants and
pilgrims. Since this house is open to everyone, it receives the sick of
every type and condition: the crippled, the disabled, lepers, mutes,
the insane, paralytics, those suffering from scurvy and those bearing
the afflictions of old age, many children, and above all countless
pilgrims and travelers, who come here, and for whom we furnish the
fire, water, and salt, as well as the utensils to cook their food. And
for all of this no payment is requested, yet Christ provides.
I work here on borrowed money, a prisoner for the sake of Jesus Christ.
And often my debts are so pressing that I dare not go out of the house
for fear of being seized by my creditors. Whenever I see so many poor
brothers and neighbors of mine suffering beyond their strength and
overwhelmed with so many physical or mental ills which I cannot
alleviate, then I become exceedingly sorrowful; but I trust in Christ,
who knows my heart. And so I say: �Woe to the man who trusts in men
rather than in Christ.� Whether you like it or not, you will grow apart
from men, but Christ is faithful and always with you, for Christ
provides all things. Let us always give thanks to him. Amen.
RESPONSORY       Isaiah 58:7-8
Share your bread with the hungry and destitute,
and take the poor and homeless into your own house.
- Then your light will break forth like the dawn;
your holiness will go before you.
When you see a man who is naked, clothe him,
and do not scorn your brother.
- Then your light will break forth like the dawn;
your holiness will go before you.
