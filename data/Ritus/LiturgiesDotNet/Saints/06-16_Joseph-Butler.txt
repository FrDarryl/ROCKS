Wisdom 7:7-14
Psalm 119:89-96 or Psalm 1
Luke 10:25-28

Wisdom 7:7-14

Therefore I prayed, and understanding was given me;
I called on God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.
I preferred her to sceptres and thrones,
and I accounted wealth as nothing in comparison with her.
Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem,
because all gold is but a little sand in her sight,
and silver will be accounted as clay before her.
I loved her more than health and beauty,
and I chose to have her rather than light,
because her radiance never ceases.
All good things came to me along with her,
and in her hands uncounted wealth.
I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom leads them;
but I did not know that she was their mother.
I learned without guile and I impart without grudging;
I do not hide her wealth,
for it is an unfailing treasure for mortals;
those who get it obtain friendship with God,
commended for the gifts that come from instruction.

Psalm 119:89-96

^89 O Lord, your word is everlasting; *
it ever stands firm in the heavens.
^90 Your faithfulness also remains from one generation to another; *
you have established the earth and it abides.
^91 So also your judgements stand firm this day, *
for all things are your servants.
^92 If your law had not been my delight, *
I should have perished in my trouble.
^93 I will never forget your commandments, *
for by them you have given me life.
^94 I am yours, O save me! *
For I have sought your commandments.
^95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me, *
but I will meditate on your testimonies.
^96 I have seen an end of all perfection, *
but your commandment knows no bounds.
or

Psalm 1

^1 Blessed are they who have not walked
in the counsel of the wicked, *
nor lingered in the way of sinners,
nor sat in the assembly of the scornful.
^2 Their delight is in the law of the Lord *
and they meditate on his law day and night.
^3 Like a tree planted by streams of water
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither, *
whatever they do, it shall prosper.
^4 As for the wicked, it is not so with them; *
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.
^5 Therefore the wicked shall not be able to stand in the judgement, *
nor the sinner in the congregation of the righteous.
^6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, *
but the way of the wicked shall perish.

Luke 10:25-28

Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. Teacher, he said, what
must I do to inherit eternal life? He said to him, What is written in
the law? What do you read there? He answered, You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself. And
he said to him, You have given the right answer; do this, and you will
live.
