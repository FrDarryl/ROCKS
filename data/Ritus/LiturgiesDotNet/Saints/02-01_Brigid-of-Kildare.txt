Corinthians 1:26-31
Psalm 138 or Psalm 1
Matthew 6:25-33

FIRST READING
1 Corinthians 1:26-31
Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise
by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble
birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise;
God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what
is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to
nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of
God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us
wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
in order that, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the
Lord."
Psalm 138
Confitebor tibi

1
I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my whole heart; *
before the gods I will sing your praise.

2
I will bow down toward your holy temple
and praise your Name, *
because of your love and faithfulness;

3
For you have glorified your Name *
and your word above all things.

4
When I called, you answered me; *
you increased my strength within me.

5
All the kings of the earth will praise you, O LORD, *
when they have heard the words of your mouth.

6
They will sing of the ways of the LORD, *
that great is the glory of the LORD.

7
Though the LORD be high, he cares for the lowly; *
he perceives the haughty from afar.

8
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you keep me safe; *
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies;
your right hand shall save me.

9
The LORD will make good his purpose for me; *
O LORD, your love endures for ever;
do not abandon the works of your hands.

Or:
Psalm 1
Beatus vir qui non abiit

1
Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked,
*
nor lingered in the way of sinners,
nor sat in the seats of the scornful!

2
Their delight is in the law of the LORD, *
and they meditate on his law day and night.

3
They are like trees planted by streams of water,
bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that do not wither; *
everything they do shall prosper.

4
It is not so with the wicked; *
they are like chaff which the wind blows away.

5
Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgment
comes, *
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.

6
For the LORD knows the way of the righteous, *
but the way of the wicked is doomed.

GOSPEL
Matthew 6:25-33
Jesus said, "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what
you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will
wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look
at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into
barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more
value than they? And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to
your span of life? And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the
lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, yet I
tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of
these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive
today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more
clothe you-- you of little faith? Therefore do not worry, saying, `What
will we eat?' or `What will we drink?' or `What will we wear?' For it
is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your
heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But strive first
for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will
be given to you as well."
