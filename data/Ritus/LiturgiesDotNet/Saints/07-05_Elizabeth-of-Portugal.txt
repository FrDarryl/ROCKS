Deus, auctor pacis et amator caritatis, qui beatam Elisabeth mira
dissidentes componendi gratia decorasti, da nobis, eius intercessione,
pacis opera exercere, ut filii Dei nominari possimus.
O God, author of peace and lover of charity,
who adorned Saint Elizabeth of Portugal
with a marvelous grace for reconciling those in conflict,
grant, through her intercession,
that we may become peacemakers,
and so be called children of God.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 3: 14-18
Beloved:
We know that we have passed from death to life
because we love our brothers.
Whoever does not love remains in death.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,
and you know that anyone who is a murderer
does not have eternal life remaining in him.
The way we came to know love
was that he laid down his life for us;
so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
If someone who has worldly means
sees a brother in need and refuses him compassion,
how can the love of God remain in him?
Children, let us love not in word or speech
but in deed and truth.

ALLELUIA          John 13:34
Mandatum novum do vobis, dicit Dominus, ut diligatis invicem, sicut
dilexi vos.
I give you a new commandment:
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL           Matthew 25:31-46 (or 31-40)
Jesus said to his disciples:
"When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
and all the angels with him,
he will sit upon his glorious throne,
and all the nations will be assembled before him.
And he will separate them one from another,
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king will say to those on his right,
`Come, you who are blessed by my Father.
Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food,
I was thirsty and you gave me drink,
a stranger and you welcomed me,
naked and you clothed me,
ill and you cared for me,
in prison and you visited me.'
Then the righteous will answer him and say,
`Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,
or thirsty and give you drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you,
or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?
And the king will say to them in reply,
`Amen, I say to you, whatever you did
for these least brothers of mine, you did for me.'
[Then he will say to those on his left,
`Depart from me, you accursed,
into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.
For I was hungry and you gave me no food,
I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,
a stranger and you gave me no welcome,
naked and you gave me no clothing,
ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.'
Then they will answer and say,
`Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty
or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison,
and not minister to your needs?'
He will answer them, 'Amen, I say to you,
what you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for
me.'
And these will go off to eternal punishment, but the righteous to
eternal life."]

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a sermon by Saint Peter Chrysologus, bishop
(De Pace: PL 52, 347-348)
Blessed are the peacemakers
Blessed are the peacemakers, the evangelist said, dearest brethren, for
they shall be called the sons of God. Truly Christian virtues grow in a
man who enjoys the unchangeable possession of Christian peace, nor does
one come to the title of son of God except through that of peacemaker.

Peace, dearest brethren, rescues man from servitude , provides him with
the name of a free man, changes his identity before God together with
his condition, from a servant to a son, and from a slave to a free man.
Peace among brethren is the will of God, the joy of Christ, the
completion of holiness, the rule of justice, the teacher of truth, the
guardian of morals and a praiseworthy discipline in every regard. Peace
lends strength to our prayers; it is the way our petitions can reach
God easily and be credited; it is the plentitude which fulfills our
desires. Peace is the mother of love, the bond of concord and the
manifest sigh of a pure soul, one which seeks to please God, which
seeks to be fulfilled and has its desire rewarded. Peace must be
preserved according to the Lord�s precepts, as Christ said: I leave you
peace, my peace I give you, that is, as I left you in peace, in peace
shall I find you. As Christ left the world, he wished to leave the gift
he wanted to find when he returned.

We have a commandment from heaven to retain his gift; his one word is:
�I shall find what I left.� God�s is the planting of peace in the root,
but the uprooting is from the enemy; for, just as brotherly love comes
from God, so hatred comes from the devil; therefore, we must condemn
our hatred of men, for it is written: He who hates his brother is a
murderer.

Now you see, dearest brethren, why we should love peace and cultivate
harmony: because they beget and nurture love. But you know also from
the apostle John that, Love comes from God, and that whoever is not
with God does not possess love.

Let us therefore, my brethren, keep the commandments, which are life
for us; let us carry on together the obligations of our brotherhood in
profound peace; let us bind one another with the ties of salvific
charity in this mutual love which covers a multitude of sins. Love
ought to be embraced with the grasp of all our desires, since the goods
it provides amount to as many rewards. We just keep peace before all
other virtues, since God is always in peace.

Love peace, and all the world will be tranquil and quiet. By doing so
you store up rewards for me, and joy for yourselves, that the Church of
God may be founded on the bond of peace and may cling to perfect
observance in Christ
RESPONSORY
Share your bread with the hungry,
and take the poor and homeless into your own house.
- Then your light will break forth like the dawn
and your holiness will go before you.
When you see a man who is naked, clothe him,
and do not scorn your brother.
- Then your light will break forth like the dawn
and your holiness will go before you.
