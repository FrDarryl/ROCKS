The Collect

Pour into our hearts, O God, the Holy Spirit's gift of love, that we,
clasping each the other's hand, may share the joy of friendship, human
and divine, and with your servant Aelred draw many to your community of
love; through Jesus Christ the Righteous, who lives and reigns with
you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.

First Reading
Philippians 2:1-4

If then there is any encouragement in Christ, any consolation from
love, any sharing in the Spirit, any compassion and sympathy, make my
joy complete: be of the same mind, having the same love, being in full
accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,
but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of
you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of others.

The Psalm
Psalm 36:5-10
Dixit injustus

5
Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, *
and your faithfulness to the clouds.

6
Your righteousness is like the strong mountains,
your justice like the great deep; *
you save both man and beast, O LORD.

7
How priceless is your love, O God! *
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.

8
They feast upon the abundance of your house; *
you give them drink from the river of your delights.

9
For with you is the well of life, *
and in your light we see light.

10
Continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, *
and your favor to those who are true of heart.

or
Psalm 145:8-13
Exaltabo te, Deus

8
The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, *
slow to anger and of great kindness.

9
The LORD is loving to everyone *
and his compassion is over all his works.

10
All your works praise you, O LORD, *
and your faithful servants bless you.

11
They make known the glory of your kingdom *
and speak of your power;

12
That the peoples may know of your power *
and the glorious splendor of your kingdom.

13
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom; *
your dominion endures throughout all ages.

Gospel Reading
John 15:9-17

Jesus said,"As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in
my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just
as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. I have
said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your
joy may be complete.

"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's
friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I do not call
you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the
master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made
known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. You did not
choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit,
fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask
him in my name. I am giving you these commands so that you may love one
another."
or
Mark 12:28-34a

One of the scribes came near and heard the Saducees disputing with one
another, and seeing that Jesus answered them well, he asked him, "Which
commandment is the first of all?" Jesus answered, "The first is, 'Hear,
O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
mind, and with all your strength.' The second is this, 'You shall love
your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than
these." Then the scribe said to him, "You are right, Teacher; you have
truly said that 'he is one, and besides him there is no other'; and 'to
love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with
all the strength,' and 'to love one's neighbor as oneself,'--this is
much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."
When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not
far from the kingdom of God."
