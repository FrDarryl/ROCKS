Deus, qui beato Caietano presbytero apostolicam vivendi formam imitari
tribuisti, eius nobis exemplo et intercessione concede in te semper
confidere, et regnum tuum indesinenter quaerere.
O God,
who endowed the Priest Saint Cajetan
with the grace of imitating the apostolic way of life,
grant us, through his example and intercession,
to trust in you at all times
and to seek unceasingly your Kingdom.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Sirach 2:7-11
You who fear the LORD, wait for his mercy,
turn not away lest you fall.
You who fear the LORD, trust him,
and your reward will not be lost.
You who fear the LORD, hope for good things,
for lasting joy and mercy.
You who fear the Lord, love him
and your hearts will be enlightened.
Study the generations long past and understand;
has anyone hoped in the LORD and been disappointed?
Has anyone persevered in his commandments and been forsaken?
Has anyone called upon him and been rebuffed?
Compassionate and merciful is the LORD;
he forgives sins, he saves in time of trouble
and he is a protector to all who seek him in truth.

SECOND READING
From a letter by Saint Cajetan, priest
(Epist. ad Elizabeth Porto: Studi e Testi 177. Citta del Vaticano 1954,
pp 50-51)

Christ dwells in our hearts

I am a sinner and do not think much of myself; I have recourse to the
greatest servants of the Lord, that they may pray for you to the
blessed Christ and his Mother. But do not forget that all the saints
can not endear you to Christ as much as you can yourself. It is
entirely up to you. If you want Christ to love you and help you, you
must love him and always make an effort to please him. Do not waver in
your purpose, because even if all the saints and every single creature
should abandon you, he will always be near you, whatever your needs.

You know, of course, that we are pilgrims in this world, on a journey
to our true home in heaven. The man who becomes proud loses his way and
rushes to death. While living here we should strive to gain eternal
life. Yet of ourselves we cannot achieve this since we have lost it
through sin; but Jesus Christ has recovered it for us. For this reason
we must always be grateful to him and love him. We must always obey
him, and as far as possible remain united with him.

He has offered himself to be our food. How wretched is the man who
knows nothing of such a gift! To us has been given the opportunity to
receive Christ, son of the Virgin Mary, and we refuse him. Woe to the
man who does not care enough to receive him. My daughter, I want what
is good for myself; I beg the same for you. Now there is no other way
to bring this about than to ask the Virgin Mary constantly to come to
you with her glorious Son. Be bold! Ask her to give you her Son, who in
the blessed sacrament of the altar is truly the food of your soul.
Readily will she give him to you, still more readily will he come to
you, giving you the strength to make your way fearlessly through this
dark wood. In it large numbers of our enemies lie in wait, but they
cannot reach us if they see us relying on such powerful help.

Nor, my child, must you receive Jesus Christ simply as a means to
further your own plans; I want you to surrender to him, that he my
welcome you and, as your divine Savior, do to you and in you whatever
he wills. This is what I want, this is what I beg of you, this, as far
as I can, is what I compel you to do.
RESPONSORY
Let us praise the fame of this holy man
and his boundless love.
- Turning aside worldly pleasures, he gained eternal life.
For to him life was Christ, and death was gain.
- Turning aside worldly pleasures, he gained eternal life.
COLLECT
