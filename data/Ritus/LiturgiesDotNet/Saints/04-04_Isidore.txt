MASS

From the Common of Pastors: For A Bishop or from the Common of
Doctors of the Church

COLLECT
Graciously hear the prayers, O Lord,
which we make in commemoration of Saint Isidore,
that your Church may be aided by his intercession,
just as she has been instructed by his heavenly teaching.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 4:1-2,5-7
Brothers and sisters: Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of
God, we do not lose heart. We have renounced disgraceful, underhanded
ways; we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but
by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to every
man's conscience in the sight of God. For what we preach is not
ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants
for Jesus' sake. For it is the God who said, "Let light shine out of
darkness," who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the
transcendent power belongs to God and not to us.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          37:3-4, 5-6, 30-31
R. (30a) The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Trust in the Lord and do good
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the LORD,
and he will grant you your heart's requests.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Commit to the LORD your way;
trust in him, and he will act.
He will make justice dawn for you like the light;
bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom
and his tongue utters what is right.
The law of his God is in his heart,
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          Jn 15:5 I am the vine, you are the
branches, says the Lord:
whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit.
GOSPEL          Luke 6:43-45
Jesus said to his disciples: "For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor
again does a bad tree bear good fruit; for each tree is known by its
own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked
from a bramble bush. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart
produces good, and the evil man out of his evil treasure produces evil;
for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.

Office of Readings

From the Book of Maxims by Saint Isidore, bishop
(Lib. 3, 8-10: PL 83, 679-682)
The scholar who is learned about the kingdom of heaven
Prayer purifies us, reading instructs us. Both are good when both are
possible. Otherwise, prayer is better than reading.

If a man wants to be always in God�s company, he must pray regularly
and read regularly. When we pray, we talk to God; when we read, God
talks to us.

All spiritual growth comes from reading and reflection. By reading we
learn what we did not know; by reflection we retain what we have
learned.

Reading the holy Scriptures confers two benefits. It trains the mind to
understand them; it turns man�s attention from the follies of the world
and leads him to the love of God.

Two kinds of study are called for here. We must first learn how the
Scriptures are to be understood, and then see how to expound them with
profit and in a manner worthy of them. A man must first be eager to
understand what he is reading before he is fit to proclaim what he has
learned.

The conscientious reader will be more concerned to carry out what he
has read than merely to acquire knowledge of it. For it is less serious
fault to be ignorant of an objective than it is to fail to carry out
what we do know. In reading we aim at knowing, but we must put into
practice what we have learned in our course of study.

No one can understand holy Scripture without constant reading,
according to the words: Love her and she will exalt you. Embrace her
and she will glorify you.

The more you devote yourself to a study of the sacred utterances, the
richer will be your understanding of them, just as the more the soil is
tilled, the richer the harvest.

Some people have great mental powers but cannot be bothered with
reading; what reading could have taught them is devalued by their
neglect. Others have a desire to know but are hampered by their slow
mental processes; yet application to reading will teach them things
which the clever fail to learn through laziness.

The man who is slow to grasp things but who really tries hard is
rewarded; equally he who does not cultivate his God-given intellectual
ability is condemned for despising his gifts and sinning by sloth.

Learning unsupported by grace may get into our ears; it never reaches
the heart. It makes a great noise outside but serves no inner purpose.
But when God�s grace touches our innermost minds to bring
understanding, his word which has been received by the ear sinks deep
into the heart.
RESPONSORY       Matthew 13:52; Proverbs 14:33
When a teacher of the law becomes a disciple of the kingdom of heaven,
- he is like the head of a household
who is able to take from his storeroom treasures new and old
(alleluia).
Wisdom makes its home in a discerning heart,
and it can even teach those who are foolish.
- he is like the head of a household
who is able to take from his storeroom treasures new and old
(alleluia).
COLLECT
Graciously hear the prayers, O Lord,
which we make in commemoration of Saint Isidore,
that your Church may be aided by his intercession,
just as she has been instructed by his heavenly teaching.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
