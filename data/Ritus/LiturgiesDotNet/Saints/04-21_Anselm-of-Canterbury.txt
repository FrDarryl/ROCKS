From the Common of Pastors: For A Bishop or from the Common of
Doctors of the Church

COLLECT
O God, who led the Bishop Saint Anselm
to seek out and teach the depths of your wisdom,
grant, we pray,
that our faith in you may so aid our understanding,
that what we believe by your command
may give delight to our hearts.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 3:14-19
Brothers and sisters:
I kneel before the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory
to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self,
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith;
that you, rooted and grounded in love,
may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11
Gustate et videte quoniam suavis est Dominus.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord. Or: Alleluia.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
praise shall be always in my mouth.
My soul will glory in the LORD
that the poor may hear and be glad.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord. Or: Alleluia.
Magnify the LORD with me;

delivered me from all my fears.

Look to God that you may be radiant with joy
and your faces may not blush for shame.
In my misfortune I called,
the LORD heard and saved me from all distress.

The angel of the LORD, who encamps with them,
delivers all who fear God.

happy are those who take refuge in him.

Fear the LORD, you holy ones;
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.
The powerful grow poor and hungry,
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.

VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          Jn 6:63,68c
Spiritus et vita sunt; verba vitae aeternae habes.
Your words, Lord, are Spirit and life,
you have the words of eternal life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 7:21-29
Jesus said to his disciples:
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,'
will enter the Kingdom of heaven,
but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day,
`Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?
Did we not drive out demons in your name?
Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?'
Then I will declare to them solemnly,
`I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers.'

"Everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them
will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain fell, the floods came,
and the winds blew and buffeted the house.
But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly on rock.
And everyone who listens to these words of mine
but does not act on them
will be like a fool who built his house on sand.
The rain fell, the floods came,
and the winds blew and buffeted the house.
And it collapsed and was completely ruined."

When Jesus finished these words,
the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
for he taught them as one having authority,
and not as their scribes.

The Liturgy of the Hours
Anselm of Canterbury

From the Common of Pastors or the Common of Doctors, except the
following:
Office of Readings
From the Proslogion by St Anselm
(Cap. 14, 16, 26: Opera omnia, edit. Schmitt, Seccovii, 1938, 1,
111-113, 121-122)
Let me know you and love you, so that I may find my joy in you

My soul, have you found what you are looking for? You were looking for
God, and you have discovered that he is the supreme being, and that you
could not possibly imagine anything more perfect. You have discovered
that this supreme being is life itself, light, wisdom, goodness,
eternal blessedness and blessed eternity. He is everywhere, and he is
timeless.

Lord my God, you gave me life and restored it when I lost it. Tell my
soul that so longs for you what else you are besides what it has
already understood, so that it may see you clearly. It stands on tiptoe
to see more, but apart from what it has seen already, it sees nothing
but darkness. Of course it does not really see darkness, because there
is no darkness in you, but it sees that it can see no further because
of the darkness in itself.

Surely, Lord, inaccessible light is your dwelling place, for no one
apart from yourself can enter into it and fully comprehend you. If I
fail to see this light it is simply because it is too bright for me.
Still, it is by this light that I do see all that I can, even as weak
eyes, unable to look straight at the sun, see all that they can by the
sun’s light.

The light in which you dwell, Lord, is beyond my understanding. It is
so brilliant that I cannot bear it, I cannot turn my mind’s eye toward
it for any length of time. I am dazzled by its brightness, amazed by
its grandeur, overwhelmed by its immensity, bewildered by its
abundance.

O supreme and inaccessible light, O complete and blessed truth, how far
you are from me, even though I am so near to you! How remote you are
from my sight, even though I am present to yours! You are everywhere in
your entirety, and yet I do not see you; in you I move and have my
being, and yet I cannot approach you; you are within me and around me,
and yet I do not perceive you.

O God, let me know you and love you so that I may find my joy in you;
and if I cannot do so fully in this life, let me at least make some
progress every day, until at last that knowledge, love and joy come to
me in all their plenitude. While I am here on earth let me learn to
know you better, so that in heaven I may know you fully; let my love
for you grow deeper here, so that there I may love you fully. On earth
then I shall have great joy in hope, and in heaven complete joy in the
fulfilment of my hope.

O Lord, through your Son you command us, no, you counsel us to ask, and
you promise that you will hear us so that our joy may be complete.
Lord, I am making the request that you urge us to make through your
Wonder-Counsellor. Give me then what you promise to give through your
Truth. You, O God, are faithful; grant that I may receive my request,
so that my joy may be complete.

Meanwhile, let this hope of mine be in my thoughts and on my tongue;
let my heart be filled with it, my voice speak of it; let my soul
hunger for it, my body thirst for it, my whole being yearn for it,
until I enter into the joy of the Lord, who is Three in One, blessed
for ever. Amen.
