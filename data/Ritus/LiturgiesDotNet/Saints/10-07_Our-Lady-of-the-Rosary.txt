COLLECT
Gratiam tuam, quaesumus, Domine, mentibus nostris infunde, ut, qui,
Angelo nuntiante, Christi Filii tui incarnationem cognovimus, beata
Maria Virgine intercedente, per passionem eius et crucem ad
resurrectionis gloriam perducamur.
Pour forth, we beseech you, O Lord,
your grace into our hearts,
that we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ your Son
was made known by the message of an Angel,
may, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
by his Passion and Cross
be brought to the glory of his Resurrection.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Acts1:12-14
After Jesus had been taken up into heaven,
the Apostles returned to Jerusalem
from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem,
a Sabbath day's journey away.

When they entered the city
they went to the upper room where they were staying,
Peter and John and James and Andrew,
Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew,
James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot,
and Judas son of James.
All these devoted themselves with one accord to prayer,
together with some women,
and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Luke 1:46-47, 48-49, 50-51, 52-53, 54-55
R./ The Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
or:
R./ O blessed Virgin Mary, you carried the Son of the eternal Father.
"My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior."
R./
"For he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed.
The Almighty has done great things for me,
holy is his Name."
R./
"He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit."
R./
"He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty."
R./
"He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children forever."
R./
ALLELUIA        Luke 1:28
Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum: benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you;
blessed are you among women
GOSPEL          Luke 1:26-38
The angel Gabriel was sent from God
to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,
to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph,
of the house of David,
and the virgin's name was Mary.
And coming to her, he said,
"Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you."
But she was greatly troubled at what was said
and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
Then the angel said to her,
"Do not be afraid, Mary,
for you have found favor with God.
Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,
and you shall name him Jesus.
He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,
and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,
and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,
and of his Kingdom there will be no end."
But Mary said to the angel,
"How can this be,
since I have no relations with a man?"
And the angel said to her in reply,
"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
Therefore the child to be born
will be called holy, the Son of God.
And behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
has also conceived a son in her old age,
and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;
for nothing will be impossible for God."
Mary said, "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.
May it be done to me according to your word."
Then the angel departed from her.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Fac nos, quaesumus, Domine, his muneribus oblatis convenienter aptari,
et Unigeniti tui mysteria ita recolere, ut eius digni promissionibus
effici mereamur.
Grant, we pray, O Lord,
that we may be rightly conformed to these offerings we bring
and so honor the mysteries of your Only Begotten Son,
as to be made worthy of his promises.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY I
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
and to praise, bless, and glorify your name
on the feast day of the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary.

For by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit
she conceived your Only Begotten Son,
and without losing the glory of virginity,
brought forth into the world the eternal Light,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven
and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in humble praise, as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
Or:
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY II
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
to praise your mighty deeds
in the exaltation of all the Saints,
and especially, as we celebrate
the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
to proclaim your kindness
as we echo her thankful hymn of praise.

For truly even to the earth's ends
you have done great things
and extended your abundant mercy from age to age:
when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid,
you gave us through her the author of our salvation,
your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise,
as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Lk 1:31
Ecce concipies in utero, et paries filium, et vocabis nomen eius Iesum.
Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,
and you shall name him Jesus.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Quaesumus, Domine Deus noster, ut, qui in hoc sacramento Filii tui
mortem et resurrectionem annuntiamus, eius socii passionum effecti,
consolationis etiam ac gloriae mereamur esse participes.
We pray, O Lord our God,
that, just as we proclaim in this Sacrament
the Death and Resurrection of your Son,
so, being made partakers in his suffering,
we may also merit a share
in his consolation and his glory.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
