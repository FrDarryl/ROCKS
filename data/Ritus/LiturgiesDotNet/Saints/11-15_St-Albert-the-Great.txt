Deus, qui beatum Albertum episcopum in humana sapientia cum divina fide
componenda magnum effecisti, da nobis, quaesumus, ita eius magisterii
inhaerere doctrinis, ut per scientiarum progressus ad profundiorem tui
cognitionem et amorem perveniamus.
O God, who made the Bishop Saint Albert great
by his joining of human wisdom to divine faith,
grant, we pray, that we may so adhere to the truths he taught,
that through progress in learning
we may come to a deeper knowledge and love of you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Sirach 15:1-6
He who fears the LORD will do this;
he who is practiced in the law will come to wisdom.
Motherlike she will meet him,
like a young bride she will embrace him,
Nourish him with the bread of understanding,
and give him the water of learning to drink.
He will lean upon her and not fall,
he will trust in her and not be put to shame.
She will exalt him above his fellows;
and in the midst of the assembly she will open his mouth
and fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
and clothe him with the robe of glory.
Joy and gladness he will find,
an everlasting name he will inherit.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 119:9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
How can the young walk without fault?
Only by keeping your words.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
With all my heart I seek you;
do not let me stray from your commands.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
In my heart I treasure your promise,
that I may not sin against you.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
Blessed are you, O LORD;
teach me your laws.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
With my lips I recite
all the edicts you have spoken.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
I find joy in the way of your decrees
more than in all riches.
R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
ALLELUIA          John 8:31b-32
Si manseritis in sermone meo, vere discipuli mei estis, et cognoscetis
veritatem, dicit Dominus.
If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples,
and you will know the truth, says the Lord.
GOSPEL          Matthew 13:47-52
Jesus said to the crowds:
"The Kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea,
which collects fish of every kind.
When it is full they haul it ashore
and sit down to put what is good into buckets.
What is bad they throw away.
Thus it will be at the end of the age.
The angels will go out and separate the wicked from the righteous
and throw them into the fiery furnace,
where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.
Do you understand all these things?"
They answered, "Yes."
And he replied,
"Then every scribe who has been instructed in the Kingdom of heaven
is like the head of a household who brings from his storeroom
both the new and the old."

for the following:

The Office of Readings

From a commentary of the gospel of Luke by Saint Albert the Great,
bishop
(22,19; Opera omnia, Parisiis 1890-1899,23,672-674)
He was a shepherd and doctor who built up the body of Christ
Do this in remembrance of me. Two things should be noted here. The
first is the command that we should use this sacrament, which is
indicated when he says: Do this. The second is that this sacrament
commemorates the Lord's going to death for our sake.

Do this. Certainly he would demand nothing more profitable, nothing
more pleasant, nothing more beneficial, nothing more desirable, nothing
more similar to eternal life. We will look at each of these qualities
separately.

This sacrament is profitable because it grants remission of sins; it is
most useful because it bestows the fullness of grace on us in this
life. The Father of spirits instructs us in what is useful for our
sanctification. And his sanctification is in Christ's sacrifice, that
is, when he offers himself in this sacrament to the Father for our
redemption, to us for our use. I consecrate myself for their sakes.
Christ, who through the Holy Spirit offered himself up without blemish
to God, will cleanse our consciences from dead works to worship the
living God.

Nor can we do anything more pleasant. For what is better than God
manifesting his whole sweetness to us. You gave them bread from heaven,
not the fruit of human labor, but a bread endowed with all delight and
pleasant to every sense of taste. For this substance of yours revealed
your kindness toward your children, and serving the desire of each
recipient, it changed to suit each one's taste.

He could not have commanded anything more beneficial, for this
sacrament is the fruit of the tree of life. Anyone who receives this
sacrament with the devotion of sincere faith will never taste death. It
is a tree of life for those who grasp it, and blessed is he who holds
it fast. The man who feeds on me shall live on account of me.

Nor could he have commanded anything more lovable, for this sacrament
produces love and union. It is characteristic of the greatest love to
give itself as food. Had not the men of my tent exclaimed: Who will
feed us with his flesh to satisfy our hunger? as if to say: I have
loved them and they have loved me so much that I desire to be within
them, and they wish to receive me so that they may become my members.
There is no more intimate or more natural means for them to be united
to me, and I to them.

Nor could he have commanded anything which is more like eternal life.
Eternal life flows from this sacrament because God with all sweetness
pours himself out upon the blessed.
RESPONSORY          Luke 22:29; John 15:16
Just as the Father handed a kingdom over to me,
I now hand on over to you.
- In my kingdom you will eat and drink at my table.
I chose you and appointed you to go forth and bear fruit.
- In my kingdom you will eat and drink at my table.
