COLLECT
Deus, qui beatum Ludovicum e terreni regiminis cura ad caelestis regni
gloriam transtulisti, eius, quaesumus, intercessione concede, ut, per
munera temporalia quae gerimus, regnum tuum quaeramus aeternum.
O God, who brought Saint Louis
from the cares of earthly rule
to the glory of a heavenly realm,
grant, we pray, through his intercession,
that, by fulfilling our duties on earth,
we may seek out your eternal Kingdom.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING      Isaiah 58:6-11
Thus says the Lord:
This is the fasting that I wish:
releasing those bound unjustly,
untying the thongs of the yoke;
Setting free the oppressed,
breaking off every yoke?
Is it not sharing your bread with the hungry,
bringing the afflicted and the homeless into your house;
Clothing the naked when you see them,
and not turning your back on your own flesh?
Then your light shall break forth like the dawn,
and your wound shall quickly be healed;
Your vindication shall go before you,
and the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.
Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer,
you shall cry for help, and he will say: �Here I am!�
If you remove the yoke from among you,
the accusing finger, and malicious speech;
If you lavish your food on the hungry
and satisfy the afflicted;
Then your light shall rise in the darkness,
and your gloom shall become like midday;
Then the LORD will guide you always
and satisfy your thirst in parched places,
will give strength to your bones
And you shall be like a watered garden,
like a flowing spring whose waters never fail.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM            Psalm 112:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9

ALLELUIA          John 13:34
Mandatum novum do vobis, dicit Dominus, ut diligatis invicem, sicut
dilexi vos..
I give you a new commandment:
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL             Matthew 22:34-40
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,
they gathered together, and one of them,
a scholar of the law, tested him by asking,
�Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?�
He said to him,
�You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart,
with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the greatest and the first commandment.
The second is like it:
You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.�

SECOND READING
From a spiritual testament to his son by St. Louis
(Acta Sanctorum Augusti 5 , 546))
A just king rules the earth
My dearest son, my first instruction is that you should love the Lord
your God with all your heart and all your strength. Without this there
is no salvation. Keep yourself, my son, from everything that you know
displeases God, that is to say, from every mortal sin. You should
permit yourself to be tormented by every kind of martyrdom before you
would allow yourself to commit a mortal sin.

If the Lord has permitted you to have some trial, bear it willingly and
with gratitude, considering that it has happened for your good and that
perhaps you well deserved it. If the Lord bestows upon you any kind of
prosperity, thank him humbly and see that you become no worse for it,
either through vain pride or anything else, because you ought not to
oppose God or offend him in the matter of his gifts.

Listen to the divine office with pleasure and devotion. As long as you
are in church, be careful not to let your eyes wander and not to speak
empty words, but pray to the Lord devoutly, either aloud or with the
interior prayer of the heart.

Be kindhearted to the poor, the unfortunate and the afflicted. Give
them as much help and consolation as you can. Thank God for all the
benefits he has bestowed upon you, that you may be worthy to receive
greater. Be just to your subjects, swaying neither to right nor left,
but holding the line of justice. Always side with the poor rather that
with the rich, until you are certain of the truth. See that all your
subjects live in justice and peace, but especially those who have
ecclesiastical rank and who belong to religious orders.

Be devout and obedient to our mother the Church of Rome and the Supreme
Pontiff as your spiritual father. Work to remove all sin from your
land, particularly blasphemies and heresies.

In conclusion, dearest son, I give you every blessing that a loving
father can give a son. May the three Persons of the Holy Trinity and
all the saints protect you from every evil. And may the Lord give you
the grace to do his will so that he may be served and honored through
you, that in the next life we may together come to see him, love him
and praise him unceasingly. Amen.
RESPONSORY          2 Kings 18:3,5,6,7
He did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord;
among all kings none could compare with him.
- He was loyal to the Lord and never turned away from him.
The Lord was with him,
because he kept his commandments.
- He was loyal to the Lord and never turned away from him.
