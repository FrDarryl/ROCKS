Sanctus martyr, Domine, Bonifatius pro nobis interventor exsistat, ut
fidem, quam ore docuit et sanguine consignavit, firmiter teneamus, et
operibus profiteamur confidenter.
May the Martyr Saint Boniface be our advocate, O Lord,
that we may firmly hold the faith
he taught with his lips and sealed in his blood
and confidently profess it by our deeds.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Acts 26:19-23
Paul said:
"King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
On the contrary, first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem
and throughout the whole country of Judea,
and then to the Gentiles,
I preached the need to repent and turn to God,
and to do works giving evidence of repentance.
That is why the Jews seized me when I was in the temple
and tried to kill me.
But I have enjoyed God's help to this very day,
and so I stand here testifying to small and great alike,
saying nothing different from what the prophets and Moses foretold,
that the Messiah must suffer and that,
as the first to rise from the dead,
he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 117:1bc, 2
Eúntes in mundum univérsum prædicáte Evangélium.
R. (Mk 16:15) Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
Praise the LORD, all you nations;
glorify him, all you peoples!
R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
For steadfast is his kindness for us,
and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever.
ALLELUIA          2 Cor 1:3b-4a
I am the good shepherd, says the Lord;
I know my sheep and mine know me.
GOSPEL          John 10:11-16
Jesus said:
"I am the good shepherd.
A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
A hired man, who is not a shepherd
and whose sheep are not his own,
sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away,
and the wolf catches and scatters them.
This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd,
and I know mine and mine know me,
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father;
and I will lay down my life for the sheep.
I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold.
These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice,
and there will be one flock, one shepherd."

From the Office of Readings

From a letter by Saint Boniface
(Ep. 78: MGH, Epistolae,3, 352-354)
The careful shepherd watches over Christ's flock
In her voyage across the ocean of this world, the Church is like a
great ship being pounded by the waves of life's different stresses. Our
duty is not to abandon ship but to keep her on her course.

The ancient fathers showed us how we should carry out this duty:
Clement, Cornelius and many others in the city of Rome, Cyprian at
Carthage, Athanasius at Alexandria. They all lived under emperors who
were pagans; they all steered Christ's ship - or rather his most dear
spouse, the Church. This they did by teaching and defending her, by
their labours and sufferings, even to the shedding of blood.

I am terrified when I think of all this. Fear and trembling came upon
me and the darkness of my sins almost covered me. I would gladly give
up the task of guiding the Church which I have accepted if I could find
such an action warranted by the example of the fathers or by holy
Scripture.

Since this is the case, and since the truth can be assaulted but never
defeated or falsified, with our tired mind let us turn to the words of
Solomon: Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not rely on your
own prudence. Think on him in all your ways, and he will guide your
steps. In another place he says: The name of the Lord is an impregnable
tower. The just man seeks refuge in it and he will be saved.

Let us stand fast in what is right and prepare our souls for trial. Let
us wait upon God's strengthening aid and say to him: O Lord, you have
been our refuge in all generations.

Let us trust in him who has placed this burden upon us. What we
ourselves cannot bear let us bear with the help of Christ. For he is
all-powerful and he tells us: My yoke is easy and my burden is light.

Let us continue the fight on the day of the Lord. The days of anguish
and of tribulation have overtaken us; if God so wills, let us die for
the holy laws of our fathers, so that we may deserve to obtain an
eternal inheritance with them.

Let us be neither dogs that do not bark nor silent onlookers nor paid
servants who run away before the wolf. Instead let us be careful
shepherds watching over Christ's flock. Let us preach the whole of
God's plan to the powerful and to the humble, to rich and to poor, to
men of every rank and age, as far as God gives us the strength, in
season and out of season, as Saint Gregory writes in his book of
Pastoral Instruction.
RESPONSORY       1 Thessalonians 2:8; Galatians 4:19
I have longed to give you the Gospel,
and more than that, to give you my very life;
- you have become very dear to me.

My little children, I am like a mother giving birth to you,
until Christ is formed in you.
- you have become very dear to me.
