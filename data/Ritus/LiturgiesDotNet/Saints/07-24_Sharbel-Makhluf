   Deus, qui sanctum Sarbelium, presbyterum, ad singularem pugnam eremi
   vocasti et omni genere pietatis imbuisti, concede nobis, quaesumus, ut
   imitatores dominicae passionis effecti regno eius mereamur esse
   consortes.
   O God, who called the Priest Saint Sharbel Makhluf
   to the solitary combat of the desert
   and imbued him with all manner of devotion,
   grant us, we pray,
   that, being made imitators of the Lord's Passion,
   we may merit to be co-heirs of his Kingdom.
   Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
   God, for ever and ever.
   FIRST READING          Sirach 3:17-24
   My child, conduct your affairs with humility,
   and you will be loved more than a giver of gifts.
   Humble yourself the more, the greater you are,
   and you will find favor with God.
   The greater you are,
   the more you must humble yourself in all things,
   and you will find grace before God.
   For great is the power of God;
   by the humble he is glorified.
   What is too sublime for you, seek not,
   into things beyond your strength search not.
   What is committed to you, attend to;
   for it is not necessary for you to see with your eyes
   those things which are hidden.
   With what is too much for you meddle not,
   when shown things beyond human understanding.
   Their own opinion has misled many,
   and false reasoning unbalanced their judgment.
   Where the pupil of the eye is missing, there is no light,
   and where there is no knowledge, there is no wisdom.
   REPONSORIAL PSALM          15:2-3a, 3bc-4ab, 5
   R. (1) The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
   He who walks blamelessly and does justice;
   who thinks the truth in his heart
   and slanders not with his tongue.
   R. The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
   Who harms not his fellow man,
   nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;
   By whom the reprobate is despised,
   while he honors those who fear the LORD.
   R. The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
   Who lends not his money at usury
   and accepts no bribe against the innocent.
   He who does these things
   shall never be disturbed.
   R. The just one shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord.
   ALLELUIA          Matthew 5:3
   Blessed are the poor in spirit,
   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
   GOSPEL          Matthew 19:27-29
   Peter said to Jesus,
   "We have given up everything and followed you.
   What will there be for us?"
   Jesus said to them, "Amen, I say to you
   that you who have followed me, in the new age,
   when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory,
   will yourselves sit on twelve thrones,
   judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
   And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters
   or father or mother or children or lands
   for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more,
   and will inherit eternal life."
