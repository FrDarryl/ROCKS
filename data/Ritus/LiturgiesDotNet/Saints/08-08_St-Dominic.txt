MASS

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf. Sir 15: 5
In medio Ecclesiae aperuit os eius, et implevit eum Dominus spiritu
sapientiae et intellectus: stolam gloriae induit eum.
In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth,
and the LORD filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding
and clothed him in a robe of glory, alleluia.
COLLECT
Adiuvet Ecclesiam tuam, Domine, beatus Dominicus meritis et doctrinis,
atque pro nobis efficiatur piissimus interventor, qui tuae veritatis
exstitit praedicator eximius.
May Saint Dominic come to the help of your Church
by his merits and teaching, O Lord,
and may he, who was an outstanding preacher of your truth,
be a devoted intercessor on our behalf.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 2:1-10a
When I came to you, brothers and sisters,
proclaiming the mystery of God,
I did not come with sublimity of words or of wisdom.
For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you
except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
I came to you in weakness and fear and much trembling,
and my message and my proclamation
were not with persuasive words of wisdom,
but with a demonstration of spirit and power,
so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom
but on the power of God.

Yet we do speak a wisdom to those who are mature,
but not a wisdom of this age,
nor of the rulers of this age who are passing away.
Rather, we speak God's wisdom, mysterious, hidden,
which God predetermined before the ages for our glory,
and which none of the rulers of this age knew;
for, if they had known it,
they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But as it is written:

What eye has not seen, and ear has not heard,
and what has not entered the human heart,
what God has prepared for those who love him,
this God has revealed to us through the Spirit.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          96:1-2a, 2b-3, 7-8a, 10
Annuntiate in omnibus populis mirabilia Domini.
R. (3) Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Sing to the LORD a new song;
sing to the LORD, all you lands.
Sing to the LORD; bless his name.
R. Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Announce his salvation, day after day.
Tell his glory among the nations;
among all peoples, his wondrous deeds.
R. Proclaim his marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Give to the LORD, you families of nations,
give to the LORD glory and praise;
give to the LORD the glory due his name!
R. Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
Say among the nations: The LORD is king.
He has made the world firm, not to be moved;
he governs the peoples with equity.
R. Proclaim God's marvelous deeds to all the nations.
GOSPEL          Luke 9:57-62
As Jesus and his disciples were proceeding on their journey
someone said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered him,
"Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests,
but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head."
And to another he said, "Follow me."
But he replied, "Lord, let me go first and bury my father."
But he answered him, "Let the dead bury their dead.
But you, go and proclaim the Kingdom of God."
And another said, "I will follow you, Lord,
but first let me say farewell to my family at home."
He said, "No one who sets a hand to the plow
and looks to what was left behind is fit for the Kingdom of God."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Preces, quas tibi, Domine, offerimus, intercedente beato Dominico,
clementer intende, et, huius sacrificii virtute potenti, propugnatores
fidei gratiae tuae protectione confirma.
Attend mercifully to the prayers we offer you, O Lord,
by the intercession of Saint Dominic,
and through the great power of this sacrifice
strengthen by the protection of your grace
those who champion the faith.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Luke 12:42
Fidelis servus et prudens, quem constituit Dominus super familiam suam,
ut det illis in tempore tritici mensuram.
This is the steward, faithful and prudent,
whom the Lord set over his household
to give them their allowance of food at the proper time.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Caelestis, Domine, virtutem sacramenti, quo in beati commemoratione
Dominici pasti sumus, percipiat Ecclesia tua plenae devotionis affectu,
et cuius praedicatione floruit, eius intercessione iuvetur.
May your Church, O Lord,
receive with wholehearted reverence
the power of this heavenly Sacrament,
by which we have been nourished
on the commemoration of Saint Dominic,
and may your Church,
having flourished by means of his preaching,
be helped through his intercession.
Through Christ our Lord.

SECOND READING
From various writings on the history of the Order of Preachers
(Libellus de principiis O.P: Acta canonizationis sancti Dominici:
Monumenta O.P. Mist. 16, Romae 1935, pp. 30 ss, 146-`57)
He spoke with God or about God
Dominic possessed such great integrity and was so strongly motivated by
divine love, that without a doubt he proved to be a bearer of honor and
grace. He was a man of great equanimity, except when moved to
compassion and mercy. And since a joyful heart animates the face, he
displayed the peaceful composure of a spiritual man in the kindness he
manifested outwardly and by the cheerfulness of his countenance.

Wherever he went he showed himself in word and deed to be a man of the
Gospel. During the day no one was more community-minded or pleasant
toward his brothers and associates. During the night hours no one was
more persistent in every kind of vigil and supplication. He seldom
spoke unless it was with God, that is, in prayer, or about God, and in
this matter he instructed his brothers. Frequently he made a special
personal petition that God would deign to grant him a genuine charity,
effective in caring for and obtaining the salvation of men. For he
believed that only then would he be truly a member of Christ, when he
had given himself totally for the salvation of men, just as the LORD
Jesus, the Savior of all, had offered himself completely for our
salvation. So, for this work, after a lengthy period of careful and
provident planning, he founded the Order of Friars Preachers.

In his conversations and letters he often urged the brothers of the
Order to study constantly the Old and New Testaments. He always carried
with him the gospel according to Matthew and the epistles of Paul, and
so well did he study them that he almost knew them from memory.

Two or three times he was chosen bishop, but he always refused,
preferring to live with his brothers in poverty. Throughout his life,
he preserved the honor of his virginity. He desired to be scourged and
cut to pieces, and so die for the faith of Christ. Of him Pope Gregory
IX declared: “I knew him as a steadfast follower of the apostolic way
of life. There is no doubt that he is in heaven, sharing in the glory
of the apostles themselves”.
RESPONSORY      See Sirach 48:1; Malachi 2:6
This preacher of the new salvation leaped up like a flame.
- His words burned like a torch.
True teaching was in his mouth;
no evil was ever found on his lips.
- His words burned like a torch.
