Deus patrum nostrorum, qui beatam Teresiam Benedictam martyrem ad
cognitionem Filii tui crucifixi eiusque imitationem usque ad mortem
perduxisti, ipsa intercedente, concede, ut omnes homines Christum
Salvatorem agnoscant et per eum ad perpetuam tui visionem adveniant.
God of our Fathers,
who brought the Martyr Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross
to know your crucified Son
and to imitate him even until death,
grant, through her intercession,
that the whole human race may acknowledge Christ as its Savior
and through him come to behold you for eternity.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING            Esther C:12, 14-16, 23, 25
Queen Esther, seized with mortal anguish, fled to the Lord for refuge.
Then she prayed to the Lord, the God of Israel, saying:
"My Lord, you alone are our King.
Help me, who am alone and have no help but you,
for I am taking my life in my hand.
From birth, I have heard among my people that you, Lord,
chose Israel from among all nations,
and our ancestors from among all their forebears,
as a lasting inheritance,
and that you fulfilled all your promises to them.

Be mindful of us, Lord.
Make yourself known in the time of our distress and give me courage,
King of gods and Ruler of every power.
Save us by your power, and help me,
who am alone and have no one but you, Lord."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          33:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11
R. (2a) I will bless the Lord at all times.
Give thanks to the LORD on the harp;
on the ten-stringed lyre offer praise.
Sing to him a new song;
skillfully play with joyful chant.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
For the LORD's word is upright;
all his works are trustworthy.
He loves justice and right.
The earth is full of the mercy of the LORD.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
By the LORD's word the heavens were made;
by the breath of his mouth all their host.
He gathered the waters of the sea as a mound;
he sets the deep into storage vaults.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
Let all the earth fear the LORD;
let all who dwell in the world show him reverence.
For he spoke, and it came to be,
commanded, and it stood in place.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
The LORD foils the plan of nations,
frustrates the designs of peoples.
But the plan of the LORD stands forever,
the designs of his heart through all generations.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
regnum caelorum.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL           John 4:19-24
The Samaritan woman said to Jesus,
�Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.
Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain;
but you people say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem.�
Jesus said to her, �Believe me, woman,
the hour is coming when you will worship the Father
neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
You people worship what you do not understand;
we worship what we understand, because salvation is from the Jews.
But the hour is coming, and is now here,
when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth;
and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him.
God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and
truth.�

The Liturgy of the Hours
Teresa Benedicta of the Cross

From the Common of Virgins, or of One Martyr, except the
following:

SECOND READING

From "The Wisdom of the Cross", by Teresa Benedicta of the Cross

The gates of life open to believers in the Crucified

Christ put on the yoke of the Law, fulfilling the Law's commands and
dying for the Law and through the Law. By this he freed those who
desire to receive life through him; but they cannot receive that life
unless they themselves offer their own lives. For whoever is baptized
into Christ Jesus is baptized into his death. They are immersed in his
life so that they become like parts of his own body and, like the parts
of his body, suffer with him and die. This life will come in its full
abundance on the day of glory; but even now, still in the flesh, we can
be part of it if we believe: if we believe Christ to have died for us
in order to confer life on us. By that faith we are united to him as
the body is united to the head; that faith opens to us the wellsprings
of his life. Thus faith in the Crucified � living faith, united with
devoted love � is for us the doorway to life and the beginning of the
glory that is to come. Thus the Cross is our only boast: As for me, the
only thing I can boast about is the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.

Whoever chooses Christ is dead to the world and the world is dead to
him. He bears the wounds of Christ in his body, he is weak and despised
by men, but his cause is strong because the strength of God is made
perfect in weakness. Knowing this, the disciple of Christ does not
merely accept the Cross that has been laid upon him, but he himself
crucifies his own self: Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified
the flesh with all its passions and desires. They have fought a hard
battle against their nature, so that the life of sin should die within
them and the life of the Spirit be given room to flourish. That battle
demands the greatest fortitude. But the Cross is not the end: it is
lifted up and shows us the way to heaven. It is not merely a sign, but
Christ's undefeated weapon: it is the shepherd's sling with which the
divine David battles the evil Goliath. With it, Christ knocks loudly at
the door of heaven and opens it. When these things come to pass the
light of God will shine out and all who follow the Crucified will be
filled with it.
RESPONSORY          Gal 2, 19-20
I have been crucified with Christ, and I live now not with my own life
but with the life of Christ who lives in me,*
- who loved me and sacrificed himself for my sake.
The life I live in this body I live in faith: faith in the Son of God,*
- who loved me and sacrificed himself for my sake.
COLLECT
