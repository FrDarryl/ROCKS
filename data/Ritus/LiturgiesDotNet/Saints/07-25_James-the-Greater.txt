Eucharistic Readings

Jeremiah 45:1-5

The word that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah, when
he wrote these words in a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the
fourth year of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah: Thus says the
LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: You said, "Woe is me! The
LORD has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I
find no rest." Thus you shall say to him, "Thus says the LORD: I am
going to break down what I have built, and pluck up what I have
planted-- that is, the whole land. And you, do you seek great things
for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am going to bring disaster upon
all flesh, says the LORD; but I will give you your life as a prize of
war in every place to which you may go."

Acts 11:27-12:3

At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them
named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a
severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign
of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability,
each would send relief to the believers living in Judea; this they did,
sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.

About that time King Herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to
the church. He had James, the brother of John, killed with the sword.
After he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter
also. (This was during the festival of Unleavened Bread.)

Psalm 7:1-10

Domine, Deus meus

^1 O Lord my God, in you I take refuge; *
save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me,
^2 Lest they rend me like a lion and tear me in pieces *
while there is no one to help me.
^3 O Lord my God, if I have done these things: *
if there is any wickedness in my hands,
^4 If I have repaid my friend with evil, *
or plundered my enemy without a cause,
^5 Then let my enemy pursue me and overtake me, *
trample my life to the ground,
and lay my honour in the dust.
^6 Rise up, O Lord, in your wrath;
lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies. *
Awaken, my God, the judgement that you have commanded.
^7 Let the assembly of the peoples gather round you; *
be seated high above them: O Lord, judge the nations.
^8 Give judgement for me
according to my righteousness, O Lord, *
and according to the innocence that is in me.
^9 Let the malice of the wicked come to an end,
but establish the righteous; *
for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God.
^10 God is my shield that is over me; *
he saves the true of heart.

Matthew 20:20-28

The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, and
kneeling before him, she asked a favor of him. And he said to her,
"What do you want?" She said to him, "Declare that these two sons of
mine will sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your
kingdom." But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are
you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him,
"We are able." He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, but to
sit at my right hand and at my left, this is not mine to grant, but it
is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."

When the ten heard it, they were angry with the two brothers. But Jesus
called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles
lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. It will
not be so among you; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be
your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your
slave; just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and
to give his life a ransom for many."

Morning Prayer

Psalm 34

Benedicam Dominum

^1 I will bless the Lord at all times; *
his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
^2 My soul shall glory in the Lord; *
let the humble hear and be glad.
^3 O magnify the Lord with me; *
let us exalt his name together.
^4 I sought the Lord and he answered me *
and delivered me from all my fears.
^5 Look upon him and be radiant *
and your faces shall not be ashamed.
^6 This poor soul cried, and the Lord heard me *
and saved me from all my troubles.
^7 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him *
and delivers them.
^8 O taste and see that the Lord is gracious; *
blessed is the one who trusts in him.
^9 Fear the Lord, all you his holy ones, *
for those who fear him lack nothing.
^10 Lions may lack and suffer hunger, *
but those who seek the Lord
lack nothing that is good.
^11 Come, my children, and listen to me; *
I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
^12 Who is there who delights in life *
and longs for days to enjoy good things?
^13 Keep your tongue from evil *
and your lips from lying words.
^14 Turn from evil and do good; *
seek peace and pursue it.
^15 The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous *
and his ears are open to their cry.
^16 The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, *
to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.
^17 The righteous cry and the Lord hears them *
and delivers them out of all their troubles.
^18 The Lord is near to the brokenhearted *
and will save those who are crushed in spirit.
^19 Many are the troubles of the righteous; *
from them all will the Lord deliver them.
^20 He keeps all their bones, *
so that not one of them is broken.
^21 But evil shall slay the wicked *
and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
^22 The Lord ransoms the life of his servants *
and will condemn none who seek refuge in him.

Jeremiah 16:14-2

1 Therefore, the days are surely coming, says the LORD, when it shall
no longer be said, "As the LORD lives who brought the people of Israel
up out of the land of Egypt," but "As the LORD lives who brought the
people of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the
lands where he had driven them." For I will bring them back to their
own land that I gave to their ancestors. I am now sending for many
fishermen, says the LORD, and they shall catch them; and afterward I
will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every
mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks. For my
eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my presence, nor
is their iniquity concealed from my sight. And I will doubly repay
their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with
the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance
with their abominations. O LORD, my strength and my stronghold, my
refuge in the day of trouble, to you shall the nations come from the
ends of the earth and say: Our ancestors have inherited nothing but
lies, worthless things in which there is no profit. Can mortals make
for themselves gods? Such are no gods! "Therefore I am surely going to
teach them, this time I am going to teach them my power and my might,
and they shall know that my name is the LORD."

Mark 1:14-20

Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the
good news of God, and saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom
of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.’

As Jesus passed along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother
Andrew casting a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And Jesus
said to them, ‘Follow me and I will make you fish for people.’ And
immediately they left their nets and followed him. As he went a little
farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in
their boat mending the nets. Immediately he called them; and they left
their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and followed him.

Evening Prayer

Psalm 33

Exultate, justi

^1 Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous.
Praise befits the upright.
^2 Praise the LORD with the lyre;
make melody to him with the harp of ten strings.
^3 Sing to him a new song;
play skilfully on the strings, with loud shouts.


^4 For the word of the LORD is upright,
and all his work is done in faithfulness.
^5 He loves righteousness and justice;
the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD.


^6 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,
and all their host by the breath of his mouth.
^7 He gathered the waters of the sea as in a bottle;
he put the deeps in storehouses.


^8 Let all the earth fear the LORD;
let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
^9 For he spoke, and it came to be;
he commanded, and it stood firm.


^10 The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing;
he frustrates the plans of the peoples.
^11 The counsel of the LORD stands for ever,
the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
^12 Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD,
the people whom he has chosen as his heritage.


^13 The LORD looks down from heaven;
he sees all humankind.
^14 From where he sits enthroned he watches
all the inhabitants of the earth
^15 he who fashions the hearts of them all,
and observes all their deeds.
^16 A king is not saved by his great army;
a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.
^17 The war horse is a vain hope for victory,
and by its great might it cannot save.


^18 Truly the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him,
on those who hope in his steadfast love,
^19 to deliver their soul from death,
and to keep them alive in famine.


^20 Our soul waits for the LORD;
he is our help and shield.
^21 Our heart is glad in him,
because we trust in his holy name.
^22 Let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us,
even as we hope in you.

Jeremiah 26:1-15

At the beginning of the reign of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah,
this word came from the LORD: Thus says the LORD: Stand in the court of
the Lord's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah that come to
worship in the house of the LORD; speak to them all the words that I
command you; do not hold back a word. It may be that they will listen,
all of them, and will turn from their evil way, that I may change my
mind about the disaster that I intend to bring on them because of their
evil doings. You shall say to them: Thus says the LORD: If you will not
listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you, and to heed
the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you
urgently--though you have not heeded-- then I will make this house like
Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the
earth.

The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking
these words in the house of the LORD. And when Jeremiah had finished
speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the
people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold
of him, saying, "You shall die! Why have you prophesied in the name of
the LORD, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall
be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people gathered around
Jeremiah in the house of the LORD. When the officials of Judah heard
these things, they came up from the king's house to the house of the
LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of
the LORD. Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and
to all the people, "This man deserves the sentence of death because he
has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own
ears." Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people,
saying, "It is the LORD who sent me to prophesy against this house and
this city all the words you have heard. Now therefore amend your ways
and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD
will change his mind about the disaster that he has pronounced against
you. But as for me, here I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good
and right to you. Only know for certain that if you put me to death,
you will be bringing innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city
and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all
these words in your ears."

Matthew 10:16-32

See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be
wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of them, for they will
hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; and you
will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a
testimony to them and the Gentiles. When they hand you over, do not
worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you
are to say will be given to you at that time; for it is not you who
speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. Brother will
betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise
against parents and have them put to death; and you will be hated by
all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be
saved. When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly
I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel
before the Son of Man comes. ‘A disciple is not above the teacher, nor
a slave above the master; it is enough for the disciple to be like the
teacher, and the slave like the master. If they have called the master
of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his
household! ‘So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that
will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known.
What I say to you in the dark, tell in the light; and what you hear
whispered, proclaim from the housetops. Do not fear those who kill the
body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both
soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not
one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. And even
the hairs of your head are all counted. So do not be afraid; you are of
more value than many sparrows. ‘Everyone therefore who acknowledges me
before others, I also will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
