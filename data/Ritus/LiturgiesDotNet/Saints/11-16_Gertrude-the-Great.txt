Deus, qui iucundam tibi mansionem in corde beatae Gertrudis virginis
praeparasti, ipsius intercessione, cordis nostri tenebras clementer
illustra, ut te in nobis praesentem et operantem laetanter experiamur.
O God,
who prepared a delightful dwelling for yourself
in the heart of the Virgin Saint Gertrude,
graciously bring light, through her intercession,
to the darkness of our hearts,
that we may joyfully experience you present and at work within us.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 3:14-19
Brothers and sisters:
I kneel before the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory
to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self,
and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith;
that you, rooted and grounded in love,
may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones
what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          23:1-3a,4,5,6
Dominus pascit me, et nihil mihi deerit.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;
Beside restful waters he leads me;
he refreshes my soul.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Even though I walk in the dark valley
I fear no evil; for you are at my side
With your rod and your staff
that give me courage.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
You spread the table before me
in the sight of my foes;
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Only goodness and kindness follow me
all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD
for years to come.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
ALLELUIA      Jn 15: 9b; 5b
Remain in my love, says the Lord;
Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit.
GOSPEL           John 15:1-8
Jesus said to his disciples:
"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower.
He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit,
and every one that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit.
You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.
Remain in me, as I remain in you.
Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own
unless it remains on the vine,
so neither can you unless you remain in me.
I am the vine, you are the branches.
Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit,
because without me you can do nothing.
Anyone who does not remain in me
will be thrown out like a branch and wither;
people will gather them and throw them into a fire
and they will be burned.
If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you.
By this is my Father glorified,
that you bear much fruit and become my disciples."

SECOND READING

From the Revelations by Saint Gertrude, virgin
(Lib. 2, 23, 1.3.5.8.10: SCh 139, 330-340)

Your thoughts of me are thoughts of peace

May my soul bless you, O Lord God my Creator, may my soul bless you.
From the very core of my being may all your merciful gifts sing your
praise. Your generous care for your daughter has been rich in mercy;
indeed it has been immeasurable, and as far as I am able I give you
thanks. I praise and glorify your great patience which bore with me
even though, from my infancy and childhood, adolescence and early
womanhood, until I was nearly twenty-six, I was always so blindly
irresponsible. Looking back I see that but for your protecting hand I
would have been quite without conscience in thought, word or deed. But
you came to my aid by giving me a natural dislike of evil and a natural
delight in what is good, and provided me with necessary correction from
those among whom I lived. Otherwise I should now have to admit to doing
my own will whenever the opportunity offered itself, living like some
pagan in a pagan society, and never understanding that you, my God,
reward good deeds while punishing evil. Yet you had chosen me to be
specially trained to serve you. I was a child of five when I began to
live in a convent surrounded by your most devoted friends.

To make amends for the way I previously lived, I offer you, most loving
Father, all the sufferings of your beloved Son, from that first infant
cry as he lay on the hay in the manger, until that final moment when,
bowing his head, with a mighty voice, Christ gave up his spirit. I
think, as I make this offering, of all that he underwent, his needs as
a baby, his dependence as a young child, the hardships of youth and the
trials of early manhood.

To atone for all my neglect I offer, most loving Father, all that your
only-begotten Son did during his life, whether in thought, word or
deed. That sacred life was, I know, utterly perfect in all respects,
from the moment he descended from your heavenly throne and came into
this world, until finally he presented the glory of his victorious
human nature to you, his Father.

And now, as an act of thanksgiving, I praise and worship you, Father,
in deepest humility for your most loving kindness and mercy. Though I
was hurrying to my eternal loss, your thoughts of me were thoughts of
peace and not of affliction, and you lifted me up with so many great
favors. To these you added the inestimable gift of your intimate
friendship, and in various ways allowed me to possess your Son�s own
heart, that most noble ark of God united with the Godhead. You refused
me no delight that could be mine.

Finally, you drew me to yourself by your faithful promises of the good
things you would give me from the hour of my death. So great are these
promises that for their sake alone, even if you had given me nothing
besides, my heart would sigh for you always and be filled with a lively
hope.
RESPONSORY          See Jeremiah 31:3; Hosea 2:14-21
The Lord loved Gertrude with an everlasting love;
- from her childhood, he drew her to himself
and led her into the wilderness.
There he spoke tenderly to her.

He espoused her to himself for ever
in faith and in love.
- From her childhood, he drew her to himself
and led her into the wilderness.
There he spoke tenderly to her.
