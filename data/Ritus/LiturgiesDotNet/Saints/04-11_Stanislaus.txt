O God, for whose honor the Bishop Saint Stanislaus
fell beneath the swords of his persecutors,
grant we pray,
that we may persevere strong in faith even until death.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Revelation 12:10-12a
I, John, heard a loud voice in heaven say:
"Now have salvation and power come,
and the Kingdom of our God
and the authority of his Anointed.
For the accuser of our brothers is cast out,
who accuses them before our God day and night.
They conquered him by the Blood of the Lamb
and by the word of their testimony;
love for life did not deter them from death.
Therefore, rejoice, you heavens,
and you who dwell in them."
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9
Ex omnibus tribulationibus meis eripuit me Dominus.
R. (5) The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
his praise shall be ever in my mouth. Let my soul glory in the LORD;
the lowly will hear and be glad.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
Glorify the LORD with me,
let us together extol his name.
I sought the LORD, and he answered me
and delivered me from all my fears.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
Look to him that you may be radiant with joy,
and your faces may not blush with shame.
When the poor one called out, the LORD heard,
and from all his distress he saved him.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
The angel of the LORD encamps
around those who fear him, and delivers them.
Taste and see how good the LORD is;
blessed the man who takes refuge in him.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
Fear the LORD, you his holy ones,
for nought is lacking to those who fear him.
The great grow poor and hungry;
but those who seek the LORD want for no good thing.
R. The Lord delivered me from all my fears.
ALLELUIA          2 Cor 1:3b-4a
Blessed be the Father of compassion and God of all encouragement,
who encourages us in our every affliction.
GOSPEL          John 17:11b-19
Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and prayed, saying:
"Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me,
so that they may be one just as we are one.
When I was with them I protected them in your name that you gave me,
and I guarded them,
and none of them was lost except the son of destruction,
in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
But now I am coming to you.
I speak this in the world
so that they may share my joy completely.
I gave them your word,
and the world hated them,
because they do not belong to the world
any more than I belong to the world.
I do not ask that you take them out of the world
but that you keep them from the Evil One.
They do not belong to the world
any more than I belong to the world.
Consecrate them in the truth.
Your word is truth.
As you sent me into the world,
so I sent them into the world.
And I consecrate myself for them,
so that they also may be consecrated in truth."

Stanislaus
From the Common of Pastors: For A Bishop or the Common of
Martyrs, except the following:
Office of Readings
From a Letter from Saint Cyprian, bishop and martyr
(Ep. 58, 8-9.11" CSEL 3, 663-666)
The contest of faith
As we do battle and fight in the contest of faith, God, his angels and
Christ himself watch us. How exalted is the glory, how great the joy of
engaging in a contest with God presiding, of receiving a crown with
Christ as judge.

Dear brethren, let us arm ourselves with all our might, let us prepare
ourselves for the struggle by innocence of heart, integrity of faith,
dedication to virtue.

The blessed Apostle teaches us how to arm and prepare ourselves: Put
round you the belt of truth; put on the breastplate of righteousness;
for shoes wear zeal for the Gospel of peace; take up the shield of
faith to extinguish all the burning arrows of the evil one; take the
helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of
God.

Let us take this armor and defend ourselves with these spiritual
defenses from heaven, so that we may be able to resist the threats of
the devil, and fight back on the evil day.

Let us put on the breastplate of righteousness so that our hearts may
be safeguarded, proof against the arrows of the enemy. Let our feet be
protected by the shoes of the teaching of the Gospel so that when we
begin to trample on the serpent and crush it, we may not be bitten and
tripped up by it.

Let us with fortitude bear the shield of faith to protect us by
extinguishing all the burning arrows that the enemy may launch against
us.

Let us wear on our head the helmet of the spirit to defend our ears
against the proclamations of death, our eyes against the sight of
accursed idols, our forehead so that God�s sign may be kept intact, our
lips so that our tongue may proclaim victoriously its faith in Christ
its Lord.

Let us arm our right hand with the sword of the spirit so that it may
courageously refuse the daily sacrifices, and like the hand � mindful
of the eucharist � that receives the body of the Lord, stretch out to
embrace him, and so gain from the Lord the future prize of a heavenly
crown.

Dear brethren, have all this firmly fixed in your hearts. If the day of
persecution finds us thinking on these things and meditating upon them,
the soldier of Christ, trained by Christ�s commands and instructions,
does not begin to panic at the thought of battle, but is ready for the
crown of victory.
RESPONSORY
For the law of God this holy man engaged in combat even unto death.
He fears no wicked threats;
� his faith was founded on solid rock, alleluia.

He renounced earthly joys,
and gained the kingdom of heaven.
� His faith was founded on solid rock, alleluia.
COLLECT
O God, for whose honor the Bishop Saint Stanislaus
fell beneath the swords of his persecutors,
grant we pray,
that we may persevere strong in faith even until death.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
