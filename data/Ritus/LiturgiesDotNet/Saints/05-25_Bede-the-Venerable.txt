MASS

From the Common of Doctors of the Church or the Common of Holy
Men and Women: For a Monk

COLLECT
O God, who bring light to your Church
through the learning of the Priest Saint Bede,
mercifully grant that your servants
may always be enlightened by his wisdom and helped by his merits.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 2:10b-16
Brothers and sisters: The Spirit searches everything, even the depths
of God. For what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of the
man which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God
except the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the spirit of the
world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might understand the
gifts bestowed on us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by
human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to
those who possess the Spirit.

The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God,
for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them
because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man judges all
things, but is himself to be judged by no one. "For who has known the
mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of
Christ.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 119:9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
How can the young walk without fault?
Only by keeping your words.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
With all my heart I seek you;
do not let me stray from your commands.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
In my heart I treasure your promise,
that I may not sin against you.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
Blessed are you, O LORD;
teach me your laws.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
With my lips I recite
all the edicts you have spoken.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
I find joy in the way of your decrees
more than in all riches.
R. Lord, teach me your statues.
ALLELUIA          Jn 6:63c, 68c
Your words, Lord, are spirit and life;
you have the words of everlasting life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 7:21-29
Jesus said to his disciples: "Not every one who says to me, 'Lord,
Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of
my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord,
Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and cast out demons in Your
name, and do many mighty works in Your name?' And then will I declare
to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers.'

"Every one then who hears these words of mine and does them will be
like a wise man who built his house upon the rock; and the rain fell,
and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but
it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. And every one
who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a
foolish man who built his house upon the sand; and the rain fell, and
the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it
fell; and great was the fall of it."

And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at
his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as
their scribes.

Office of Readings

From a letter on the death of the Venerable Bede, By Cuthbert
(Nn. 4-6: PL 90, 64-66)
I desire to see Christ

On Tuesday before the feast of the Ascension, Bede’s breathing became
labored and a slight swelling appeared in his legs. Nevertheless, he
gave us instruction all day long and dictated cheerfully the whole
time. It seemed to us, however, that he knew very well that his end was
near, and so he spent the whole night giving thanks to God.

At daybreak on Wednesday he told us to finish the writing we had begun.
We worked until nine o’clock, when we went in procession with the
relics  as the custom of the day required. But one of our community, a
boy named Wilbert, stayed with him and said to him, “Dear master, there
is still one more chapter  to finish in that book you were dictating.
Do you think it would be too hard for you to answer any more
questions?” Bede replied: “Not at all; it will be easy. Take up your
pen and ink, and write quickly,” and he did so.

At three o’clock, Bede said to me, “I have a few treasures in my
private chest, some pepper, napkins, and a little incense. Run quickly
and bring the priest  of our monastery, and I will distribute among
them these little presents that god has given me.”

When the priests  arrived he spoke to them and asked each one to offer
Masses and prayers for him regularly. They gladly promised to do so.
The priests were sad, however, and they all wept, especially because
Bede had said that he thought they would not see his face much longer
in this world. Yet they rejoiced when he said, “If it so please my
Maker, it is time for me to return to him who created me and formed me
out of nothing when I did not exist. I have lived a long time, and the
righteous Judge has taken good care of me during my whole life. The
time has come for my departure, and I long to die and be with Christ.
My soul yearns to see Christ, my King, in all his glory.” He said many
other things which profited us greatly, and so he passed the day
joyfully till evening.

When evening came, young Wilbert said to Bede, “Dear master, there is
still one sentence that we have not written down.” Bede said, “Quick,
write it down.” In a little while, Wilbert said, “There; now it is
written down.” Bede said, “Good. You have spoken the truth; it is
finished. Hold my head in your hands, for I really enjoy sitting
opposite the holy place where I used to pray; I can call upon my Father
as I sit there.”

And so Bede, as he lay upon the floor of his cell, sang, “Glory be to
the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.” And when he had
named the Holy Spirit, he breathed his last breath.  We believe most
firmly that Bede has now entered into the joy of the heaven he longed
for, since his labors here on earth were always dedicated to the glory
of God.
RESPONSORY
During all my years in the monastery
I spent long hours in meditating on the sacred Scriptures;
