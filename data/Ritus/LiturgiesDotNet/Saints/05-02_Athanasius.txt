FIRST READING          1 John 5:1-5
Beloved:
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God,
and everyone who loves the Father loves also the one begotten by him.
In this way we know that we love the children of God
when we love God and obey his commandments.
For the love of God is this,
that we keep his commandments.
And his commandments are not burdensome,
for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world.
And the victory that conquers the world is our faith.
Who indeed is the victor over the world
but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 37:3-4, 5-6, 30-31
Os iusti meditabitur sapientiam.
R. (30a) The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Trust in the Lord and do good,
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the Lord
and he will grant you your heart's requests.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Commit to the Lord your way;
trust in him, and he will act.
He will make justice dawn for you like the light; bright as the noonday
shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom
and his tongue utters what is right. The law of his God is in his
heart,
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
ALLELUIA          Mt 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Matthew 10:22-25
Jesus said to the Twelve:
"You will be hated by all because of my name,
but whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When they persecute you in one town, flee to another.
Amen, I say to you, you will not finish the towns of Israel
before the Son of Man comes.
No disciple is above his teacher,
no slave above his master.
It is enough for the disciple that he become like the teacher,
and the slave that he become like the master.
If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub,
how much more those of his household!"
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Respice, Domine, munera quae tibi in commemoratione beati Athanasii
perhibemus, eiusque fidem profitentibus illibatam tuae testificatio

who profess the same unblemished faith as him.
Through Christ our Lord.

The Office of Readings

From a discourse by Saint Athanasius, bishop
(Oratio de Incarnatione Verbi, 8-9, PG 25, 110-111)
On the incarnation of the Word

The Word of God, incorporeal, incorruptible and immaterial, entered our
world. Yet it was not as if he had been remote from it up to that time.
For there is no part of the world that was ever without his presence;
together with his Father, he continually filled all things and places.

Out of his loving-kindness for us he came to us, and we see this in the
way he revealed himself openly to us. Taking pity on mankind's
weakness, and moved by our corruption, he could not stand aside and see
death have the mastery over us; he did not want creation to perish and
his Father's work in fashioning man to be in vain. He therefore took to
himself a body, no different from our own, for he did not wish simply
to be in a body or only to be seen.

If he had wanted simply to be seen, he could indeed have taken another,
and nobler, body. Instead, he took our body in its reality.

Within the Virgin he built himself a temple, that is, a body; he made
it his own instrument in which to dwell and to reveal himself. In this
way he received from mankind a body like our own, and, since all were
subject to the corruption of death, he delivered this body over to
death for all, and with supreme love offered it to the Father. He did
so to destroy the law of corruption passed against all men, since all
died in him. The law, which had spent its force on the body of the
Lord, could no longer have any power over his fellowmen. Moreover, this
was the way in which the Word was to restore mankind to immortality,
after it had fallen into corruption, and summon it back from death to
life. He utterly destroyed the power death had against mankind - as
fire consumes chaff - by means of the body he had taken and the grace
of the resurrection.

This is the reason why the Word assumed a body that could die, so that
this body, sharing in the Word who is above all, might satisfy death's
requirement in place of all. Because of the Word dwelling in that body,
it would remain incorruptible, and all would be freed for ever from
corruption by the grace of the resurrection.

In death the Word made a spotless sacrifice and oblation of the body he
had taken. by dying for others, he immediately banished death for all
mankind.

In this way the Word of God, who is above all, dedicated and offered
his temple, the instrument that was his body, for us all, as he said,
and so paid by his own death the debt that was owed. The immortal Son
of God, united with all men by likeness of nature, thus fulfilled all
justice in restoring mankind to immortality by the promise of the
resurrection.

The corruption of death no longer holds any power over mankind, thanks
to the Word, who has come to dwell among them through his one body.


RESPONSORY          Jeremiah 15:19,20; 2 Peter 2:1
You will be my spokeman.
I will make you a solid wall of brass to their people.
- They will fight against you,
but they shall not prevail,
for I am with you, alleluia.

False teachers will arise.
They will secretly bring in destructive heresies
and deny the master who saved them.
- They will fight against you,
but they shall not prevail,
for I am with you, alleluia.
