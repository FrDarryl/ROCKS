The Collect

O God, our heavenly Father, who raised up your faithful servant Robert
Grosseteste to be a bishop and pastor in your Church and to feed your
flock: Give abundantly to all pastors the gifts of your Holy Spirit,
that they may minister in your household as true servants of Christ and
stewards of your divine mysteries; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who
lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever.
Amen.

First Reading
Acts 20:28-32

Keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock, of which the Holy
Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that he
obtained with the blood of his own Son. I know that after I have gone,
savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Some even
from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to entice
the disciples to follow them. Therefore be alert, remembering that for
three years I did not cease night or day to warn everyone with tears.
And now I commend you to God and to the message of his grace, a message
that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all
who are sanctified.

The Psalm
Psalm 112:1-9
Beatus vir

1
Hallelujah!
Happy are they who fear the Lord *
and have great delight in his commandments!

2
Their descendants will be mighty in the land; *
the generation of the upright will be blessed.

3
Wealth and riches will be in their house, *
and their righteousness will last for ever.

4
Light shines in the darkness for the upright; *
the righteous are merciful and full of compassion.

5
It is good for them to be generous in lending *
and to manage their affairs with justice.

6
For they will never be shaken; *
the righteous will be kept in everlasting remembrance.

7
They will not be afraid of any evil rumors; *
their heart is right;
they put their trust in the Lord.

8
Their heart is established and will not shrink, *
until they see their desire upon their enemies.

9
They have given freely to the poor, *
and their righteousness stands fast for ever;
they will hold up their head with honor.

or
Psalm 23
Dominus regit me

1
The LORD is my shepherd; *
I shall not be in want.

2
He makes me lie down in green pastures *
and leads me beside still waters.

3
He revives my soul *
and guides me along right pathways for his Name's sake.

4
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I shall fear no evil; *
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

5
You spread a table before me in the presence of those who
trouble
me; *
you have anointed my head with oil,
and my cup is running over.

6
Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
my
life, *
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

Gospel Reading
Luke 16:10-15

Jesus said, "Whoever is faithful in a very little is faithful also in
much; and whoever is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in
much. If then you have not been faithful with the dishonest wealth, who
will entrust to you the true riches? And if you have not been faithful
with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own? No
slave can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and
love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You
cannot serve God and wealth."

The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they
ridiculed him. So he said to them, "You are those who justify
yourselves in the sight of others; but God knows your hearts; for what
is prized by human beings is an abomination in the sight of God."
