of Mercy

Deus, qui beatae Elisabeth tribuisti in pauperibus Christum cognoscere
ac venerari, da nobis, eius intercessione, egenis et tribulatis iugi
caritate servire.
O God, by whose gift Saint Elizabeth of Hungary
recognized and revered Christ in the poor,
grant, through her intercession,
that we may serve with unfailing charity
the needy and those afflicted.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 3:14-18
Beloved:
We know that we have passed from death to life
because we love our brothers.
Whoever does not love remains in death.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,
and you know that anyone who is a murderer
does not have eternal life remaining in him.
The way we came to know love
was that he laid down his life for us;
so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
If someone who has worldly means
sees a brother in need and refuses him compassion,
how can the love of God remain in him?
Children, let us love not in word or speech
but in deed and truth.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           Ps 34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11
R. (2) I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. (9) Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
his praise shall be ever in my mouth.
Let my soul glory in the LORD;
the lowly will hear and be glad.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
Glorify the LORD with me,
let us together extol his name.
I sought the LORD, and he answered me
and delivered me from all my fears.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
Look to him that you may be radiant with joy,
and your faces may not blush with shame.
When the poor one called out, the LORD heard,
and from all his distress he saved him.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
The angel of the LORD encamps
around those who fear him, and delivers them.
Taste and see how good the LORD is;
blessed the man who takes refuge in him.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
Fear the LORD, you his holy ones,
for nought is lacking to those who fear him.
The great grow poor and hungry;
but those who seek the LORD want for no good thing.
R. I will bless the Lord at all times. or: R. Taste and see the
goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          John 13:34
I give you a new commandment:
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL          Luke 6:27-38
Jesus said to his disciples:
"To you who hear I say,
love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
To the person who strikes you on one cheek,
offer the other one as well,
and from the person who takes your cloak,
do not withhold even your tunic.
Give to everyone who asks of you,
and from the one who takes what is yours do not demand it back.
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
For if you love those who love you,
what credit is that to you?
Even sinners love those who love them.
And if you do good to those who do good to you,
what credit is that to you?
Even sinners do the same.
If you lend money to those from whom you expect repayment,
what credit is that to you?
Even sinners lend to sinners,
and get back the same amount.
But rather, love your enemies and do good to them,
and lend expecting nothing back;
then your reward will be great
and you will be children of the Most High,
for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.
Be merciful, just as also your Father is merciful.
"Stop judging and you will not be judged.
Stop condemning and you will not be condemned.
Forgive and you will be forgiven.
Give and gifts will be given to you;
a good measure, packed together, shaken down, and overflowing,
will be poured into your lap.
For the measure with which you measure
will in return be measured out to you."

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a letter of Conrad of Marburg, Saint Elizabeth's spiritual
director
(Ad pontificen anno 1232: A. Wyss, Hessisches Urkundenbuch I, Leipzig
1879, 31-35)
Elizabeth recognised and loved Christ in the poor
From this time onward Elizabeth�s goodness greatly increased. She was a
lifelong friend of the poor and gave herself entirely to relieving the
hungry. She ordered that one of her castles should be converted into a
hospital in which she gathered many of the weak and feeble. She
generously gave alms to all who were in need, not only in that place
but in all the territories of her husband�s empire. She spent all her
own revenue from her husband�s four principalities, and finally she
sold her luxurious� possessions and rich clothes for the sake of the
poor.
Twice a day, in the morning and in the evening, Elizabeth went to visit
the sick. She personally cared for those who were particularly
repulsive; to some she gave food, to others clothing; some she carried
on her own shoulders, and performed many other kindly services. Her
husband, of happy memory, gladly approved of these charitable works.
Finally, when her husband died, she sought the highest perfection;
filled with tears, she implored me to let her beg for alms from door to
door.
On Good Friday of that year, when the altars had been stripped, she
laid her hands on the altar in a chapel in her own town, where she had
established the Friars Minor, and before witnesses she voluntarily
renounced all worldly display and everything that our Saviour in the
gospel advises us to abandon. Even then she saw that she could still be
distracted by the cares and worldly glory which had surrounded her
while her husband was alive. Against my will she followed me to
Marburg. Here in the town she built a hospice where she gathered
together the weak and the feeble. There she attended the most wretched
and contemptible at her own table.
Apart from those active good works, I declare before God that I have
seldom seen a more contemplative woman. When she was coming from
private prayer, some religious men and women often saw her face shining
marvellously and light coming from her eyes like the rays of the sun.
Before her death I heard her confession. When I asked what should be
done about her goods and possessions, she replied that anything which
seemed to be hers belonged to the poor. She asked me to distribute
everything except one worn out dress in which she wished to be buried.
When all this had been decided, she received the body of our Lord.
Afterward, until vespers, she spoke often of the holiest things she had
heard in sermons. Then, she devoutly commended to God all who were
sitting near her, and as if falling into a gentle sleep, she died.
RESPONSORY          Judith 15:11; Acts 10:4
You acted bravely, and your heart has been strengthened
because you loved chastity.
- Your name will be praised for ever.
Your prayers and generosity have been accepted in God's sight,
and because of them he has remembered you.
- Your name will be praised for ever
