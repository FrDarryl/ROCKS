FIRST READING          Sir 6-10
If it pleases the LORD Almighty,
he who studies the law of the Most High
will be filled with the spirit of understanding;
He will pour forth his words of wisdom
and in prayer give thanks to the LORD,
Who will direct his knowledge and his counsel,
as he meditates upon his mysteries.
He will show the wisdom of what he has learned
and glory in the law of the LORD'S covenant.
Many will praise his understanding;
his fame can never be effaced;
Unfading will be his memory,
through all generations his name will live;
Peoples will speak of his wisdom,
and in assembly sing his praises.

Os iusti meditabitur sapientiam.

that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the LORD,

R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
Commit to the LORD your way;
trust in him, and he will act.
He will make justice dawn for you like the light;
bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom
and his tongue utters what is right.
The law of his God is in his heart,
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.

Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          Matthew 16:13-19
When Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi
he asked his disciples,
"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
They replied, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah,
still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter said in reply,
"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah.
For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly
Father.
And so I say to you, you are Peter,
and upon this rock I will build my Church,
and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the Kingdom of heaven.
Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;
and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."

Oblatis muneribus, quaesumus, Domine, Ecclesiam tuam benignus illumina,

te gubernante, pastores.

graciously shed light on your Church,
so that your flock may everywhere prosper

accipiat, et in religionis integritate persistat.

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a sermon by St. Leo the Great, pope
(Sermo 4, 1-2; PL 54, 148-149)

The minister of a special calling

Although the universal Church of God is constituted of distinct orders
of members, still, in spite of the many parts of its holy body, the
Church subsists as an integral whole, just as the Apostle says: We are
all one in Christ. No difference in office is so great that anyone can
be separated, through lowliness, from the head. In the unity of faith
and baptism, therefore, our community is undivided. There is a common
dignity, as the apostle Peter says in these words: And you are built up
as living stones into spiritual houses, a holy priesthood, offering
spiritual sacrifices which are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
And again: But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation, a people set apart.
For all, regenerated in Christ, are made kings by the sign of the
cross; they are consecrated priests by the oil of the Holy Spirit, so
that beyond the special service of our ministry as priests, all
spiritual and mature Christians know that they are a royal race and are
sharers in the office of the priesthood. For what is more king-like
than to find yourself ruler over your body after having surrendered
your soul to God? And what is more priestly than to promise the Lord a
pure conscience and to offer him in love unblemished victims on the
altar of one�s heart?
Because, through the grace of God, it is a deed accomplished
universally on behalf of all, it is altogether praiseworthy and in
keeping with a religious attitude for you to rejoice in this our day of
consecration, to consider it a day when we are especially honoured. For
indeed one sacramental priesthood is celebrated throughout the entire
body of the Church. The oil which consecrates us has richer effects in
the higher grades, yet it is not sparingly given in the lower.
Sharing in this office, my dear brethren, we have solid ground for a
common rejoicing; yet there will be more genuine and excellent reason
for joy if you do not dwell on the thought of our unworthiness. It is
more helpful and more suitable to turn your thoughts to study the glory
of the blessed apostle Peter. We should celebrate this day above all in
honour of him. He overflowed with abundant riches from the very source
of all graces, yet though he alone received much, nothing was given
over to him without his sharing it. The Word made flesh lived among us,
and in redeeming the whole human race, Christ gave himself entirely.
RESPONSORY          Matthew 16:18; Psalm 48:9
Jesus said to Simon: I tell you most solemnly that you are Peter,
and I will build my Church upon this rock foundation,
- and the powers of hell will never overcome it.

For all eternity, God's Church stands firm.
- And the powers of hell will never overcome it.
COLLECT
O God, who never allow the gates of hell
to prevail against your Church,
firmly founded on the apostolic rock,
grant her, we pray,
that through the intercession of Pope Saint Leo,
she may stand firm in your truth
and know the protection of lasting peace.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
