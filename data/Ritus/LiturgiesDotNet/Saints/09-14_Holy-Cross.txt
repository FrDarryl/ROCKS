ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Galatians 6:14
Nos autem gloriari oportet in cruce Domini nostri Iesu Christi, in quo
est salus, vita, et resurrectio nostra: per quem salvati, et liberati
sumus.
We should glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
in whom is our salvation, life and resurrection,
through whom we are saved and delivered.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui Unigenitum tuum crucem subire voluisti, ut salvum faceret
genus humanum, praesta, quaesumus, ut, cuius mysterium in terra
cognovimus, eius redemptionis praemia in caelo consequi mereamur.
O God, who willed that your Only Begotten Son
should undergo the Cross to save the human race,
grant, we pray,
that we, who have known his mystery on earth,
may merit the grace of his redemption in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Numbers 21:4b-9
With their patience worn out by the journey,
the people complained against God and Moses,
"Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in this desert,
where there is no food or water?
We are disgusted with this wretched food!"

In punishment the LORD sent among the people saraph serpents,
which bit the people so that many of them died.
Then the people came to Moses and said,
"We have sinned in complaining against the LORD and you.
Pray the LORD to take the serpents from us."
So Moses prayed for the people, and the LORD said to Moses,
"Make a saraph and mount it on a pole,
and if any who have been bitten look at it, they will live."
Moses accordingly made a bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole,
and whenever anyone who had been bitten by a serpent
looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 78:1bc-2, 34-35, 36-37, 38
Ne obliviscamini operum Domini.
R. (see 7b) Do not forget the works of the Lord!
Hearken, my people, to my teaching;
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable,
I will utter mysteries from of old.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
While he slew them they sought him
and inquired after God again,
Remembering that God was their rock
and the Most High God, their redeemer.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
But they flattered him with their mouths
and lied to him with their tongues,
Though their hearts were not steadfast toward him,
nor were they faithful to his covenant.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
But he, being merciful, forgave their sin
and destroyed them not;
Often he turned back his anger
and let none of his wrath be roused.
R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
SECOND READING           Philippians 2:6-11
Brothers and sisters:
Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God,
did not regard equality with God something to be grasped.
Rather, he emptied himself,
taking the form of a slave,
coming in human likeness;
and found human in appearance,
he humbled himself,
becoming obedient to death,
even death on a cross.
Because of this, God greatly exalted him
and bestowed on him the name
that is above every name,
that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bend,
of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
and every tongue confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.
ALLELUIA
Adoramus te, Christe, benedicimus tibi, quia per crucem tuam redemisti
mundum.
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you,
because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.
GOSPEL          John 3:13-17
Jesus said to Nicodemus:
"No one has gone up to heaven
except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man.
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert,
so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."

For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son,
so that everyone who believes in him might not perish
but might have eternal life.
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,
but that the world might be saved through him.
When this Feast falls on a Sunday, the Creed is said.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Haec oblatio, Domine, quaesumus, ab omnibus nos purget offensis, quae
in ara crucis totius mundi tulit offensam.
May this oblation, O Lord,
which on the altar of the Cross
canceled the offense of the whole world,
cleanse us, we pray, of all our sins.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE            The victory of the glorious Cross
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens, aeterne Deus:
Qui salutem humani generis in ligno crucis constituisti, ut unde mors
oriebatur, inde vita resurgeret; et, qui in ligno vincebat, in ligno
quoque vinceretur: per Christum Dominum nostrum. Per quem maiestatem
tuam laudant Angeli, adorant Dominationes, tremunt Potestates. Caeli
caelorumque Virtutes, ac beata Seraphim, socia exsultatione
concelebrant. Cum quibus et nostras voces ut admitti iubeas,
deprecamur, supplici confessione dicentes: Sanctus.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.

It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For you placed the salvation of the human race
on the wood of the Cross,
so that, where death arose,
life might again spring forth
and the evil one, who conquered on a tree,
might likewise on a tree be conquered,
through Christ our Lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in humble praise, as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts...
PREFACE I OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD may also be used.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          John 12: 32
Ego si exaltatus fuero a terra, omnes traham ad meipsum, dicit Dominus.
When I am lifted up from the earth,
I will draw everyone to myself, says the Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Refectione tua sancta enutriti, Domine Iesu Christe, supplices
deprecamur, ut, quos per lignum crucis vivificae redemisti, ad
resurrectionis gloriam perducas.
Having been nourished by your holy banquet,
we beseech you, Lord Jesus Christ,
to bring those you have redeemed
by the wood of your life-giving Cross
to the glory of the resurrection.
Who live and reign for ever and ever.
