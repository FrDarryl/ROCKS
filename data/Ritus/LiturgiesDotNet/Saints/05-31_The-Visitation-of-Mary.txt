Zephaniah 3:14-18a

Sing aloud, O daughter Zion; shout, O Israel! Rejoice and exult with
all your heart, O daughter Jerusalem! The L
ORD has taken away the judgments against you, he has turned away your
enemies. The king of Israel, the LORD, is in your midst; you shall fear
disaster no more. On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Do not
fear, O Zion; do not let your hands grow weak. The LORD, your God, is
in your midst, a warrior who gives victory; he will rejoice over you
with gladness, he will renew you in his love; he will exult over you
with loud singing as on a day of festival.

or Canticle: Isaiah 12:2-6

Psalm 113 ^

1
Alleluia.
Give praise, you servants of the Lord, *
O praise the name of the Lord.
^2 Blessed be the name of the Lord, *
from this time forth and for evermore.
^3 From the rising of the sun to its setting *
let the name of the Lord be praised.
^4 The Lord is high above all nations *
and his glory above the heavens.
^5 Who is like the Lord our God,
that has his throne so high, *
yet humbles himself to behold
the things of heaven and earth?
^6 He raises the poor from the dust *
and lifts the needy from the ashes,
^7 To set them with princes, *
with the princes of his people.
^8 He gives the barren woman a place in the house *
and makes her a joyful mother of children.
Alleluia.

Canticle: Isaiah 12:2-6

Canticle: The First Song of Isaiah

Ecce Deus

Isaiah 12:2-6

Surely, it is God who saves me; *
I will trust in him and not be afraid.

For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, *
and he will be my Savior.

Therefore you shall draw water with rejoicing *
from the springs of salvation.

And on that day you shall say, *
Give thanks to the Lord and call upon his Name;

Make his deeds known among the peoples; *
see that they remember that his Name is exalted.

Sing praises of the Lord, for he has done great things, *
and this is known in all the world.

Cry aloud, inhabitants of Zion, ring out your joy, *
for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.



Colossians 3:12-17

As God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with
compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. Bear with one
another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each
other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together
in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to
which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful. Let the
word of Christ dwell in you richly; teach and admonish one another in
all wisdom; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do
everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the
Father through him.

Luke 1:39-49


In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the
hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted
Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child leapt in her
womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with
a loud cry, 'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of
your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord
comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the
child in my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who believed that
there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.'

And Mary said,
'My soul magnifies the Lord,
and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,
for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant.
Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me,
and holy is his name.



Daily Office

Evening Prayer I

Psalm 132 ^

1
Lord, remember for David *
all the hardships he endured;
^2 How he swore an oath to the Lord *
and vowed a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
^3 'I will not come within the shelter of my house, *
nor climb up into my bed;
^4 'I will not allow my eyes to sleep, *
nor let my eyelids slumber,
^5 'Until I find a place for the Lord, *
a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.'
^6 Now, we heard of the ark in Ephrathah *
and found it in the fields of Ja-ar.
^7 Let us enter his dwelling place *
and fall low before his footstool.
^8 Arise, O Lord, into your resting place, *
you and the ark of your strength.
^9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness *
and your faithful ones sing with joy.
^10 For your servant David's sake, *
turn not away the face of your anointed.
^11 The Lord has sworn an oath to David, *
a promise from which he will not shrink:
^12 'Of the fruit of your body *
shall I set upon your throne.
^13 'If your children keep my covenant
and my testimonies that I shall teach them, *
their children also shall sit upon your throne for evermore.'
^14 For the Lord has chosen Zion for himself; *
he has desired her for his habitation:
^15 'This shall be my resting place for ever; *
here will I dwell, for I have longed for her.
^16 'I will abundantly bless her provision; *
her poor will I satisfy with bread.
^17 'I will clothe her priests with salvation, *
and her faithful ones shall rejoice and sing.
^18 'There will I make a horn to spring up for David; *
I will keep a lantern burning for my anointed.
^19 'As for his enemies, I will clothe them with shame; *
but on him shall his crown be bright.'


Isaiah 11:1-10

A shoot shall come out from the stock of Jesse,
and a branch shall grow out of his roots.
The spirit of the L
ORD shall rest on him,
the spirit of wisdom and understanding,
the spirit of counsel and might,
the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
His delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.
He shall not judge by what his eyes see,
or decide by what his ears hear;
but with righteousness he shall judge the poor,
and decide with equity for the meek of the earth;
he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,
and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.
Righteousness shall be the belt around his waist,
and faithfulness the belt around his loins.

The wolf shall live with the lamb,
the leopard shall lie down with the kid,
the calf and the lion and the fatling together,
and a little child shall lead them.
The cow and the bear shall graze,
their young shall lie down together;
and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp,
and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder's den.
They will not hurt or destroy
on all my holy mountain;
for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the L
ORD
as the waters cover the sea.

On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples;
the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious.



Hebrews 2:11-18

For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one
Father. For this reason Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and
sisters, saying,
'I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters,
in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.'
And again,
'I will put my trust in him.'
And again,
'Here am I and the children whom God has given me.'

Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself
likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy
the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those
who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it
is clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of
Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in
every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest
in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of
the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is
able to help those who are being tested.



Morning Prayer

Psalm 72


^

1
Give the king your judgements, O God, *
and your righteousness to the son of a king.
^2 Then shall he judge your people righteously *
and your poor with justice.
^3 May the mountains bring forth peace, *
and the little hills righteousness for the people.
^4 May he defend the poor among the people, *
deliver the children of the needy and crush the oppressor.
^5 May he live as long as the sun and moon endure, *
from one generation to another.
^6 May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, *
like the showers that water the earth.
^7 In his time shall righteousness flourish, *
and abundance of peace
till the moon shall be no more.
^8 May his dominion extend from sea to sea *
and from the River to the ends of the earth.
^9 May his foes kneel before him *
and his enemies lick the dust.
^10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall pay tribute; *
the kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring gifts.
^11 All kings shall fall down before him; *
all nations shall do him service.
^12 For he shall deliver the poor that cry out, *
the needy and those who have no helper.
^13 He shall have pity on the weak and poor; *
he shall preserve the lives of the needy.
^14 He shall redeem their lives from oppression and violence, *
and dear shall their blood be in his sight.
^15 Long may he live;
unto him may be given gold from Sheba; *
may prayer be made for him continually
and may they bless him all the day long.
^16 May there be abundance of grain on the earth,
standing thick upon the hilltops; *
may its fruit flourish like Lebanon
and its grain grow like the grass of the field.
^17 May his name remain for ever
and be established as long as the sun endures; *
may all nations be blest in him
and call him blessed.
^18 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, *
who alone does wonderful things.
^19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever. *
May all the earth be filled with his glory.
Amen. Amen.


1 Samuel 1:1-20

There was a certain man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country
of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham son of Elihu son of
Tohu son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. He had two wives; the name of one was
Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but
Hannah had no children.

Now this man used to go up year by year from his town to worship and to
sacrifice to the L
ORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas,
were priests of the LORD. On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would
give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;
but to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though
the LORD had closed her womb. Her rival used to provoke her severely,
to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb. So it went on
year after year; as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she
used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. Her
husband Elkanah said to her, 'Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not
eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?'

After they had eaten and drunk at Shiloh, Hannah rose and presented
herself before the L
ORD. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of
the temple of the LORD. She was deeply distressed and prayed to the
LORD, and wept bitterly. She made this vow: 'O LORD of hosts, if only
you will look on the misery of your servant, and remember me, and not
forget your servant, but will give to your servant a male child, then I
will set him before you as a nazirite until the day of his death. He
shall drink neither wine nor intoxicants, and no razor shall touch his
head.'

As she continued praying before the L
ORD, Eli observed her mouth. Hannah was praying silently; only her lips
moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was
drunk. So Eli said to her, 'How long will you make a drunken spectacle
of yourself? Put away your wine.' But Hannah answered, 'No, my lord, I
am a woman deeply troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD. Do not regard your
servant as a worthless woman, for I have been speaking out of my great
anxiety and vexation all this time.' Then Eli answered, 'Go in peace;
the God of Israel grant the petition you have made to him.' And she
said, 'Let your servant find favour in your sight.' Then the woman went
to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance
was sad no longer.

They rose early in the morning and worshipped before the L
ORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. Elkanah knew his wife
Hannah, and the LORD remembered her. In due time Hannah conceived and
bore a son. She named him Samuel, for she said, 'I have asked him of
the LORD.'



Hebrews 3:1-6

Therefore, brothers and sisters, holy partners in a heavenly calling,
consider that Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, was
faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses also 'was faithful
in all God's house.' Yet Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses, just
as the builder of a house has more honour than the house itself. (For
every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)
Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to
the things that would be spoken later. Christ, however, was faithful
over God's house as a son, and we are his house if we hold firm the
confidence and the pride that belong to hope.



Evening Prayer II

Psalm 146,147


^

1
Alleluia.
Praise the Lord, O my soul:
while I live will I praise the Lord; *
as long as I have any being,
I will sing praises to my God.
^2 Put not your trust in princes,
nor in any human power, *
for there is no help in them.
^3 When their breath goes forth, they return to the earth; *
on that day all their thoughts perish.
^4 Happy are those who have the God of Jacob for their help, *
whose hope is in the Lord their God;
^5 Who made heaven and earth,
the sea and all that is in them; *
who keeps his promise for ever;
^6 Who gives justice to those that suffer wrong *
and bread to those who hunger.
^7 The Lord looses those that are bound; *
the Lord opens the eyes of the blind;
^8 The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down; *
the Lord loves the righteous;
^9 The Lord watches over the stranger in the land;
he upholds the orphan and widow; *
but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
^10 The Lord shall reign for ever, *
your God, O Zion, throughout all generations.
Alleluia.

^1 Alleluia.
How good it is to make music for our God, *
how joyful to honour him with praise.
^2 The Lord builds up Jerusalem *
and gathers together the outcasts of Israel.
^3 He heals the brokenhearted *
and binds up all their wounds.
^4 He counts the number of the stars *
and calls them all by their names.
^5 Great is our Lord and mighty in power; *
his wisdom is beyond all telling.
^6 The Lord lifts up the poor, *
but casts down the wicked to the ground.
^7 Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; *
make music to our God upon the lyre;
^8 Who covers the heavens with clouds *
and prepares rain for the earth;
^9 Who makes grass to grow upon the mountains *
and green plants to serve our needs.
^10 He gives the beasts their food *
and the young ravens when they cry.
^11 He takes no pleasure in the power of a horse, *
no delight in human strength;
^12 But the Lord delights in those who fear him, *
who put their trust in his steadfast love.
^13 Sing praise to the Lord, O Jerusalem; *
praise your God, O Zion;
^14 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates *
and has blest your children within you.
^15 He has established peace in your borders *
and satisfies you with the finest wheat.
^16 He sends forth his command to the earth *
and his word runs very swiftly.
^17 He gives snow like wool *
and scatters the hoarfrost like ashes.
^18 He casts down his hailstones like morsels of bread; *
who can endure his frost?
^19 He sends forth his word and melts them; *
he blows with his wind and the waters flow.
^20 He declares his word to Jacob, *
his statutes and judgements to Israel.
^21 He has not dealt so with any other nation; *
they do not know his laws.
Alleluia.


Zechariah 2:10-13

Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion! For lo, I will come and dwell in
your midst, says the L
ORD. ^11Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD on that day, and
shall be my people; and I will dwell in your midst. And you shall know
that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. ^12The LORD will inherit
Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.
^13Be silent, all people, before the LORD; for he has roused himself
from his holy dwelling.


John 3:25-30

Now a discussion about purification arose between John's disciples and
a Jew. They came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the one who was with
you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing, and
all are going to him.' John answered, 'No one can receive anything
except what has been given from heaven. You yourselves are my witnesses
that I said, "I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him."
He who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom,
who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice.
For this reason my joy has been fulfilled. He must increase, but I must
decrease.'
