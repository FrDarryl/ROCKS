COLLECT
Deus, qui ad tuae fidem Ecclesiae vindicandam beatum Robertum episcopum
mira eruditione et virtute decorasti, eius intercessione concede, ut
populus tuus eiusdem fidei semper integritate laetetur.
O God, who adorned the Bishop Saint Robert Bellarmine
with wonderful learning and virtue
to vindicate the faith of your Church,
grant, through his intercession,
that in the integrity of that same faith
your people may always find joy.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Wisdom 7:7-10, 15-16
I prayed, and prudence was given me;
I pleaded, and the spirit of Wisdom came to me.
I preferred her to scepter and throne,
And deemed riches nothing in comparison with her,
nor did I liken any priceless gem to her;
Because all gold, in view of her, is a little sand,
and before her, silver is to be accounted mire.
Beyond health and comeliness I loved her,
And I chose to have her rather than the light,
because the splendor of her never yields to sleep.

Now God grant I speak suitably
and value these endowments at their worth:
For he is the guide of Wisdom
and the director of the wise.
For both we and our words are in his hand,
as well as all prudence and knowledge of crafts.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 19:8, 9, 10, 11
Iustitiae Domini rectae laetificantes corda
R. (9ab) The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
The law of the LORD is perfect,
refreshing the soul.
The decree of the LORD is trustworthy,
giving wisdom to the simple.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
The precepts of the LORD are right,
rejoicing the heart.
The command of the LORD is clear,
enlightening the eye.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
The fear of the LORD is pure,
enduring forever;
The ordinances of the LORD are true,
all of them just.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
They are more precious than gold,
than a heap of purest gold;
Sweeter also than syrup
or honey from the comb.
R. The precepts of the Lord give joy to the heart.
ALLELUIA          Jn 6:63c, 68c
Verba tua, Domine, Spiritus et vita sunt; verba vitae aeternae habes
Your words, Lord, are Spirit and life;
you have the words of everlasting life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 7:21-29
Jesus said to his disciples:
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,'
will enter the Kingdom of heaven,
but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day,
`Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?
Did we not drive out demons in your name?
Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?'
Then I will declare to them solemnly,
`I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers.'

"Everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them
will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain fell, the floods came,
and the winds blew and buffeted the house.
But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly on rock.
And everyone who listens to these words of mine
but does not act on them
will be like a fool who built his house on sand.
The rain fell, the floods came,
and the winds blew and buffeted the house.
And it collapsed and was completely ruined."
When Jesus finished these words,
the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
for he taught them as one having authority,
and not as their scribes.

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a treatise On the Ascent of the Mind to God by Saint Robert
Bellarmine
(Ante exsilium, nn 1-3: PG 52, 427*-430)
Incline my heart to your decrees
Sweet Lord, you are meek and merciful. Who would not give himself
wholeheartedly to your service, if he began to taste even a little of
your fatherly rule? What command, Lord, do you give your servants? Take
my yoke upon you, you say. And what is this yoke of yours like? My
yoke, you say, is easy and my burden light. Who would not be glad to
bear a yoke that does not press hard but caresses? Who would not be
glad for a burden that does not weigh heavy but refreshes? And so you
were right to add: And you will find rest for your souls. And what is
this yoke of yours that does not weary, but gives rest? It is, of
course, that first and greatest commandment: You shall love the Lord
your God with all your heart. What is easier, sweeter, more pleasant,
than to love goodness, beauty and love, the fullness of which you are,
O Lord, my God?
Is it not true that you promise those who keep your commandments a
reward more desirable than great wealth and sweeter than honey? You
promise a most abundant reward, for as your apostle James says: The
Lord has prepared a crown of life for those who love him. What is this
crown of life? It is surely a greater good than we can conceive of or
desire, as Saint Paul says, quoting Isaiah: Eye has not seen, ear has
not heard, nor has it so much as dawned on man what God has prepared
for those who love him.
Truly then the recompense is great for those who keep your
commandments. That first and greatest commandment helps the man who
obeys, not the God who commands. In addition, the other commandments of
God perfect the man who obeys them. They provide him with what he
needs. They instruct and enlighten him and make him good and blessed.
If you are wise, then, know that you have been created for the glory of
God and your own eternal salvation. This is your goal; this is the
center of your life; this is the treasure of your heart. If you reach
this goal, you will find happiness. If you fail to reach it, you will
find misery.
May you consider truly good whatever leads to your goal and truly evil
whatever makes you fall away from it. Prosperity and adversity, wealth
and poverty, health and sickness, honors and humiliations, life and
death, in the mind of the wise man, are not to be sought for their own
sake, nor avoided for their own sake. But if they contribute to the
glory of God and your eternal happiness, then they are good and should
be sought. If they detract from this, they are evil and must be
avoided.
RESPONSORY           Malachi 2:7; Titus 1:7, 9
Knowledge shall be kept safe in the mouth of the priest, and men shall
seek instruction from his lips,
� because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.
The bishop should be God�s steward,
� Because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.
