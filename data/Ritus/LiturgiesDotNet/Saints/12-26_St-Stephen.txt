Psalm 31
In te, Domine, speravi

1
In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;
let me never be put to shame; *
deliver me in your righteousness.

2
Incline your ear to me; *
make haste to deliver me.

3
Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe,
for you are my crag and my stronghold; *
for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.

4
Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *
for you are my tower of strength.

5
Into your hands I commend my spirit, *
for you have redeemed me,
O LORD, O God of truth.

6
I hate those who cling to worthless idols, *
and I put my trust in the LORD.

7
I will rejoice and be glad because of your mercy; *
for you have seen my affliction;
you know my distress.

8
You have not shut me up in the power of the enemy; *
you have set my feet in an open place.

9
Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am in trouble; *
my eye is consumed with sorrow,
and also my throat and my belly.

10
For my life is wasted with grief,
and my years with sighing; *
my strength fails me because of affliction,
and my bones are consumed.

11
I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my
neighbors,
a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *
when they see me in the street they avoid me.

12
I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *
I am as useless as a broken pot.

13
For I have heard the whispering of the crowd;
fear is all around; *
they put their heads together against me;
they plot to take my life.

14
But as for me, I have trusted in you, O LORD. *
I have said, "You are my God.

15
My times are in your hand; *
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,
and from those who persecute me.

16
Make your face to shine upon your servant, *
and in your loving-kindness save me."

17
LORD, let me not be ashamed for having called upon you; *
rather, let the wicked be put to shame;
let them be silent in the grave.

18
Let the lying lips be silenced which speak against the
righteous, *
haughtily, disdainfully, and with contempt.

19
How great is your goodness, O LORD!
which you have laid up for those who fear you; *
which you have done in the sight of all
for those who put their trust in you.

20
You hide them in the covert of your presence from those who
slander
them; *
you keep them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.

21
Blessed be the LORD! *
for he has shown me the wonders of his love in a besieged
city.

22
Yet I said in my alarm,
"I have been cut off from the sight of your eyes." *
Nevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty
when I cried out to you.

23
Love the LORD, all you who worship him; *
the LORD protects the faithful,
but repays to the full those who act haughtily.

24
Be strong and let your heart take courage, *
all you who wait for the LORD.

Jeremiah 26:1-9,12-15

1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of
Judah, this word came from the Lord, 2 "Thus says the Lord: Stand in
the court of the Lord's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah
which come to worship in the house of the Lord all the words that I
command you to speak to them; do not hold back a word. 3 It may be they
will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may repent of
the evil which I intend to do to them because of their evil doings. 4
You shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord: If you will not listen to
me, to walk in my law which I have set before you, 5 and to heed the
words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently, though
you have not heeded, 6 then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I
will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.'"

7 The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
speaking these words in the house of the Lord. 8 And when Jeremiah had
finished speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all
the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid
hold of him, saying, "You shall die! 9 Why have you prophesied in the
name of the Lord, saying, 'This house shall be like Shiloh, and this
city shall be desolate, without inhabitant'?" And all the people
gathered about Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.

12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying,
"The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the
words you have heard. 13 Now therefore amend your ways and your doings,
and obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will repent of
the evil which he has pronounced against you. 14 But as for me, behold,
I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you. 15 Only
know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent
blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in
truth the Lord sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears."

Acts 6:8-7:2a,51c-60

8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs
among the people. 9 Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of
the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the
Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, arose and disputed
with Stephen. 10 But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit
with which he spoke. 11 Then they secretly instigated men, who said,
"We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God." 12
And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they
came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, 13 and
set up false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases to speak words
against this holy place and the law; 14 for we have heard him say that
this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the
customs which Moses delivered to us." 15 And gazing at him, all who sat
in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

7:1 And the high priest said, "Is this so?" 2 And Stephen said:
"Brethren and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father
Abraham.

51As your fathers did, so do you. 52 Which of the prophets did not your
fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the
coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,
53 you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep
it."

54 Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground
their teeth against him. 55 But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into
heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand
of God; 56 and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son
of man standing at the right hand of God." 57 But they cried out with a
loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. 58 Then
they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid
down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. 59 And as
they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
60 And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold
this sin against them." And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

Matthew 23:34-39

34 Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom
you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues
and persecute from town to town, 35 that upon you may come all the
righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the
blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the
sanctuary and the altar. 36 Truly, I say to you, all this will come
upon this generation.

37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who
are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together
as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! 38
Behold, your house is forsaken and desolate. 39 For I tell you, you
will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the
name of the Lord.'"


Morning Prayer

Psalm 28, 30
Psalm 28
Ad te, Domine

1
O LORD, I call to you;
my Rock, do not be deaf to my cry; *
lest, if you do not hear me,
I become like those who go down to the Pit.

2
Hear the voice of my prayer when I cry out to you, *
when I lift up my hands to your holy of holies.

3
Do not snatch me away with the wicked or with the evildoers, *
who speak peaceably with their neighbors,
while strife is in their hearts.

4
Repay them according to their deeds, *
and according to the wickedness of their actions.

5
According to the work of their hands repay them, *
and give them their just deserts.

6
They have no understanding of the LORD's doings,
nor of the works of his hands; *
therefore he will break them down and not build them up.

7
Blessed is the LORD! *
for he has heard the voice of my prayer.

8
The LORD is my strength and my shield; *
my heart trusts in him, and I have been helped;

9
Therefore my heart dances for joy, *
and in my song will I praise him.

10
The LORD is the strength of his people, *
a safe refuge for his anointed.

11
Save your people and bless your inheritance; *
shepherd them and carry them for ever.

Psalm 30
Exaltabo te, Domine

1
I will exalt you, O LORD,
because you have lifted me up *
and have not let my enemies triumph over me.

2
O LORD my God, I cried out to you, *
and you restored me to health.

3
You brought me up, O LORD, from the dead; *
you restored my life as I was going down to the grave.

4
Sing to the LORD, you servants of his; *
give thanks for the remembrance of his holiness.

5
For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, *
his favor for a lifetime.

6
Weeping may spend the night, *
but joy comes in the morning.

7
While I felt secure, I said,
"I shall never be disturbed. *
You, LORD, with your favor, made me as strong as the
mountains."

8
Then you hid your face, *
and I was filled with fear.

9
I cried to you, O LORD; *
I pleaded with the Lord, saying,

10
"What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the Pit? *
will the dust praise you or declare your faithfulness?

11
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me; *
O LORD, be my helper."

12
You have turned my wailing into dancing; *
you have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy.

13
Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing; *
O LORD my God, I will give you thanks for ever.

2 Chr 24:17-22

17 Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and did
obeisance to the king; then the king hearkened to them. 18 And they
forsook the house of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and served the
Asherim and the idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this
their guilt. 19 Yet he sent prophets among them to bring them back to
the Lord; these testified against them, but they would not give heed.

20 Then the Spirit of God took possession of Zechariah the son of
Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them,
"Thus says God, 'Why do you transgress the commandments of the Lord, so
that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the Lord, he has
forsaken you.'" 21 But they conspired against him, and by command of
the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the
Lord. 22 Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which
Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, had shown him, but killed his son. And
when he was dying, he said, "May the Lord see and avenge!"

Acts 6:1-7

1 Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, the
Hellenists murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were
neglected in the daily distribution. 2 And the twelve summoned the body
of the disciples and said, "It is not right that we should give up
preaching the word of God to serve tables. 3 Therefore, brethren, pick
out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of
wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty. 4 But we will devote
ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word." 5 And what they
said pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of
faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor,
and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. 6 These
they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands upon
them.

7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were
obedient to the faith.


Evening Prayer

Psalm 118

1 O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
his steadfast love endures for ever!
2 Let Israel say,
"His steadfast love endures for ever."
3 Let the house of Aaron say,
"His steadfast love endures for ever."
4 Let those who fear the Lord say,
"His steadfast love endures for ever."
5 Out of my distress I called on the Lord;
the Lord answered me and set me free.
6 With the Lord on my side I do not fear.
What can man do to me?
7 The Lord is on my side to help me;
I shall look in triumph on those who hate me.
8 It is better to take refuge in the Lord
than to put confidence in man.
9 It is better to take refuge in the Lord
than to put confidence in princes.
10 All nations surrounded me;
in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
11 They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side;
in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
12 They surrounded me like bees,
they blazed like a fire of thorns;
in the name of the Lord I cut them off!
13 I was pushed hard, so that I was falling,
but the Lord helped me.
14 The Lord is my strength and my song;
he has become my salvation.
15 Hark, glad songs of victory
in the tents of the righteous:
"The right hand of the Lord does valiantly,
16 the right hand of the Lord is exalted,
the right hand of the Lord does valiantly!"
17 I shall not die, but I shall live,
and recount the deeds of the Lord.
18 The Lord has chastened me sorely,
but he has not given me over to death.
19 Open to me the gates of righteousness,
that I may enter through them
and give thanks to the Lord.
20 This is the gate of the Lord;
the righteous shall enter through it.
21 I thank thee that thou hast answered me
and hast become my salvation.
22 The stone which the builders rejected
has become the head of the corner.
23 This is the Lord's doing;
it is marvelous in our eyes.
24 This is the day which the Lord has made;
let us rejoice and be glad in it.
25 Save us, we beseech thee, O Lord!
O Lord, we beseech thee, give us success!
26 Blessed be he who enters in the name of the Lord!
We bless you from the house of the Lord.
27 The Lord is God,
and he has given us light.
Bind the festal procession with branches,
up to the horns of the altar!
28 Thou art my God, and I will give thanks to thee;
thou art my God, I will extol thee.
29 O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
for his steadfast love endures for ever!

Wisdom 4:7-15

7 But the righteous man, though he die early, will be at rest. 8 For
old age is not honored for length of time,nor measured by number of
years; 9 but understanding is gray hair for men,and a blameless life is
ripe old age.

10 There was one who pleased God and was loved by him, and while living
among sinners he was taken up. 11 He was caught up lest evil change his
understanding or guile deceive his soul. 12 For the fascination of
wickedness obscures what is good,and roving desire perverts the
innocent mind. 13 Being perfected in a short time, he fulfilled long
years; 14 for his soul was pleasing to the Lord,therefore he took him
quickly from the midst of wickedness. 15 Yet the peoples saw and did
not understand,nor take such a thing to heart,that God's grace and
mercy are with his elect,and he watches over his holy ones.

Acts 7:59-8:8

59 And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit." 60 And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, do
not hold this sin against them." And when he had said this, he fell
asleep.

8:1 And Saul was consenting to his death.

And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in
Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea
and Samaria, except the apostles. 2 Devout men buried Stephen, and made
great lamentation over him. 3 But Saul was ravaging the church, and
entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed
them to prison.

4 Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. 5 Philip
went down to a city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ. 6
And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by
Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did. 7 For
unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud
voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 8 So there was
much joy in that city.
