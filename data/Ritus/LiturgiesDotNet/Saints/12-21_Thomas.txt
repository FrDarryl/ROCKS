GLORIA
COLLECT
Da nobis, omnipotens Deus, beati Thomae apostoli festivitate gloriari,
ut eius semper et patrociniis sublevemur, et vitam credentes habeamus
in nomine eius, quem ipse Dominum agnovit, Iesum Christum Filium tuum.
Grant, almighty God,
that we may glory in the Feast of the blessed Apostle Thomas,
so that we may always be sustained by his intercession
and, believing, may have life
in the name of Jesus Christ your Son,
whom Thomas acknowledged as the Lord.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever
FIRST READING          Eph 2:19-22
Brothers and sisters:
You are no longer strangers and sojourners,
but you are fellow citizens with the holy ones
and members of the household of God,
built upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets,
with Christ Jesus himself as the capstone.
Through him the whole structure is held together
and grows into a temple sacred in the Lord;
in him you also are being built together
into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 117:1bc, 2
Euntes in mundum universum, praedicate Evangelium.
R. (Mark 16:15) Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
Praise the LORD, all you nations;
glorify him, all you peoples!
R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
For steadfast is his kindness for us,
and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever.
ALLELUIA          John 20:29
Quia vidisti me, Thoma, credidisti dicit Dominus; beati qui non
viderunt et crediderunt.
You believe in me, Thomas, because you have seen me, says the Lord;
blessed are those who have not seen, but still believe!
GOSPEL           Jn 20:24-29
Thomas, called Didymus, one of the Twelve,
was not with them when Jesus came.
So the other disciples said to him, �We have seen the Lord.�
But Thomas said to them,
�Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands
and put my finger into the nailmarks
and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.�
Now a week later his disciples were again inside
and Thomas was with them.
Jesus came, although the doors were locked,
and stood in their midst and said, �Peace be with you.�
Then he said to Thomas, �Put your finger here and see my hands,
and bring your hand and put it into my side,
and do not be unbelieving, but believe.�
Thomas answered and said to him, �My Lord and my God!�
Jesus said to him, �Have you come to believe because you have seen me?
Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Debitum tibi, Domine, nostrae reddimus servitutis, suppliciter
exorantes, ut in nobis tua munera tuearis, qui in confessione beati
Thomae apostoli laudis tibi hostias immolamus.
We render you, O Lord, the service that is your due,
humbly imploring you to keep safe your gifts in us,
as we honor the confession of the Apostle Saint Thomas
and offer you a sacrifice of praise.
Through Christ our Lord.
