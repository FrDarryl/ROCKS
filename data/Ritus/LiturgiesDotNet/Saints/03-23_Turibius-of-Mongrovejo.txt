VERSE BEFORE THE GOSPEL          Jn 10:14
I am the good shepherd, says the Lord,
I know my sheep and mine know me.
GOSPEL          Matthew 9:35-38
Jesus went around to all the towns and villages,
teaching in their synagogues,
proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom,
and curing every disease and illness.
At the sight of the crowds, his heart was moved with pity for them
because they were troubled and abandoned,
like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples,
"The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest."

Office of Readings

From the decree on the pastoral office of bishops in the Church of the
Second Vatican Council
(Christus Dominus, nn. 12-13 16)
Ready for every good work
In exercising their duty of teaching, bishops are to proclaim the
gospel of Christ before men, a task that stands out among their
principal duties. In the strength of the Spirit, they are to call men
to faith, or confirm them in a living faith. They are to set before
them the mystery of Christ in it entirety, that is, those truths which
are necessary in order to know Christ, as well as the divinely revealed
way of glorifying God and so attaining to eternal happiness.

Moreover, they are to make it clear that earthly realities and human
institutions are themselves directed, in the plan of God the creator,
toward man�s salvation, and are thus able to make no small contribution
to the building up of the body of Christ.

They should therefore insist on the value placed by the Church�s
teaching on the human person, his freedom and also his physical life;
on the family, its unity and stability, and the procreation and
education of children; on civil society, with its laws and its
professions; on work and leisure, the arts and technological
developments; on poverty and affluence. They should also set forth the
principles for resolving the very serious problems relating to the
possession, increase and proper distribution of material goods, to
peace and war, and to friendly relations among all peoples.

They should present Christian teaching in a way appropriate to the
needs of the times, that is, in a way that meets the difficulties and
problems that people today find a special burden and source of anxiety.
They should also safeguard this teaching, instructing the faithful how
to defend it and propagate it themselves. In handing on this teaching
they should manifest the Church�s motherly concern for all, believers
and unbelievers alike. They should show a special solicitude for the
poor and less fortunate, to whom the Lord has sent them to preach the
good news.

In discharging their duty as father and shepherd, bishops should be
among their people as those who serve, good shepherds who know their
sheep and whose sheep know them. They should be outstanding in their
spirit of love and concern for all, true fathers whose God-given
authority all obey with joyful heart. They should unite and mold the
entire family of their flock so that all are made aware of their
responsibilities and are able to live and work in loving communion with
each other.

To do this effectively, bishops should order their lives in keeping
with the needs of the times, and so be ready for every good work,
enduring all for the sake of God�s chosen ones.
RESPONSORY       1 Peter 5:2,3-4;Acts 20:28
Be shepherds of God's flock,
give them good example,
- and when the chief shepherd appears,
he will give you a crown of unfading glory.
You must have at heart every member of the flock,
for the Holy Spirit has made you their shepherds.
You must rule over the Church of God.
- And when the chief shepherd appears,
he will give you a crown of unfading glory.
COLLECT
O God, who gave increase to your Church
through the apostolic labors and zeal for truth
of the Bishop Saint Turibius,
grant that the people consecrated to you
may always receive new growth in faith and holiness.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
