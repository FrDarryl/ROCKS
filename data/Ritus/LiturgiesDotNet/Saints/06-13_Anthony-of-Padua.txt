Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui populo tuo beatum Antonium
praedicatorem insignem dedisti, atque in necessitatibus intercessorem,
concede, ut, eius auxilio, christianae vitae documenta sectantes, in
omnibus adversitatibus te subvenientem sentiamus.
Almighty ever-living God,
who gave Saint Anthony of Padua to your people
as an outstanding preacher
and an intercessor in their need,
grant that, with his assistance,
as we follow the teachings of the Christian life,
we may know your help in every trial.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Isaiah 61:1-3d
The spirit of the Lord God is upon me,
because the LORD has anointed me;
He has sent me to bring glad tidings to the lowly,
to heal the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives
and release to the prisoners,
To announce a year of favor from the LORD
and a day of vindication by our God,
to comfort all who mourn;
To place on those who mourn in Zion
a diadem instead of ashes,
To give them oil of gladness in place of mourning,
a glorious mantle instead of a listless spirit.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          89:2-3, 4-5, 21-22, 25 and 27
Misericordias tuas, Domine, in aeternum cantabo.
R. (2) For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The favors of the LORD I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever";
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
I have sworn to David my servant:
Forever will I confirm your posterity
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
I have found David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
That my hand may be always with him,
and that my arm may make him strong."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,
and through my name shall his horn be exalted. He shall say of me,
'You are my father,
my God, the Rock, my savior."'
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Luke 4:18
Evangelizare pauperibus misit me Dominus, praedicare captivis
remissionem.
The Lord sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor
and to proclaim liberty to the captives.
GOSPEL          Luke 10:1-9
The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two other disciples
whom he sent ahead of him in pairs
to every town and place he intended to visit.
He said to them,
"The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest.
Go on your way;
behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals;
and greet no one along the way.
Into whatever house you enter, first say,
`Peace to this household.'
If a peaceful person lives there,
your peace will rest on him;
but if not, it will return to you.
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you,
for the laborer deserves his payment.
Do not move about from one house to another.
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you,
eat what is set before you,
cure the sick in it and say to them,
'The Kingdom of God is at hand for you."'

Office of Readings
From a sermon by St Anthony of Padua
(I, 226)
Actions speak louder than words
The man who is filled with the Holy Spirit speaks in different
languages. These different languages are different ways of witnessing
to Christ, such as humility, poverty, patience and obedience; we speak
in those languages when we reveal in ourselves these virtues to others.
Actions speak louder than words; let your words teach and your actions
speak. We are full of words but empty of actions, and therefore are
cursed by the Lord, since he himself cursed the fig tree when he found
no fruit but only leaves. Gregory says: �A law is laid upon the
preacher to practice what he preaches.� It is useless for a man to
flaunt his knowledge of the law if he undermines its teaching by his
actions.
But the apostles spoke as the Spirit gave them the gift of speech.
Happy the man whose words issue from the Holy Spirit and not from
himself! For some men speak as their own character dictates, but steal
the words of others and present them as their own and claim the credit
for them. The Lord refers to such men and others like them in Jeremiah:
So, then, I have a quarrel with the prophets that steal my words from
each other. I have a quarrel with the prophets, says the Lord, who have
only to move their tongues to utter oracles. I have a quarrel with the
prophets who make prophecies out of lying dreams, who recount them and
lead my people astray with their lies and their pretensions. I
certainly never sent them or commissioned them, and they serve no good
purpose for this people, says the Lord.
We should speak, then, as the Holy Spirit gives us the gift of
speech. Our humble and sincere request to the Spirit for ourselves
should be that we may bring the day of Pentecost to fulfilment, insofar
as he infuses us with his grace, by using our bodily senses in a
perfect manner and by keeping the commandments. Likewise we shall
request that we may be filled with a keen sense of sorrow and with
fiery tongues for confessing the faith, so that our deserved reward may
be to stand in the blazing splendour of the saints and to look upon the
triune God.
RESPONSORY          See Hos. 14:6; Ps. 92:13; Sir. 24:4
The just man shall blossom like the lily;
- he shall flourish for ever in the courts of our God.
He will be praised by all of God's chosen ones.
- He shall flourish for ever in the courts of our God.
