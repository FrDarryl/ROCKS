ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Isaiah 52:7
Quam pulchri super montes pedes adnuntiantis et praedicantis pacem,
adnuntiantis bonum, praedicantis salutem!
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him
who brings glad tidings of peace,
bearing good news, announcing salvation!
says the Lord.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Domine Deus, qui beatum Lucam elegisti, ut praedicatione et scriptis
mysterium tuae in pauperes dilectionis revelaret, concede, ut, qui tuo
iam nomine gloriantur, cor unum et anima una esse perseverent, et omnes
gentes tuam mereantur videre salutem.
Lord God, who chose Saint Luke
to reveal by his preaching and writings
the mystery of your love for the poor,
grant that those who already glory in your name
may persevere as one heart and one soul
and that all nations may merit to see your salvation.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Timothy 4:10-17b
Beloved:
Demas, enamored of the present world,
deserted me and went to Thessalonica,
Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
Luke is the only one with me.
Get Mark and bring him with you,
for he is helpful to me in the ministry.
I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus in Troas,
the papyrus rolls, and especially the parchments.

Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm;
the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
You too be on guard against him,
for he has strongly resisted our preaching.

At my first defense no one appeared on my behalf,
but everyone deserted me.
May it not be held against them!
But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength,
so that through me the proclamation might be completed
and all the Gentiles might hear it.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          145: 10-11, 12-13, 17-18
Sancti tui, Domine, notam faciant gloriam regni tui.
R. (12) Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD,
and let your faithful ones bless you.
Let them discourse of the glory of your Kingdom
and speak of your might.
R. Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
Making known to men your might
and the glorious splendor of your Kingdom.
Your Kingdom is a Kingdom for all ages,
and your dominion endures through all generations.
R. Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
The LORD is just in all his ways
and holy in all his works.
The LORD is near to all who call upon him,
to all who call upon him in truth.
R. Your friends make known, O Lord, the glorious splendor of your
Kingdom.
ALLELUIA          See John 15:16
Ego vos elegi de mundo, ut eatis, et fructum afferatis: et fructus
vester maneat, dicit Dominus.
I chose you from the world.
to go and bear fruit that will last, says the Lord.
GOSPEL          Luke 10:1-9
The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two disciples
whom he sent ahead of him in pairs
to every town and place he intended to visit.
He said to them,
�The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few;
so ask the master of the harvest
to send out laborers for his harvest.
Go on your way;
behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.
Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals;
and greet no one along the way.
Into whatever house you enter,
first say, �Peace to this household.�
If a peaceful person lives there,
your peace will rest on him;
but if not, it will return to you.
Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you,
for the laborer deserves payment.
Do not move about from one house to another.
Whatever town you enter and they welcome you,
eat what is set before you,
cure the sick in it and say to them,
�The Kingdom of God is at hand for you.��
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Donis caelestibus, da nobis, quaesumus, Domine, libera tibi mente
servire, ut munera, quae in festivitate beati Lucae deferimus, et
medelam nobis operentur et gloriam
Grant through your heavenly gifts
that we may serve you in freedom of heart, we pray, O Lord,
so that the offerings we make on the feast day of Saint Luke
may bring us healing and give us glory.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE OF THE APOSTLES II
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Quoniam Ecclesiam tuam in apostolicis
tribuisti consistere fundamentis, ut signum sanctitatis tuae in terris
maneret ipsa perpetuum, et caelestia praeberet cunctis hominibus
documenta. Quapropter nunc et usque in saeculum cum omni militia
Angelorum devota tibi mente concinimus, clamantes atque dicentes:
Sanctus.
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord

For you have built your Church
to stand firm on apostolic foundations,
to be a lasting sign of your holiness on earth
and offer all humanity your heavenly teaching.

Therefore, now and for ages unending,
with all the host of Angels,
we sing to you with all our hearts,
crying out as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy..
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. Lk 10: 1, 9
Misit Dominus discipulos, qui nuntiarent civitatibus: Appropinquavit in
vos regnum Dei.
The Lord sent out disciples to proclaim throughout the towns:
The kingdom of God is at hand for you.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Praesta, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus, ut, quod de sancto altari tuo
accepimus, nos sanctificet, et in fide Evangelii, quod beatus Lucas
praedicavit, fortes efficiat.

that what we have received from your holy altar
may sanctify us and make us strong
in the faith of the Gospel which Saint Luke proclaimed.
