Eucharistic Readings

Acts 1:15-26 In those days Peter stood up among the believers (together the
crowd numbered about one hundred and twenty people) and said, ‘Friends, the
scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit through David foretold
concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus— for he was
numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry.’ (Now this man
acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he
burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. This became known to
all the residents of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their
language Hakeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) ‘For it is written in the book
of Psalms,
“Let his homestead become desolate,
and let there be no one to live in it”;
and
“Let another take his position of overseer.”
So one of the men who have accompanied us throughout the time that the Lord
Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the
day when he was taken up from us—one of these must become a witness with us
to his resurrection.’ So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was
also known as Justus, and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, ‘Lord, you
know everyone’s heart. Show us which one of these two you have chosen to take
the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to
go to his own place.’ And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on
Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.

Philippians 3:13b-21 Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to
what lies ahead, I press on towards the goal for the prize of the heavenly
call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us then who are mature be of the
same mind; and if you think differently about anything, this too God will
reveal to you. Only let us hold fast to what we have attained.
Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live
according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the
cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even with
tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their glory is
in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. But our citizenship is
in heaven, and it is from there that we are expecting a Saviour, the Lord
Jesus Christ. He will transform the body of our humiliation so that it may be
conformed to the body of his glory, by the power that also enables him to
make all things subject to himself.
Psalm 15    Domine, quis habitabit?

1
LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *
who may abide upon your holy hill?

2
Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *
who speaks the truth from his heart.

3
There is no guile upon his tongue;
he does no evil to his friend; *
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.

4
In his sight the wicked is rejected, *
but he honors those who fear the LORD.

5
He has sworn to do no wrong *
and does not take back his word.

6
He does not give his money in hope of gain, *
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.

7
Whoever does these things *
shall never be overthrown.

John 15:1, 6-16 ‘I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-grower.
6Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such
branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. 7If you abide in me,
and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for
you. 8My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become* my
disciples. 9As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my
love. 10If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I
have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. 11I have said these
things to you so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be
complete. 12 ‘This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have
loved you. 13No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for
one’s friends. 14You are my friends if you do what I command you. 15I do not
call you servants* any longer, because the servant* does not know what the
master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to
you everything that I have heard from my Father. 16You did not choose me but
I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last,
so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name.

Morning Prayer

Psalm 80    Qui regis Israel

1
Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph like a flock; *
shine forth, you that are enthroned upon the cherubim.

2
In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, *
stir up your strength and come to help us.

3
Restore us, O God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.

4
O LORD God of hosts, *
how long will you be angered
despite the prayers of your people?

5
You have fed them with the bread of tears; *
you have given them bowls of tears to drink.

6
You have made us the derision of our neighbors, *
and our enemies laugh us to scorn.

7
Restore us, O God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.

8
You have brought a vine out of Egypt; *
you cast out the nations and planted it.

9
You prepared the ground for it; *
it took root and filled the land.

10
The mountains were covered by its shadow *
and the towering cedar trees by its boughs.

11
You stretched out its tendrils to the Sea *
and its branches to the River.

12
Why have you broken down its wall, *
so that all who pass by pluck off its grapes?

13
The wild boar of the forest has ravaged it, *
and the beasts of the field have grazed upon it.

14
Turn now, O God of hosts, look down from heaven;
behold and tend this vine; *
preserve what your right hand has planted.

15
They burn it with fire like rubbish; *
at the rebuke of your countenance let them perish.

16
Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, *
and son of man you have made so strong for yourself.

17
And so will we never turn away from you; *
give us life, that we may call upon your Name.

18
Restore us, O LORD God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.

1 Samuel 16:1-13

The Lord said to Samuel, ‘How long will you grieve over Saul? I have
rejected him from being king over Israel. Fill your horn with oil and
set out; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided
for myself a king among his sons.’ Samuel said, ‘How can I go? If Saul
hears of it, he will kill me.’ And the Lord said, ‘Take a heifer with
you, and say, “I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.” Invite Jesse to
the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall
anoint for me the one whom I name to you.’ Samuel did what the Lord
commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet
him trembling, and said, ‘Do you come peaceably?’ He said, ‘Peaceably;
I have come to sacrifice to the Lord; sanctify yourselves and come with
me to the sacrifice.’ And he sanctified Jesse and his sons and invited
them to the sacrifice.
When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, ‘Surely the Lord’s
anointed is now before the Lord.’ But the Lord said to Samuel, ‘Do not
look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have
rejected him; for the Lord does not see as mortals see; they look on
the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.’ Then Jesse
called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, ‘Neither has
the Lord chosen this one.’ Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he
said, ‘Neither has the Lord chosen this one.’ Jesse made seven of his
sons pass before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, ‘The Lord has not
chosen any of these.’ Samuel said to Jesse, ‘Are all your sons here?’
And he said, ‘There remains yet the youngest, but he is keeping the
sheep.’ And Samuel said to Jesse, ‘Send and bring him; for we will not
sit down until he comes here.’ He sent and brought him in. Now he was
ruddy, and had beautiful eyes, and was handsome. The Lord said, ‘Rise
and anoint him; for this is the one.’ Then Samuel took the horn of oil,
and anointed him in the presence of his brothers; and the spirit of the
Lord came mightily upon David from that day forward. Samuel then set
out and went to Ramah.

1 John 2:18-25

Children, it is the last hour! As you have heard that antichrist is
coming, so now many antichrists have come. From this we know that it is
the last hour. 19They went out from us, but they did not belong to us;
for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But
by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us. 20But
you have been anointed by the Holy One, and all of you have knowledge.*
21I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because
you know it, and you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22Who is
the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?* This is the
antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23No one who
denies the Son has the Father; everyone who confesses the Son has the
Father also. 24Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If
what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in
the Son and in the Father. 25And this is what he has promised us,*
eternal life.

Evening Prayer

Psalm 33    Exultate, justi

1
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous; *
it is good for the just to sing praises.

2
Praise the LORD with the harp; *
play to him upon the psaltery and lyre.

3
Sing for him a new song; *
sound a fanfare with all your skill upon the trumpet.

4
For the word of the LORD is right, *
and all his works are sure.

5
He loves righteousness and justice; *
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.

6
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, *
by the breath of his mouth all the heavenly hosts.

7
He gathers up the waters of the ocean as in a water-skin *
and stores up the depths of the sea.

8
Let all the earth fear the LORD; *
let all who dwell in the world stand in awe of him.

9
For he spoke, and it came to pass; *
he commanded, and it stood fast.

10
The LORD brings the will of the nations to naught; *
he thwarts the designs of the peoples.

11
But the LORD'S will stands fast for ever, *
and the designs of his heart from age to age.

12
Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD! *
happy the people he has chosen to be his own!

13
The LORD looks down from heaven, *
and beholds all the people in the world.

14
From where he sits enthroned he turns his gaze *
on all who dwell on the earth.

15
He fashions all the hearts of them *
and understands all their works.

16
There is no king that can be saved by a mighty army; *
a strong man is not delivered by his great strength.

17
The horse is a vain hope for deliverance; *
for all its strength it cannot save.

18
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, *
on those who wait upon his love,

19
To pluck their lives from death, *
and to feed them in time of famine.

20
Our soul waits for the LORD; *
he is our help and our shield.

21
Indeed, our heart rejoices in him, *
for in his holy Name we put our trust.

22
Let your loving-kindness, O LORD, be upon us, *
as we have put our trust in you.

1 Samuel 12:1-5 Samuel said to all Israel, ‘I have listened to you in all
that you have said to me, and have set a king over you. See, it is the king
who leads you now; I am old and grey, but my sons are with you. I have led
you from my youth until this day. Here I am; testify against me before the
Lord and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I
taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand
have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will
restore it to you.’ They said, ‘You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or
taken anything from the hand of anyone.’ He said to them, ‘The Lord is
witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not
found anything in my hand.’ And they said, ‘He is witness.’

Acts 20:17-35

From Miletus Paul sent a message to Ephesus, asking the elders of the
church to meet him. When they came to him, he said to them:
‘You yourselves know how I lived among you the entire time from the
first day that I set foot in Asia, serving the Lord with all humility
and with tears, enduring the trials that came to me through the plots
of the Jews. I did not shrink from doing anything helpful, proclaiming
the message to you and teaching you publicly and from house to house,
as I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance towards God and
faith towards our Lord Jesus. And now, as a captive to the Spirit, I am
on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that
imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me. But I do not count my
life of any value to myself, if only I may finish my course and the
ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good
news of God’s grace.
‘And now I know that none of you, among whom I have gone about
proclaiming the kingdom, will ever see my face again. Therefore I
declare to you this day that I am not responsible for the blood of any
of you, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of
God. Keep watch over yourselves and over all the flock, of which the
Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that
he obtained with the blood of his own Son. I know that after I have
gone, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. Some
even from your own group will come distorting the truth in order to
entice the disciples to follow them. Therefore be alert, remembering
that for three years I did not cease night or day to warn everyone with
tears. And now I commend you to God and to the message of his grace, a
message that is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance
among all who are sanctified. I coveted no one’s silver or gold or
clothing. You know for yourselves that I worked with my own hands to
support myself and my companions. In all this I have given you an
example that by such work we must support the weak, remembering the
words of the Lord Jesus, for he himself said, “It is more blessed to
give than to receive.” ’

From the Office of Readings (Matins)

1 Corinthians 4:1-16

Think of us in this way, as servants of Christ and stewards of God’s
mysteries. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they should be
found trustworthy. But with me it is a very small thing that I should
be judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself. I
am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby
acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. Therefore do not pronounce
judgement before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to
light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes
of the heart. Then each one will receive commendation from God.
I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit,
brothers and sisters, so that you may learn through us the meaning of
the saying, ‘Nothing beyond what is written’, so that none of you will
be puffed up in favour of one against another. For who sees anything
different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you
received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?
Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Quite
apart from us you have become kings! Indeed, I wish that you had become
kings, so that we might be kings with you! For I think that God has
exhibited us apostles as last of all, as though sentenced to death,
because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to
mortals. We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in
Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honour, but we
in disrepute. To the present hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are
poorly clothed and beaten and homeless, and we grow weary from the work
of our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;
when slandered, we speak kindly. We have become like the rubbish of the
world, the dregs of all things, to this very day.
I am not writing this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my
beloved children. For though you might have ten thousand guardians in
Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became
your father through the gospel. I appeal to you, then, be imitators of
me.

From a sermon of St John Chrysostom on St Matthias

'In those days, Peter, stood up in the midst of the disciples and said"
As the fiery spirit to whom the flock was entrusted by Christ and as
the leader in the band of the apostles, Peter always took the
initiative in speaking: "My brothers, we must choose from among our
number.'" He left the decision to the whole body, at once augmenting
the honour of those elected and avoiding any suspicion of partiality.
For such great occasions can easily lead to trouble.

Did not Peter then have the right to make the choice himself? Certainly
he had the right, but he did not want to give the appearance of showing
special favour to anyone. Besides he was not yet endowed with the
Spirit. "And they nominated two," we read, "Joseph, who was called
Barsabbas and surnamed Justus, and Matthias." He himself did not
nominate them; all present did. But it was he who brought the issue
forward, pointing out that it was not his own idea but had been
suggested to him by a scriptural prophecy. So he was speaking not as a
teacher but as an interpreter.

"So," he goes on, "we must choose from those men who lived in our
company." Notice how insistent he is that they should be eyewitnesses.
Even though the Spirit would come to ratify the choice, Peter regards
this prior qualification as most important.

"Those who lived in our company," he continued, "all through the time
when the Lord Jesus came and went among us." He refers to those who had
dwelt with Jesus, not just those who had been his disciples. For of
course from the very beginning many had followed him. Notice how it is
written that Peter himself was "one of the two who had listened to
John, and followed Jesus."

"All through the time when the Lord Jesus came and went among us,
beginning with the baptism of John" – rightly so, because no one knew
what had happened before that time, although they were to know of it
later through the Spirit.

"Up to the day," Peter added, "on which he was taken up from us – one
of these must be made a witness along with us of his resurrection." He
did not say “a witness of the rest of his actions” but only "a witness
of the resurrection." That witness would be more believable who could
declare that he who ate and drank and was crucified also rose from the
dead. He needed to be a witness not of the times before or after that
event, and not of the signs and wonders, but only of the resurrection
itself. For the rest happened by general admission, openly; but the
resurrection took place secretly, and was known to these men only.

And they all prayed together, saying: "You, Lord, know the hearts of
men; make your choice known to us." “You”, not “we”. Appropriately they
said that he knew the hearts of men, because the choice was to be made
by him, not by others.

They spoke with such confidence, because someone had to be appointed.
They did not say “choose” but "make known to us" the chosen one; "the
one you choose," they said, fully aware that everything was
pre-ordained by God. "They then drew lots." For they did not think
themselves worthy to make the choice of their own accord, and therefore
they wanted some sign for their instruction.
