Deus, qui sanctum Camillum presbyterum caritatis in infirmos singulari
gratia decorasti, eius meritis, spiritum nobis tuae dilectionis
infunde, ut, tibi in fratribus servientes, ad te, hora exitus nostri,
securi transire possimus.
O God, who adorned the Priest Saint Camillus
with a singular grace of charity towards the sick,
pour out upon us, by his merits,
a spirit of love for you,
so that, serving you in our neighbor,
we may, at the hour of our death,
pass safely over to you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 3:14-18
Beloved:
We know that we have passed from death to life
because we love our brothers.
Whoever does not love remains in death.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,
and you know that anyone who is a murderer
does not have eternal life remaining in him.
The way we came to know love
was that he laid down his life for us;
so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
If someone who has worldly means
sees a brother in need and refuses him compassion,
how can the love of God remain in him?
Children, let us love not in word or speech
but in deed and truth.

ALLELUIA
I give you a new commandment:
love one another as I have loved you.
GOSPEL           John 15:9-17
Jesus said to his disciples:
"As the Father loves me, so I also love you.
Remain in my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love,
just as I have kept my Father's commandments
and remain in his love.

"I have told you this so that my joy might be in you
and your joy might be complete.
This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
No one has greater love than this,
to lay down one's life for one's friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you slaves,
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
I have called you friends,
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,
so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
This I command you: love one another."

SECOND READING
From the life of Saint Camillus by his companion
(S. Cicarelli, Vita del P. Camillo de Lellis, Viterbo, 1615)
Serving the Lord in the brethren
Let me begin with holy charity. It is the root of all the virtues and
Camillus� most characteristic trait. I can attest that he was on fire
with this holy virtue � not only toward God, but also toward his
fellowmen, and especially toward the sick. The mere sight of the sick
was enough to soften and melt his heart and make him utterly forget all
the pleasures, enticements and interests of this world. When he was
taking care of his patients, he seemed to spend and exhaust himself
completely, so great was his devotion and compassion. He would have
loved to take upon himself all their illness, their every affliction,
could he but ease their pain and relieve their weakness.

In the sick he saw the person of Christ. His imagination was so vivid
that, while feeding them, he perceived his patients as other Christs.
He would even beg of them the gift of forgiveness for his sins. His
reverence in their presence was as great as if he were really and truly
in the presence of his Lord. In his conversations he talked of nothing
more often or with greater feeling than of holy charity. He would have
liked to plant this virtue in every human heart.

To enkindle the enthusiasm of his religious brothers for this
all-important virtue, he used to impress upon them the consoling words
of Jesus Christ: I was sick and you visited me. He seemed to have these
words truly graven on his heart, so often did he say them over and over
again.

Great and all-embracing was Camillus� charity. Not only the sick and
dying, but every other needy or suffering human being found shelter in
his deep and kind concern. Indeed, his heartfelt concern for the poor
led him to say often: �If there were no poor people in the world, we
should have to go below the earth to look for them and rescue them, to
show them compassion and do them good!�
RESPONSORY          1 Thess 5:14,15,18; Rom. 15:7
Support the weak;
always strive to do good for all,
- for this God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
Welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you,
for the glory of God.
- For this God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
