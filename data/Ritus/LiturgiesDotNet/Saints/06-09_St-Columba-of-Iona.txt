FIRST READING          1 Corinthians 3:11-23
For no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been
laid; that foundation is Jesus Christ. Now if anyone builds on the
foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw-- the
work of each builder will become visible, for the Day will disclose it,
because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort
of work each has done. If what has been built on the foundation
survives, the builder will receive a reward. If the work is burned up,
the builder will suffer loss; the builder will be saved, but only as
through fire.
Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells
in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person.
For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple. Do not deceive
yourselves. If you think that you are wise in this age, you should
become fools so that you may become wise. For the wisdom of this world
is foolishness with God. For it is written,
"He catches the wise in their craftiness,"
and again,
"The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile."
So let no one boast about human leaders. For all things are yours,
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the
present or the future-- all belong to you, and you belong to Christ,
and Christ belongs to God.
PSALM          97:1-2,7-12
^1 The Lord is king: let the earth rejoice; *
let the multitude of the isles be glad.
^2 Clouds and darkness are round about him; *
righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
^7 Confounded be all who worship carved images
and delight in mere idols. *
Bow down before him, all you gods.
^8 Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced, *
because of your judgements, O Lord.
^9 For you, Lord, are most high over all the earth; *
you are exalted far above all gods.
^10 The Lord loves those who hate evil; *
he preserves the lives of his faithful
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
^11 Light has sprung up for the righteous *
and joy for the true of heart.
^12 Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous, *
and give thanks to his holy name.
Or:
Psalm 98:1-4
^1 Sing to the Lord a new song, *
for he has done marvellous things.
^2 His own right hand and his holy arm *
have won for him the victory.
^3 The Lord has made known his salvation; *
his deliverance has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.
^4 He has remembered his mercy and faithfulness
towards the house of Israel, *
and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
GOSPEL          Luke 10:17-20
The seventy, whom Jesus had sent out, returned with joy, saying, "Lord,
in your name even the demons submit to us!" He said to them, "I watched
Satan fall from heaven like a flash of lightning. See, I have given you
authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of
the enemy; and nothing will hurt you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice at
this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are
written in heaven."
