The Collect

O holy God, you endowed your servant and bishop Hugh of Lincoln with
wise and cheerful boldness, and taught him to commend the discipline of
holy life to kings and princes: Grant that we also, rejoicing in the
Good News of your mercy, and fearing nothing but the loss of you, may
be bold to speak the truth in love, in the name of Jesus Christ our
Redeemer; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, God, for
ever and ever. Amen

First Reading
Titus 2:7-8, 11-14

"Bless God and acknowledge him in the presence of all the living for
the good things he has done

Show yourself in all respects a model of good works, and in your
teaching show integrity, gravity, and sound speech that cannot be
censured; then any opponent will be put to shame, having nothing evil
to say of us.

For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, training
us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to
live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, while we wait
for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great
God and Savior, Jesus Christ. He it is who gave himself for us that he
might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of
his own who are zealous for good deeds.

The Psalm
Psalm 112:1-9
Beatus vir

1
Hallelujah!
Happy are they who fear the Lord *
and have great delight in his commandments!

2
Their descendants will be mighty in the land; *
the generation of the upright will be blessed.

3
Wealth and riches will be in their house, *
and their righteousness will last for ever.

4
Light shines in the darkness for the upright; *
the righteous are merciful and full of compassion.

5
It is good for them to be generous in lending *
and to manage their affairs with justice.

6
For they will never be shaken; *
the righteous will be kept in everlasting remembrance.

7
They will not be afraid of any evil rumors; *
their heart is right;
they put their trust in the Lord.

8
Their heart is established and will not shrink, *
until they see their desire upon their enemies.

9
They have given freely to the poor, *
and their righteousness stands fast for ever;
they will hold up their head with honor.

or
Psalm 15
Domine, quis habitabit?

1
LORD, who may dwell in your tabernacle? *
who may abide upon your holy hill?

2
Whoever leads a blameless life and does what is right, *
who speaks the truth from his heart.

3
There is no guile upon his tongue;
he does no evil to his friend; *
he does not heap contempt upon his neighbor.

4
In his sight the wicked is rejected, *
but he honors those who fear the LORD.

5
He has sworn to do no wrong *
and does not take back his word.

6
He does not give his money in hope of gain, *
nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.

7
Whoever does these things *
shall never be overthrown.

Gospel Reading
Matthew 24:42-47

Jesus said to his disciples, "Keep awake therefore, for you do not know
on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of
the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he
would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken
into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at
an unexpected hour.

"Who then is the faithful and wise slave, whom his master has put in
charge of his household, to give the other slaves their allowance of
food at the proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his master will
find at work when he arrives. Truly I tell you, he will put that one in
charge of all his possessions."
