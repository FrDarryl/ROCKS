MASS

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Mal 2: 6
Lex veritatis fuit in ore eius et iniquitas non est inventa in labiis
eius; in pace et in aequitate ambulavit mecum, et multos avertit ab
iniquitate.
The law of truth was in his mouth;
no dishonesty was found on his lips.
He walked with me in integrity and peace,
and turned many away from evil.
COLLECT
Deus, qui beato Irenaeo episcopo tribuisti, ut veritatem doctrinae
pacemque Ecclesiae feliciter confirmaret, concede, quaesumus, eius
intercessione, ut nos, fide et caritate renovati, ad unitatem
concordiamque fovendam semper simus intenti.
O God, who called the Bishop Saint Irenaeus
to confirm true doctrine and the peace of the Church,
grant, we pray, through his intercession,
that, being renewed in faith and charity,
we may always be intent on fostering unity and concord.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          2 Tim 2:22b-26
Beloved:
Pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace,
along with those who call on the Lord with purity of heart.
Avoid foolish and ignorant debates,
for you know that they breed quarrels.
A slave of the Lord should not quarrel,
but should be gentle with everyone,
able to teach, tolerant, correcting opponents with kindness.
It may be that God will grant them repentance
that leads to knowledge of the truth,
and that they may return to their senses out of the Devil's snare,
where they are entrapped by him, for his will.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 37:3-4,5-6,30-31
R. (30a) The mouth of the just tells of wisdom.
Trust in the Lord and do good
that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.
Take delight in the Lord
and he will grant you your heart's requests.
R. The mouth of the just tells of wisdom.
Commit to the Lord your way;
trust in him and he will act
He will make justice dawn for you like the light;
bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.
R. The mouth of the just tells of wisdom.
The mouth of the just tells of wisdom;
and his tongue utters what is right.
The law of his God  is in his heart
and his steps do not falter.
R. The mouth of the just tells of wisdom.
ALLELUIA          John 15:9b,5b
Remain in my love, says the Lord;
whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit.
GOSPEL          John 22:34-40
Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said:
"Holy Father, I pray not only for these,
but also for those who will believe in me through their word,
so that they may all be one,
as you, Father, are in me and I in you,
that they also may be in us,
that the world may believe that you sent me.
And I have given them the glory you gave me,
so that they may be one, as we are one,
I in them and you in me,
that they may be brought to perfection as one,
that the world may know that you sent me,
and that you loved them even as you loved me.
Father, they are your gift to me.
I wish that where I am they also may be with me,
that they may see my glory that you gave me,
because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
Righteous Father, the world also does not know you,
but I know you, and they know that you sent me.
I made known to them your name and I will make it known,
that the love with which you loved me
may be in them and I in them."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Gloriam tibi, Domine, conferat sacrificium, quod in natali beati
Irenaei tibi laetanter offerimus, et praebeat nobis diligere veritatem,
ut et inviolatam Ecclesiae fidem teneamus, et stabilem unitatem.
May the sacrifice we offer you with joy
on the heavenly birthday of Saint Irenaeus
bring you glory, O Lord,
and instill in us a love of the truth,
so that we may keep the Church's faith inviolate
and her unity secure.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Jn 15: 4-5
Manete in me, et ego in vobis, dicit Dominus. Qui manet in me et ego in
eo, hic fert fructum multum.
Remain in me, as I remain in you, says the Lord.
Whoever remains in me, and I in him, bears fruit in plenty
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Per haec sacra mysteria, quaesumus, Domine, da nobis fidei miseratus
augmentum, ut, quae beatum Irenaeum episcopum usque ad mortem retenta
glorificat, nos etiam iustificet veraciter hanc sequentes.
Through these sacred mysteries, we pray, O Lord,
give us in your compassion an increase of that faith
which brought glory to the Bishop Saint Irenaeus
as he maintained it even until death,
and may the same faith bring to us, who truly follow it,
justification in your sight.
Through Christ our Lord.

SECOND READING
From the treatise Against Heresies by Saint Irenaeus, bishop
(Lib. 4, 20, 5-7; SC 100, 640-642, 644-648)
Life in man is the glory of God; the life of man is the vision of God
The glory of God gives life; those who see God receive life. For this
reason God, who cannot be grasped, comprehended or seen, allows himself
to be seen, comprehended and grasped by men, that he may give life to
those who see and receive him. It is impossible to live without life,
and the actualization of life comes from participation in God, while
participation in God is to see God and enjoy his goodness.

Men will therefore see God if they are to live; through the vision of
God they become immortal and attain to God himself. As I have said,
this was shown in symbols by the prophets: God will be seen by men who
bear his Spirit and are always waiting for his coming. As Moses said in
the Book of Deuteronomy: On that day we shall see, for God will speak
to man, and man will live.

God is the source of all activity throughout creation. He cannot be
seen or described in his own nature and in all his greatness by any of
his creatures. Yet he is certainly not unknown. Through his Word the
whole creation learns that there is one God the Father, who holds all
things together and gives them their being. As it is written in the
Gospel: No man has ever seen God, except the only-begotten Son, who is
in the bosom of the Father; he has revealed him.

From the beginning the Son is the one who teaches us about the Father;
he is with the Father from the beginning. He was to reveal to the human
race visions of prophecy, the diversity of spiritual gifts, his own
ways of ministry, the glorification of the Father, all in due order and
harmony, at the appointed time and for our instruction. Where there is
order, there is also harmony; where there is harmony, there is also
correct timing; where there is correct timing, there is also advantage.

The Word became the steward of the Father's grace for the advantage of
men, for whose benefit he made such wonderful arrangements. He revealed
God to men and presented men to God. He safeguarded the invisibility of
the Father to prevent man from treating God with contempt and to set
before him a constant goal toward which to make progress. On the other
hand, he revealed God to men and made him visible in many ways to
prevent man from being totally separated from God and so cease to be.
Life in man is the glory of God: the life of man is the vision of God.
If the revelation of God through creation gives life to all who live
upon the earth, much more does the manifestation of the Father through
the Word give life to those who see God.
RESPONSORY          Malachi 2:6; Psalm 89:22
True teaching was in his mouth;
no evil was ever found on his lips.
- He walked with me in goodness and in peace.

My hand will be a steady help to him;
my arm will give him strength.
- He walked with me in goodness and in peace.
