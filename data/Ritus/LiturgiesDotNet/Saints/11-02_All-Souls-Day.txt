ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf. 1 Thes 4: 14; 1 Cor 15: 22
Sicut Iesus mortuus est et resurrexit, ita et Deus eos qui dormierunt
per Iesum adducet cum eo. Et sicut in Adam omnes moriuntur, ita et in
Christo omnes vivificabuntur.
Just as Jesus died and has risen again,
so through Jesus God will bring with him
those who have fallen asleep;
and as in Adam all die,
so also in Christ will all be brought to life
COLLECT
Preces nostras, quaesumus, Domine, benignus exaudi, ut, dum attollitur
nostra fides in Filio tuo a mortuis suscitato, in famulorum tuorum
praestolanda resurrectione spes quoque nostra firmetur.
Listen kindly to our prayers, O Lord,
and, as our faith in your Son,
raised from the dead, is deepened,
so may our hope of resurrection for your departed servants
also find new strength.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
The following are one set of readings for the day:
FIRST READING          Wisdom 3:1-9
The souls of the just are in the hand of God,
and no torment shall touch them.
They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead;
and their passing away was thought an affliction
and their going forth from us, utter destruction.
But they are in peace.
For if before men, indeed, they be punished,
yet is their hope full of immortality;
chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,
because God tried them
and found them worthy of himself.
As gold in the furnace, he proved them,
and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.
In the time of their visitation they shall shine,
and shall dart about as sparks through stubble;
they shall judge nations and rule over peoples,
and the LORD shall be their King forever.
Those who trust in him shall understand truth,
and the faithful shall abide with him in love:
because grace and mercy are with his holy ones,
and his care is with his elect.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 23:1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6

with me.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures he gives me repose;
beside restful waters he leads me;
he refreshes my soul.

with me.
SECOND READING          Romans 6:3-9
Brothers and sisters:
Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus
were baptized into his death?
We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death,
so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead
by the glory of the Father,
we too might live in newness of life.
For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his,
we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.
We know that our old self was crucified with him,
so that our sinful body might be done away with,
that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.
For a dead person has been absolved from sin.
If, then, we have died with Christ,
we believe that we shall also live with him.
We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;
death no longer has power over him.
ALLELUIA
Come, you who are blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
GOSPEL          John 6:37-40
Jesus said to the crowds:
�Everything that the Father gives me will come to me,
and I will not reject anyone who comes to me,
because I came down from heaven not to do my own will
but the will of the one who sent me.
And this is the will of the one who sent me,
that I should not lose anything of what he gave me,
but that I should raise it on the last day.
For this is the will of my Father,
that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him
may have eternal life,
and I shall raise him on the last day.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Nostris, Domine, propitiare muneribus, ut famuli tui defuncti
assumantur in gloriam cum Filio tuo, cuius magno pietatis iungimur
