GLORIA
COLLECT
Deus, qui beatam Virginem Mariam, eius humilitatem respiciens, ad hanc
gratiam evexisti, ut Unigenitus tuus ex ipsa secundum carnem
nasceretur, et hodierna die superexcellenti gloria coronasti, eius
nobis precibus concede, ut, redemptionis tuae mysterio salvati, a te
exaltari mereamur.
O God, who, looking on the lowliness of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
raised her to this grace,
that your Only Begotten Son was born of her according to the flesh
and that she was crowned this day with surpassing glory,
grant through her prayers,
that, saved by the mystery of your redemption,
we may merit to be exalted by you on high.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 Chronicles 15:3-4,15-16; 16:1-2
David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring the ark of the LORD
to the place which he had prepared for it.
David also called together the sons of Aaron and the Levites.

The Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with poles,
as Moses had ordained according to the word of the LORD.

David commanded the chiefs of the Levites
to appoint their kinsmen as chanters,
to play on musical instruments, harps, lyres, and cymbals,
to make a loud sound of rejoicing.

They brought in the ark of God and set it within the tent
which David had pitched for it.
Then they offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings to God.
When David had finished offering up the burnt offerings and peace
offerings,
he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 132:6-7, 9-10, 13-14
Surge, Domine, in requiem tuam, tu et arca fortitudinis tuae.
R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your
holiness.
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;
we found it in the fields of Jaar.
Let us enter his dwelling,
let us worship at his footstool.
R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your
holiness.
May your priests be clothed with justice;
let your faithful ones shout merrily for joy.
For the sake of David your servant,
reject not the plea of your anointed.
R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your
holiness.
For the LORD has chosen Zion;
he prefers her for her dwelling.
�Zion is my resting place forever;
in her will I dwell, for I prefer her.�
R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest, you and the ark of your
holiness.
SECOND READING           1 Cor 15:54b-57
Brothers and sisters:
When that which is mortal clothes itself with immortality,
then the word that is written shall come about:

"Death is swallowed up in victory.
Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?"

The sting of death is sin,
and the power of sin is the law.
But thanks be to God who gives us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ.
ALLELUIA          Luke 11:28
Beati qui audiunt verbum Dei et custodiunt illud.
Blessed are they who hear the word of God
and keep it.
GOSPEL          Luke 11:27-28
While Jesus was speaking,
a woman from the crowd called out and said to him,
�Blessed is the womb that carried you
and the breasts at which you nursed.�
He replied,
�Rather, blessed are those
who hear the word of God and observe it.�

PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, quaesumus, Domine, sacrificium placationis et laudis, quod in
sanctae Dei Genetricis Assumptione celebramus, ut ad veniam nos
obtinendam perducat, et in perpetua gratiarum constituat actione.
Receive, we pray, O Lord,
the sacrifice of conciliation and praise,
which we celebrate on the Assumption of the holy Mother of God,
that it may lead us to your pardon
and confirm us in perpetual thanksgiving.
Through Christ our Lord.
PREFACE            The Glory of Mary assumed into heaven.
Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et
ubique gratias agere: Domine, sancte Pater, omnipotens aeterne Deus:
per Christum Dominum nostrum. Quoniam Virgo Deipara hodie in caelos
assumpta est, Ecclesiae tuae consummandae initium et imago, ac populo
peregrinanti certae spei et solacii documentum; corruptionem enim
sepulcri eam videre merito noluisti, quae Filium tuum, vitae omnis
auctorem, ineffabiliter de se genuit incarnatum. Et ideo, choris
angelicis sociati, te laudamus, in gaudio confitentes: Sanctus.
V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.

It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For today the Virgin Mother of God
was assumed into heaven
as the beginning and image
of your Church’s coming to perfection
and a sign of sure hope and comfort to your pilgrim people;
rightly you would not allow her
to see the corruption of the tomb
since from her own body she marvelously brought forth
your incarnate Son, the Author of all life.

And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts...
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Lk 11: 27
Beata viscera Mariae Virginis, quae portaverunt aeterni Patris Filium.
Blessed is the womb of the Virgin Mary,
which bore the Son of the eternal Father
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Mensae caelestis participes effecti, imploramus clementiam tuam, Domine
Deus noster, ut, qui Assumptionem Dei Genetricis colimus, a cunctis
malis imminentibus liberemur.
Having partaken of this heavenly table,
we beseech your mercy, Lord our God,
that we, who honor the Assumption of the Mother of God,
may be freed from every threat of harm.
Through Christ our Lord.
SOLEMN BLESSING
May God, who through the childbearing of the Blessed Virgin Mary
willed in his great kindness to redeem the human race,
be pleased to enrich you with his blessing.
Amen.

May you know always and everywhere the protection of her,
through whom you have been found worthy to receive the author of life.
Amen.

May you, who have devoutly gathered on this day,
carry away with you the gifts of spiritual joys and heavenly
rewards.
Amen.

And may the blessing of almighty God,
the Father, and the Son, † and the Holy Spirit,
come down on you and remain with you for ever.
Amen.

Mass during the Day
ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf. Rev 12: 1
Signum magnum apparuit in caelo: mulier amicta sole, et luna sub
pedibus eius, et in capite eius corona stellarum duodecim.
A great sign appeared in heaven:
a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon beneath her feet,
and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
Or:
Gaudeamus omnes in Domino, diem festum celebrantes sub honore Mariae
Virginus, de cuius Assumptione gaudent Angeli, et collaudant Filium
Dei.
Let us all rejoice in the Lord,
as we celebrate the feast day in honor of the Virgin Mary,
at whose Assumption the Angels rejoice
and praise the Son of God.
GLORIA
COLLECT
Omnipotens sempiterne Deus, qui immaculatam Virginem Mariam, Filii tui
Genetricem, corpore et anima ad caelestem gloriam assumpsisti, concede,
quaesumus, ut, ad superna semper intenti, ipsius gloriae mereamur esse
consortes.
Almighty ever-living God,
who assumed the Immaculate Virgin Mary, the Mother of your Son,
body and soul into heavenly glory,
grant, we pray,
that, always attentive to the things that are above,
we may merit to be sharers of her glory.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Revelation 11:19; 12:1-6a,10ab
God�s temple in heaven was opened,
and the ark of his covenant could be seen in the temple.

A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun,
with the moon under her feet,
and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
She was with child and wailed aloud in pain as she labored to give
birth.
Then another sign appeared in the sky;
it was a huge red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns,
and on its heads were seven diadems.
Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky
and hurled them down to the earth.
Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth,
to devour her child when she gave birth.
She gave birth to a son, a male child,
destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod.
Her child was caught up to God and his throne.
The woman herself fled into the desert
where she had a place prepared by God.

Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:
�Now have salvation and power come,
and the Kingdom of our God
and the authority of his Anointed One.�
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 45:10, 11, 12, 16
Astitit regina a dextris tuis ornata auro ex Ophir.
R. The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.
The queen takes her place at your right hand in gold of Ophir.
R. The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.
Hear, O daughter, and see; turn your ear,
forget your people and your father�s house.
R. The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.
So shall the king desire your beauty;
for he is your lord.
R. The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.
They are borne in with gladness and joy;
they enter the palace of the king.
R. The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.
SECOND READING           1 Cor 15:20-27
Brothers and sisters:
Christ has been raised from the dead,
the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
For since death came through man,
the resurrection of the dead came also through man.
For just as in Adam all die,
so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,
but each one in proper order:
Christ the firstfruits;
then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ;
then comes the end,
when he hands over the Kingdom to his God and Father,
when he has destroyed every sovereignty
and every authority and power.
For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
The last enemy to be destroyed is death,
for �he subjected everything under his feet.�
ALLELUIA
Assumpta est Maria in caelum: gaudet exercitus angelorum.
Mary is taken up to heaven;
a chorus of angels exults
GOSPEL          Lk 1:39-56
Mary set out
and traveled to the hill country in haste
to a town of Judah,
where she entered the house of Zechariah
and greeted Elizabeth.
When Elizabeth heard Mary�s greeting,
the infant leaped in her womb,
and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit,
cried out in a loud voice and said,
�Blessed are you among women,
and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
And how does this happen to me,
that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears,
the infant in my womb leaped for joy.
Blessed are you who believed
that what was spoken to you by the Lord
would be fulfilled.�
And Mary said:

�My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior
for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed:
the Almighty has done great things for me
and holy is his Name.
He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm,
and has scattered the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty.
He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children forever.�

Mary remained with her about three months
and then returned to her home.
