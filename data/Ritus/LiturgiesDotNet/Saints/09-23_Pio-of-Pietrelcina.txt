SECOND READING
From the Second Vatican Council
(Presbyterorum Ordinis 3, 12)
The Vocation of Priests to the Life of Perfection
Priests are made in the likeness of Christ the Priest by the Sacrament
of Orders, so that they may, in collaboration with their bishops, work
for the building up and care of the Church which is the whole Body of
Christ, acting as ministers of him who is the Head. Like all other
Christians they have received in the sacrament of Baptism the symbol
and gift of such a calling and such grace that even in human weakness
they can and must seek for perfection, according to the exhortation of
Christ: "Be you therefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect"
(Mt 5:48). Priests are bound, however, to acquire that perfection in
special fashion. They have been consecrated by God in a new manner at
their ordination and made living instruments of Christ the Eternal
Priest that they may be able to carry on in time his marvelous work
whereby the entire family of man is again made whole by power from
above. Since, therefore, every priest in his own fashion acts in place
of Christ himself, he is enriched by a special grace, so that, as he
serves the flock committed to him and the entire People of God, he may
the better grow in the grace of him whose tasks he performs, because to
the weakness of our flesh there is brought the holiness of him who for
us was made a High Priest "holy, guiltless, undefiled not reckoned
among us sinners" (Heb 7:26).

Christ, whom the Father sanctified, consecrated and sent into the
world, "gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity
and cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuing good works"
(Titus 2:14), and thus through suffering entered into his glory. In
like fashion, priests consecrated by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
and sent by Christ must mortify the works of the flesh in themselves
and give themselves entirely to the service of men. It is in this way
that they can go forward in that holiness with which Christ endows them
to perfect man.

Hence, those who exercise the ministry of the spirit and of justice
will be confirmed in the life of the spirit, so long as they are open
to the Spirit of Christ, who gives them life and direction. By the
sacred actions which are theirs daily as well as by their entire
ministry which they share with the bishop and their fellow priests,
they are directed to perfection in their lives. Holiness does much for
priests in carrying on a fruitful ministry. Although divine grace could
use unworthy ministers to effect the work of salvation, yet for the
most part God chooses, to show forth his wonders, those who are more
open to the power and direction of the Holy Spirit, and who can by
reason of their close union with Christ and their holiness of life say
with St. Paul: "And yet I am alive; or rather, not I; it is Christ that
lives in me" (Gal 2:20).
RESPONSORY           1 Thessalonians 2:8; Galatians 4:19
I have longed to give you the Gospel,
and more than that, to give you my very life;
� you have become very dear to me.
My little children, I am like a mother giving birth to you,
until Christ is formed in you.
� You have become very dear to me.
