MASS

From the Common of Pastors: For a Pope
COLLECT
Praesta, quaesumus, Domine, ut martyrum tuorum iugiter merita
celebremus, quorum exstitit beatus Damasus papa cultor et amator.
Grant, we pray, O Lord,
that we may constantly exalt the merits of your Martyrs,
whom Pope Saint Damasus so venerated and loved.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Acts 20:17-18a,28-32,36
From Miletus Paul had the presbyters
of the Church at Ephesus summoned.
When they came to him, he addressed them,
"Keep watch over yourselves and over the whole flock
of which the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers,
in which you tend the Church of God
that he acquired with his own Blood.
I know that after my departure savage wolves will come among you,
and they will not spare the flock.
And from your own group,
men will come forward perverting the truth
to draw the disciples away after them.
So be vigilant and remember that for three years, night and day,
I unceasingly admonished each of you with tears.
And now I commend you to God
and to that gracious word of his that can build you up
and give you the inheritance among all who are consecrated."

When he had finished speaking
he knelt down and prayed with them all.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Psalm 110:1, 2, 3, 4
Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech.
R. (4b) You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORD said to my Lord:
"Sit at my right hand till I make your enemies your footstool."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The scepter of your power the LORD will stretch forth from Zion:
"Rule in the midst of your enemies."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
"Yours is princely power in the day of your birth,
in holy splendor; before the daystar, like the dew,
I have begotten you."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
The LORD has sworn, and he will not repent:
"You are a priest forever,
according to the order of Melchizedek."
R. You are a priest for ever, in the line of Melchizedek.
ALLELUIA           John 15:15b
Vos dixi amicos, dicit Dominus, quia omnia quae audivi a Patre meo,
nota feci vobis.
I call you my friends, says the Lord,
for I have made known to you all that the Father has told me.
GOSPEL          John 15:9-17
Jesus said to his disciples:
"As the Father loves me, so I also love you.
Remain in my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love,
just as I have kept my Father's commandments
and remain in his love.

"I have told you this so that my joy might be in you
and your joy might be complete.
This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
No one has greater love than this,
to lay down one's life for one's friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you slaves,
because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
I have called you friends,
because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you
and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,
so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
This I command you: love one another."

Damasus I

From the Common of Pastors; except the following

Office of Readings

The treatise of St Augustine against Faustus
We celebrate the martyrs with love and fellowship
We, the Christian community, assemble to celebrate the memory of the
martyrs with ritual solemnity because we want to be inspired to follow
their example, share in their merits, and be helped by their prayers.
Yet we erect no altars to any of the martyrs, even in the martyrs�
burial chapels themselves.
No bishop, when celebrating at an altar where these holy bodies rest,
has ever said, �Peter, we make this offering to you,� or �Paul, to
you,� or �Cyprian, to you.� No, what is offered is offered always to
God, who crowned the martyrs. We offer in the chapels where the bodies
of those he crowned rest, so the memories that cling to those places
will stir our emotions and encourage us to greater love both for the
martyrs whom we can imitate and for God whose grace enables us to do
so.
So we venerate the martyrs with the same veneration of love and
fellowship that we give to the holy men of God still with us. We sense
that the hearts of these latter are just as ready to suffer death for
the sake of the Gospel, and yet we feel more devotion toward those who
have already emerged victorious from the struggle. We honour those who
are fighting on the battlefield of this life here below, but we honour
more confidently those who have already achieved the victor�s crown and
live in heaven.
But the veneration strictly called �worship,� or latria, that is, the
special homage belonging only to the divinity, is something we give and
teach others to give to God alone. The offering of a sacrifice belongs
to worship in this sense (that is why those who sacrifice to idols are
called idol-worshippers), and we neither make nor tell others to make
any such offering to any martyr, any holy soul, or any angel. If anyone
among us falls into this error, he is corrected with words of sound
doctrine and must then either mend his ways or else be shunned.
The saints themselves forbid anyone to offer them the worship they know
is reserved for God, as is clear from the case of Paul and Barnabas.
When the Lycaonians were so amazed by their miracles that they wanted
to sacrifice to them as gods, the apostles tore their garments,
declared that they were not gods, urged the people to believe them, and
forbade them to worship them.
Yet the truths we teach are one thing, the abuses thrust upon us are
another. There are commandments that we are bound to give; there are
breaches of them that we are commanded to correct, but until we correct
them we must of necessity put up with them.
RESPONSORY          Psalm 116:15; 34:21; see Judith 10:3
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful ones;
- their very bones are dear to him,
not one of them shall be broken.
The Lord clothes them with gladness.
- Their very bones are dear to him,
not one of them shall be broken.
