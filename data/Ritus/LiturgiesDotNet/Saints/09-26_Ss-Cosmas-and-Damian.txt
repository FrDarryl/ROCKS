Magnificet te, Domine, sanctorum tuorum Cosmae et Damiani veneranda
memoria, quia et illis gloriam sempiternam, et opem nobis ineffabili
providentia contulisti.
May you be magnified, O Lord,
by the revered memory of your Saints Cosmas and Damian,
for with providence beyond words
you have conferred on them everlasting glory,
and on us, your unfailing help.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Wisdom 3:1-9
The souls of the just are in the hand of God,
and no torment shall touch them.
They seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead;
and their passing away was thought an affliction
and their going forth from us, utter destruction.
But they are in peace.
For if before men, indeed, they be punished,
yet is their hope full of immortality;
chastised a little, they shall be greatly blessed,
because God tried them
and found them worthy of himself.
As gold in the furnace, he proved them,
and as sacrificial offerings he took them to himself.
In the time of their visitation they shall shine,
and shall dart about as sparks through stubble;
they shall judge nations and rule over peoples,
and the LORD shall be their King forever.
Those who trust in him shall understand truth,
and the faithful shall abide with him in love:
because grace and mercy are with his holy ones,
and his care is with his elect.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Ps 126:1bc-2ab, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6
R. (5) Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion,
we were like men dreaming.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Then they said among the nations,
"The LORD has done great things for them."
The LORD has done great things for us;
we are glad indeed.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Restore our fortunes, O LORD,
like the torrents in the southern desert.
Those that sow in tears
shall reap rejoicing.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
Although they go forth weeping,
carrying the seed to be sown,
They shall come back rejoicing,
carrying their sheaves.
R. Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.
ALLELUIA          James 1:12
Blessed is the man who perseveres in temptation,
for when he has been proved he will receive the crown of life.
GOSPEL          Matthew 10:28-33
Jesus said to the Twelve:
�Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul;
rather, be afraid of the one who can destroy
both soul and body in Gehenna.
Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?
Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father�s
knowledge.
Even all the hairs of your head are counted.
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
Everyone who acknowledges me before others
I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.
But whoever denies me before others,
I will deny before my heavenly Father.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
In tuorum, Domine, pretiosa morte iustorum, sacrificium illud
offerimus, de quo martyrium sumpsit omne principium.
In honor of the precious death of your just ones, O Lord,
we come to offer that sacrifice
from which all martyrdom draws its origin.
Through Christ our Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Conserva in nobis, Domine, munus tuum, et quod, te donante, pro
commemoratione beatorum martyrum Cosmae et Damiani percepimus, salutem
nobis praestet et pacem.
Preserve in us your gift, O Lord,
and may what we have received at your hands
as we commemorate the Martyrs Saints Cosmas and Damian,
bring us healing, salvation and peace.
Through Christ our Lord.

SECOND READING
From a Sermon by Saint Augustine, Bishop
(Sermo 329,1-2 PL 38, 1454-1455)
The martyrs' death was bought by the death of Christ and it is precious
in his sight
In the glorious deeds of the holy martyrs who everywhere adorn the
Church, we verify the truth of what we have been singing: Precious in
the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. They are precious in
our sight and in the sight of him in whose name it was done. The price
paid for these deaths was the death of one man. How many deaths indeed
this one man bought by dying, for if he had not died, the grain of
wheat would not have been multiplied! You have heard what he said as he
drew near to his passion, our redemption: If the grain of wheat does
not fall to the ground and die, it remains barren, but if it dies, it
is very fruitful. On the cross Christ effected a great exchange. There
the purse containing the price to be paid for us was opened. When the
soldier's lance cut its way into his side, the price paid for the whole
world flowed forth. The martyrs and all the faithful were bought with
it, but the faith of the martyrs was also tested: their blood bore
witness to their faith. They gave back what had been paid for them and
lived up to what Saint John says: As Christ laid down his life for us,
so we should lay down our lives for our brothers. Elsewhere we read:
You have taken your seat at the great table; consider carefully what is
set before you, for you must prepare the same in return. The great
table is the one at which the Lord of the banquet is himself the food.
No one feeds the guests with his very self, yet that is what Christ the
Lord does. He invites and he is the food and drink. The martyrs took
careful note of what they ate and drank, so that they might return the
same. But how could they return the same unless the one who had first
given it, gave them also the means of making a return? What shall I
give back to the Lord for all that he has given me? I shall take the
cup of salvation. What cup is that? The bitter and saving cup of
suffering, the cup the sick man would be afraid to put to his lips
unless the doctor had drunk of it first. That is the cup meant here,
and we find Christ himself speaking of it: Father, if possible, let
this cup pass away from me. Of it the martyrs said: I shall take the
cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord. Are you not afraid
that you may fail the test? But why should you be? I shall call upon
the name of the Lord. How else did the martyrs overcome, except that in
them he overcame who said: Rejoice, for I have overcome the world? The
Lord of heaven directed their minds and tongues; through them he
overcame the devil on earth and crowned them as martyrs in heaven.
Happy are they who have thus drunk of this cup, for their suffering is
over, and they have received their honors.
RESPONSORY          See Ephesians 4:4-5
These holy men poured out their blood for the Lord;
they loved Christ in life; they followed him in death.
- They have won the glorious crown.
They shared the one Spirit;
the held fast to one faith.
- They have won the glorious crown.
