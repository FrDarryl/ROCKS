ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Sir 44:15,14
Sapientiam Sanctorum narrent populi, et laudes eorum nuntiet Ecclesia;
nomina autem eorum vivent in saeculum saeculi.
Let the peoples recount the wisdom of the Saints,
and let the Church proclaim their praise.
Their names will live on and on.
COLLECT
Deus, qui Ecclesiam tuam beatorum episcoporum Basilii et Gregorii
exemplis et doctrinis dignatus es illustrare, concede, quaesumus, ut
tuam discamus in humilitate veritatem et eam in caritate fideliter
operemur.
O God, who were pleased to give light to your Church
by the example and teaching
of the Bishops Saints Basil and Gregory,
grant, we pray,
that in humility we may learn your truth
and practice it faithfully in charity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Ephesians 4:1-7, 11-13
I, a prisoner for the Lord,
urge you to live in a manner worthy of the call you have received,
with all humility and gentleness, with patience,
bearing with one another through love,
striving to preserve the unity of the Spirit
through the bond of peace:
one Body and one Spirit,
as you were also called to the one hope of your call;
one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
one God and Father of all,
who is over all and through all and in all.
But grace was given to each of us
according to the measure of Christ's gift.
And he gave some as Apostles, others as prophets,
others as evangelists, others as pastors and teachers,
to equip the holy ones for the work of ministry,
for building up the Body of Christ,
until we all attain to the unity of faith
and knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,
to the extent of the full stature of Christ.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           23:1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6
Dominus pascit me, et nihil mihi deerit.
R. (1) The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
In verdant pastures he gives me repose.
Beside restful waters he leads me;
he refreshes my soul.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
He guides me in right paths
for his name�s sake.
Even though I walk in the dark valley
I fear no evil; for you are at my side
With your rod and your staff
that give me courage.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
You spread the table before me
in the sight of my foes;
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
Only goodness and kindness follow me
all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD
for years to come.
R. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.
ALLELUIA          Matt 23:9b, 10b
Unus est Pater vester, caelis est; magister vester unus est Christus.
You have but one Father in heaven
and one master, the Christ.
GOSPEL          Matthew 23:8-12
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples:
"Do not be called �Rabbi.�
You have but one teacher, and you are all brothers.
Call no one on earth your father,
you have but one Father in heaven.
Do not be called 'Master';
you have but one master, the Christ.
The greatest among you must be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled;
but whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Suscipe, quaesumus, Domine, hoc sacrificium populi tui, ut, quod tibi
in honore beatorum Basilii et Gregorii offertur ad gloriam, nobis
tribuas ad salutem perpetuam.

Basilii et Gregorii celebrantibus supernas vires firmet et augeat, ut

Liturgy of the Hours
Basil the Great and Gregory Nazianzen

From the Common of Pastors: for several pastors or from the
Common of Doctors, except the following:
Office of Readings
From a sermon by Saint Gregory Nazianzen, bishop
(Oratio 43, in laudem Basilii Magni, 15. 16-17, 19-21; PG 36, 514-423)

Two bodies, but a single spirit

Basil and I were both in Athens. We had come, like streams of a river,
from the same source in our native land, had separated from each other
in pursuit of learning, and were now united again as if by plan, for
God so arranged it.

I was not alone at that time in my regard for my friend, the great
Basil. I knew his irreproachable conduct, and the maturity and wisdom
of his conversation. I sought to persuade others, to whom he was less
well known, to have the same regard for him. Many fell immediately
under his spell, for they had already heard of him by reputation and
hearsay.

What was the outcome? Almost alone of those who had come to Athens to
study he was exempted from the customary ceremonies of initiation for
he was held in higher honor that his status as a first-year student
seemed to warrant.

Such was the prelude to our friendship, the kindling of that flame that
was to bind us together. In this way we began to feel affection for
each other. When, in the course of time, we acknowledged our friendship
and recognized that our ambition was a life of true wisdom, we became
everything to each other: we shared the same lodging, the same table,
the same desires, the same goal. Our love for each other grew daily
warmer and deeper.

The same hope inspired us: the pursuit of learning. This is an ambition
especially subject to envy. Yet between us there was no envy. On the
contrary, we made capital out of our rivalry. Our rivalry consisted,
not in seeking the first place for oneself but in yielding it to the
other, for we each looked on the other�s success as his own.

We seemed to be two bodies with a single spirit. Though we cannot
believe those who claim that �everything is contained in everything,�
yet you must believe that in our case each of us was in the other and
with the other.

Our single object and ambition was virtue, and a life of hope in the
blessings that are to come; we wanted to withdraw from this world
before we departed from it. With this end in view we ordered our lives
and all our actions. We followed the guidance of God�s law and spurred
each other on to virtue. If it is not too boastful to say, we found in
each other a standard and rule for discerning right from wrong.

Different men have different names, which they owe to their parents or
to themselves, that is, to their own pursuits and achievements. But our
great pursuit, the great name we wanted, was to be Christians, to be
called Christians.
RESPONSORY          Sirach 47:8, 9, 10
The Lord gives wisdom to the wise
and knowledge to those who have understanding.
- He reveals what is deep and hidden;
all light has its source in him.
One and the same Spirit is at work in all,
and he gives to each as he wills.
- He reveals what is deep and hidden;
all light has its source in him.
COLLECT
O God, who were pleased to give light to your Church
by the example and teaching
of the Bishops Saints Basil and Gregory,
grant, we pray,
that in humility we may learn your truth
and practice it faithfully in charity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
