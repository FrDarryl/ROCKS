for the Memorial of
Saint Charles Borromeo
Bishop

From the Common of Pastors: For a Bishop.
COLLECT
Custodi, quaesumus, Domine, in populo tuo spiritum, quo beatum Carolum
episcopum implevisti, ut Ecclesia indesinenter renovetur, et, Christi
se imagini conformans, ipsius vultum mundo valeat ostendere.
Preserve in the midst of your people,
we ask, O Lord, the spirit with which you filled
the Bishop Saint Charles Borromeo,
that your Church may be constantly renewed
and, by conforming herself to the likeness of Christ,
may show his face to the world.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Romans 12:3-13
Brothers and sisters:
By the grace given to me I tell everyone among you
not to think of himself more highly than one ought to think,
but to think soberly,
each according to the measure of faith that God has apportioned.
For as in one body we have many parts,
and all the parts do not have the same function,
so we, though many, are one Body in Christ
and individually parts of one another.
Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us,
let us exercise them:
if prophecy, in proportion to the faith;
if ministry, in ministering;
if one is a teacher, in teaching;
if one exhorts, in exhortation;
if one contributes, in generosity;
if one is over others, with diligence;
if one does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.

Let love be sincere;
hate what is evil,
hold on to what is good;
love one another with mutual affection;
anticipate one another in showing honor.
Do not grow slack in zeal,
be fervent in spirit,
serve the Lord.
Rejoice in hope,
endure in affliction,
persevere in prayer.
Contribute to the needs of the holy ones,
exercise hospitality.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM Ps 89:2-3, 4-5, 21-22, 25 and 27
Misericordias tuas, Domine, in aeternum cantabo.
R. (2) For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
The favors of the LORD I will sing forever;
through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.
For you have said, "My kindness is established forever";
in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
I have made a covenant with my chosen one,
I have sworn to David my servant:
Forever will I confirm your posterity
and establish your throne for all generations."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"I have found David, my servant;
with my holy oil I have anointed him,
That my hand may be always with him,
and that my arm may make him strong."
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
"My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,
and through my name shall his horn be exalted.
He shall say of me, 'You are my father,
my God, the Rock, my savior."'
R. For ever I will sing the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Mk 1:17
Venite post me, dicit Dominus, et faciam vos fieri piscatores hominum.
Come after me, says the Lord,
and I will make you fishers of men.
GOSPEL          John 10:11-16
Jesus said:
"I am the good shepherd.
good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
The hired man, who is not a shepherd
and whose sheep are not his own,
sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away,
and the wolf catches and scatters them.
This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd,
and I know mine and mine know me,
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father;
and I will lay down my life for the sheep.
I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold.
These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice,
and there will be one flock, one shepherd."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Intende munera, Domine, altaribus tuis pro beati Caroli commemoratione
proposita, et huius sacrificii virtute concede, ut, sicut illum
pastoralis officii vigilantia et praeclaris virtutum meritis
sublimasti, ita nos facias sinceris operum fructibus abundare.
Look, O Lord, upon the offering placed on your altar
in commemoration of Saint Charles,
and grant by the power of this sacrifice
that, as you made him an attentive pastor,
outstanding in the merit of his virtues,
so you may make us abound in good fruit by our works.
Through Christ our Lord.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Praestent nobis, quaesumus, Domine, sacra mysteria quae sumpsimus eam
animi fortitudinem, quae beatum Carolum reddidit in ministerio fidelem
et in caritate ferventem.
May the sacred mysteries of which we have partaken,
O Lord, we pray, give us that determination
which made Saint Charles faithful in ministry
and fervent in charity.
Through Christ our Lord.

Liturgy of the Hours

From the Common of Pastors, except the following:

Office of Readings

From a sermon given during the last synod he attended, by Saint
Charles, bishop
(Acta Ecclesiae Mediolanensis 1599, 1177-1178)
Practice what you preach
I admit that we are all weak, but if we want help, the Lord God has
given us the means to find it easily. One priest may wish to lead a
good, holy life, as he knows he should. He may wish to be chaste and to
reflect heavenly virtues in the way he lives. Yet he does not resolve
to use suitable means, such as penance, prayer, the avoidance of evil
discussions and harmful and dangerous friendships. Another priest
complains that as soon as he comes into church to pray the office or to
celebrate Mass, a thousand thoughts fill his mind and distract him from
God. But what was he doing in the sacristy before he came out for the
office or for Mass? How did he prepare? What means did he use to
collect his thoughts and to remain recollected?
Would you like me to teach you how to grow from virtue to virtue and
how, if you are already recollected at prayer, you can be even more
attentive next time, and so give God more pleasing worship? Listen, and
I will tell you. If a tiny spark of God�s love already burns within
you, do not expose it to the wind, for it may get blown out. Keep the
stove tightly shut so that it will not lose its heat and grow cold. In
other words, avoid distractions as well as you can. Stay quiet with
God. Do not spend your time in useless chatter.
If teaching and preaching is your job, then study diligently and apply
yourself to whatever is necessary for doing the job well. Be sure that
you first preach by the way you live. If you do not, people will notice
that you say one thing, but live otherwise, and your words will bring
only cynical laughter and a derisive shake of the head.
Are you in charge of a parish? If so, do not neglect the parish of your
own soul, do not give yourself to others so completely that you have
nothing left for yourself. You have to be mindful of your people
without becoming forgetful of yourself.
My brothers, you must realise that for us churchmen nothing is more
necessary than meditation. We must meditate before, during and after
everything we do. The prophet says: "I will pray, and then I will
understand." When you administer the sacraments, meditate on what you
are doing. When you celebrate Mass, reflect on the sacrifice you are
offering. When you pray the office, think about the words you are
saying and the Lord to whom you are speaking. When you take care of
your people, meditate on how the Lord�s blood that has washed them
clean so that "all that you do becomes a work of love."
This is the way we can easily overcome the countless difficulties we
have to face day after day, which, after all, are part of our work: in
meditation we find the strength to bring Christ to birth in ourselves
and in other men.
RESPONSORY
Seek after integrity and holiness, faith and love, patience and
gentleness.
- These are the things you must command and teach;
be an example to all who believe.
If you give them this advice,
you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus.
- These are the things you must command and teach;
be an example to all who believe.
