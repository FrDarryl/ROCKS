MASS

ENTRANCE ANTIPHON          Cf. Lk 10: 38
Intravit Iesus in quoddam castellum, et mulier quaedam Martha nomine
excepit illum in domum suam.
Jesus entered a village,
where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
COLLECT
Deus, cuius Filius de sepulcro ad vitam Lazarum revocavit, et in domo
Marthae dignatus est hospitari, da nobis, quaesumus, ut ipsi in
fratribus nostris fideliter ministrantes, cum Maria verbi eius
meditatione pasci mereamur. Qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate
Spiritus Sancti, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.
Heavenly Father,
your Son called Lazarus from the grave
and sat at table in the house of Bethany.
May we serve him faithfully in our brethren
and with Mary ponder and feed upon his Word.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          1 John 4:7-16
Beloved, let us love one another,
because love is of God;
everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God.
Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.
In this way the love of God was revealed to us:
God sent his only-begotten Son into the world
so that we might have life through him.
In this is love:
not that we have loved God, but that he loved us
and sent his Son as expiation for our sins.
Beloved, if God so loved us,
we also must love one another.
No one has ever seen God.
Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us,
and his love is brought to perfection in us.

This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us,
that he has given us of his Spirit.
Moreover, we have seen and testify
that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world.
Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,
God remains in him and he in God.
We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us.

God is love, and whoever remains in love
remains in God and God in him.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM           34:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11
Gustate et videte quoniam suavis est Dominus.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
I will bless the LORD at all times;
praise shall be always in my mouth.
My soul will glory in the LORD
that the poor may hear and be glad.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
Magnify the LORD with me;
let us exalt his name together.
I sought the LORD, who answered me,
delivered me from all my fears.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
Look to God that you may be radiant with joy
and your faces may not blush for shame.
In my misfortune I called,
the LORD heard and saved me from all distress.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
The angel of the LORD, who encamps with them,
delivers all who fear God.
Learn to savor how good the LORD is;
happy are those who take refuge in him.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
Fear the LORD, you holy ones;
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.
The powerful grow poor and hungry,
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
R. Taste and see the goodness of the Lord.
ALLELUIA          Matthew 5:10
Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, quoniam ipsorum
est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness;
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          John 11:19-27 or Luke 10:38:42
(The Gospel for this memorial is proper)
Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary
to comfort them about their brother [Lazarus, who had died].
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,
she went to meet him; but Mary sat at home.
Martha said to Jesus,
"Lord, if you had been here,
my brother would not have died.
But even now I know that whatever you ask of God,
God will give you." Jesus said to her,
"Your brother will rise."
Martha said to him,
"I know he will rise,
in the resurrection on the last day."
Jesus told her,
"I am the resurrection and the life;
whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live,
and anyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
Do you believe this?"
She said to him, "Yes, Lord.
I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God,
the one who is coming into the world."
Or:
GOSPEL          Luke 10:38-42
Jesus entered a village
where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him.
She had a sister named Mary
who sat beside the Lord at his feet listening to him speak.
Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said,
�Lord, do you not care
that my sister has left me by myself to do the serving?
Tell her to help me.�
The Lord said to her in reply,
�Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things.
There is need of only one thing.
Mary has chosen the better part
and it will not be taken from her.�
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
In beata tuis te, Domine, mirabilem praedicantes, maiestatem tuam
suppliciter exoramus, ut, sicut eorum tibi gratum exstitit caritatis
obsequium, sic nostrae servitutis accepta reddantur officia.
As we proclaim your wonders in your saints, O Lord,
we humbly implore your majesty,
that, as their homage of love was pleasing to you,
so, too, our dutiful service may find favor in your sight.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          John 11:27
Dixit Martha ad Iesum: Tu es Christus, Filius Dei vivi, qui in hunc
mundum venisti.
Martha said to Jesus:
You are the Christ, the Son of God,
who is coming into this world.
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Corporis et Sanguinis Unigeniti tui sacra perceptio, Domine, ab omnibus
nos caducis rebus avertat, ut, exemplo beatae Marthae, Mariae, at
Lazari, valeamus tibi et sincera in terris caritate proficere, et tui
perpetua in caelis visione gaudere.
May the holy reception of the Body and Blood
of your Only Begotten Son, O Lord,
turn us away from the cares of this fallen world,
so that, following the example of Saints Martha, Mary, and Lazarus
we may grow in sincere love for you on earth
and rejoice to behold you for eternity in heaven.
Through Christ our Lord.

From the Common of Holy Women, except the following:

Morning Prayer

HYMN
Quas tibi laudes ferimusque vota,
nos tuis possint meritis iuvare,
Martha, quam mire sibi corde iungit
Christo amico.

Te frequens visit Dominus tuaque
in domo degit placida quiete
ac tuis verbis studiisque laetans
teque ministra.

Tu prior fratrem quereris perisse,
cumque Maria lacrimata multum,
aspicis vitre subita Magistri
voce redire.

Quae fide prompta stabilem fateris
spem resurgendi, Domino probante,
impetra nobis cupide in perenne
pergere regnum.

Flamini Sancto parilis potestas,
gl6riam quorum petimus per aevum
cernere tecum. Amen.

HYMN, as in the Office of Readings
MAGNIFICAT (Canticle of Mary)
Antiphon:
Diligebat lesus Martham et sororem eius Mariam et Lazarum fratrem eius.
Jesus loved Martha and Mary and their brother Lazarus.

From the Office of Readings

HYMN
Te gratulantes pangimus,
Martha, cum tuis fratribus,
quae meruisti saepius
Christum domi recipere.

Tantum libenter hospitem
curis ornabas sedulis,
in plurima sollicita
amoris dulci stimulo.

Pascis dum laeta Dominum,
Maria atque Lazarus
possunt ab illo gratiae
vitaeque cibum sumere.

Capturo mortis tramitem
dante sorore aromata,
extremi tu servitii
vigil donasti munera.

Iesu felices hospites,
corda nostra accendite,
ut illi gratae iugiter
sint sedes amicitiae.

Sit Trinitati gloria,
quae nos in domum caelicam
admitti tandem tribuat
vobiscum laudes canere. Amen.
SECOND READING
From a sermon by St. Bernard, abbot
(Sermo 3 in Assumptione beatae Mariae Virginis, 4. 5: PL 183, 423. 424)
(This translation has been taken from Buckets, Wells, and Aqueducts)

Let us consider, brothers, how in this our home the hierarchy of love
has distrubuted three offices: government to Martha, contemplation to
Mary, repentance to Lazarus. Any soul that is perfect has all three at
once. Particular things, however, seem to belong more to particular
persons, so that some keep themselves free for holy contemplation, some
are given to fraternal government, some recall their own years in
bitterness of soul, like wounded men sleeping among graves. So it is
necessary that Mary think reverently and lofitily about her God, Martha
kindly and mercifully about her neighbor, Lazarus wretchedly and humbly
about himself. Let each be concerned with his own degree. If there is
found in this city, a Noah, a Daniel, a Job; they themselves will be
delivered in their righteousness, says the Lord, but they will not save
daughter or son (Ezekiel 14:14-16).

We flatter no one�and, oh, that none of you would delude yourselves!
For those to whom no steweardship, no government has been committed
should either come to rest completely at the feet of Jesus with Mary,
or with Lazarus in the walls of his grave. Why should not Martha be
upset over many things, when her concern is for many persons? But for
you who are not burdened with this necessity, only one of two things is
needful: Either be thoroughly untroubled and delight in the Lord, or,
if you cannot do so yet, then do not be upset over many things but, as
the prophet says, over yourself (Psalm 51:7).

I say it again, lest anyone plead the excuse of ignorance. You,
brother�who have no call to build or steer a Noah's Ark among the flood
waves�should either be a man of desires as Daniel was or, with blessed
Job, a man of sorrow and acquainted with infirmity. Or else I fear that
He may spew you out�lukewarm and nauseating�from His mouth, when He
wants to find you either white-hot with the thought of Him and blazing
with the flame of love, or with that one thought of Him ice-cold and
plunging the fiery darts of the devil in the water of remorse.

But it is necessary that Martha herself also be warned: a special audit
is applied to stewards, to discover which ones are found faithful. He
will be faithful, if he neither seek his own gain but that of Jesus
Christ�that his intention may be pure�nor do his own will but the
Lord's, that his actions may be well-ordered. For there are some whose
eye is not single, and they receive their reward. There are those who
are borne about on the motions of their own hearts, and all things that
they offer are contaminated, yes, since their will is found out within
them.

Now come with me to the wedding song of Solomon, and consider how the
Bridegroom, when He calls his bride, has left out none of these three,
nor added anything to them. Rise, He says, hasten, my love, my lovely
one, my dove�and come. Is not His love she who, intent on the riches of
her Lord, faithfully offers her very soul to Him as well? Whenever she
leaves her spiritual study for the least of these, so often she
spiritually offers her soul to Him. And is she not His lovely one, who,
gazing on the glory of the Lord with face unveiled, is transformed from
radiance to radiance into His very image, as though by the Spirit of
the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18)? And is not His dove she who mourns and
moans in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall (Song
of Songs 2:14), as though buried under a stone?
