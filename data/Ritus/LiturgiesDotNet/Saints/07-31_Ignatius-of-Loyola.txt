Brothers and sisters:
Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do,
do everything for the glory of God.
Avoid giving offense,
whether to Jews or Greeks or the Church of God,
just as I try to please everyone in every way,
not seeking my own benefit but that of the many,
that they may be saved.
Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.

In my misfortune I called,
the LORD heard and saved me from all distress.

The angel of the LORD, who encamps with them,
delivers all who fear God.

Fear the LORD, you holy ones;
nothing is lacking to those who fear him.
The powerful grow poor and hungry,
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.

ALLELUIA          Mt 5:3
Beati pauperes spiritu, quoniam ipsorum est regnum caelorum.
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs in the kingdom of heaven.
GOSPEL          Luke 14:25-33
Great crowds were traveling with Jesus,
and he turned and addressed them,
"If anyone comes to me without hating his father and mother,
wife and children, brothers and sisters,
and even his own life,
he cannot be my disciple.
Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me
cannot be my disciple.
Which of you wishing to construct a tower
does not first sit down and calculate the cost
to see if there is enough for its completion?
Otherwise, after laying the foundation
and finding himself unable to finish the work
the onlookers should laugh at him and say,
`This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish.'
Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down
and decide whether with ten thousand troops
he can successfully oppose another king
advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops?
But if not, while he is still far away,
he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms.
In the same way,
everyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions
cannot be my disciple."
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Placeant, Domine Deus, oblationes in celebratione beati Ignatii tibi
delatae, et praesta, ut sacrosancta mysteria, in quibus omnis
sanctitatis fontem constituisti, nos quoque in veritate sanctificent.
May these offerings we make to you
as we celebrate Saint Ignatius
be pleasing, Lord God,
and grant that the sacred mysteries,
which you have made the fount of all holiness,
may sanctify us, too, in the truth.
Through Christ our Lord.
COMMUNION ANTIPHON          Cf. Lk 12: 49
Dicit Dominus: Ignem veni mittere in terram, et quid volo, nisi ut
accendatur?
Thus says the Lord: I have come to cast fire on the earth,
and how I wish that it were kindled!
PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION
Laudis hostia, Domine, quam pro beato Ignatio gratias agentes
obtulimus, ad perpetuam nos maiestatis tuae laudationem perducat.
May the sacrifice of praise
that we have offered with thanksgiving
in honor of Saint Ignatius, O Lord,
bring us to exalt your majesty without end.
Through Christ our Lord.

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From the life of Saint Ignatius from his own words by Luis Gonzalez
(Cap 1, 5-9: Acta Sanctorum, Julii, 7[ 1868], 647)
Put inward experiences to the test to see if they come from God
Ignatius was passionately fond of reading worldly books of fiction and
tales of knight-errantry. When he felt he was getting better, he asked
for some of these books to pass the time. But no book of that sort
could be found in the house; instead they gave him a life of Christ and
a collection of the lives of saints written in Spanish.
By constantly reading these books he began to be attracted to what he
found narrated there. Sometimes in the midst of his reading he would
reflect on what he had read. Yet at other times he would dwell on many
of the things which he had been accustomed to dwell on previously. But
at this point our Lord came to his assistance, insuring that these
thoughts were followed by others which arose from his current reading.
While reading the life of Christ our Lord or the lives of the saints,
he would reflect and reason with himself: �What if I should do what
Saint Francis or Saint Dominic did?� In this way he let his mind dwell
on many thoughts; they lasted a while until other things took their
place. Then those vain and worldly images would come into his mind and
remain a long time. This sequence of thoughts persisted with him for a
long time.
But there was a difference. When Ignatius reflected on worldly
thoughts, he felt intense pleasure; but when he gave them up out of
weariness, he felt dry and depressed. Yet when he thought of living the
rigorous sort of life he knew the saints had lived, he not only
experienced pleasure when he actually thought about it, but even after
he dismissed these thoughts, he still experienced great joy. Yet he did
not pay attention to this, nor did he appreciate it until one day, in a
moment of insight, he began to marvel at the difference. Then he
understood his experience: thoughts of one kind left him sad, the
others full of joy. And this was the first time he applied a process of
reasoning to his religious experience. Later on, when he began to
formulate his spiritual exercises, he used this experience as an
illustration to explain the doctrine he taught his disciples on the
discernment of spirits.
RESPONSORY          1 Peter 4:11,8
Whoever speaks should proclaim God's message;
whoever ministers should serve by the power that God gives,
- so that in all of you God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.
Before all else be constant in your love for one another.
- So that in all of you God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.
