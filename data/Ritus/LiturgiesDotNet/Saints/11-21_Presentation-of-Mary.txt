COLLECT
Sanctissimae venerantibus Virginis Mariae memoriam gloriosam, ipsius
nobis, quaesumus, Domine, intercessione concede, ut de plenitudine
gratiae tuae nos quoque mereamur accipere.
As we venerate the glorious memory
of the most holy Virgin Mary,
grant, we pray, O Lord, through her intercession,
that we, too, may merit to receive
from the fullness of your grace.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING          Zechariah 2:14-17 (2:10-13 RSV)
Sing and rejoice, O daughter Zion!
See, I am coming to dwell among you, says the LORD.
Many nations shall join themselves to the LORD on that day,
and they shall be his people,
and he will dwell among you,
and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
The LORD will possess Judah as his portion in the holy land,
and he will again choose Jerusalem.
Silence, all mankind, in the presence of the LORD!
He stirs forth from his holy dwelling.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          Luke 1:46-47, 48-49, 50-51, 52-53, 54-55
R./ The Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.
or:
R./ O blessed Virgin Mary, you carried the Son of the eternal Father.
"My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior."
R./
"For he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
From this day all generations will call me blessed.
The Almighty has done great things for me,
holy is his Name."
R./
"He has mercy on those who fear him
in every generation.
He has shown the strength of his arm,
he has scattered the proud in their conceit."
R./
"He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty."
R./
"He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children forever."
R./
ALLELUIA          John 13:34
Blessed are you, holy Virgin Mary, deserving of all praise;
from you rose the sun of justice, Christ our God.
GOSPEL          Matthew 12:46-50
While Jesus was speaking to the crowds,
his mother and his brothers appeared outside,
wishing to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside,
asking to speak with you."
But he said in reply to the one who told him,
"Who is my mother?
Who are my brothers?"
And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said,
"Here are my mother and my brothers.
For whoever does the will of my heavenly Father
is my brother, and sister, and mother."
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY I
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
and to praise, bless, and glorify your name
on the feast day of the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary.

For by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit
she conceived your Only Begotten Son,
and without losing the glory of virginity,
brought forth into the world the eternal Light,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven
and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in humble praise, as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
Or:
PREFACE OF THE VIRGIN MARY II
It is truly right and just,
our duty and our salvation,
to praise your mighty deeds
in the exaltation of all the Saints,
and especially, as we celebrate
the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
to proclaim your kindness
as we echo her thankful hymn of praise.

For truly even to the earth's ends
you have done great things
and extended your abundant mercy from age to age:
when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid,
you gave us through her the author of our salvation,
your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray,
join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise,
as we acclaim:

Holy, Holy, Holy...
