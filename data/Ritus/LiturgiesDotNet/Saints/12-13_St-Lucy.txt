FIRST READING          2 Corinthians 10:17-11:2
Brothers and sisters:
"Whoever boasts, should boast in the Lord."
For it is not the one who recommends himself who is approved,
but the one whom the Lord recommends.
If only you would put up with a little foolishness from me!
Please put up with me.
For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God,
since I betrothed you to one husband
to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          31:3-4, 6, 7, 8, 17, 21
R./ Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
Incline your ear to me; make haste to rescue me!
Be my rock of refuge, a stronghold to save me.
You are my rock and my fortress;
for your name's sake lead and guide me.
R./ Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
Into your hands I commend my spirit;
you will redeem me, LORD, faithful God.
R./ Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
You hate those who serve worthless idols,
but I trust in the LORD
R./ Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
I will rejoice and be glad in your love,
once you have seen my misery, observed my distress.
R./ Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
Let your face shine on your servant;
save me in your kindness.
R./ Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
You hide us in the shelter of your presence,
safe from scheming enemies.
You keep us in your abode,
safe from plotting tongues.
R./ Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.
GOSPEL          Matthew 25:1-13
Jesus told his disciples this parable:
"The Kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins
who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
The foolish ones, when taking their lamps,
brought no oil with them,
but the wise brought flasks of oil with their lamps.
Since the bridegroom was long delayed,
they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
At midnight, there was a cry,
'Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'
Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise,
'Give us some of your oil,
for our lamps are going out.'
But the wise ones replied,
'No, for there may not be enough for us and you.
Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.'
While they went off to buy it,
the bridegroom came
and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him.
Then the door was locked.
Afterwards the other virgins came and said,
'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'
But he said in reply,
'Amen, I say to you, I do not know you.'
Therefore, stay awake,
for you know neither the day nor the hour."

Office of Readings

SECOND READING
From a book on virginity by St Ambrose, bishop
(Cap. 12, 68, 74-75; 13, 77-78: PL 16 [edit. 1845] 281, 283, 285-286)
You light up your grace of body with the radiance of your mind
You are one of God�s people, of God�s family, a virgin among virgins;
you light up your grace of body with your splendour of soul. More than
others you can be compared to the Church. When you are in your room,
then, at night, think always on Christ, and wait for his coming at
every moment.
This is the person Christ has loved in loving you, the person he has
chosen in choosing you. He enters by the open door; he has promised to
come in, and he cannot deceive. Embrace him, the one you have sought;
turn to him, and be enlightened; hold him fast, ask him not to go in
haste, beg him not to leave you. The Word of God moves swiftly; he is
not won by the lukewarm, nor held fast by the negligent. Let your soul
be attentive to his word; follow carefully the path God tells you to
take, for he is swift in his passing.
What does his bride say? I sought him, and did not find him; I called
him, and he did not hear me. Do not imagine that you are displeasing to
him although you have called him, asked him opened the door to him, and
that this is the reason why he has gone so quickly; no, for he allows
us to be constantly tested. When the crowds pressed him to stay, what
does he say in the Gospel? I must preach the word of God to other
cities, because for that I have been sent. But even if it seems to you
that he has left you, go out and seek him once more.
Who but holy Church is to teach you how to hold Christ fast? Indeed,
she has already taught you, if you only understood her words in
Scripture: How short a time it was when I left them before I found him
whom my soul has loved. I held him fast, and I will not let him go.
How do we hold him fast? Not by restraining chains or knotted ropes but
by bonds of love, by spiritual reins, by the longing of the soul.
If you also, like the bride, wish to hold him fast, seek him and be
fearless of suffering. It is often easier to find him in the midst of
bodily torments, in the very hands of persecutors.
His bride says: How short a time it was after I left them. In a little
space, after a brief moment, when you have escaped from the hands of
your persecutors without yielding to the powers of this world, Christ
will come to you, and he will not allow you to be tested for long.
Whoever seeks Christ in this way, and finds him, can say: I held him
fast, and I will not let him go before I bring him into my mother�s
house, into the room of her who conceived me. What is this �house�,
this �room�, but the deep and secret places of your heart?
Maintain this house, sweep out its secret recesses until it becomes
immaculate and rises as a spiritual temple for a holy priesthood,
firmly secured by Christ, the cornerstone, so that the Holy Spirit may
dwell in it.
Whoever seeks Christ in this way, whoever prays to Christ in this way,
is not abandoned by him; on the contrary, Christ comes again and again
to visit such a person, for he is with us until the end of the world.
RESPONSORY
The grace of the Lord gave her strength in the battle,
and she was glorified before God and man.
In the presence of the prince she spoke with wisdom,
-   and therefore the Lord of heaven and earth has loved her.
She is the virgin
who prepared a joyful home for God in her heart.
-   And therefore the Lord of heaven and earth has loved her.
COLLECT
