1. Ordinary Time contains thirty-three or thirty-four weeks. It begins
on the Monday following the Sunday after January 6 and continues until
the beginning of Lent; it begins again on the Monday after Pentecost
Sunday and ends on the Saturday before the First Sunday of Advent.

2. The numbering of Sundays and weeks in Ordinary Time is calculated as
follows:

a) The Sunday on which the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord occurs
takes the place of the first Sunday in Ordinary Time; the week that
follows is counted as the first week in Ordinary Time. The remaining
Sundays and weeks are numbered in order until the beginning of Lent.

b) If there are thirty-four weeks in Ordinary Time, after Pentecost the
series is resumed with the week that follows immediately the last week
celebrated before Lent; it should be noted, however, that the Masses of
Pentecost Sunday and of the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity take the
place of the Sunday Masses. If, however, there are thirtythree weeks in
Ordinary Time, the first week that would otherwise follow Pentecost is
omitted.

3. Thus, in the Missal, thirty-four Masses for the Sundays and weekdays
in Ordinary Time are found. They are used in this way:

a) On Sundays the Mass corresponding to the number of the Sunday in
Ordinary Time is ordinarily used, unless there occurs a Solemnity or a
Feast of the Lord which takes the place of the Sunday.

b) On weekdays, however, any of the thirty-four Masses may be used,
provided the pastoral needs of the faithful are taken into
consideration.

4. The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) and the Creed
are said on Sundays, Solemnities and major feast days; on other
weekdays, however, both are omitted.

5. Unless a Eucharistic Prayer is used that has a proper Preface, on
Sundays one of the Prefaces for Sundays in Ordinary Time is said;
but on weekdays, a Common Preface is said.

6. Two antiphons are provided for Communion, the first from the Psalms,
and the second for the most part from the Gospel. One or the other may
be selected, as circumstances suggest, but preference should be given
to an antiphon that is in harmony with the Gospel of the Mass.

FIRST WEEK IN ORDINARY TIME

On the first Sunday in Ordinary Time there occurs the Feast of the
Baptism of the Lord

Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et

Qui Unigenitum Filium tuum, Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum, Sacerdotem
aeternum et universorum Regem, oleo exsultationis unxisti: ut, seipsum
in ara crucis hostiam immaculatam et pacificam offerens, redemptionis

an eternal and universal kingdom
