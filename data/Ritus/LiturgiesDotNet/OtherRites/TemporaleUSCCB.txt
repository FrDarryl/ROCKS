Ordinary Time lasts from the Monday after this Sunday to the Tuesday before Lent. For
Masses both on Sundays and on weekdays, the texts given below, pp. 000 ff., are used.

LENT

1. It is strongly recommended that the tradition of gathering the local Church after the
fashion of the Roman “stations” be kept and promoted, especially during Lent and at least
in larger towns and cities, in a way best suited to individual places.
Such gatherings of the faithful can take place, especially with the chief Pastor of the
diocese presiding, on Sundays or on other more convenient days during the week, either
at the tombs of the Saints, or in the principal churches or shrines of a city, or even in the
more frequently visited places of pilgrimage in the diocese.
If a procession precedes a Mass celebrated for such a gathering, according to
circumstances and local conditions, the faithful gather at a smaller church or some other
suitable place other than in the church to which the procession will head.
After greeting the people, the Priest says a Collect of the mystery of the Holy Cross
(cf. below, pp. 000-000), for the remission of sins (cf. below, pp. 000-000), or for the
Church, especially the local Church (cf. below, pp. 000-000), or one of the Prayers over
the People. Then the procession makes its way to the church in which Mass will be
celebrated and meanwhile the Litany of the Saints is sung. Invocations to the Patron Saint
or the Founder Saint and to the Saints of the local Church may be inserted at the
appropriate point in the Litany.
When the procession reaches the church, the Priest venerates the altar and, if
appopriate, incenses it. Afterwards, omitting the Introductory Rites and, if appropriate,
the Kyrie, he says the Collect of the Mass, and then continues the Mass in the usual way.
2. At these gatherings, instead of Mass, some celebration of the Word of God may also
take place, especially in the form of the penitential celebrations given in the Roman
Ritual for Lent.
3. On weekdays of Lent, at the end of Mass and before the final blessing, the Prayer
over the People indicated for each day may appropriately be used.
4. During Lent, it is not permitted to decorate the altar with flowers, and the use of
musical instruments is allowed only so as to support the singing. Nevertheless, Laetare
Sunday (the Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts are exceptions to this rule.

ASH WEDNESDAY
In the course of today’s Mass, ashes are blessed and distributed. These are made from
the olive branches or branches of other trees that were blessed the previous year.

Introductory Rites and Liturgy of the Word
Entrance Antiphon

Wis 11: 24, 25, 27

You are merciful to all, O Lord,
and despise nothing that you have made.
You overlook people’s sins, to bring them to repentance,
and you spare them, for you are the Lord our God.
The Penitential Act is omitted, and the Distribution of Ashes takes its place.

Collect
Grant, O Lord, that we may begin with holy fasting
this campaign of Christian service,
so that, as we take up battle against spiritual evils,
we may be armed with weapons of self-restraint.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

Blessing and Distribution of Ashes
After the Homily, the Priest, standing with hands joined, says:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), let us humbly ask God our Father
that he be pleased to bless with the abundance of his grace
these ashes, which we will put on our heads in penitence.
After a brief prayer in silence, and, with hands extended, he continues:

O God, who are moved by acts of humility
and respond with forgiveness to works of penance,
lend your merciful ear to our prayers
and in your kindness pour out the grace of your  blessing
on your servants who are marked with these ashes,
that, as they follow the Lenten observances,
they may be worthy to come with minds made pure
to celebrate the Paschal Mystery of your Son.
Through Christ our Lord
R. Amen.

64

ASH WEDNESDAY

Or:

O God, who desire not the death of sinners,
but their conversion,
mercifully hear our prayers
and in your kindness be pleased to bless  these ashes,
which we intend to receive upon our heads,
that we, who acknowledge we are but ashes
and shall return to dust,
may, through a steadfast observance of Lent,
gain pardon for sins and newness of life
after the likeness of your Risen Son.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
He sprinkles the ashes with holy water, without saying anything.
Then the Priest places ashes on the head of all those present who come to him, and says
to each one:

Repent, and believe in the Gospel.
Or:

Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.
Meanwhile, the following are sung:

Antiphon 1
Let us change our garments to sackcloth and ashes,
let us fast and weep before the Lord,
that our God, rich in mercy, might forgive us our sins.
Antiphon 2

Cf. Jl 2: 17; Est 4: 17

Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord,
stand between the porch and the altar and weep and cry out:
Spare, O Lord, spare your people;
do not close the mouths of those who sing your praise, O Lord.
Antiphon 3

Ps 51 (50): 3

Blot out my transgressions, O Lord.
This may be repeated after each verse of Psalm 51 (50) (Have mercy on me, O God).

Responsory

Cf. Bar 3: 2; Ps 79 (78): 9

R. Let us correct our faults which we have committed in ignorance,
let us not be taken unawares by the day of our death, looking in vain
for leisure to repent. * Hear us, O Lord, and show us your mercy, for
we have sinned against you.

65

ASH WEDNESDAY

V. Help us, O God our Savior; for the sake of your name, O Lord, set
us free. * Hear us, O Lord . . .
Another appropriate chant may also be sung.
After the distribution of ashes, the Priest washes his hands and proceeds to the Universal
Prayer, and continues the Mass in the usual way.
The Creed is not said.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
Prayer over the Offerings
As we solemnly offer
the annual sacrifice for the beginning of Lent,
we entreat you, O Lord,
that, through works of penance and charity,
we may turn away from harmful pleasures
and, cleansed from our sins, may become worthy
to celebrate devoutly the Passion of your Son.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
Preface III or IV of Lent, pp. 000-000.

Communion Antiphon

Cf. Ps 1: 2-3

He who ponders the law of the Lord day and night
will yield fruit in due season.
Prayer after Communion
May the Sacrament we have received sustain us, O Lord,
that our Lenten fast may be pleasing to you
and be for us a healing remedy.
Through Christ our Lord.
Prayer over the People
For the dismissal, the Priest stands facing the people and, extending his hands over them,
says this prayer:

Pour out a spirit of compunction, O God,
on those who bow before your majesty,
and by your mercy may they merit the rewards you promise
to those who do penance.
Through Christ our Lord.
The blessing and distribution of ashes may also take place outside Mass. In this case, the
rite is preceded by a Liturgy of the Word, with the Entrance Antiphon, the Collect, and
the readings with their chants as at Mass. Then there follow the Homily and the blessing
and distribution of ashes. The rite is concluded with the Universal Prayer, the Blessing,
and the Dismissal of the Faithful.

HOLY WEEK

PALM SUNDAY OF THE
PASSION OF THE LORD
1. On this day the Church recalls the entrance of Christ the Lord into Jerusalem to
accomplish his Paschal Mystery. Accordingly, the memorial of this entrance of the Lord
takes place at all Masses, by means of the Procession or the Solemn Entrance before the
principal Mass or the Simple Entrance before other Masses. The Solemn Entrance, but
not the Procession, may be repeated before other Masses that are usually celebrated with
a large gathering of people.
It is desirable that, where neither the Procession nor the Solemn Entrance can take
place, there be a sacred celebration of the Word of God on the messianic entrance and on
the Passion of the Lord, either on Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time.

The Commemoration of the Lord’s Entrance into Jerusalem
First Form: The Procession
2. At an appropriate hour, a gathering takes place at a smaller church or other suitable
place other than inside the church to which the procession will go. The faithful hold

branches in their hands.
3. Wearing the red sacred vestments as for Mass, the Priest and the Deacon,
accompanied by other ministers, approach the place where the people are gathered.
Instead of the chasuble, the Priest may wear a cope, which he leaves aside when the
procession is over, and puts on a chasuble.
4. Meanwhile, the following antiphon or another appropriate chant is sung.
Mt 21: 9

Ant.

[PalmSunday2Pub]
Or:

[PalmSunday1Pub]
5. After this, the Priest and people sign themselves, while the Priest says: In the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Then he greets the people in the usual
way. A brief address is given, in which the faithful are invited to participate actively and
consciously in the celebration of this day, in these or similar words:

118

PALM SUNDAY

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
since the beginning of Lent until now
we have prepared our hearts by penance and charitable works.
Today we gather together to herald with the whole Church
the beginning of the celebration
of our Lord’s Paschal Mystery,
that is to say, of his Passion and Resurrection.
For it was to accomplish this mystery
that he entered his own city of Jerusalem.
Therefore, with all faith and devotion,
let us commemorate
the Lord's entry into the city for our salvation,
following in his footsteps,
so that, being made by his grace partakers of the Cross,
we may have a share also in his Resurrection and in his life.
6. After the address, the Priest says one of the following prayers with hands extended.

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
sanctify  these branches with your blessing,
that we, who follow Christ the King in exultation,
may reach the eternal Jerusalem through him.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or:

Increase the faith of those who place their hope in you, O God,
and graciously hear the prayers of those who call on you,
that we, who today hold high these branches
to hail Christ in his triumph,
may bear fruit for you by good works accomplished in him.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
He sprinkles the branches with holy water without saying anything.
7. Then a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, a Priest, proclaims in the usual way the
Gospel concerning the Lord’s entrance according to one of the four Gospels. If
appropriate, incense may be used.

119

OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD

“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord”

Year A:

 A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.
1

When Jesus and the disciples drew near Jerusalem and
came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two
disciples, 2 saying to them,
"Go into the village opposite you,
and immediately you will find an ass tethered,
and a colt with her.
Untie them and bring them here to me.
3
And if anyone should say anything to you, reply,
'The master has need of them.' Then he will send them at
once."
4
This happened so that what had been spoken through the
prophet
might be fulfilled:
5
Say to daughter Zion,
"Behold, your king comes to you, meek and riding on an
ass,
and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden."
6
The disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them.
7
They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks
over them, and he sat upon them.
8
The very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
while others cut branches from the trees and strewed them
on the road.
9
The crowds preceding him and those following
kept crying out and saying:
"Hosanna to the Son of David;
blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord;
hosanna in the highest."
10
And when he entered Jerusalem
the whole city was shaken and asked, "Who is this?"
11
And the crowds replied,
"This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee."
The Gospel of the Lord.

21: 1-11

120

PALM SUNDAY

Year B:

 A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark.

11: 1-10

1

When Jesus and his disciples drew near to Jerusalem, to
Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives,
he sent two of his disciples 2 and said to them,
"Go into the village opposite you, and immediately on entering it,
you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat.
Untie it and bring it here.
3 If anyone should say to you,
'Why are you doing this?' reply,
'The Master has need of it
and will send it back here at once.' "
4
So they went off
and found a colt tethered at a gate outside on the street, and they
untied it.
5
Some of the bystanders said to them,
"What are you doing, untying the colt?"
6
They answered them just as Jesus had told them to, and they
permitted them to do it.
7
So they brought the colt to Jesus and put their cloaks over it.
And he sat on it.
8
Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread
leafy branches
that they had cut from the fields.
9
Those preceding him as well as those following kept crying out:
"Hosanna!
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
10
Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is to come!
Hosanna in the highest!"
The Gospel of the Lord.

12: 12-16

When the great crowd that had come to
the feast heard that Jesus was coming to
Jerusalem,
13
they took palm branches and went out to meet him, and cried out:
"Hosanna!

OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD

121

Blessed is he who comes in the
name of the Lord, the king of
Israel."
14
Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is written:
15 Fear no more, O daughter Zion;
see, your king comes, seated upon an ass's colt.
16
His disciples did not understand
this at first, but when Jesus had
been glorified
they remembered that these things were
written about him and that they had
done this for him.

Jesus proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem.
As he drew near to Bethphage
and Bethany at the place called
the Mount of Olives,
he sent two of his disciples.
30
He said, "Go into the village opposite you,
and as you enter it you will find a
colt tethered on which no one has
ever sat.
Untie it and bring it here.
31
And if anyone should ask you,
'Why are you
untying it?' you
will answer,
'The Master has need of it.' "
32
So those who had been sent went off
and found everything just as he had told them.
33
And as they were untying the colt, its owners
said to them, "Why are you untying this colt?"
34
They answered,
"The Master has need of it."
35
So they brought it to
Jesus, threw their
cloaks over the colt,
and helped Jesus to mount.

PALM SUNDAY

36

As he rode along,
the people were spreading their cloaks on the road;
37
and now as he was approaching the slope of the
Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of his disciples
began to praise God aloud with joy
for all the mighty deeds they had seen.
38
They proclaimed:
"Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord.
39
Peace in heaven and glory in the highest."
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher,
rebuke your disciples."
40 He said in reply,
"I tell you, if they keep silent, the stones will cry out!"
The Gospel of the Lord.
8. After the Gospel, a brief homily may be given. Then, to begin the Procession, an
invitation may be given by a Priest or a Deacon or a lay minister, in these or similar
words:

[PalmSunday3Pub]

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
like the crowds who acclaimed Jesus in Jerusalem,
let us go forth in peace.
Or:

[PalmSunday4Pub]
In this latter case, all respond:

[PalmSunday5Pub]
9. The Procession to the church where Mass will be celebrated then sets off in the usual
way. If incense is used, the thurifer goes first, carrying a thurible with burning incense,
then an acolyte or another minister, carrying a cross decorated with palm branches
according to local custom, between two ministers with lighted candles. Then follow the
Deacon carrying the Book of the Gospels, the Priest with the ministers, and, after them,
all the faithful carrying branches.
As the Procession moves forward, the following or other suitable chants in honor of
Christ the King are sung by the choir and people.

Antiphon 1
The children of the Hebrews, carrying olive branches,
went to meet the Lord, crying out and saying:
Hosanna in the highest.

123

OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD

If appropriate, this antiphon is repeated between the strophes of the following Psalm.

Psalm 24 (23)
The LORD’S is the earth and its fullness, *
the world, and those who dwell in it.
It is he who set it on the seas;*
on the rivers he made it firm.
(The antiphon is repeated)

Who shall climb the mountain of the LORD?*
The clean of hands and pure of heart,
whose soul is not set on vain things, †
who has not sworn deceitful words.*
(The antiphon is repeated)

Blessings from the LORD shall he receive,*
and right reward from the God who saves him.
Such are the people who seek him,*
who seek the face of the God of Jacob.
(The antiphon is repeated)

grow higher, ancient doors.*
Let him enter, the king of glory!
Who is this king of glory?*
The LORD, the mighty, the valiant;
the LORD, the valiant in war.
(The antiphon is repeated)

O gates, lift high your heads; †
grow higher, ancient doors.*
Let him enter, the king of glory!
Who is this king of glory?*
He, the LORD of hosts,
he is the king of glory.
(The antiphon is repeated)

Antiphon 2
The children of the Hebrews spread their garments on the road,
crying out and saying: Hosanna to the Son of David;

PALM SUNDAY

Psalm 47 (46)
All peoples, clap your hands.*
Cry to God with shouts of joy!
For the LORD, the Most high, is awesome,*

and nations under our feet.
Our heritage he chose for us,*
the pride of Jacob whom he loves.
God goes up with shouts of joy.*
The LORD goes up with trumpet blast.
(The antiphon is repeated)

Sing praise for God; sing praise!*
Sing praise our king; sing praise!
God is king of all earth.*
Sing praise with all your skill.
(The antiphon is repeated)

God reigns over the nations.*
God sits upon his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are assembled
with the people of the God of Abraham. †
The rulers of the earth belong to God,*
who is greatly exalted.

All repeat: Glory and honor . . .
10. As the procession enters the church, there is sung the following responsory or another
chant, which should speak of the Lord’s entrance.

R. As the Lord entered the holy city, the children of the Hebrews
proclaimed the resurrection of life. * Waving their branches of palm, they
cried: Hosanna in the Highest.
V. When the people heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they went
out to meet him. * Waving their branches.
11. When the Priest arrives at the altar, he venerates it and, if appropriate, incenses it.
Then he goes to the chair, where he puts aside the cope, if he has worn one, and puts on
the chasuble. Omitting the other Introductory Rites of the Mass and, if appropriate, the
Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), he says the Collect of the Mass, and then continues the Mass
in the usual way.

Second Form: The Solemn Entrance
12. When a procession outside the church cannot take place, the entrance of the Lord is
celebrated inside the church by means of a Solemn Entrance before the principal Mass.
13. Holding branches in their hands, the faithful gather either outside, in front of the
church door, or inside the church itself. The Priest and ministers and a representative
group of the faithful go to a suitable place in the church outside the sanctuary, where at
least the greater part of the faithful can see the rite.
14. While the Priest approaches the appointed place, the antiphon Hosanna or another
appropriate chant is sung. Then the blessing of branches and the proclamation of the
Gospel of the Lord’s entrance into Jerusalem take place as above (nos. 5-7). After the
Gospel, the Priest processes solemnly with the ministers and the representative group of
the faithful through the church to the sanctuary, while the responsory As the Lord entered
(no. 10) or another appropriate chant is sung.

126

PALM SUNDAY

15. Arriving at the altar, the Priest venerates it. He then goes to the chair and, omitting
the Introductory Rites of the Mass and, if appropriate, the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), he
says the Collect of the Mass, and then continues the Mass in the usual way.

Third Form: The Simple Entrance
16. At all other Masses of this Sunday at which the Solemn Entrance is not held, the
memorial of the Lord’s entrance into Jerusalem takes place by means of a Simple
Entrance.
17. While the Priest proceeds to the altar, the Entrance Antiphon with its Psalm (no. 18)
or another chant on the same theme is sung. Arriving at the altar, the Priest venerates it
and goes to the chair. After the Sign of the Cross, he greets the people and continues the
Mass in the usual way.
At other Masses, in which singing at the entrance cannot take place, the Priest, as
soon as he has arrived at the altar and venerated it, greets the people, reads the Entrance
Antiphon, and continues the Mass in the usual way.
18.

Entrance Antiphon

Cf. Jn 12: 1, 12-13; Ps 24 (23): 9-10

Six days before the Passover,
when the Lord came into the city of Jerusalem,
the children ran to meet him;
in their hands they carried palm branches
and with a loud voice cried out:
*Hosanna in the highest!
Blessed are you, who have come in your abundant mercy!
O gates, lift high your heads;
grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!
Who is this king of glory?
He, the Lord of hosts, he is the king of glory.
*Hosanna in the highest!
Blessed are you, who have come in your abundant mercy!
AT THE MASS
19. After the Procession or Solemn Entrance the Priest begins the Mass with the Collect.
20. Collect

Almighty ever-living God,
who as an example of humility for the human race to follow
caused our Savior to take flesh and submit to the Cross,
graciously grant that we may heed his lesson of patient suffering
and so merit a share in his Resurrection.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

127

OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD

21. The narrative of the Lord’s Passion is read without candles and without incense, with
no greeting or signing of the book. It is read by a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, by a
Priest. It may also be read by readers, with the part of Christ, if possible, reserved to a
Priest.
Deacons, but not others, ask for the blessing of the Priest before singing the Passion,
as at other times before the Gospel.
22. After the narrative of the Passion, a brief homily should take place, if appropriate. A
period of silence may also be observed.
The Creed is said, and the Universal Prayer takes place.
23. Prayer over the Offerings

Through the Passion of your Only Begotten Son, O Lord,
may our reconciliation with you be near at hand,
so that, though we do not merit it by our own deeds,
yet by this sacrifice made once for all,
we may feel already the effects of your mercy.
Through Christ our Lord.

Mt 20: 28

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]
1. In accordance with a most ancient tradition of the Church, on this day all Masses
without the people are forbidden.

The Chrism Mass
2. The blessing of the Oil of the Sick and of the Oil of Catechumens and the
consecration of the Chrism are carried out by the Bishop, according to the Rite described
in the Roman Pontifical, usually on this day, at a proper Mass to be celebrated during the
morning.
3. If, however, it is very difficult for the clergy and the people to gather with the Bishop
on this day, the Chrism Mass may be anticipated on another day, but near to Easter.
4. This Mass, which the Bishop concelebrates with his presbyterate, should be, as it
were, a manifestation of the Priests’ communion with their Bishop. Accordingly it is
desirable that all the Priests participate in it, insofar as is possible, and during it receive
Communion even under both kinds. To signify the unity of the presbyterate of the
diocese, the Priests who concelebrate with the Bishop should be from different regions of
the diocese.
5. In accord with traditional practice, the blessing of the Oil of the Sick takes place
before the end of the Eucharistic Prayer, but the blessing of the Oil of Catechumens and
the consecration of the Chrism take place after Communion. Nevertheless, for pastoral
reasons, it is permitted for the entire rite of blessing to take place after the Liturgy of the
Word.
6. Entrance Antiphon

Rev 1: 6

Jesus Christ has made us into a kingdom, priests for his God and Father.
To him be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.
7. Collect

O God, who anointed your Only Begotten Son with the Holy Spirit
and made him Christ and Lord,
graciously grant
that, being made sharers in his consecration,
we may bear witness to your Redemption in the world.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
8. After the reading of the Gospel, the Bishop preaches the Homily in which, taking his
starting point from the text of the readings proclaimed in the Liturgy of the Word, he
speaks to the people and to his Priests about priestly anointing, urging the Priests to be
faithful in their office and calling on them to renew publicly their priestly promises.

133

THE CHRISM MASS

Renewal of Priestly Promises
9. After the Homily, the Bishop speaks with the Priests in these or similar words.

Beloved sons,
on the anniversary of that day
when Christ our Lord conferred his priesthood
on his Apostles and on us,
are you resolved to renew
in the presence of your Bishop and God’s holy people,
the promises you once made?
The Priests, all together, respond: I am.
Are you resolved to be more united with the Lord Jesus
and more closely conformed to him,
denying yourselves and confirming those promises
about sacred duties towards Christ's Church
which, prompted by love of him,
you willingly and joyfully pledged
on the day of your priestly ordination?
Priests: I am.
Are you resolved to be faithful stewards of the mysteries of God
in the Holy Eucharist and the other liturgical rites
and to discharge faithfully the sacred office of teaching,
following Christ the Head and Shepherd,
not seeking any gain,
but moved only by zeal for souls?
Priests: I am.
Then, turned towards the people, the Bishop continues:

As for you, dearest sons and daughters,
pray for your Priests,
that the Lord may pour out his gifts abundantly upon them,
and keep them faithful as ministers of Christ, the High Priest,
so that they may lead you to him,
who is the source of salvation.
People: Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.
And pray also for me,
that I may be faithful to the apostolic office
entrusted to me in my lowliness
and that in your midst I may be made day by day
a living and more perfect image of Christ,
the Priest, the Good Shepherd,
the Teacher and the Servant of all.

134

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

People: Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.

May the Lord keep us all in his charity
and lead all of us,
shepherds and flock,
to eternal life.
All: Amen.
10. The Creed is not said.
11. Prayer over the Offerings

May the power of this sacrifice, O Lord, we pray,
mercifully wipe away what is old in us
and increase in us grace of salvation and newness of life.
Through Christ our Lord.
12. Preface: The Priesthood of Christ and the Ministry of Priests.

V. The Lord be with you.

R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
you made your Only Begotten Son
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,
and by your wondrous design were pleased to decree
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.
For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood
the people he has made his own,
but with a brother’s kindness he also chooses men
to become sharers in his sacred ministry
through the laying on of hands.
They are to renew in his name
the sacrifice of human redemption,

THE CHRISM MASS

135

to set before your children the paschal banquet,
to lead your holy people in charity,
to nourish them with the word
and strengthen them with the Sacraments.
As they give up their lives for you
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
13. Communion Antiphon

Ps 89 (88): 2

I will sing for ever of your mercies, O Lord;
through all ages my mouth will proclaim your fidelity.
14. Prayer after Communion

We beseech you, almighty God,
that those you renew by your Sacraments
may merit to become the pleasing fragrance of Christ.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
15. The reception of the Holy Oils may take place in individual parishes either before the
celebration of the Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper or at another time that seems more
appropriate.

THE SACRED
PASCHAL TRIDUUM

1. In the Sacred Triduum, the Church solemnly celebrates the greatest mysteries of our
redemption, keeping by means of special celebrations the memorial of her Lord,
crucified, buried, and risen.
The Paschal Fast should also be kept sacred. It is to be celebrated everywhere on
the Friday of the Lord’s Passion and, where appropriate, prolonged also through Holy
Saturday as a way of coming, with spirit uplifted, to the joys of the Lord’s Resurrection.
2. For a fitting celebration of the Sacred Triduum, a sufficient number of lay ministers
is required, who must be carefully instructed as to what they are to do.
The singing of the people, the ministers, and the Priest Celebrant has a special
importance in the celebrations of these days, for when texts are sung, they have their
proper impact.
Pastors should, therefore, not fail to explain to the Christian faithful, as best they can,
the meaning and order of the celebrations and to prepare them for active and fruitful
participation.
3. The celebrations of the Sacred Triduum are to be carried out in cathedral and
parochial churches and only in those churches in which they can be performed with
dignity, that is, with a good attendance of the faithful, an appropriate number of
ministers, and the means to sing at least some of the parts.
Consequently, it is desirable that small communities, associations, and special groups
of various kinds join together in these churches to carry out the sacred celebrations in a
more noble manner.

THURSDAY OF THE LORD’S SUPPER
At the Evening Mass
1. The Mass of the Lord’s Supper is celebrated in the evening, at a convenient time,
with the full participation of the whole local community and with all the Priests and
ministers exercising their office.
2. All Priests may concelebrate even if they have already concelebrated the Chrism
Mass on this day, or if they have to celebrate another Mass for the good of the Christian
faithful.
3. Where a pastoral reason requires it, the local Ordinary may permit another Mass to be
celebrated in churches and oratories in the evening and, in case of genuine necessity,
even in the morning, but only for the faithful who are in no way able to participate in the
evening Mass. Care should, nevertheless, be taken that celebrations of this sort do not
take place for the advantage of private persons or special small groups, and do not
prejudice the evening Mass.
4. Holy Communion may only be distributed to the faithful during Mass; but it may be
brought to the sick at any hour of the day.
5. The altar may be decorated with flowers with a moderation that accords with the
character of this day. The tabernacle should be entirely empty; but a sufficient amount of
bread should be consecrated in this Mass for the Communion of the clergy and the people
on this and the following day.
6. Entrance Antiphon

Cf. Gal 6: 14

We should glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
in whom is our salvation, life and resurrection,
through whom we are saved and delivered.
7. The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said. While the hymn is being
sung, bells are rung, and when it is finished, they remain silent until the Gloria in excelsis
of the Easter Vigil, unless, if appropriate, the Diocesan Bishop has decided otherwise.
Likewise, during this same period, the organ and other musical instruments may be used
only so as to support the singing.

140

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

8. Collect

O God, who have called us to participate
in this most sacred Supper,
in which your Only Begotten Son,
when about to hand himself over to death,
entrusted to the Church a sacrifice new for all eternity,
the banquet of his love,
grant, we pray,
that we may draw from so great a mystery,
the fullness of charity and of life.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
9. After the proclamation of the Gospel, the Priest gives a homily in which light is shed
on the principal mysteries that are commemorated in this Mass, namely, the institution of
the Holy Eucharist and of the priestly Order, and the commandment of the Lord
concerning fraternal charity.

The Washing of Feet
10. After the Homily, where a pastoral reason suggests it, the Washing of Feet follows.
11. The men who have been chosen are led by the ministers to seats prepared in a
suitable place. Then the Priest (removing his chasuble if necessary) goes to each one,
and, with the help of the ministers, pours water over each one’s feet and then dries them.
12. Meanwhile some of the following antiphons or other appropriate chants are sung.

Antiphon 1

Cf. Jn 13: 4,5,15

After the Lord had risen from supper,
he poured water into a basin
and began to wash the feet of his disciples:
he left them this example.
Antiphon 2

Cf. Jn 13: 12,13,15

The Lord Jesus, after eating supper with his disciples,
washed their feet and said to them:
Do you know what I, your Lord and Master, have done for you?
I have given you an example, that you should do likewise.

MASS OF THE LORD’S SUPPER

Antiphon 3

141

Jn 13: 6,7,8

Lord, are you to wash my feet? Jesus said to him in answer:
If I do not wash your feet, you will have no share with me.
V. So he came to Simon Peter and Peter said to him:
—Lord.
V. What I am doing, you do not know for now,

On the day before he was to suffer
for our salvation and the salvation of all,
that is today,
He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

he took bread in his holy and venerable hands,
He raises his eyes.

and with eyes raised to heaven

genuflects in adoration.

In a similar way, when supper was ended,
He takes the chalice and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

he took this precious chalice
in his holy and venerable hands,
and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
He bows slightly.

TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,

THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT,
WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY
FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.

through Christ our Lord.
31. And he continues:

Through whom
you continue to make all these good things, O Lord;
you sanctify them, fill them with life,
bless them, and bestow them upon us.
32. He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, elevating both, he says:

Through him, and with him, and in him,
to you, O God, almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
is all honor and glory,
for ever and ever.
The people acclaim:

Amen.
Then follows the Communion Rite, p. 000.
33. At an appropriate moment during Communion, the Priest entrusts the Eucharist from
the table of the altar to Deacons or acolytes or other extraordinary ministers, so that
afterwards it may be brought to the sick who are to receive Holy Communion at home.
34. Communion Antiphon

following day is left on the altar. The Priest, standing at the chair, says the Prayer after
Communion.
36.

Prayer after Communion

by the Supper of your Son in this present age,
so we may enjoy his banquet for all eternity.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.

MASS OF THE LORD’S SUPPER

149

The Transfer of the Most Blessed Sacrament
37. After the Prayer after Communion, the Priest puts incense in the thurible while
standing, blesses it and then, kneeling, incenses the Blessed Sacrament three times. Then,
having put on a white humeral veil, he rises, takes the ciborium, and covers it with the
ends of the veil.
38. A procession is formed in which the Blessed Sacrament, accompanied by torches and
incense, is carried through the church to a place of repose prepared in a part of the church
or in a chapel suitably decorated. A lay minister with a cross, standing between two other
ministers with lighted candles leads off. Others carrying lighted candles follow. Before
the Priest carrying the Blessed Sacrament comes the thurifer with a smoking thurible.
Meanwhile, the hymn Pange, lingua (exclusive of the last two stanzas) or another
eucharistic chant is sung.
39. When the procession reaches the place of repose, the Priest, with the help of the
Deacon if necessary, places the ciborium in the tabernacle, the door of which remains
open. Then he puts incense in the thurible and, kneeling, incenses the Blessed Sacrament,
while Tantum ergo Sacraméntum or another eucharistic chant is sung. Then the Deacon
or the Priest himself places the Sacrament in the tabernacle and closes the door.
40. After a period of adoration in silence, the Priest and ministers genuflect and return to
the sacristy.
41. At an appropriate time, the altar is stripped and, if possible, the crosses are removed
from the church. It is expedient that any crosses which remain in the church be veiled.
42. Vespers (Evening Prayer) is not celebrated by those who have attended the Mass of
the Lord’s Supper.
43. The faithful are invited to continue adoration before the Blessed Sacrament for a
suitable length of time during the night, according to local circumstances, but after
midnight the adoration should take place without solemnity.
44. If the celebration of the Passion of the Lord on the following Friday does not take
place in the same church, the Mass is concluded in the usual way and the Blessed
Sacrament is placed in the tabernacle.

FRIDAY OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD
[GOOD FRIDAY]
1. On this and the following day, by a most ancient tradition, the Church does not
celebrate the Sacraments at all, except for Penance and the Anointing of the Sick.
2. On this day, Holy Communion is distributed to the faithful only within the
celebration of the Lord’s Passion; but it may be brought at any hour of the day to the sick
who cannot participate in this celebration.
3. The altar should be completely bare: without a cross, without candles and without cloths.

The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord
On the afternoon of this day, about three o’clock (unless a later hour is chosen for a
4.
pastoral reason), there takes place the celebration of the Lord’s Passion consisting of
three parts, namely, the Liturgy of the Word, the Adoration of the Cross, and Holy
Communion.
In the United States, if the size or nature of a parish or other community indicates
the pastoral need for an additional liturgical service, the Diocesan Bishop may permit the
service to be repeated later. This liturgy by its very nature may not, however, be
celebrated in the absence of a Priest.
5. The Priest and the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, wearing red vestments as for Mass,
go to the altar in silence and, after making a reverence to the altar, prostrate themselves
or, if appropriate, kneel and pray in silence for a while. All others kneel.
6. Then the Priest, with the ministers, goes to the chair where, facing the people, who
are standing, he says, with hands extended, one of the following prayers, omitting the
invitation Let us pray.

151

THE PASSION OF THE LORD

Prayer
Remember your mercies, O Lord,
and with your eternal protection sanctify your servants,
for whom Christ your Son,
by the shedding of his Blood,
established the Paschal Mystery.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
Or:

O God, who by the Passion of Christ your Son, our Lord,
abolished the death inherited from ancient sin
by every succeeding generation,
grant that just as, being conformed to him,
we have borne by the law of nature
the image of the man of earth,
so by the sanctification of grace
we may bear the image of the Man of heaven.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

7. Then all sit and the First Reading, from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah (52: 13-53:
12), is read with its Psalm.
8. The Second Reading, from the Letter to the Hebrews (4: 14-16; 5: 7-9), follows, and
then the chant before the Gospel.
9. Then the narrative of the Lord’s Passion according to John (18: 1–19: 42) is read in
the same way as on the preceding Sunday.
10. After the reading of the Lord’s Passion, the Priest gives a brief homily and, at its end,
the faithful may be invited to spend a short time in prayer.

152

FRIDAY OF HOLY WEEK [GOOD FRIDAY]

The Solemn Intercessions
11. The Liturgy of the Word concludes with the Solemn Intercessions, which take place
in this way: the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, or if he is not, a lay minister, stands at the
ambo, and sings or says the invitation in which the intention is expressed. Then all pray
in silence for a while, and afterwards the Priest, standing at the chair or, if appropriate, at
the altar, with hands extended, sings or says the prayer.
The faithful may remain either kneeling or standing throughout the entire period of
the prayers.
12. Before the Priest’s prayer, in accord with tradition, it is permissible to use the
Deacon’s invitations Let us kneel — Let us stand, with all kneeling for silent prayer.
Text with music:

T HE A DORATION OF THE H OLY C ROSS
14. After the Solemn Intercessions, the solemn Adoration of the Holy Cross takes place.
Of the two forms of the showing of the Cross presented here, the more appropriate one,
according to pastoral needs, should be chosen.

The Showing of the Holy Cross
First Form
15. The Deacon accompanied by ministers, or another suitable minister, goes to the
sacristy, from which, in procession, accompanied by two ministers with lighted candles,
he carries the Cross, covered with a violet veil, through the church to the middle of the
sanctuary.
The Priest, standing before the altar and facing the people, receives the Cross,
uncovers a little of its upper part and elevates it while beginning the Ecce lignum Crucis
(Behold the wood of the Cross). He is assisted in singing by the Deacon or, if need be, by
the choir. All respond, Come, let us adore. At the end of the singing, all kneel and for a
brief moment adore in silence, while the Priest stands and holds the Cross raised.

[HolyCross3Pub]
Or:

[HolyCross2Pub]
Or:

[HolyCross1Pub]

Behold the wood of the Cross,
on which hung the salvation of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
Then the Priest uncovers the right arm of the Cross and again, raising up the Cross,
begins, Behold the wood of the Cross and everything takes place as above.
Finally, he uncovers the Cross entirely and, raising it up, he begins the invitation
Behold the wood of the Cross a third time and everything takes place like the first time.

Second Form
16. The Priest or the Deacon accompanied by ministers, or another suitable minister,
goes to the door of the church, where he receives the unveiled Cross, and the ministers
take lighted candles; then the procession sets off through the church to the sanctuary.
Near the door, in the middle of the church and before the entrance of the sanctuary, the
one who carries the Cross elevates it, singing, Behold the wood of the Cross, to which all
respond, Come, let us adore. After each response all kneel and for a brief moment adore
in silence, as above.

159

THE PASSION OF THE LORD

The Adoration of the Holy Cross
17. Then, accompanied by two ministers with lighted candles, the Priest or the Deacon
carries the Cross to the entrance of the sanctuary or to another suitable place and there
puts it down or hands it over to the ministers to hold. Candles are placed on the right and
left sides of the Cross.
18. For the Adoration of the Cross, first the Priest Celebrant alone approaches, with the
chasuble and his shoes removed, if appropriate. Then the clergy, the lay ministers, and
the faithful approach, moving as if in procession, and showing reverence to the Cross by
a simple genuflection or by some other sign appropriate to the usage of the region, for
example, by kissing the Cross.
19. Only one Cross should be offered for adoration. If, because of the large number of
people, it is not possible for all to approach individually, the Priest, after some of the
clergy and faithful have adored, takes the Cross and, standing in the middle before the
altar, invites the people in a few words to adore the Holy Cross and afterwards holds the
Cross elevated higher for a brief time, for the faithful to adore it in silence.
20. While the adoration of the Holy Cross is taking place, the antiphon Crucem tuam
adoramus (We adore your Cross, O Lord), the Reproaches, the hymn Crux fidelis
(Faithful Cross) or other suitable chants are sung, during which all who have already
adored the Cross remain seated.

Chants to Be Sung during the Adoration of the Holy Cross
Ant. We adore your Cross, O Lord,

we praise and glorify your holy Resurrection,
for behold, because of the wood of a tree
joy has come to the whole world.
May God have mercy on us and bless us;
may he let his face shed its light upon us
and have mercy on us.

Cf. Ps 67 (66): 2

And the antiphon is repeated: We adore . . .

The Reproaches
Parts assigned to one of the two choirs separately are indicated by the numbers 1
(first choir) and 2 (second choir); parts sung by both choirs together are marked: 1 and 2.
Some of the verses may also be sung by two cantors.

I
1 and 2 My people, what have I done to you?

Or how have I grieved you? Answer me!

FRIDAY OF HOLY WEEK [GOOD FRIDAY]

Hymn
All:

Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.
Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!
Cantors:

Sing, my tongue, in exultation
Of our banner and device!
Make a solemn proclamation
Of a triumph and its price:
How the Savior of creation
Conquered by his sacrifice!
All:

Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.
Cantors:

For, when Adam first offended,
Eating that forbidden fruit,
Not all hopes of glory ended
With the serpent at the root:
Broken nature would be mended
By a second tree and shoot.
All:

Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!
Cantors:

Thus the tempter was outwitted
By a wisdom deeper still:
Remedy and ailment fitted,
Means to cure and means to kill;
That the world might be acquitted,
Christ would do his Father’s will.

THE PASSION OF THE LORD

All:

Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.
Cantors:

So the Father, out of pity
For our self-inflicted doom,
Sent him from the heavenly city
When the holy time had come:
He, the Son and the Almighty,
Took our flesh in Mary’s womb.
All:

Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!
Cantors:

Hear a tiny baby crying,
Founder of the seas and strands;
See his virgin Mother tying
Cloth around his feet and hands;
Find him in a manger lying
Tightly wrapped in swaddling-bands!
All:

Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.
Cantors:

So he came, the long-expected,
Not in glory, not to reign;
Only born to be rejected,
Choosing hunger, toil and pain,
Till the scaffold was erected
And the Paschal Lamb was slain.
All:

Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!

164

Cantors:

No disgrace was too abhorrent:
Nailed and mocked and parched he died;
Blood and water, double warrant,
Issue from his wounded side,
Washing in a mighty torrent
Earth and stars and oceantide.
All:

Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.
Cantors:

Lofty timber, smooth your roughness,
Flex your boughs for blossoming;
Let your fibers lose their toughness,
Gently let your tendrils cling;
Lay aside your native gruffness,
Clasp the body of your King!
All:

Sweet the timber, sweet the iron,
Sweet the burden that they bear!
Cantors:

Noblest tree of all created,
Richly jeweled and embossed:
Post by Lamb’s blood consecrated;
Spar that saves the tempest-tossed;
Scaffold-beam which, elevated,
Carries what the world has cost!
All:

Faithful Cross the Saints rely on,
Noble tree beyond compare!
Never was there such a scion,
Never leaf or flower so rare.

FRIDAY OF HOLY WEEK [GOOD FRIDAY]

165

THE PASSION OF THE LORD

The following conclusion is never to be omitted:
All:

Wisdom, power, and adoration
To the blessed Trinity
For redemption and salvation
Through the Paschal Mystery,
Now, in every generation,
And for all eternity. Amen.
In accordance with local circumstances or popular traditions and if it is pastorally
appropriate, the Stabat Mater may be sung, as found in the Graduale Romanum, or
another suitable chant in memory of the compassion of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
21. When the adoration has been concluded, the Cross is carried by the Deacon or a
minister to its place at the altar. Lighted candles are placed around or on the altar or near
the Cross.

T HIRD P ART :
H OLY C OMMUNION
22. A cloth is spread on the altar, and a corporal and the Missal put in place. Meanwhile
the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself, putting on a humeral veil, brings
the Blessed Sacrament back from the place of repose to the altar by a shorter route, while
all stand in silence. Two ministers with lighted candles accompany the Blessed
Sacrament and place their candlesticks around or upon the altar.
When the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, has placed the Blessed Sacrament upon the
altar and uncovered the ciborium, the Priest goes to the altar and genuflects.
23. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says aloud:

At the Savior’s command
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:
The Priest, with hands extended says, and all present continue:

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Text with music, p. 000.

166

FRIDAY OF HOLY WEEK [GOOD FRIDAY]

24. With hands extended, the Priest continues alone:

Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,
that, by the help of your mercy,
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,
as we await the blessed hope
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
He joins his hands.
The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming:

For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours now and for ever.
Text with music, p. 000.
25. Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly:

May the receiving of your Body and Blood,
Lord Jesus Christ,
not bring me to judgment and condemnation,
but through your loving mercy
be for me protection in mind and body
and a healing remedy.
26. The Priest then genuflects, takes a particle, and, holding it slightly raised over the
ciborium, while facing the people, says aloud:

Behold the Lamb of God,
behold him who takes away the sins of the world.
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.
And together with the people he adds once:

Lord, I am not worthy
that you should enter under my roof,
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.
27. And facing the altar, he reverently consumes the Body of Christ, saying quietly: May
the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life.
28. He then proceeds to distribute Communion to the faithful. During Communion,
Psalm 22 (21) or another appropriate chant may be sung.
29. When the distribution of Communion has been completed, the ciborium is taken by
the Deacon or another suitable minister to a place prepared outside the church or, if
circumstances so require, it is placed in the tabernacle.
30. Then the Priest says: Let us pray, and, after a period of sacred silence, if
circumstances so suggest, has been observed, he says the Prayer after Communion.

THE PASSION OF THE LORD

167

Almighty ever-living God,
who have restored us to life
by the blessed Death and Resurrection of your Christ,
preserve in us the work of your mercy,
that, by partaking of this mystery,
we may have a life unceasingly devoted to you.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
31. For the Dismissal the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself, may say
the invitation Bow down for the blessing.
Then the Priest, standing facing the people and extending his hands over them, says
this Prayer over the People:

May abundant blessing, O Lord, we pray,
descend upon your people,
who have honored the Death of your Son
in the hope of their resurrection:
may pardon come,
comfort be given,
holy faith increase,
and everlasting redemption be made secure.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
32. And all, after genuflecting to the Cross, depart in silence.
33. After the celebration, the altar is stripped, but the Cross remains on the altar with two
or four candlesticks.
34. Vespers (Evening Prayer) is not celebrated by those who have been present at the
solemn afternoon liturgical celebration.

HOLY SATURDAY
1. On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord’s tomb in prayer and fasting,
meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his
Resurrection.
2. The Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare,
until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when
the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.
3. Holy Communion may only be given on this day as Viaticum.

EASTER TIME

EASTER SUNDAY
OF THE RESURRECTION
OF THE LORD

THE EASTER VIGIL IN THE HOLY NIGHT
1. By most ancient tradition, this is the night of keeping vigil for the Lord (Ex 12: 42),
in which, following the Gospel admonition (Lk 12: 35-37), the faithful, carrying lighted
lamps in their hands, should be like those looking for the Lord when he returns, so that at
his coming he may find them awake and have them sit at his table.
2. Of this night’s Vigil, which is the greatest and most noble of all solemnities, there is
to be only one celebration in each church. It is arranged, moreover, in such a way that
after the Lucernarium and Easter Proclamation (which constitutes the first part of this
Vigil), holy Church meditates on the wonders the Lord God has done for his people from
the beginning, trusting in his word and promise (the second part, that is, the Liturgy of
the Word) until, as day approaches, with new members reborn in Baptism (the third part),
the Church is called to the table the Lord has prepared for his people, the memorial of his
Death and Resurrection until he comes again (the fourth part).
3. The entire celebration of the Easter Vigil must take place during the night, so that it
begins after nightfall and ends before daybreak on the Sunday.
4. The Mass of the Vigil, even if it is celebrated before midnight, is a paschal Mass of
the Sunday of the Resurrection.
5. Anyone who participates in the Mass of the night may receive Communion again at
Mass during the day. A Priest who celebrates or concelebrates the Mass of the night may
again celebrate or concelebrate Mass during the day.
The Easter Vigil takes the place of the Office of Readings.
6. The Priest is usually assisted by a Deacon. If, however, there is no Deacon, the duties
of his Order, except those indicated below, are assumed by the Priest Celebrant or by a
concelebrant.
The Priest and Deacon vest as at Mass, in white vestments.
7. Candles should be prepared for all who participate in the Vigil. The lights of the
church are extinguished.

THE EASTER VIGIL

173

FIRST PART:
THE SOLEMN BEGINNING OF THE VIGIL OR LUCERNARIUM
The Blessing of the Fire and Preparation of the Candle
8. A blazing fire is prepared in a suitable place outside the church. When the people are
gathered there, the Priest approaches with the ministers, one of whom carries the paschal
candle. The processional cross and candles are not carried.
Where, however, a fire cannot be lit outside the church, the rite is carried out as in no.
13, below.
9. The Priest and faithful sign themselves while the Priest says: In the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and then he greets the assembled people in
the usual way and briefly instructs them about the night vigil in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
on this most sacred night,
in which our Lord Jesus Christ
passed over from death to life,
the Church calls upon her sons and daughters,
scattered throughout the world,
to come together to watch and pray.
If we keep the memorial
of the Lord's paschal solemnity in this way,
listening to his word and celebrating his mysteries,
then we shall have the sure hope
of sharing his triumph over death
and living with him in God.
10. Then the Priest blesses the fire, saying with hands extended:

Let us pray.
O God, who through your Son
bestowed upon the faithful the fire of your glory,
sanctify  this new fire, we pray,
and grant that,
by these paschal celebrations,
we may be so inflamed with heavenly desires,
that with minds made pure
we may attain festivities of unending splendor.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

174

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

11. After the blessing of the new fire, one of the ministers brings the paschal candle to
the Priest, who cuts a cross into the candle with a stylus. Then he makes the Greek letter
Alpha above the cross, the letter Omega below, and the four numerals of the current year
between the arms of the cross, saying meanwhile:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Christ yesterday and today (he cuts a vertical line);
the Beginning and the End (he cuts a horizontal line);
the Alpha (he cuts the letter Alpha above the vertical line);
and the Omega (he cuts the letter Omega below the vertical line).
All time belongs to him (he cuts the first numeral of the current year in the upper

left corner of the cross);
6. and all the ages (he cuts the second numeral of the current year in the upper right
corner of the cross).
7. To him be glory and power (he cuts the third numeral of the current year in the
lower left corner of the cross);
8. through every age and for ever. Amen (he cuts the fourth numeral of the
current year in the lower right corner of the cross).
[Insert inscription diagram for candle, cf. Missale Romanum, p. 339]
12. When the cutting of the cross and of the other signs has been completed, the Priest
may insert five grains of incense into the candle in the form of a cross, meanwhile saying:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

By his holy [Insert incense diagram for candle, cf. Missale Romanum, p. 339]
and glorious wounds,
may Christ the Lord
guard us
and protect us. Amen.

13. Where, because of difficulties that may occur, a fire is not lit, the blessing of fire is
adapted to the circumstances. When the people are gathered in the church as on other
occasions, the Priest comes to the door of the church, along with the ministers carrying
the paschal candle. The people, insofar as is possible, turn to face the Priest.
The greeting and address take place as in no. 9 above; then the fire is blessed and the
candle is prepared, as above in nos. 10-12.

14. The Priest lights the paschal candle from the new fire, saying:

[FireBlessingPub]
May the light of Christ rising in glory
dispel the darkness of our hearts and minds.
As regards the preceding elements, Conferences of Bishops may also establish other
forms more adapted to the culture of the different peoples.

175

THE EASTER VIGIL

Procession
15. When the candle has been lit, one of the ministers takes burning coals from the fire
and places them in the thurible, and the Priest puts incense into it in the usual way. The
Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, another suitable minister, takes the paschal candle and a
procession forms. The thurifer with the smoking thurible precedes the Deacon or other
minister who carries the paschal candle. After them follows the Priest with the ministers
and the people, all holding in their hands unlit candles.
At the door of the church the Deacon, standing and raising up the candle, sings:

[VigilProcession1Pub]
Or:

[VigilProcession3Pub]

The Light of Christ.
And all reply:

[VigilProcession2Pub]
Or:

[VigilProcession4Pub]

Thanks be to God.
The Priest lights his candle from the flame of the paschal candle.
16. Then the Deacon moves forward to the middle of the church and, standing and
raising up the candle, sings a second time:

The Light of Christ.
And all reply:

Thanks be to God.
All light their candles from the flame of the paschal candle and continue in
procession.
17. When the Deacon arrives before the altar, he stands facing the people, raises up the
candle and sings a third time:

The Light of Christ.
And all reply:

Thanks be to God.
Then the Deacon places the paschal candle on a large candlestand prepared next to
the ambo or in the middle of the sanctuary.
And lights are lit throughout the church, except for the altar candles.

176

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

The Easter Proclamation
(Exsultet)
18. Arriving at the altar, the Priest goes to his chair, gives his candle to a minister, puts
incense into the thurible and blesses the incense as at the Gospel at Mass. The Deacon
goes to the Priest and saying, Your blessing, Father, asks for and receives a blessing from
the Priest, who says in a low voice:

May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips,
that you may proclaim his paschal praise worthily and well,
in the name of the Father and of the Son,  and of the Holy Spirit.
The Deacon replies: Amen.
This blessing is omitted if the Proclamation is made by someone who is not a
Deacon.
19. The Deacon, after incensing the book and the candle, proclaims the Easter
Proclamation (Exsultet) at the ambo or at a lectern, with all standing and holding lighted
candles in their hands.
The Easter Proclamation may be made, in the absence of a Deacon, by the Priest
himself or by another concelebrating Priest. If, however, because of necessity, a lay
cantor sings the Proclamation, the words Therefore, dearest friends up to the end of the
invitation are omitted, along with the greeting The Lord be with you.
The Proclamation may also be sung in the shorter form (pp. 000-000).

Exult, let them exult, the hosts of heaven,

Be glad, let earth be glad, as glory floods her,
ablaze with light from her eternal King,
let all corners of the earth be glad,
knowing an end to gloom and darkness.
Rejoice, let Mother Church also rejoice,
arrayed with the lightning of his glory,
let this holy building shake with joy,
filled with the mighty voices of the peoples.

(Therefore, dearest friends,
standing in the awesome glory of this holy light,
invoke with me, I ask you,
the mercy of God almighty,
that he, who has been pleased to number me,
though unworthy, among the Levites,
may pour into me his light unshadowed,
that I may sing this candle’s perfect praises).
(V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.)
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just,
with ardent love of mind and heart
and with devoted service of our voice,
to acclaim our God invisible, the almighty Father,
and Jesus Christ, our Lord, his Son, his Only Begotten.
Who for our sake paid Adam’s debt to the eternal Father,
and, pouring out his own dear Blood,
wiped clean the record of our ancient sinfulness.
These, then, are the feasts of Passover,
in which is slain the Lamb, the one true Lamb,
whose Blood anoints the doorposts of believers.
This is the night,
when once you led our forebears, Israel’s children,
from slavery in Egypt
and made them pass dry-shod through the Red Sea.
This is the night
that with a pillar of fire
banished the darkness of sin.
This is the night
that even now, throughout the world,
sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices
and from the gloom of sin,
leading them to grace
and joining them to his holy ones.

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

This is the night,
when Christ broke the prison-bars of death
and rose victorious from the underworld.
Our birth would have been no gain,
had we not been redeemed.
O wonder of your humble care for us!
O love, O charity beyond all telling,
to ransom a slave you gave away your Son!
O truly necessary sin of Adam,
destroyed completely by the Death of Christ!
O happy fault
that earned so great, so glorious a Redeemer!
O truly blessed night,
worthy alone to know the time and hour
when Christ rose from the underworld!
This is the night
of which it is written:
The night shall be as bright as day,
dazzling is the night for me,
and full of gladness.
The sanctifying power of this night
dispels wickedness, washes faults away,
restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to mourners,
drives out hatred, fosters concord, and brings down the mighty.
On this, your night of grace, O holy Father,
accept this candle, a solemn offering,
the work of bees and of your servants’ hands,
an evening sacrifice of praise,
this gift from your most holy Church.
But now we know the praises of this pillar,
which glowing fire ignites for God’s honor,
a fire into many flames divided,
yet never dimmed by sharing of its light,
for it is fed by melting wax,
drawn out by mother bees
to build a torch so precious.
O truly blessed night,
when things of heaven are wed to those of earth,
and divine to the human.

THE EASTER VIGIL

Therefore, O Lord,
we pray you that this candle,
hallowed to the honor of your name,
may persevere undimmed,
to overcome the darkness of this night.
Receive it as a pleasing fragrance,
and let it mingle with the lights of heaven.
May this flame be found still burning
by the Morning Star:
the one Morning Star who never sets,
Christ your Son,
who, coming back from death’s domain,
has shed his peaceful light on humanity,
and lives and reigns for ever and ever.

THE EASTER VIGIL

SECOND PART:
THE LITURGY OF THE WORD
20. In this Vigil, the mother of all Vigils, nine readings are provided, namely seven from
the Old Testament and two from the New (the Epistle and Gospel), all of which should be
read whenever this can be done, so that the character of the Vigil, which demands an
extended period of time, may be preserved.
21. Nevertheless, where more serious pastoral circumstances demand it, the number of
readings from the Old Testament may be reduced, always bearing in mind that the
reading of the Word of God is a fundamental part of this Easter Vigil. At least three
readings should be read from the Old Testament, both from the Law and from the
Prophets, and their respective Responsorial Psalms should be sung. Never, moreover,
should the reading of chapter 14 of Exodus with its canticle be omitted.
22. After setting aside their candles, all sit. Before the readings begin, the Priest instructs
the people in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
now that we have begun our solemn Vigil,
let us listen with quiet hearts to the Word of God.
Let us meditate on how God in times past saved his people
and in these, the last days, has sent us his Son as our Redeemer.
Let us pray that our God may complete this paschal work of salvation
by the fullness of redemption.
23. Then the readings follow. A reader goes to the ambo and proclaims the reading.
Afterwards a psalmist or a cantor sings or says the Psalm with the people making the
response. Then all rise, the Priest says, Let us pray and, after all have prayed for a while
in silence, he says the prayer corresponding to the reading. In place of the Responsorial
Psalm a period of sacred silence may be observed, in which case the pause after Let us
pray is omitted.

184

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

Prayers after the Readings
24. After the first reading (On creation: Gn 1: 1-2: 2 or 1: 1, 26-31a) and the Psalm (104
[103] or 33 [32]).

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
who are wonderful in the ordering of all your works,
may those you have redeemed understand
that there exists nothing more marvelous
than the world’s creation in the beginning
except that, at the end of the ages,
Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or, On the creation of man:

O God, who wonderfully created human nature
and still more wonderfully redeemed it,
grant us, we pray,
to set our minds against the enticements of sin,
that we may merit to attain eternal joys.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
25. After the second reading (On Abraham’s sacrifice: Gn 22: 1-18 or 1-2, 9a, 10-13, 1518) and the Psalm (16 [15]).

Let us pray.
O God, supreme Father of the faithful,
who increase the children of your promise
by pouring out the grace of adoption
throughout the whole world
and who through the Paschal Mystery
make your servant Abraham father of nations,
as once you swore,
grant, we pray,
that your peoples may enter worthily
into the grace to which you call them.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

THE EASTER VIGIL

26. After the third reading (On the passage through the Red Sea: Ex 14: 15-15: 1) and its
canticle (Ex 15).

Let us pray.
O God, whose ancient wonders
remain undimmed in splendor even in our day,
for what you once bestowed on a single people,
freeing them from Pharaoh’s persecution
by the power of your right hand
now you bring about as the salvation of the nations
through the waters of rebirth,
grant, we pray, that the whole world
may become children of Abraham
and inherit the dignity of Israel’s birthright.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or:

O God, who by the light of the New Testament
have unlocked the meaning
of wonders worked in former times,
so that the Red Sea prefigures the sacred font
and the nation delivered from slavery
foreshadows the Christian people,
grant, we pray, that all nations,
obtaining the privilege of Israel by merit of faith,
may be reborn by partaking of your Spirit.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
27. After the fourth reading (On the new Jerusalem: Is 54: 5-14) and the Psalm (30
[29]).

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
surpass, for the honor of your name,
what you pledged to the Patriarchs by reason of their faith,
and through sacred adoption increase the children of your promise,
so that what the Saints of old never doubted would come to pass
your Church may now see in great part fulfilled.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

Alternatively, other prayers may be used from among those which follow the

28. After the fifth reading (On salvation freely offered to all: Is 55: 1-11) and the canticle
(Is 12).

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
sole hope of the world,
who by the preaching of your Prophets
unveiled the mysteries of this present age,
graciously increase the longing of your people,
for only at the prompting of your grace
do the faithful progress in any kind of virtue.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
29. After the sixth reading (On the fountain of wisdom: Bar 3: 9-15, 31-4: 4) and the
Psalm (19 [18]).

Let us pray.
O God, who constantly increase your Church
by your call to the nations,
graciously grant
to those you wash clean in the waters of Baptism
the assurance of your unfailing protection.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
30. After the seventh reading (On a new heart and new spirit: Ez 36: 16-28) and the
Psalm (42-43 [41-42]).

Let us pray.
O God of unchanging power and eternal light,
look with favor on the wondrous mystery of the whole Church
and serenely accomplish the work of human salvation,
which you planned from all eternity;
may the whole world know and see
that what was cast down is raised up,
what had become old is made new,
and all things are restored to integrity through Christ,
just as by him they came into being.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.

THE EASTER VIGIL

Or:

O God, who by the pages of both Testaments
instruct and prepare us to celebrate the Paschal Mystery,
grant that we may comprehend your mercy,
so that the gifts we receive from you this night
may confirm our hope of the gifts to come.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
31. After the last reading from the Old Testament with its Responsorial Psalm and its
prayer, the altar candles are lit, and the Priest intones the hymn Gloria in excelsis Deo
(Glory to God in the highest), which is taken up by all, while bells are rung, according to
local custom.

[GloriaPub]
32.

When the hymn is concluded, the Priest says the Collect in the usual way.

Let us pray.
O God, who make this most sacred night radiant
with the glory of the Lord’s Resurrection,
stir up in your Church a spirit of adoption,
so that, renewed in body and mind,
we may render you undivided service.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
33. Then the reader proclaims the reading from the Apostle.
34. After the Epistle has been read, all rise, then the Priest solemnly intones the Alleluia
three times, raising his voice by a step each time, with all repeating it. If necessary, the
psalmist intones the Alleluia.

[AlleluiaPub]
Then the psalmist or cantor proclaims Psalm 118 (117) with the people responding
Alleluia.
35. The Priest, in the usual way, puts incense in the thurible and blesses the Deacon. At
the Gospel lights are not carried, but only incense.
36. After the Gospel, the Homily, even if brief, is not to be omitted.

188

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

THIRD PART:
BAPTISMAL LITURGY
37. After the Homily the Baptismal Liturgy begins. The Priest goes with the ministers to
the baptismal font, if this can be seen by the faithful. Otherwise a vessel with water is
placed in the sanctuary.
38. Catechumens, if there are any, are called forward and presented by their godparents
in front of the assembled Church or, if they are small children, are carried by their parents
and godparents.
39. Then, if there is to be a procession to the baptistery or to the font, it forms
immediately. A minister with the paschal candle leads off, and those to be baptized
follow him with their godparents, then the ministers, the Deacon, and the Priest. During
the procession, the Litany (no. 43) is sung. When the Litany is completed, the Priest gives
the address (no. 40).
40. If, however, the Baptismal Liturgy takes place in the sanctuary, the Priest
immediately makes an introductory statement in these or similar words.
If there are candidates to be baptized:

[BaptismalLiturgy1Pub]

Dearly beloved,
with one heart and one soul, let us by our prayers
come to the aid of these our brothers and sisters in their blessed hope,
so that, as they approach the font of rebirth,
the almighty Father may bestow on them
all his merciful help.
If the font is to be blessed, but no one is to be baptized:

[BaptismalLiturgy2Pub]

Dearly beloved,
let us humbly invoke upon this font
the grace of God the almighty Father,
that those who from it are born anew
may be numbered among the children of adoption in Christ.
41. The Litany is sung by two cantors, with all standing (because it is Easter Time) and
responding.
If, however, there is to be a procession of some length to the baptistery, the Litany is
sung during the procession; in this case, those to be baptized are called forward before the
procession begins, and the procession takes place led by the paschal candle, followed by
the catechumens with their godparents, then the ministers, the Deacon, and the Priest.
The address should occur before the Blessing of Water.

189

THE EASTER VIGIL

________________________________________________________________________
42. If no one is to be baptized and the font is not to be blessed, the Litany is omitted, and
the Blessing of Water (no. 54) takes place at once.
________________________________________________________________________
43. In the Litany the names of some Saints may be added, especially the Titular Saint of
the church and the Patron Saints of the place and of those to be baptized.

[PaschalVigil1Pub]
[PaschalVigil2Pub]
[PaschalVigil3Pub]
If there are candidates to be baptized, the Priest, with hands extended, says the following
prayer:

Almighty ever-living God,
be present by the mysteries of your great love
and send forth the spirit of adoption
to create the new peoples
brought to birth for you in the font of Baptism,
so that what is to be carried out by our humble service
may be brought to fulfillment by your mighty power.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

190

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

Blessing of Baptismal Water
44. The Priest then blesses the baptismal water, saying the following prayer with hands
extended:

[BaptismalWater1Pub]
[BaptismalWater2Pub]
[BaptismalWater3Pub]
And, if appropriate, lowering the paschal candle into the water either once or three times,
he continues:

[BaptismalWater4Pub]
and, holding the candle in the water, he continues:

[BaptismalWater5Pub]
45. Then the candle is lifted out of the water, as the people acclaim:

[BaptismalWater6Pub]
Text without music:
46. The Priest then blesses the baptismal water, saying the following prayer with hands
extended:

O God, who by invisible power
accomplish a wondrous effect
through sacramental signs
and who in many ways have prepared water, your creation,
to show forth the grace of Baptism;
O God, whose Spirit
in the first moments of the world’s creation
hovered over the waters,
so that the very substance of water
would even then take to itself the power to sanctify;
O God, who by the outpouring of the flood
foreshadowed regeneration,
so that from the mystery of one and the same element of water
would come an end to vice and a beginning of virtue;
O God, who caused the children of Abraham
to pass dry-shod through the Red Sea,
so that the chosen people,
set free from slavery to Pharaoh,
would prefigure the people of the baptized;

THE EASTER VIGIL

191

O God, whose Son,
baptized by John in the waters of the Jordan,
was anointed with the Holy Spirit,
and, as he hung upon the Cross,
gave forth water from his side along with blood,
and after his Resurrection, commanded his disciples:
“Go forth, teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,”
look now, we pray, upon the face of your Church
and graciously unseal for her the fountain of Baptism.
May this water receive by the Holy Spirit
the grace of your Only Begotten Son,
so that human nature, created in your image
and washed clean through the Sacrament of Baptism
from all the squalor of the life of old,
may be found worthy to rise to the life of newborn children
through water and the Holy Spirit.
And, if appropriate, lowering the paschal candle into the water either once or three times,
he continues:

May the power of the Holy Spirit,
O Lord, we pray,
come down through your Son
into the fullness of this font,
and, holding the candle in the water, he continues:

so that all who have been buried with Christ
by Baptism into death
may rise again to life with him.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
47. Then the candle is lifted out of the water, as the people acclaim:

Springs of water, bless the Lord;
praise and exalt him above all for ever.
48. After the blessing of baptismal water and the acclamation of the people, the Priest,
standing, puts the prescribed questions to the adults and the parents or godparents of the
children, as is set out in the respective Rites of the Roman Ritual, in order for them to
make the required renunciation.

192

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

If the anointing of the adults with the Oil of Catechumens has not taken place
beforehand, as part of the immediately preparatory rites, it occurs at this moment.
49. Then the Priest questions the adults individually about the faith and, if there are
children to be baptized, he requests the triple profession of faith from all the parents and
godparents together, as is indicated in the respective Rites.
Where many are to be baptized on this night, it is possible to arrange the rite so that,
immediately after the response of those to be baptized and of the godparents and the
parents, the Celebrant asks for and receives the renewal of baptismal promises of all
present.
50. When the interrogation is concluded, the Priest baptizes the adult elect and the
children.
51. After the Baptism, the Priest anoints the infants with chrism. A white garment is
given to each, whether adults or children. Then the Priest or Deacon receives the paschal
candle from the hand of the minister, and the candles of the newly baptized are lighted.
For infants the rite of Ephphetha is omitted.
52. Afterwards, unless the baptismal washing and the other explanatory rites have
occurred in the sanctuary, a procession returns to the sanctuary, formed as before, with
the newly baptized or the godparents or parents carrying lighted candles. During this
procession, the baptismal canticle Vidi aquam (I saw water) or another appropriate chant
is sung (no. 56).
53. If adults have been baptized, the Bishop or, in his absence, the Priest who has
conferred Baptism, should at once administer the Sacrament of Confirmation to them in
the sanctuary, as is indicated in the Roman Pontifical or Roman Ritual.

193

THE EASTER VIGIL

The Blessing of Water
54. If no one present is to be baptized and the font is not to be blessed, the Priest
introduces the faithful to the blessing of water, saying:

[BaptismalWater7Pub]
And after a brief pause in silence, he proclaims the following prayer with hands
extended:

[BaptismalWater8Pub]
[BaptismalWater9Pub]
Text without music:

Dear brothers and sisters,
let us humbly beseech the Lord our God
to bless this water he has created,
which will be sprinkled upon us
as a memorial of our Baptism.
May he graciously renew us,
that we may remain faithful to the Spirit
whom we have received.
And after a brief pause in silence, he proclaims the following prayer, with hands
extended:

Lord our God,
in your mercy be present to your people
who keep vigil on this most sacred night,
and, for us who recall the wondrous work of our creation
and the still greater work of our redemption,
graciously bless this water.
For you created water to make the fields fruitful
and to refresh and cleanse our bodies.
You also made water the instrument of your mercy:
for through water you freed your people from slavery
and quenched their thirst in the desert;
through water the Prophets proclaimed the new covenant
you were to enter upon with the human race;
and last of all,
through water, which Christ made holy in the Jordan,
you have renewed our corrupted nature
in the bath of regeneration.

194

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

Therefore, may this water be for us
a memorial of the Baptism we have received,
and grant that we may share
in the gladness of our brothers and sisters,
who at Easter have received their Baptism.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
________________________________________________________________________

The Renewal of Baptismal Promises
55. When the Rite of Baptism (and Confirmation) has been completed or, if this has not
taken place, after the blessing of water, all stand, holding lighted candles in their hands,
and renew the promise of baptismal faith, unless this has already been done together with
those to be baptized (cf. no. 49).
The Priest addresses the faithful in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), through the Paschal Mystery
we have been buried with Christ in Baptism,
so that we may walk with him in newness of life.
And so, now that our Lenten observance is concluded,
let us renew the promises of Holy Baptism,
by which we once renounced Satan and his works
and promised to serve God in the holy Catholic Church.
And so I ask you:
Priest:
All:

Do you renounce Satan?
I do.

Priest:
All:

And all his works?
I do.

Priest:
All:

And all his empty show?
I do.

Or:

the author and prince of sin?

Then the Priest continues:

Do you believe in God,

I do.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,

suffered death and was buried,
rose again from the dead
and is seated at the right hand of the Father?
I do.
Do you believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting?
I do.

And the Priest concludes:

And may almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has given us new birth by water and the Holy Spirit
and bestowed on us forgiveness of our sins,
keep us by his grace,
in Christ Jesus our Lord,
for eternal life.
All: Amen.
56. The Priest sprinkles the people with the blessed water, while all sing:

Antiphon
[BaptismalWater10Pub.tif]
Or:

[BaptismalWater11Pub.tif]
Ant. I saw water flowing from the Temple,

from its right-hand side, alleluia;
and all to whom this water came were saved
and shall say: Alleluia, alleluia.

196

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

Another chant that is baptismal in character may also be sung.
57. Meanwhile the newly baptized are led to their place among the faithful.
If the blessing of baptismal water has not taken place in the baptistery, the Deacon
and the ministers reverently carry the vessel of water to the font.
If the blessing of the font has not occurred, the blessed water is put aside in an
appropriate place.
58. After the sprinkling, the Priest returns to the chair where, omitting the Creed, he
directs the Universal Prayer, in which the newly baptized participate for the first time.

FOURTH PART:
THE LITURGY OF THE EUCHARIST
59. The Priest goes to the altar and begins the Liturgy of the Eucharist in the usual way.
60. It is desirable that the bread and wine be brought forward by the newly baptized or, if
they are children, by their parents or godparents.
61. Prayer over the Offerings

Accept, we ask, O Lord,
the prayers of your people
with the sacrificial offerings,
that what has begun in the paschal mysteries
may, by the working of your power,
bring us to the healing of eternity.
Through Christ our Lord.
62. Preface I of Easter: The Paschal Mystery (... on this night above all ...), p. 000.
63. In the Eucharistic Prayer, a commemoration is made of the baptized and their
godparents in accord with the formulas which are found in the Roman Missal and Roman
Ritual for each of the Eucharistic Prayers.
64. Before the Ecce Agnus Dei (Behold the Lamb of God), the Priest may briefly address
the newly baptized about receiving their first Communion and about the excellence of
this great mystery, which is the climax of Initiation and the center of the whole of
Christian life.
65. It is desirable that the newly baptized receive Holy Communion under both kinds,
together with their godfathers, godmothers, and Catholic parents and spouses, as well as
their lay catechists. It is even appropriate that, with the consent of the Diocesan Bishop,
where the occasion suggests this, all the faithful be admitted to Holy Communion under
both kinds.
66. Communion Antiphon

Christ our Passover has been sacrificed;
therefore let as keep the feast

Through Christ our Lord.
68. Solemn Blessing

May almighty God bless you
through today’s Easter Solemnity
and, in his compassion,
defend you from every assault of sin.
R. Amen.
And may he, who restores you to eternal life
in the Resurrection of his Only Begotten,
endow you with the prize of immortality.
R. Amen.
Now that the days of the Lord’s Passion have drawn to a close,
may you who celebrate the gladness of the Paschal Feast
come with Christ’s help, and exulting in spirit,
to those feasts that are celebrated in eternal joy.
R. Amen.
And may the blessing of almighty God,
the Father, and the Son,  and the Holy Spirit,
come down on you and remain with you for ever.
R. Amen.
The final blessing formula from the Rite of Baptism of Adults or of Children may
also be used, according to circumstances.
69. To dismiss the people the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself

sings or says:
[Dismissal5Pub]
Or:

[Dismissal6Pub]
All reply:

This practice is observed throughout the Octave of Easter.
70. The paschal candle is lit in all the more solemn liturgical celebrations of this period.

PENTECOST SUNDAY
Solemnity

At the Vigil Mass
Extended form
This Vigil Mass may be celebrated on the Saturday evening, either before or
after First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Pentecost Sunday.
1. In churches where the Vigil Mass is celebrated in an extended form, this may be done
as follows.
2. a) If First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) celebrated in choir or in common immediately
precede Mass, the celebration may begin either from the introductory verse and the hymn
(Veni, creátor Spíritus) or else from the singing of the Entrance Antiphon with the
procession and greeting of the Priest; in either case the Penitential Act is omitted (cf.
General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours, nos. 94 and 96).
Then the Psalmody prescribed for Vespers follows, up to but not including the Short
Reading.
After the Psalmody, omitting the Penitential Act, and if appropriate, the Kyrie, (Lord,
have mercy), the Priest says the prayer Grant, we pray, almighty God, that the splendor,
as at the Vigil Mass.
3. b) If Mass is begun in the usual way, after the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), the Priest
says the prayer Grant, we pray, almighty God, that the splendor, as at the Vigil Mass.
Then the Priest may address the people in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
we have now begun our Pentecost Vigil,
after the example of the Apostles and disciples,
who with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, persevered in prayer,
awaiting the Spirit promised by the Lord;
like them, let us, too, listen with quiet hearts to the Word of God.
Let us meditate on how many great deeds
God in times past did for his people
and let us pray that the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father sent as the first fruits for those who believe,
may bring to perfection his work in the world.
4. Then follow the readings proposed as options in the Lectionary. A reader goes to the
ambo and proclaims the reading. Afterwards a psalmist or a cantor sings or says the
Psalm with the people making the response. Then all rise, the Priest says, Let us pray and,
after all have prayed for a while in silence, he says the prayer corresponding to the
reading. In place of the Responsorial Psalm a period of sacred silence may be observed,
in which case the pause after Let us pray is omitted.

Text without music:

V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For, bringing your Paschal Mystery to completion,
you bestowed the Holy Spirit today
on those you made your adopted children
by uniting them to your Only Begotten Son.
This same Spirit, as the Church came to birth,
opened to all peoples the knowledge of God
and brought together the many languages of the earth
in profession of the one faith.
Therefore, overcome with paschal joy,
every land, every people exults in your praise
and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts,
sing together the unending hymn of your glory,
as they acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
When the Roman Canon is used, the proper form of the Communicantes (In communion

With Easter Time now concluded, the paschal candle is extinguished. It is desirable
to keep the paschal candle in the baptistery with due honor so that it is lit at the
celebration of Baptism and the candles of those baptized are lit from it.
Where the Monday or Tuesday after Pentecost are days on which the faithful are
obliged or accustomed to attend Mass, the Mass of Pentecost Sunday may be repeated, or
a Mass of the Holy Spirit, pp. 0000-0000, may be said.

ORDINARY TIME

1. Ordinary Time contains thirty-three or thirty-four weeks. It begins on the Monday
following the Sunday after January 6 and continues until the beginning of Lent; it begins
again on the Monday after Pentecost Sunday and ends on the Saturday before the First
Sunday of Advent.
2. The numbering of Sundays and weeks in Ordinary Time is calculated as follows:
a) The Sunday on which the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord occurs takes the place
of the first Sunday in Ordinary Time; the week that follows is counted as the first week in
Ordinary Time. The remaining Sundays and weeks are numbered in order until the
beginning of Lent.
b) If there are thirty-four weeks in Ordinary Time, after Pentecost the series is
resumed with the week that follows immediately the last week celebrated before Lent; it
should be noted, however, that the Masses of Pentecost Sunday and of the Solemnity of
the Most Holy Trinity take the place of the Sunday Masses. If, however, there are thirtythree weeks in Ordinary Time, the first week that would otherwise follow Pentecost is
omitted.
3. Thus, in the Missal, thirty-four Masses for the Sundays and weekdays in Ordinary
Time are found. They are used in this way:
a) On Sundays the Mass corresponding to the number of the Sunday in Ordinary
Time is ordinarily used, unless there occurs a Solemnity or a Feast of the Lord which
takes the place of the Sunday.
b) On weekdays, however, any of the thirty-four Masses may be used, provided the
pastoral needs of the faithful are taken into consideration.
4. The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) and the Creed are said on
Sundays; on weekdays, however, both are omitted.
5. Unless a Eucharistic Prayer is used that has a proper Preface, on Sundays one of the
Prefaces for Sundays in Ordinary Time is said, pp. 000-000; but on weekdays, a Common
Preface is said, pp. 000-000.
6. Two antiphons are provided for Communion, the first from the Psalms, and the
second for the most part from the Gospel. One or the other may be selected, as
circumstances suggest, but preference should be given to an antiphon that is in harmony
with the Gospel of the Mass.

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
Text without music:

V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For with your Only Begotten Son and the Holy Spirit
you are one God, one Lord:
not in the unity of a single person,
but in a Trinity of one substance.
For what you have revealed to us of your glory
we believe equally of your Son
and of the Holy Spirit,
so that, in the confessing of the true and eternal Godhead,
you might be adored in what is proper to each Person,
their unity in substance,
and their equality in majesty.
For this is praised by Angels and Archangels,
Cherubim, too, and Seraphim,
who never cease to cry out each day,
as with one voice they acclaim:
Communion Antiphon
Since you are children of God,
God has sent into your hearts the Spirit of his Son,
the Spirit who cries out: Abba, Father.
Prayer after Communion
May receiving this Sacrament, O Lord our God,
bring us health of body and soul,
as we confess your eternal holy Trinity and undivided Unity.

It is desirable that a procession take place after the Mass in which the Host to be carried
in the procession is consecrated. However, nothing prohibits a procession from taking
place even after a public and lengthy period of adoration following the Mass. If a
procession takes place after Mass, when the Communion of the faithful is over, the
monstrance in which the consecrated host has been placed is set on the altar. When the
Prayer after Communion has been said, the Concluding Rites are omitted and the
procession forms.
