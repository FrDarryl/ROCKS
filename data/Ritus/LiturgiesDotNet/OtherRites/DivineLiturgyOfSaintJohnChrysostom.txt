The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom
__________________________________________________________________

The Divine Liturgy of John Chrysostom is the most common liturgy of the
Eastern Orthodox Church, used on most Sundays and Holy Days. It is a
shortened form of the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil, and is related to
the Divine Liturgy of James of Jerusalem, which is traditionally
attributed to James the Just, who was the first Bishop of Jerusalem,
and who is called the brother of Jesus.

Holy God, You dwell among Your saints. You are praised by the Seraphim with
the thrice holy hymn and glorified by the Cherubim and worshiped by all the
heavenly powers. You have brought all things out of nothing into being. You
have created man and woman in Your image and likeness and adorned them with
all the gifts of Your grace. You give wisdom and understanding to the
supplicant and do not overlook the sinner but have established repentance as
the way of salvation. You have enabled us, Your lowly and unworthy servants,
to stand at this hour before the glory of Your holy altar and to offer to
You due worship and praise. Master, accept the thrice holy hymn also from
the lips of us sinners and visit us in Your goodness. Forgive our voluntary
and involuntary transgressions, sanctify our souls and bodies, and grant

The Great Entrance
__________________________________________________________________

People:
We who mystically represent the Cherubim sing the thrice holy
hymn to the life giving Trinity. Let us set aside all the cares
of life that we may receive the King of all...

Priest (While the Cherubic Hymn is being sung, the priest prays in a
low voice):

No one bound by worldly desires and pleasures is worthy to approach, draw
near or minister to You, the King of glory. To serve You is great and
awesome even for the heavenly powers. But because of Your ineffable and
immeasurable love for us, You became man without alteration or change. You
have served as our High Priest, and as Lord of all, and have entrusted to us
the celebration of this liturgical sacrifice without the shedding of blood.
For You alone, Lord our God, rule over all things in heaven and on earth.
You are seated on the throne of the Cherubim, the Lord of the Seraphim and
the King of Israel. You alone are holy and dwell among Your saints. You
alone are good and ready to hear. Therefore, I implore You, look upon me,
Your sinful and unworthy servant, and cleanse my soul and heart from evil
consciousness. Enable me by the power of Your Holy Spirit so that, vested
with the grace of priesthood, I may stand before Your holy Table and
celebrate the mystery of Your holy and pure Body and Your precious Blood. To
You I come with bowed head and pray: do not turn Your face away from me or
reject me from among Your children, but make me, Your sinful and unworthy
servant, worthy to offer to You these gifts. For You, Christ our God, are
the Offerer and the Offered, the One who receives and is distributed, and to
You we give glory, together with Your eternal Father and Your holy, good and
life giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

(The priest censes and recites in a low voice:)
Priest:

We who mystically represent the Cherubim sing the thrice holy hymn to the
life giving Trinity. Let us set aside all the cares of life that we may
receive the King of all...

(On Sundays)

Having beheld the resurrection of Christ, let us worship the holy Lord
Jesus, the only Sinless One. We venerate Your cross, O Christ, and we praise
and glorify You holy resurrection. You are our God. We know no other than
You, and we call upon Your name. Come, all faithful, let us venerate the
holy resurrection of Christ. For behold, through the cross joy has come to
all the world. Blessing the Lord always, let us praise His resurrection. For
enduring the cross for us, he destroyed death by death.

Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your great mercy; and according to
the multitude of Your compassion, blot out my transgression. Wash me
thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge
my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against You, You only, have I
sinned, and done evil in Your sight, that You may be found just when You
speak, and victorious when You are judged. For behold, I was conceived in
iniquity, and in sin my mother bore me. For behold, You have loved truth;
You have made known to me the secret and hidden thing of Your wisdom. you
shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; You shall wash me,
and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the
afflicted bones may rejoice. Turn Your face away from my sins, and blot out
all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast
spirit within me. Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your
Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and establish
me with Your governing Spirit. I shall teach transgressors Your ways, and
the ungodly shall turn back to You. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall joyfully declare Your
righteousness. Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall proclaim Your praise.
For if You had desired sacrifice, I would give it; You do not delight in
burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; God will not despise
a broken and a humbled heart. Do good in Your good pleasure to Sion; and let
the walls of Jerusalem be built. Then You shall be pleased with a sacrifice
of righteousness, with oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they shall
offer bulls on Your altar.

(Then the Great Entrance takes place.)
Deacon:
May the Lord God remember all of you in His kingdom, now and
forever and to the ages of ages.

People:
Amen.

(The priest enters the sanctuary, while the people sing the end of the
Cherubic Hymn.)

People:
...invisibly escorted by the angelic hosts. Alleluia. Alleluia.
Alleluia.

The Creed
__________________________________________________________________

People:
I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, Creator of
heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God,
begotten of the Father before all ages. Light of Light, true God
of true God, begotten, not created, of one essence with the
Father, through whom all things were made.
For us and for our salvation, He came down from heaven and was
incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.
He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and He suffered
and was buried.
On the third day He rose according to the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the
Father.
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.
His kingdom will have no end.
And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who
proceeds from the Father, who together with the Father and the
Son is worshiped and glorified, who spoke through the prophets.
In one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.
I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
I expect the resurrection of the dead.
And the life of the age to come. Amen.

worship You in all places of Your dominion; for You are God ineffable,
beyond comprehension, invisible, beyond understanding, existing forever and
always the same; You and Your only begotten Son and Your Holy Spirit. You
brought us into being out of nothing, and when we fell, You raised us up
again. You did not cease doing everything until You led us to heaven and
granted us Your kingdom to come. For all these things we thank You and Your
only begotten Son and Your Holy Spirit; for all things that we know and do
not know, for blessings seen and unseen that have been bestowed upon us. We
also thank You for this liturgy which You are pleased to accept from our
hands, even though You are surrounded by thousands of Archangels and tens of
thousands of Angels, by the Cherubim and Seraphim, six-winged, many-eyed,
soaring with their wings,

Priest:

Your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is He who comes in

Together with these blessed powers, merciful Master, we also proclaim and
say: You are holy and most holy, You and Your only begotten Son and Your
Holy Spirit. You are holy and most holy, and sublime is Your glory. You so
loved Your world that You gave Your only begotten Son so that whoever
believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. He came and
fulfilled the divine plan for us. On the night when He was delivered up, or
rather when He gave Himself up for the life of the world, He took bread in
His holy, pure, and blameless hands, gave thanks, blessed, sanctified, broke
and gave it to His holy disciples and apostles, saying:

Priest:
Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you for the
forgiveness of sins.

People:
Amen.

Priest (in a low voice):

Likewise, after supper, He took the cup, saying:

Priest:
Drink of it all of you; this is my Blood of the new Covenant
which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.

People:
Amen.

Priest (in a low voice):

Remembering, therefore, this command of the Savior, and all that came to
pass for our sake, the cross, the tomb, the resurrection on the third day,
the ascension into heaven, the enthronement at the right hand of the Father,
and the second, glorious coming,

Priest:
We offer to You these gifts from Your own gifts in all and for
all.

People:
We praise You, we bless You, we give thanks to You, and we pray
to You, Lord our God.

Priest (in a low voice):

Once again we offer to You this spiritual worship without the shedding of
blood, and we ask, pray, and entreat You: send down Your Holy Spirit upon us
and upon these gifts here presented.

And make this bread the precious Body of Your Christ.

(He blesses the holy Bread.)
Deacon (in a low voice):

Amen.

Priest (in a low voice):

And that which is in this cup the precious Blood of Your Christ.

(He blesses the holy Cup.)
Deacon (in a low voice):

Amen.

Priest (in a low voice):

Changing them by Your Holy Spirit.

(He blesses them both.)
Deacon (in a low voice):

Amen. Amen. Amen.

Priest (in a low voice):

So that they may be to those who partake of them for vigilance of soul,
forgiveness of sins, communion of Your Holy Spirit, fulfillment of the
kingdom of heaven, confidence before You, and not in judgment or
condemnation. Again, we offer this spiritual worship for those who repose in
the faith, forefathers, fathers, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, preachers,
evangelists, martyrs, confessors, ascetics, and for every righteous spirit
made perfect in faith.

Priest:
Especially for our most holy, pure, blessed, and glorious Lady,
the Theotokos and ever virgin Mary.

People:
It is truly right to bless you, Theotokos, ever blessed, most
pure, and mother of our God. More honorable than the Cherubim,
and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without
corruption you gave birth to God the Word. We magnify you, the
true Theotokos.

Priest (in a low voice):

For Saint John the prophet, forerunner, and baptist; for the holy glorious
and most honorable Apostles; for Saint(s) (Name-s), whose memory we
commemorate today; and for all Your saints, through whose supplications, O
God, bless us. Remember also all who have fallen asleep in the hope of
resurrection unto eternal life. (Here the priest commemorates the names of
the deceased.) And grant them rest, our God, where the light of Your
countenance shines. Again, we ask You, Lord, remember all Orthodox bishops
who rightly teach the word of Your truth, all presbyters, all deacons in the
service of Christ, and every one in holy orders. We also offer to You this
spiritual worship for the whole world, for the holy, catholic, and apostolic
Church, and for those living in purity and holiness. And for all those in
public service; permit them, Lord, to serve and govern in peace that through
the faithful conduct of their duties we may live peaceful and serene lives
in all piety and holiness.

Priest:
Above all, remember, Lord, our Archbishop (Name) and our Bishop
(Name): Grant that they may serve Your holy churches in peace.
Keep them safe, honorable, and healthy for many years, rightly
teaching the word of Your truth.

Deacon:
Remember also, Lord, those whom each of us calls to mind and all
Your people.

People:
And all Your people.

Priest (in a low voice):

Remember, Lord, the city in which we live, every city and country, and the
faithful who dwell in them. Remember, Lord, the travelers, the sick, the
suffering, and the captives, granting them protection and salvation.
Remember, Lord, those who do charitable work, who serve in Your holy
churches, and who care for the poor. And send Your mercy upon us all.

Priest:
And grant that with one voice and one heart we may glorify and
praise Your most honored and majestic name, of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of
ages.

People:
Amen.

Priest:
The mercy of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ be with all
of you.

People:
And with your spirit.

Deacon:
Having remembered all the saints, let us again in peace pray to
the Lord.

People:
Lord have mercy.

Deacon:
For the precious Gifts offered and consecrated, let us pray to
the Lord.

People:
Lord have mercy.

Deacon:
That our loving God who has received them at His holy, heavenly,
and spiritual altar as an offering of spiritual fragrance, may
in return send upon us divine grace and the gift of the Holy
Spirit, let us pray.

People:
Lord have mercy.

Deacon:
Having prayed for the unity of faith and for the communion of
the Holy Spirit, let us commit ourselves, and one another, and
our whole life to Christ our God.

People:
To You, O Lord.

Priest (in a low voice):

We entrust to You, loving Master, our whole life and hope, and we ask, pray,
and entreat: make us worthy to partake of your heavenly and awesome
Mysteries from this holy and spiritual Table with a clear conscience; for
the remission of sins, forgiveness of transgressions, communion of the Holy
Spirit, inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, confidence before You, and not
in judgment or condemnation.

Priest:
And make us worthy, Master, with confidence and without fear of
condemnation, to dare call You, the heavenly God, Father, and to
say:
__________________________________________________________________

The Lord's Prayer
__________________________________________________________________

People:
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us,
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

Priest:
For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory of the
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to
the ages of ages.

People:
Amen.

Priest:
Peace be with all.

People:
And with your spirit.

Deacon:
Let us bow our heads to the Lord.

People:
To You, O Lord.

Priest (in a low voice):

We give thanks to You, invisible King. By Your infinite power You created
all things and by Your great mercy You brought everything from nothing into
being. Master, look down from heaven upon those who have bowed their heads
before You; they have bowed not before flesh and blood but before You the
awesome God. Therefore, Master, guide the course of our life for our benefit
according to the need of each of us. Sail with those who sail; travel with
those who travel; and heal the sick, Physician of our souls and bodies.

Priest:
By the grace, mercy, and love for us of Your only begotten Son,
with whom You are blessed, together with Your all holy, good,
and life giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

People:
Amen.

Priest (in a low voice):

Lord Jesus Christ, our God, hear us from Your holy dwelling place and from
the glorious throne of Your kingdom. You are enthroned on high with the
Father and are also invisibly present among us. Come and sanctify us, and
let Your pure Body and precious Blood be given to us by Your mighty hand and
through us to all Your people.

Deacon:
Let us be attentive.

Priest:
The holy Gifts for the holy people of God.

People:
One is Holy, one is Lord, Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the
Father. Amen.
__________________________________________________________________

Holy Communion
__________________________________________________________________

People:
Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise Him in the highest.
Alleluia (3).

(The Communion Hymn changes according to the Feast Day.)
__________________________________________________________________

Priest (After the fraction of the sacred Bread, the priest says in a
low voice):

The Lamb of God is broken and distributed; broken but not divided. He is
forever eaten yet is never consumed, but He sanctifies those who partake of
Him.

(Then the priest places a portion of the sacred Bread in the Cup
saying:)

The fullness of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

(He then blesses the warm water saying:)

Blessed is the fervor of Your saints, now and forever and to the ages of
ages. Amen.

(Pouring the water into the Cup crosswise, he says:)

The warmth of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
__________________________________________________________________

(The Communion Prayers are recited silently by those prepared to
receive the holy Mysteries.)

People:

I believe and confess, Lord, that You are truly the Christ, the Son of the
living God, who came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the first.
I also believe that this is truly Your pure Body and that this is truly Your
precious Blood. Therefore, I pray to You, have mercy upon me, and forgive my
transgressions, voluntary and involuntary, in word and deed, known and
unknown. And make me worthy without condemnation to partake of Your pure
Mysteries for the forgiveness of sins and for life eternal. Amen.

How shall I, who am unworthy, enter into the splendor of Your saints? If I
dare to enter into the bridal chamber, my clothing will accuse me, since it
is not a wedding garment; and being bound up, I shall be cast out by the
angels. In Your love, Lord, cleanse my soul and save me.

Loving Master, Lord Jesus Christ, my God, let not these holy Gifts be to my
condemnation because of my unworthiness, but for the cleansing and
sanctification of soul and body and the pledge of the future life and
kingdom. It is good for me to cling to God and to place in Him the hope of
my salvation.

Receive me today, Son of God, as a partaker of Your mystical Supper. I will
not reveal Your mystery to Your adversaries. Nor will I give You a kiss as
did Judas. But as the thief I confess to You: Lord, remember me in Your
kingdom.
__________________________________________________________________

(The priest proceeds to receive holy Communion.)
Priest (in a low voice):

Behold, I approach Christ, our immortal King and God.

The precious and most holy Body of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ is
given to me (Name) the priest, for the forgiveness of my sins and eternal
life.

(He then partakes of the sacred Bread.)

The precious and most holy Blood of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ
is given to me (Name) the priest, for the forgiveness of my sins and eternal
life.

(He then drinks from the holy Cup. Afterwards, he wipes the holy Cup,
kisses it, and says:)

This has touched my lips, taking away my transgressions and cleansing my
sins.

(The priest then transfers the remaining portions of the consecrated
Bread into the holy Cup, saying:)

Having beheld the resurrection of Christ, let us worship the holy Lord
Jesus, the only Sinless One. We venerate Your cross, O Christ, and we praise
and glorify Your holy resurrection. You are our God. We know no other than
You, and we call upon Your name. Come, all faithful, let us venerate the
holy resurrection of Christ. For behold, through the cross joy has come to
all the world. Blessing the Lord always, let us praise His resurrection. For
enduring the cross for us, He destroyed death by death.

(The priest takes up the holy Cup, proceeds to the Royal Doors, raises
the holy Cup, and says:)

Deacon:
Approach with the fear of God, faith, and love.

(Those prepared come forth with reverence to receive Holy Communion
while the people sing the communion hymn.)

(When administering Holy Communion, the priest says:)
Priest:

The servant of God (Name) receives the Body and Blood of Christ for
forgiveness of sins and eternal life.

(After Communion has been given, the priest blesses the people,
saying:)

Priest:
Save, O God, Your people and bless Your inheritance.

People:
We have seen the true light; we have received the heavenly
Spirit; we have found the true faith, worshiping the undivided
Trinity, for the Trinity has saved us.

Priest (Returning to the holy Table, the priest transfers the portions
of the Theotokos and of the saints into the holy Cup. Then he
does the same for those of the living and the dead saying in a
low voice):

Wash away, Lord, by Your holy Blood, the sins of all those commemorated,
through the intercessions of the Theotokos and all Your saints. Amen.

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let Your glory be over all the earth
(3).

Priest (the priest lifts the holy Cup and says in a low voice):

Blessed is our God.

Priest:
Always, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

People:
Amen.
Let our mouths be filled with Your praise, Lord, that we may
sing of Your glory. You have made us worthy to partake of Your
holy mysteries. Keep us in Your holiness, that all the day long
we may meditate upon Your righteousness. Alleluia. Alleluia.
Alleluia.

Priest:
Let us depart in peace.

Deacon:
Let us pray to the Lord.

People:
Lord have mercy.

Priest:
Lord, bless those who praise You and sanctify those who trust in
You. Save Your people and bless Your inheritance. Protect the
whole body of Your Church. Sanctify those who love the beauty of
Your house. Glorify them in return by Your divine power, and do
not forsake us who hope in You. Grant peace to Your world, to
Your churches, to the clergy, to those in public service, to the
armed forces, and to all Your people. For every good and perfect
gift is from above, coming from You, the Father of lights. To
You we give glory, thanksgiving, and worship, to the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of
ages.

People:

the honorable, bodiless powers of heaven; the supplications of
the honorable, glorious, prophet, and forerunner John the
Baptist; the holy, glorious, and praiseworthy apostles; the
