PROPER OF SAINTS

1. The rank of the celebration, namely Solemnity, Feast, or Memorial, is indicated for
each day. If no other indication is given, the celebration is an Optional Memorial.
2. For each Solemnity and Feast a complete proper Mass is provided. This is therefore
said as printed.
3. As regards Memorials, the following are to be observed:
a) The proper texts proposed for certain days are always to be used.
b) Whenever there is a reference to a particular Common, the more appropriate texts
should be chosen according to the principles explained at the beginning of the Commons.
The page reference given in each case only indicates a text that is particularly suitable.
c) If, however, a reference is given to several Commons, one or other of them may be
used, with due regard for pastoral concerns; it is always allowed to exchange texts among
several Masses of the same Common.
For example, if a Saint is both a Martyr and a Bishop, either the Common of Martyrs
or the Common of Pastors (for Bishops) may be used.
d) Moreover, as well as the Commons that refer to a particular category of Saint (e.g.,
of Martyrs, Virgins, Pastors, etc.), it is always permitted to use the texts from the
Common of Holy Men and Women, which refers to Sainthood in general.
e) The Prayers over the Offerings and after Communion, unless they are proper, are
taken either from the Common or from the current time of the liturgical year.
4. The Masses contained in this Proper of Saints are also used as Votive Masses, with
the exception of Masses of the mysteries of the life of the Lord and of the Blessed Virgin
Mary (cf. General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 375) and also of Masses of
certain Saints for whom a special Votive Mass is provided. When Masses of the Proper of
Saints are used as Votive Masses, words in the prayers indicating the heavenly birthday
or the Solemnity or Feast are not used but are replaced by the word memorial or
commemoration.

THE PRESENTATION OF THE LORD
Feast
The Blessing of Candles and the Procession
First Form: The Procession
1. At an appropriate hour, a gathering takes place at a smaller church or other suitable
place other than inside the church to which the procession will go. The faithful hold in
their hands unlighted candles.
2. The Priest, wearing white vestments as for Mass, approaches with the ministers.
Instead of the chasuble, the Priest may wear a cope, which he leaves aside after the
procession is over.
3. While the candles are being lit, the following antiphon or another appropriate chant is
sung.

[63PresentationD2Pub, 63PresentationD1Pub]
4. When the chant is concluded, the Priest, facing the people, says: In the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Then the Priest greets the people in the
usual way, and next he gives an introductory address, encouraging the faithful to
celebrate the rite of this feast day actively and consciously. He may use these or similar
words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
forty days have passed since we celebrated the joyful feast
of the Nativity of the Lord.
Today is the blessed day
when Jesus was presented in the Temple by Mary and Joseph.
Outwardly he was fulfilling the Law,
but in reality he was coming to meet his believing people.
Prompted by the Holy Spirit,
Simeon and Anna came to the Temple.
Enlightened by the same Spirit,
they recognized the Lord
and confessed him with exultation.
So let us also, gathered together by the Holy Spirit,
proceed to the house of God to encounter Christ.
There we shall find him
and recognize him in the breaking of the bread,
until he comes again, revealed in glory.

19

FEBRUARY

5. After the address the Priest blesses the candles, saying, with hands extended:

Let us pray.
O God, source and origin of all light,
who on this day showed to the just man Simeon
the Light for revelation to the Gentiles,
we humbly ask that,
in answer to your people's prayers,
you may be pleased to sanctify with your blessing  these candles,
which we are eager to carry in praise of your name,
so that, treading the path of virtue,
we may reach that light which never fails.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or:

O God, true light, who create light eternal,
spreading it far and wide,
pour, we pray, into the hearts of the faithful
the brilliance of perpetual light,
so that all who are brightened in your holy temple
by the splendor of these candles
may happily reach the light of your glory.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
He sprinkles the candles with holy water without saying anything, and puts incense into
the thurible for the procession.
6. Then the Priest receives from the Deacon or a minister the lighted candle prepared
for him and the procession begins, with the Deacon announcing (or, if there is no Deacon,
the Priest himself):
[63PresentationD3Pub]

Or:
[63PresentationD4Pub]

In this case, all respond:
[63PresentationD5Pub]

7. All carry lighted candles. As the procession moves forward, one or other of the
antiphons that follow is sung, namely the antiphon A light for revelation with the canticle
(Lk 2:29-32), or the antiphon Sion, adorn your bridal chamber or another appropriate
chant.

King of glory and new light. A Virgin she remains, though bringing in her
hands the Son before the morning star begotten, whom Simeon, taking in
his arms announced to the peoples as Lord of life and death and Savior of
the world.
8. As the procession enters the church, the Entrance Antiphon of the Mass is sung.
When the Priest has arrived at the altar, he venerates it and, if appropriate, incenses it.
Then he goes to the chair, where he takes off the cope, if he used it in the procession, and
puts on a chasuble. After the singing of the hymn Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the
highest), he says the Collect as usual. The Mass continues in the usual manner.

Second Form: The Solemn Entrance
9. Whenever a procession cannot take place, the faithful gather in church, holding
candles in their hands. The Priest, wearing white sacred vestments as for Mass, together
with the ministers and a representative group of the faithful, goes to a suitable place,
either in front of the church door or inside the church itself, where at least a large part of
the faithful can conveniently participate in the rite.
10. When the Priest reaches the place appointed for the blessing of the candles, candles
are lit while the antiphon Behold, our Lord (no. 3) or another appropriate chant is sung.
11. Then, after the greeting and address, the Priest blesses the candles, as above nos. 4-5;
and then the procession to the altar takes place, with singing (nos. 6-7). For Mass, what is
indicated in no. 8 above is observed.
