THE LITTLE ENTRANCE

   (While the Apolytikion is sung, the Priest carrying the holy Gospel

   voice:)

   Master and Lord our God, You have established in heaven the orders and
   hosts of angels and archangels to minister to Your glory. Grant that

   (The Priest blesses the entrance saying in a low voice.) Blessed is the

THE TRISAGION HYMN

   Deacon: Let us pray to the Lord.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Priest (in a low voice): Holy God, You dwell among Your saints. You are
   praised by the Seraphim with the thrice holy hymn and glorified by the
   Cherubim and worshiped by all the heavenly powers. You have brought all
   things out of nothing into being. You have created man and woman in
   Your image and likeness and adorned them with all the gifts of Your
   grace. You give wisdom and understanding to the supplicant and do not
   overlook the sinner, but have established repentance as the way of
   salvation. You have enabled us, Your lowly and unworthy servants, to
   stand at this hour before the glory of Your holy altar and to offer to
   You due worship and praise. Master, accept the thrice; holy hymn also
   from the lips of us sinners and visit us in Your goodness. Forgive our
   voluntary and involuntary transgressions, sanctify our souls and
   bodies, and grant that we may worship and serve You in holiness all the
   days of our lives, by the intercessions of the holy Theotokos and of
   all the saints who have pleased You throughout the ages.
   Priest: For You are holy, our God, and to You we give glory, to the
   Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever . . .

   Deacon: and to the ages of ages.

   Blessed are You on the throne of glory of Your kingdom, seated upon the
   Cherubim, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

   (The Reader reads the designated Apostolic pericope.)

   Priest: Peace be with you.

   People: Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.

   Priest (in a low voice): Shine within our hearts, loving Master, the
   pure light of Your divine knowledge and open the eyes of our minds that
   we may comprehend the message of your Gospel. Instill in us, also,
   reverence for Your blessed commandments, so that having conquered
   sinful desires, we may pursue a spiritual life, thinking and doing all
   those things that are pleasing to You. For You, Christ our God, are the
   light of our souls and bodies, and to You we give glory together with
   Your Father who is without beginning and Your all-holy, good, and
   life-giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

   Deacon: Wisdom. Arise. Let us hear the holy Gospel.

   People: And with your spirit.

   be attentive.

THE HOMILY

   (Following the readings, it is customary for the Priest to proclaim the
   Gospel.)

   Priest (in a low voice): O God, You have visited our lowliness in mercy
   and compassion. You have set us, Your lowly, sinful, and unworthy
   servants, to serve at Your holy altar before Your holy glory.
   Strengthen us for this service with the power of Your Holy Spirit, and
   grant speech to our lips that we may invoke the grace of Your Holy
   Spirit upon the gifts that are about to be offered.

   Priest: And grant that always guarded by Your power we may give glory
   to You, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and
   to the ages of ages.

   People: Amen.

THE GREAT ENTRANCE

   People: we who mystically represent the Cherubim sing the thrice; holy
   hymn to the life; giving Trinity. Let us set aside all the cares of
   life that we may receive the King of all ...

   (While the Cherubic Hymn is sung, the Priest prays in a low voice:)

   No one bound by worldly desires and pleasures is worthy to approach,
   draw near or minister to You, the King of glory. To serve You is great
   and awesome even for the heavenly powers. But because of Your ineffable
   and immeasurable love for us, You became man without alteration or
   change. You have served as our High Priest, and as Lord of all, and
   have entrusted to us the celebration of this liturgical sacrifice
   without the shedding of blood. For You alone, Lord our God, rule over
   all things in heaven and on earth. You are seated on the throne of the
   Cherubim, the Lord of the Seraphim and the King of Israel. You alone
   are holy and dwell among Your saints. You alone are good and ready to
   hear. Therefore, I implore you, look upon me, Your sinful and unworthy
   servant, and cleanse my soul and heart from evil consciousness. Enable
   me by the power of Your Holy Spirit so that, vested with the grace of
   priesthood, I may stand before Your holy Table and celebrate the
   mystery of Your holy and pure Body and Your precious Blood. To you I
   come with bowed head and pray: do not turn Your face away from me or
   reject me from among Your children, but make me, Your sinful and
   unworthy servant, worthy to offer to You these gifts. For You, Christ
   our God, are the Offerer and the Offered, the One who receives and is
   distributed, and to You we give glory, together with Your eternal
   Father and Your holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and forever and
   to the ages of ages. Amen.

   Priest: We who mystically represent the Cherubim sing the thriceholy
   hymn to the life; giving Trinity. Let us set aside all the cares of
   life that we may receive the King of all. . .

   (The Priest censes and says in a low voice:)

   (On Sundays)

   Having beheld the resurrection of Christ, let us worship the holy Lord
   Jesus, the only Sinless One. We venerate Your cross, O Christ, and we
   praise and glorify Your holy resurrection. You are our God. We know no
   other than You, and we call upon Your name. Come, all faithful let us
   venerate the holy resurrection of Christ. For behold, through the cross
   joy has come to all the world. Blessing the Lord always, let us praise
   His resurrection. For enduring the cross for us, He destroyed death by
   death.

   Then Psalm 50

   Priest: Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your great mercy; and
   according to the multitude to Your compassion, blot out my
   transgression. Wash me thoroughly from my inquity, and cleanse me from
   my sin. For I acknowledge my inquity, and my sin is ever before me.
   Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done evil in Your sight, that
   You may be found just when You speak, and victorious when You are
   judged. For behold, I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin my mother
   bore me. For behold, You have loved truth; You have made known to me
   the secret and hidden things of Your wisdom. You shall sprinkle me with
   hyssop, and I shall be made clean; You shall wash me, and I shall be
   whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the afflicted
   bones may rejoice. Turn Your face away from my sins, and blot out all
   my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast
   spirit within me. Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not
   Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and
   establish me with Your governing Spirit. I shall teach transgressors
   Your ways, and the ungodly shall turn back to You. Deliver me from
   bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall
   joyfully declare Your righteousness. Lord, open my lips, and my mouth
   shall proclaim Your praise. For if You had desired sacrifice, I would
   give it; You do not delight in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a
   broken spirit; God will not despise a broken and a humbled heart. Do
   good in Your good pleasure to Sion; and let the walls of Jerusalem be
   built. Then You shall be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness,
   with oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they shall offer bulls on
   Your altar.

   (The Great Entrance then takes place.)

   Deacon: May the Lord God remember all of you in His kingdom, now and
   forever and to the ages of ages.

   People: Amen.

   (The Priest and the Deacon enter the sanctuary, while the people sing
   the end of the Cherubic Hymn.)

   People: ... invisibly escorted by the angelic hosts. Alleluia.
   Alleluia. Alleluia.

   (After placing the holy gifts on the holy Table, the Priest censes
   them:)

   Priest: Lord, our God, You created us and brought us into this life.
   You have shown us the way to salvation and have bestowed upon us the
   revelation of heavenly mysteries. You have appointed us to this service
   by the power of Your Holy Spirit. Grant, therefore, O Lord that we may
   be accepted as servants of Your new Covenant and ministers of Your holy
   mysteries. Accept us as we draw near to Your holy altar, according to
   the multitude of Your mercy, that we may be worthy to offer You this
   spiritual sacrifice without the shedding of blood, for our sins and for
   the transgressions of Your people. Grant that, having accepted this
   sacrifice upon Your holy, heavenly, and spiritual altar as an offering
   of spiritual fragrance, You may in return send down upon us the grace
   of Your Holy Spirit. Look upon us, O God, and consider our worship; and
   accept it as You accepted the gifts of Abel, the sacrifices of Noah,
   the burnt offerings of Abraham, the priestly offices of Moses and
   Aaron, and the peace offerings of Samuel. As You accepted this true
   worship from Your holy apostles, accept also in Your goodness, O Lord,
   these gifts from the hands of us sinners, that being deemed worthy to
   serve at Your holy altar without blame., we may obtain the reward of
   the faithful stewards on the fearful day of Your just judgment.

   Priest: Through the mercies of Your only begotten Son with whom You are
   blessed, together with Your all holy, good, and lifegiving Spirit, now
   and forever and to the ages of ages.

   People: Amen.

   Priest: Peace be with all.

   People: And with your spirit.

   Deacon: Let us love one another that with one mind we may confess:

   (The Priest kisses the holy Gifts saying:)

   I love You, Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, and my fortress,
   and my deliverer.

   (At this time it is customary for the kiss of peace to be exchanged.)

   People: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, Trinity one in essence and
   inseparable.

   Deacon: Guard the doors. Wisdom. Let us be attentive.

THE CREED

   People: I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, Creator of
   heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.

   And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten
   of the Father before all ages. Light of Light, true God of true God,
   begotten, not created, of one essence with the Father, through whom all
   things were made.

   For us and for our salvation, He came down from heaven and was
   incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.

   He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and He suffered and was
   buried.

   On the third day He rose according to the Scriptures.

   He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

   He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. His
   kingdom will have no end.

   And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from
   the Father, who together with the Father and the Son is worshiped and
   glorified, who spoke through the prophets.

   In one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.

   acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.

   expect the resurrection of the dead.

   And the life of the age to come. Amen.

THE HOLY ANAPHORA

   Deacon: Let us stand well. Let us stand in awe. Let us be attentive,
   that we may present the holy offering in peace.

   People: Mercy and peace, a sacrifice of praise.

   Priest: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the
   Father, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with all of you.

   People: And with your spirit.

   Priest: Let us lift up our hearts.

   People: We lift them up to the Lord.

   Priest: Let us give thanks to the Lord.

   People: It is proper and right.

   Priest: Master, Lord, God, worshipful Father almighty, it is truly just
   and right to the majesty of Your holiness to praise You, to hymn You,
   to bless You, to worship You, to give thanks to You, to glorify You,
   the only true God, and to offer to You this our spiritual worship with
   a contrite heart and a humble spirit. For You have given us to know
   Your truth. Who is worthy to praise Your mighty acts? Or to make known
   all Your praises? Or tell of all Your wonderful deeds at all times?
   Master of all things, Lord of heaven and earth, and of every creature
   visible and invisible, You are seated upon the throne of glory and
   behold the depths. You are without beginning, invisible,
   incomprehensible, beyond words, unchangeable. You are the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, who is the great God and Savior of our hope, the
   image of Your goodness, the true seal of revealing in Himself You, the
   Father. He is the living Word, the true God, eternal wisdom, life,
   sanctification, power, and the true light. Through Him the Holy Spirit
   was manifested, the spirit of truth the gift of Sonship, the pledge of
   our future inheritance, the first fruits of eternal blessings, the life
   giving power, the source of sanctification through whom every rational
   and spiritual creature is made capable of worshiping You and giving You
   eternal glorification, for all things are subject to You. For You are
   praised by the angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities,
   authorities, powers, and the many eyed Cherubim. Round about You stand
   the Seraphim, one with six wings and the other with six wings; with two
   they cover their faces: with two they cover their feet; with two they
   fly, crying out to one another with unceasing voices and everresounding
   praises:

   Priest: Singing the victory hymn, proclaiming, crying out, and saying:

   People: Holy, holy, holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are filled
   with Your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is He who comes in the
   name of the Lord. Hosanna to God in the highest.

   Priest: Together with these blessed powers, loving Master we sinners
   also cry out and say: Truly You are holy and mostholy, and there are no
   bounds to the majesty of Your holiness. You are holy in all Your works,
   for with righteousness and true judgment You have ordered all things
   for us. For having made man by taking dust from the earth, and having
   honored him with Your own image, O God, You placed him in a garden of
   delight, promising him eternal life and the enjoyment of everlasting
   blessings in the observance of Your commandments. But when he disobeyed
   You, the true God who had created him, and was led astray by the
   deception of the serpent becoming subject to death through his own
   transgressions, You, O God, in Your righteous judgment, expelled him
   from paradise into this world, returning him to the earth from which he
   was taken, yet providing for him the salvation of regeneration in Your
   Christ. For You did not forever reject Your creature whom You made, O
   Good One, nor did You forget the work of Your hands, but because of
   Your tender compassion, You visited him in various ways: You sent forth
   prophets; You performed mighty works by Your saints who in every
   generation have pleased You. You spoke to us by the mouth of Your
   servants the prophets, announcing to us the salvation which was to
   come; You gave us the law to help us; You appointed angels as
   guardians. And when the fullness of time had come, You spoke to us
   through Your Son Himself, through whom You created the ages. He, being
   the splendor of Your glory and the image of Your being, upholding all
   things by the word of His power, thought it not robbery to be equal
   with You, God and Father. But, being God before all ages, He appeared
   on earth and lived with humankind. Becoming incarnate from a holy
   Virgin, He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, conforming to
   the body of our lowliness, that He might change us in the likeness of
   the image of His glory. For, since through man sin came into the world
   and through sin death, it pleased Your onlybegotten Son, who is in Your
   bosom, God and Father, born of a woman, the holy Theotokos and
   ever-virgin Mary; born under the law, to condemn sin in His flesh, so
   that those who died in Adam may be brought to life in Him, Your Christ.
   He lived in this world, and gave us precepts of salvation. Releasing us
   from the delusions of idolatry, He guided us to the sure knowledge of
   You, the true God and Father. He acquired us for Himself, as His chosen
   people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation. Having cleansed us by water
   and sanctified us with the Holy Spirit, He gave Himself as ransom to
   death in which we were held captive, sold under sin. Descending into
   Hades through the cross, that He might fill all things with Himself, He
   loosed the bonds of death. He rose on the third day, having opened a
   path for all flesh to the resurrection from  the dead, since it was not
   possible that the Author of life would be dominated by corruption. So
   He became the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep, the first
   born of the dead, that He might be Himself the first in all things.
   Ascending into heaven, He sat at the right hand of Your majesty on high
   and He will come to render to each according to His works. As memorials
   of His saving passion, He has left us these gifts which we have set
   forth before You according to His commands. For when He was about to go
   forth to His voluntary, ever memorable, and life-giving death, on the
   night on which He was delivered up for the life of the world, He took
   bread in His holy and pure hands, and presenting it to You, God and
   Father, and offering thanks, blessing, sanctifying, and breaking it:

   Priest: He gave it to His holy disciples and apostles saying: Take,
   eat, this is my body which is broken for you and for the forgiveness of
   sins.

   People: Amen.

   Priest: Likewise, He took the cup of the fruit of vine, and having
   mingled it, offering thanks, blessing, and sanctifying it.

   Priest: He gave it to His holy disciples and apostles saying: Drink of
   this all of you. This is my blood of the new Covenant, shed for you and
   for many, for the forgiveness of sins.

   People: Amen.

   Priest: Do this in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this
   Bread and drink this Cup, you proclaim my death, and you confess my
   resurrection. Therefore, Master, we also, remembering His saving
   passion and life-giving cross, His three; day burial and resurrection
   from the dead, His ascension into heaven, and enthronement at Your
   right hand, God and Father, and His glorious and awesome second coming.

   Priest: We offer to You these gifts from Your own gifts in all and for
   all.

   People: We praise You, we bless You, we give thanks to You, and we pray
   to You, Lord our God.

   Priest: Therefore, most holy Master, we also, Your sinful and unworthy
   servants, whom You have made worthy to serve at Your holy altar, not
   because of our own righteousness (for we have not done anything good
   upon the earth), but because of Your mercy and compassion, which You
   have so richly poured upon us, we dare to approach Your holy altar, and
   bring forth the symbols of the holy Body and Blood of Your Christ. We
   pray to You and call upon You, O Holy of Holies, that by the favor of
   Your goodness, Your Holy Spirit may come upon us and upon the gifts
   here presented, to bless, sanctify, and make.

   Priest: This bread to be the precious Body of our Lord and God and
   Savior Jesus Christ.

   (He blesses the holy Bread.)

   Deacon: Amen.

   Priest: And this cup to be the precious Blood of our Lord and God and
   Savior Jesus Christ.

   (He blesses the holy Cup.)

   Deacon: Amen.

   (He blesses them both.)

   Priest: Shed for the life and salvation of the world.

   Deacon: Amen. Amen. Amen.

   Priest: And unite us all to one another who become partakers of the one
   Bread and the Cup in the communion of the one Holy Spirit. Grant that
   none of us may partake of the holy Body and Blood of Your Christ to
   judgment or condemnation; but, that we may find mercy and grace with
   all the saints who through the ages have pleased You: forefathers,
   fathers, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, preachers, evangelists,
   martyrs, confessors, teachers, and every righteous spirit made perfect
   in faith.

   Priest: Especially for our most holy, pure, blessed, and glorious Lady,
   the Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary.

   People: All of creation rejoices in you, O full of grace: the assembly
   of angels and the human race. You are a sanctified temple and a
   spiritual paradise, the glory from whom God was incarnate and became a
   child; our God, existing before all ages. He made your womb a throne,
   and your body more spacious than the heavens. All of creation rejoices
   in you, O full of grace. Glory to you.

   (The Priest censes.)

   Priest: For Saint John the prophet, forerunner, and baptist; for the
   holy, glorious, and most; honorable ; apostles; for Saint(s) (Name;s),
   whose memory we commemorate today; and for all Your saints, through
   whose supplications, O God, visit us. Remember also all who have fallen
   asleep in the hope of the resurrection to eternal life (here the priest
   commemorates the names of the deceased) . And grant them rest, our God,
   where the light of Your countenance shines. Again, we pray to You, be
   mindful of Your holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, which is from one
   end of the inhabited earth to the other. Grant peace to her which You
   have obtained with the precious blood of Your Christ. Strengthen also
   this holy house to the end of the ages. Remember, Lord, those who have
   brought You these gifts, and for whom and through whom and the
   intentions for which they were offered. Remember, Lord, those who bear
   fruit and do good works in Your holy churches, and those who remember
   the poor. Reward them with Your rich and heavenly gifts. Grant them in
   return for earthly things, heavenly gifts; for temporal, eternal; for
   corruptible, incorruptible. Remember, Lord, those who are in the
   deserts, on mountains, in caverns, and in the chambers of the earth.
   Remember, Lord, those living in chastity and godliness, in asceticism
   and holiness of life. Remember, Lord, this country and all those in
   public service whom you have allowed to govern on earth. Grant them
   profound and lasting peace. Speak to their hearts good things
   concerning your Church and all your people that through the faithful
   conduct of their duties we may live peaceful and serene lives in all
   piety and holiness. Sustain the good in their goodness; make the wicked
   good through Your goodness. Remember, Lord, the people here presented
   and those who are absent with good cause. Have mercy on them and on us
   according to the multitude of Your mercy. Fill their treasuries with
   every good thing; preserve their marriages in peace and harmony;
   nurture the infants; instruct the youth; strengthen the aged; give
   courage to the faint hearted; reunite those separated; bring back those
   in error and unite them to Your holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.
   Free those who are held captive by unclean spirits; sail with those who
   sail; travel with those who travel; defend the widows; protect the
   orphans; liberate the captives; heal the sick. Remember, Lord, those
   who are in mines, in exile, in harsh labor, and those in every kind of
   affliction, necessity, or distress; those who entreat your loving
   kindness; those who love us and those who hate us; those who have asked
   us to pray for them, unworthy though we may be. Remember, Lord our God,
   all Your people, and pour out Your rich mercy upon them, granting them
   their petitions for salvation. Remember, O God, all those whom we have
   not remembered through ignorance, forgetfulness or because of their
   multitude since You know the name and age of each, even from their
   mother's womb. For You, Lord, are the helper of the helpless, the hope
   of the hopeless, the savior of the afflicted, the haven of the voyager,
   and the physician of the sick. Be all things to all, You who know each
   person, his requests, his household, and his need. Deliver this
   community and city, O Lord, and every city and town, from famine,
   plague, earthquake, flood, fire, sword, invasion of foreign enemies,
   and civil war.

   Priest: Above all, remember, Lord, our Archbishop (Name) and our Bishop
   (Name): Grant that they may serve Your holy churches in peace. Keep
   them safe, honorable, and healthy for many years, rightly teaching the
   word of Your truth.

   Deacon: Remember also, Lord, those whom each of us calls to mind and
   all your people.

   People: And all Your people.

   Priest (in a low voice): Remember, Lord, all Orthodox bishops who
   rightly teach the word of Your truth. Remember Lord, my unworthiness
   according to the multitude of Your mercies; forgive my every
   transgression, both voluntary and involuntary. Do not take away the
   grace of Your Holy Spirit from these gifts presented because of my
   sins. Remember, Lord, the presbyters, the diaconate in Christ, and
   every order of the clergy, and do not confound any of us who stand
   about Your holy altar. Visit us with Your goodness, Lord; manifest
   Yourself to us through Your rich compassion. Grant us seasonable
   weather and fruitful seasons; send gentle showers upon the earth so
   that it may bear fruit; bless the crown of the year of Your goodness.
   Prevent schism in the Church; pacify the raging of the heathen. Quickly
   stop the uprisings of heresies by the power of Your Holy Spirit.
   Receive us all into Your kingdom. Declare us to be sons and daughters
   of the light and of the day. Grant us Your peace and love, Lord our
   God, for You have given all things to us.

   Priest: And grant that with one voice and one heart we may glorify and
   praise Your most honored and majestic name, of the Father and the Son
   and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

   People: Amen.

   Priest: The mercy of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ be with all
   of you.

   People: And with your spirit.

   Deacon: Having remembered all the saints, let us again in peace pray to
   the Lord.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon: For the precious Gifts offered and consecrated, let us pray to
   the Lord.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon: That our loving God who has received them at His holy,
   heavenly, and spiritual altar as an offering of spiritual fragrance,
   may in return send upon us divine grace and the gift of the Holy
   Spirit, let us pray.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon: Having prayed for the unity of the faith and for the communion
   of the Holy Spirit, let us commit ourselves, and one another, and our
   whole life to Christ our God.

   People: To You, O Lord.

   Priest (in a low voice): Our God, the God who saves, You teach us
   justly to thank You for the good things which You have done and still
   do for us. You are our God who has accepted these Gifts. Cleanse us
   from every defilement of flesh and spirit, and teach us how to live in
   holiness by Your fear, so that receiving the portion of Your holy Gifts
   with a clear conscience we may be united with the holy Body and Blood
   of Your Christ. Having received them worthily, may we have Christ
   dwelling in our hearts, and may we become the temple of Your Holy
   Spirit. Yes, our God, let none of

   37-us be guilty before these, Your awesome and heavenly Mysteries, nor
   be infirm in body and soul by partaking of them unworthily. But enable
   us, even up to our last breath, to receive a portion of Your holy Gifts
   worthily, as provision for eternal life and as an acceptable defense at
   the awesome judgment seat of Your Christ. So that we also, together
   with all the saints who through the ages have pleased You, may become
   partakers of Your eternal good things, which You, Lord, have prepared
   for those who love You.

   Priest: And make us worthy, Master, with confidence and without fear of
   condemnation, to dare call You, the heavenly God, FATHER, and to say:

THE LORD'S PRAYER

   People: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy
   kingdom come; Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us
   this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
   those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but
   deliver us from evil.

   38Priest: For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, of the
   Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages
   of ages.

   People: Amen.

   Priest: Peace be with all.

   People: And with your spirit.

   Deacon: Let us bow our heads to the Lord.

   People: To You, O Lord.

   Priest (in a low voice): Lord Master, the Father of mercies and God of
   every consolation, bless sanctify, guard, fortify, and strengthen those
   who have bowed their heads to You. Distance them from every evil deed.
   Lead them to every good work and make them worthy to partake without
   condemnation of these, Your most pure and life-giving Mysteries, for
   the forgiveness of sins and for the communion of the Holy Spirit.

   Priest: By the grace, mercy, and love for us of Your only; begotten
   Son, with whom You are blessed, together with Your all; holy, good, and
   life-giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.
   People: Amen.

   Priest (in a low voice): Lord Jesus Christ, our God, hear us from Your
   holy dwelling place and from the glorious throne of Your kingdom. You
   are enthroned on high with the Father and are also invisibly present
   among us. Come and sanctify us, and let Your pure Body and precious
   Blood be given to us by Your mighty hand and through us to all Your
   people.

   Deacon: Let us be attentive.

   Priest: The holy Gifts for the holy people of God.

   People: One is Holy, one is Lord, Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the
   Father. Amen.

HOLY COMMUNION

   People: Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise Him in the highest.
   Alleluia (3).

   (The Communion hymn changes according to the Feast Day.)

   (After the fraction of the sacred Bread, the Priest says in a low
   voice):

   The Lamb of God is broken and distributed; broken but not divided. He
   is forever eaten yet is never consumed, but He sanctifies those who
   partake of Him.

   (Then the Priest places a portion of the sacred Bread in the holy Cup
   saying:)

   The fullness of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

   (He then blesses the warm water saying:)

   Blessed is the fervor of Your saints, now and forever and to the ages
   of ages. Amen.

   (Pouring the water into the Cup crosswise, he says:)

   The warmth of the Holy Spirit.

   Amen.

   (The Communion prayers are recited silently by those prepared to
   receive the holy Mysteries.)

   I believe and confess, Lord, that You are truly the Christ, the Son of
   the living God, who came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am
   the first. I also believe that this is truly Your pure Body and that
   this is truly Your precious Blood. Therefore, I pray to You, have mercy
   upon me, and forgive my transgressions, voluntary and involuntary, in
   word and deed, known and unknown. And make me worthy without
   condemnation to partake of Your pure Mysteries for the forgiveness of
   sins and for life eternal. Amen.

   How shall I, who am unworthy, enter into the splendor of Your saints?
   If I dare to enter into the bridal chamber, my clothing will accuse me,
   since it is not a wedding garment; and being bound up, I shall be cast
   out by the angels. In Your love, Lord, cleanse my soul and save me.

   Loving Master, Lord Jesus Christ, my God, let not these holy Gifts be
   to my condemnation because of my unworthiness, but for the cleansing
   and sanctification of soul and body and the pledge of the future life
   and kingdom. It is good for me to cling to God and to place in Him the
   hope of my salvation.

   Receive me today, Son of God, as a partaker of Your mystical Supper. I
   will not reveal Your mystery to Your adversaries. Nor will I give You a
   kiss as did Judas. But as the thief I confess You: Lord, remember me in
   Your kingdom.

   (The Priest proceeds to receive holy Communion.)

   Priest: Behold, I approach Christ, our immortal King and God.

   The precious and most holy Body of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus
   Christ is given to me (Name) the priest, for the forgiveness of my sins
   and for eternal life.

   (He partakes of the sacred Bread.)

   The precious and most holy Blood of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus
   Christ is given to me (Name) the priest, for the forgiveness of my sins
   and for eternal life.

   (He then drinks from the holy Cup. Afterwards, he wipes the holy Cup,
   kisses it, and says:)

   This has touched my lips, taking away my transgressions and cleansing
   my sins.

   (The Priest then transfers the remaining portions of the consecrated
   Bread into the holy Cup, saying:)

   Having beheld the resurrection of Christ, let us worship the holy Lord
   Jesus, the only Sinless One. We venerate Your cross, O Christ, and we
   praise and glorify Your holy resurrection. You are our God. We know no
   other than You, and we call upon Your name. Come, all faithful, let us
   venerate the holy resurrection of Christ. For behold, through the cross
   joy has come to all the world. Blessing the
   Lord always, let us praise His resurrection. For enduring the cross for
   us, He destroyed death by death.

   (The Priest takes up the holy Cup, proceeds to the Royal Doors, raises
   it, and says:)

   Deacon: Approach with the fear of God, faith, and love.

   (Those prepared come forth with reverence to receive holy Communion
   while the peopie continue to sing the communion hymn.)

   (When administering holy Communion, the Priest says:The servant of God
   (Name) receives the Body and Blood of Christ for forgiveness of sins
   and eternal life.

   (After Communion has been given, the Priest blesses the people,
   saying:)

   Priest: Save, O God, Your people and bless Your inheritance.

   People: We have seen the true light; we have received the heavenly
   Spirit; we have found the true faith, worshiping the undivided Trinity,
   for the Trinity has saved us.

   (Returning to the holy Table, the Priest transfers the portions of the
   Theotokos and of the saints into the holy Cup. Then he does the same
   for those of the living and the dead saying in a low voice):

   Wash away, Lord, by Your holy Blood, the sins of all those
   commemorated, through the intercessions of the Theotokos and all Your
   saints. Amen.

   Priest: Be exalted, O God, above the heavens. Let Your glory be over
   all the earth (3).

   (The Priest lifts the holy Cup and says in a low voice:)

   Priest: Blessed is our God.

   Priest: Always, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

   People: Amen.

PRAYER OF THANKSGIVING

   Deacon: Let us be attentive. Having partaken of the divine, holy, pure,
   immortal, heavenly, lifegiving, and awesome Mysteries of Christ, let us
   worthily give thanks to the Lord.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon: Help us, save us, have mercy upon us, and protect us, O God, by
   Your grace.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Deacon: Having prayed for a perfect, holy, peaceful, and sinless day,
   let us commit ourselves and one another, and our whole life to Christ
   our God.

   People: To You, O Lord.

   Priest (in a low voice): We thank You, Lord, our God, for the communion
   of Your holy, most pure, immortal, and heavenly Mysteries which You
   have granted us for the benefit, sanctification, and healing of our
   souls and bodies. Grant, Master of all, that the communion of the holy
   Body and Blood of Your Christ may become for us faith unashamed, love
   unfeigned, fulness of wisdom, healing of soul and body, repelling of
   every hostile adversary, observance of Your commandments, and an
   acceptable defense at the dread judgment seat of Your Christ.

   Priest: For You are our sanctification and to You we give glory, to the
   Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages
   of ages.

   People: Amen.

THE DISMISSAL

   Priest: Let us depart in peace.

   Deacon: Let us pray to the Lord.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Priest: Lord, bless those who praise You and sanctify those who trust
   in You. Save Your people and bless Your inheritance. Protect the whole
   body of Your Church. Sanctify those who love the beauty of Your house.
   Glorify them in return by Your divine power, and do not forsake us who
   hope in You. Grant peace to Your world, to Your churches, to the
   clergy, to those in public service, to the armed forces, and to all
   Your people. For every good and perfect gift is from above, coming from
   You, the Father of lights. To You we give glory, thanksgiving, and
   worship, to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever
   and to the ages of ages. 1

   People: Amen.

   (On January 1, it is traditional instead of the above to say the
   following prayer:)

   Priest: O Christ, our God, accept from those who call upon You with all
   their heart this spiritual sacrifice without the shedding of blood as a
   sacrifice of praise and true worship. You are the Lamb and Son of God
   who bears the sins of the world; the blameless calf who does not accept
   the yoke of sin and who freely sacrificed Yourself for us. You are
   broken but not divided. You are consumed but never spent. You sanctify
   those who partake of you. In remembrance of Your voluntary passion and
   life-giving resurrection on the third day, You have made us partakers
   of Your ineffable and heavenly and awesome mysteries of Your holy Body
   and precious Blood. Preserve us, Your servants, those who minister, our
   leaders, the armed forces, and the people present here, in Your
   holiness. Grant that we may meditate upon Your righteousness at all
   times and in every season. Guide us and our actions so that we may do
   what is pleasing to You, and may You find us worthy to stand at Your
   right hand when You return to judge the living and the dead. Deliver
   our brothers and sisters who are in captivity, visit those who are
   sick, protect those who are in danger at sea, and give rest to the
   souls of all those who have fallen asleep in the hope of the eternal
   life where the light of Your face shines. Hear the petitions of all
   those who beseech You for Your help. For You are the giver of all good
   things, and to You we give glory, together with Your eternal Father and
   Your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and forever and to the
   ages of ages.

   People: Blessed is the name of the Lord, both now and to the ages (3).

   Priest (proceeding toward the Prothesis and saying in a low voice): The
   mystery of Your dispensation, O Christ our God, has been accomplished
   and perfected as far as it is in our power. We have had Vie memorial of
   Your death. We hove seen the typos of Your resurrection. We have been
   filled with Your unending life. We have enjoyed Your inexhaustible
   delight which in the world to come be well pleased to give to us all,
   through the grace of Your holy and good and life-giving creating
   Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages.

   Deacon: Let us pray to the Lord.

   People: Lord, have mercy (3). Father, give the blessing.

   Priest: May the blessing of the Lord and His mercy come upon you
   through His divine grace and love always, now and forever and to the
   ages of ages.

   People: Amen.

   Priest: Glory to You, O God, our hope, glory to You.

   Priest: May Christ our true God (who rose from the dead), as a good,
   loving, and merciful God, have mercy upon us and save us, through the
   intercessions of His most pure and holy Mother; the power of the
   precious and lifegiving Cross; the protection of the honorable,
   bodiless powers of heaven; the supplications of the honorable,
   glorious, prophet, and forerunner John the Baptist; the holy, glorious,
   and praiseworthy apostles; the holy, glorious, and triumphant martyrs;
   our holy and God-bearing fathers (name of the church) the holy and
   righteous ancestors Joachim and Anna; Saint (of the day) whose memory
   we commemorate today, and all the saints.

   People: Amen.

   People: Lord, grant long life to him who blesses and sanctifies us.

   Priest: Through the prayers of our holy fathers, Lord Jesus Christ, our
   God, have mercy on us and save us.

   People: Amen.

   Glory to you, O God. Glory to you, O God. Glory to you, O God.

   ANONYMOUS

   Lord Jesus Christ, our God, let You sacred Body be unto me for eternal
   life and Your precious Blood for forgiveness of sins. Let this
   Eucharist be unto me for joy, health and gladness. And in Your awesome
   Second Coming make me, a sinner, worthy to stand at the right hand of
   Your glory; through the intercessions of Your pure Mother and of all
   Your Saints. Amen.

   SAINT BASIL

   I thank You, Christ and Master our God, King of the ages and Creator of
   all things, for all the gifts You have given me, and especially for the
   participation in Your pure and life-giving mysteries. 1, therefore,
   pray to You, good and loving Lord: keep me under Your protection and
   under the shadow of Your wings. Grant that to my last breath I may with
   a pure conscience partake worthily of Your gifts for the forgiveness of
   sins and for eternal life. For You are the bread of life, the source of
   holiness, the giver of all good things, and to You we give glory, with
   the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of
   ages. Amen.

   ANONYMOUS

   I thank You, Lord my God, that You have not rejected me, a sinner, but
   have made me worthy to partake of Your holy mysteries. I thank You that
   You have permitted me, although I am unworthy, to receive Your pure and
   heavenly gifts. O loving Master, who died and rose for our sake, and
   granted to us these awesome and life-giving mysteries for the wellbeing
   and sanctification of our souls and bodies, let these gifts be for
   healing of my own soul and body, the averting of every evil, the
   illumination of the eyes of my heart, the peace of my spiritual powers,
   a faith unashamed, a love unfeigned, the fulfilling of wisdom, the
   observing of Your commandments, the receiving of Your divine grace, and
   the inheritance of Your kingdom. Preserved by them in Your holiness,
   may I always be mindful of Your grace and no longer live for myself,
   but for You, our Master and Benefactor. May I pass from this life in
   the hope of eternal life, and attain to the everlasting rest, where the
   voices of Your Saints who feast are unceasing, and their joy, beholding
   the ineffable beauty of Your countenance, is unending. For You, Christ
   our God, are the true joy and the inexpressable gladness of those who
   love You, and all creation praises You forever. Amen.

THE RESURRECTION APOLYTIKIA

   First Tone

   Though the tomb was sealed by a stone and soldiers guarded Your pure
   body, You arose, O Savior, on the third day, giving life to the world.
   Therefore, O Giver of life, the heavenly powers praise You: Glory to
   Your resurrection, O Christ, glory to Your kingdom, glory to Your plan
   of redemption, O only loving God.

   Second Tone

   When you descended unto death, O life immortal, You destroyed Hades
   with the splendor of Your divinity. And when You raised the dead from
   the depths of darkness, all the heavenly powers shouted: O Giver of
   life, Christ our God, glory to You.

   Third Tone

   Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad, for the Lord has shown the
   power of His reign; He has conquered death by death, and become the
   first born of the dead. He has delivered us from the depths of Hades;
   and has granted to the world great mercy.

   Fourth Tone

   The joyful news of Your resurrection was told to the women disciples of
   the Lord by the angel. Having thrown off the ancestral curse, and
   boasting,

   they told the Apostles: death has been vanquished, Christ our God is
   risen, granting to the world great mercy.

   Fifth Tone

   To the Word, coeternal with the Father and the Spirit, born of the
   Virgin for our salvation, let us, the faithful, give praise and
   worship. Of His own will, He mounted the cross in the flesh, He
   suffered death, and raised the dead by His glorious resurrection.

   Sixth Tone

   The heavenly powers appeared at Your tomb, and those guarding it became
   like dead. Mary stood at Your grave seeking Your pure body. You
   stripped the power of hades, not touched by its corruption. You met the
   virgin woman, as one who grants life. O Lord, who rose from the dead,
   glory to You.

   Seventh Tone

   By Your cross You destroyed death, and to the thief You opened
   paradise. You transformed the sorrow of the Myrrhbearers, and commanded
   the Apostles to proclaim that You have risen from the dead, Christ our
   God, granting to the world great mercy.

   Eighth Tone

   From on high You descended, O merciful Lord, and accepted the three-day
   burial to free us from our passions. Glory to You, O Lord, our life and
   our resurrection.

   sisters, and relatives; and for the forgiveness of all their sins, both
   voluntary and involuntary.

   People: Lord, have mercy (3).

   Priest: Again we pray for the blessed memory and eternal rest of the
   souls of the departed servants of God (here are commemorated the names
   of the dead) and for the forgiveness of all their sins, both voluntary
   and involuntary.

   People: Lord, have mercy (3).

   Priest: May the Lord God grant that their souls rest where the
   righteous repose. Let us ask Christ, our immortal King and God, for the
   mercies of God, the kingdom of heaven, and the forgiveness of their
   sins.

   People: Grant this, O Lord (3).

   Priest: Let us pray to the Lord.

   People: Lord, have mercy.

   Priest: O God of spirits and of all flesh, You have trampled upon death
   and have abolished the power of the devil, giving life to Your world.
   Give rest to the souls of Your departed servants: emperors, patriarchs,
   hierarchs, priests, hieromonks, deacons, monks, and all our departed
   faithful and Orthodox Christians, from one end of the world to the
   other: fathers, forefathers, grandparents, great-grandparents, parents,
   brothers, sisters, and relatives. And place them in a place of light,
   in a place of repose, in a place of refreshment, where there is no
   pain, sorrow, and suffering. As a good and loving God, forgive every
   sin they have committed in thought, word, or deed, for there is no one
   who lives and does not sin. You alone are without sin. Your
   righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and Your word is truth.

   Priest: For You are the resurrection, the life, and the repose of Your
   departed servants, the faithful and Orthodox Christians, Christ our
   God, and to You we give glory, with Your eternal Father and Your all
   holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of
   ages.

   People: Amen. Eternal memory, eternal memory, may their memory be
   eternal (3).
   Priest: Glory to You, O God, our hope, glory to You.

   The Dismissal

   Priest: May Christ our true God, who rose from the dead and as immortal
   King has authority over the living and the dead, have mercy on us and
   save us, through the intercessions of his spotless holy Mother; of the
   holy, glorious, and praiseworthy Apostles, of our venerable and
   God-bearing Fathers; of the holy and glorious forefathers Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob; of his holy and righteous friend Lazaros, who lay in
   the grave four days; and of all the Saints; establish the souls of His
   servants departed from us, in the dwelling place of the saints; grant
   rest to them in the bosom of Abraham, and number them among the
   righteous.

   Priest: Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, Lord Jesus Christ, our
   God, have mercy on us and save us.

   People: Amen.

   (Here the Priest reads the following passages from the Synodikon of the
   Seventh Ecumenical Synod.)

   Priest: As the prophets beheld, as the apostles have taught, as the
   Church has received, as the teachers have declared, as the world has
   agreed, as grace has shown forth, as truth has been revealed, as
   falsehood has been dispelled, as wisdom has become manifest, as Christ
   awarded; thus we declare; thus we affirm; thus we proclaim Christ our
   true God, and honor His saints in words, writings, thoughts,
   sacrifices, churches, and holy icons; on the one hand, worshiping and
   reverencing Christ as God and Lord, and on the other, honoring the
   saints as true servants of the same Lord of all, and offering them
   proper veneration. This is the faith of the apostles. This is the faith
   of the fathers. This is the faith of the Orthodox. This is the faith on
   which the world is established. Therefore, with fraternal and filial
   love we praise the heralds of the faith, those who with glory and honor
   have struggled for the faith, and we say: to the champions of
   Orthodoxy, 'faithful emperors, most-holy patriarchs, hierarchs,
   teachers, martyrs, and confessors: May your memory be eternal.

   People: May their memory be eternal (3).

   Priest: Let us beseech God that we may be instructed and strengthened
   by the trials and struggles of these saints, which they endured for the
   faith even unto death, and by their teachings, entreating that we may
   to the end imitate their godly life. May we be deemed worthy of
   obtaining our requests through the mercy and grace of the Great and
   First Hierarch, Christ our God, through the intercessions of our
   glorious Lady, the Theotokos and ever-virgin Mary, the divine angels
   and all the Saints.

   People: Amen.

   People: Who is so great a God as our God? You are the God who alone
   perform wonders (3).

   People: Today salvation has come to the world. Let us sing and praise
   Him who rose from the tomb and is the author of life. For having
   vanquished death by death, He has bestowed upon us victory and great
   mercy.

   aromatic flowers and three candies) which is on the holy Table. He
   lifts up the tray and exits from the Sanctuary in procession within the
   interior of the church. He is preceded by candle-bearers, the
   Hexapteryga, followed by the Psalte and an Altar Boy censing. They
   circle the church, pausing in the center where there is a decorated
   table. The Priest then circles the table thrice and stands before it,
   looking toward the east. He then raises the tray above his head and
   intones:

   Priest: Wisdom, stand.

   He then places the tray on the table and censes around it and chants:

   Tone Four

   O unfailing protectress of Christians and ever-present intercessor
   before the Creator, do not turn away from the prayers of us sinners;

   supplicate for us, for you always protect those who honor you.

   passion, the people that sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
   taking the symbols of victiory, the boughs of trees and branches of
   palms, went forth and proclaimed by anticipation the resurrection. The
   same Lord also keep and preserve us, who in imitation of them bear in
   our hands palms and boughs of trees on this day of the feast, and like
   those multitudes and children offer too You hosanna. We pray that with
   hymns and spiritual songs, we may The deemed worthy of the life-giving
