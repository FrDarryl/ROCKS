ENTRANCE ANTIPHON
Ps 13 (12): 6
Exsultabit cor meum in salutari tuo, cantabo Domino, qui bona tribuit
mihi.
My heart will rejoice in your salvation.
I will sing to the Lord, who has been bountiful with me.
COLLECT
Deus, qui in Corde beatae Mariae Virginis dignum Sancti Spiritus
habitaculum praeparasti, concede propitius, ut, eiusdem Virginis
intercessione, tuae gloriae templum inveniri mereamur.
O God, who prepared a fit dwelling place for the Holy Spirit
in the Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
graciously grant that through her intercession
we may be a worthy temple of your glory.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, for ever and ever.
FIRST READING           Isaiah 61:9-11
Thus says the Lord:
The descendants of my people shall be renowned among the nations,
and their offspring in the midst of the peoples;
all who see them shall acknowledge them,
that they are a people whom the Lord has blessed.
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
my soul shall exult in my God;
for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation,
he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,
and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
For as the earth brings forth its shoots,
and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,
so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise
to spring forth before all the nations.
RESPONSORIAL PSALM          1 Sam 2:1,4-5,6-7,8abcd
Exsultavit cor meum in omino, salvatore meo.
R. My heart exults in the Lord, my Savior.
"My heart exults in the LORD,
my horn is exalted in my God.
I have swallowed up my enemies;
I rejoice in my victory.
R. My heart exults in the Lord, my Savior.
The bows of the mighty are broken,
while the tottering gird on strength.
The well-fed hire themselves out for bread,
while the hungry batten on spoil.
The barren wife bears seven sons,
while the mother of many languishes.
R. My heart exults in the Lord, my Savior.
"The LORD puts to death and gives life;
he casts down to the nether world; he raises up again.
The LORD makes poor and makes rich,
he humbles, he also exalts.
R. My heart exults in the Lord, my Savior.
He raises the needy from the dust;
from the ash heap he lifts up the poor,
To seat them with nobles
and make a glorious throne their heritage.
R. My heart exults in the Lord, my Savior.
ALLELUIA          Cf Luke 2:19
Blessed is the Virgin Mary, who kept the word of God
and pondered it in her heart.
GOSPEL          Luke 2:41-51
Each year Jesus� parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover,
and when he was twelve years old,
they went up according to festival custom.
After they had completed its days, as they were returning,
the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem,
but his parents did not know it.
Thinking that he was in the caravan,
they journeyed for a day
and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances,
but not finding him,
they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.
After three days they found him in the temple,
sitting in the midst of the teachers,
listening to them and asking them questions,
and all who heard him were astounded
at his understanding and his answers.
When his parents saw him,
they were astonished,
and his mother said to him,
�Son, why have you done this to us?
Your father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety.�
And he said to them,
�Why were you looking for me?
Did you not know that I must be in my Father�s house?�
But they did not understand what he said to them.
He went down with them and came to Nazareth,
and was obedient to them;
and his mother kept all these things in her heart.
PRAYER OVER THE OFFERINGS
Preces, Domine, tuorum respice oblationesque fidelium in beatae Mariae
Dei Genetricis commemoratione delatas, ut tibi gratae sint, et nobis
conferant tuae propitiationis auxilium.
Look, O Lord, upon the prayers and offerings of your faithful,
presented in commemoration of Blessed Mary, the Mother of God,
that they may be pleasing to you
and may confer on us your help and forgiveness.
Through Christ our Lord.

Mary treasured all these words,
reflecting on them in her heart.

Redemptionis aeternae participes effecti, quaesumus, Domine, ut, qui
Genetricis Filii tui memoriam agimus, et de gratiae tuae plenitudine
gloriemur, et salvationis continuum sentiamus augmentum.

that we, who commemorate the Mother of your Son,
