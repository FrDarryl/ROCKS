107	Sanctorale
108	The version of the Sanctorale is that of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham under the Patronage of Blessed John Henry Newman. It conforms to the General Calendar of the Roman Church and to the National Calendar for England. Since the Personal Ordinariate has the privileges of a local Church, the Ordinariate Calendar, like diocesan calendars, has local characteristics.
109	Different degrees of celebration are distinguished by typography. Observances peculiar to the Ordinariate Calendar are inset and printed in blue. With the exception of the feast of the All Saints of England or All Saints of Wales, they are all optional memorials.
110	• SOLEMNITIES
111	On solemnities (BOLD CAPITALS) the Gloria in excelsis and Creed are used at Mass. The Mass propers and the readings (of which there are three) are as appointed for the day.
112	• External solemnity
113	The external solemnity of any feast means the celebration of the feast without an office, for the good of the faithful, either on the day on which the feast is impeded, or on a Sunday when the feast occurs during the week, or on some other established day. This convention is sometimes applied to the celebration of Epiphany, the Ascension, Corpus Christi, and the Sacred Heart, and All Saints. It may also be applied to the feast of a duly constituted principal patron, the anniversary of the dedication of the church in which the Mass is said, the titular feast of the church itself, the titular feast of the order or congregation, the feast of the holy founder of the order or congregation, and solemnities which are celebrated with an especially large attendance by the faithful (of this matter the local ordinary is the judge).
114	• Feasts
115	On feasts (Bold Type or Bold Type), the Gloria in excelsis is used. The Mass propers and the readings (of which there are two) are as appointed for the day.
116	• Obligatory memorials
117	On obligatory memorials (Ordinary Type), the Gloria in excelsis is not used. The Mass propers of the day are used but the readings are often the normal weekday ones. In Lent the collect of the memorial replaces the collect of the Lent weekday but the remainder of the Mass is as for the Lent weekday.
118	• Optional memorials
119	Optional memorials (Italics), where observed, are observed like obligatory ones. Observance of the Optional memorials of the General Calendar remains available to those following the Proper Calendar of the Ordinariate.
