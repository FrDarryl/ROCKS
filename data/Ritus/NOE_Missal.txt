DECREE
The Order of the Eucharistic celebration having been established, and the texts belonging to the
Roman Missal having been approved by the Supreme Pontiff Paul VI by means of the Apostolic Constitution Missale Romanum, dated 3 April 1969, this Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship, by mandate of the same Supreme Pontiff, now promulgates this new edition of the Roman Missal prepared in
accordance with the decrees of the Second Vatican Council and declares it to be typical.
As to use of the new Roman Missal, it is permitted for the Latin edition to be put into use as
soon as it is published, with the necessary adjustments concerning the celebrations of the Saints, until
the revised calendar is brought definitively into effect. To the Conferences of Bishops is entrusted the
responsibility for preparing editions in the vernacular and for setting the date for them to come into
force, after due confirmation by the Apostolic See.
All things to the contrary notwithstanding.

Decree
CONCERNING THE SECOND TYPICAL EDITION
Since the Missale Romanum must be printed once more, variations and additions have been introduced so that this new edition may accord with documents published subsequent to the appearance
of the first edition of 1970.
In the Institutio Generalis, whose marginal numbers are unchanged, a description of the functions of acolyte and lector has been inserted instead of those that the subdeacon used to carry out
(nos. 142-152).
There is another change of some importance in the part of the Missal that contains the Ritual
Masses and the Masses for Various Needs. Certain formularies have been completed by the insertion
of Entrance and Communion Antiphons. In addition, texts have been added for the Ritual Mass of
Dedication of a Church and Altar and for the Mass for Reconciliation and, among Votive Masses, the
texts that were widely requested for the Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church,
and of the Most Holy Name of Mary.
Some other variations of lesser importance have been introduced in headings and rubrics, so
that they might correspond better to the words and expressions that occur in the new liturgical books.
The Supreme Pontiff Paul VI has approved by his authority this second edition of the Missale
Romanum and the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship now issues it and declares it to be typical.
It will be the responsibility of Conferences of Bishops to introduce the variations contained in
this second edition of the Missale Romanum into editions to be prepared in the vernacular languages.
All things to the contrary notwithstanding.

ConCERNING the Third Typical Edition
At the outset of the third millennium after the Incarnation of the Lord, it has been decided to
prepare a new edition of the Missale Romanum, to take account of the more recent documents of the
Apostolic See and especially of the new Code of Canon Law, and to meet the various needs for emendation and augmentation.
Regarding the Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani, some variations have been introduced consistent with the manner of expression and prescriptions of other liturgical books and also recommended
by pastoral experience. The permitted cases regarding the faculty to distribute Holy Communion
under both kinds are set out more clearly; a newly-composed Chapter 9 has been added, in which a
way is outlined of adapting the Roman Missal in an appropriate way to pastoral needs.
Other formulas have been added for celebrations recently inserted into the General Roman Calendar. With the aim of fostering devotion to the Mother of God, the Common of the Blessed Virgin
Mary has been endowed with new Mass formularies. Likewise, in other Commons, in Masses for
Various Needs and Occassions and in the Masses for the Dead, the order of prayers has from time to
time been changed for the sake of greater consistency in the texts. In the Masses of Lent, in accord with
ancient liturgical practice, a Prayer over the People has been inserted for each day.
In an appendix to the Order of Mass are also to be found the Eucharistic Prayer for Reconciliation and a special Eucharistic Prayer, which may be used for various needs.
The Supreme Pontiff John Paul II approved by his authority this third edition of the Roman
Missal on 10 April 2000, and the Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments
now publishes it and declares it to be typical.
Conferences of Bishops shall ensure that, within an appropriate period of time, new vernacular
versions of the Missale Romanum are faithfully and accurately prepared from this third typical edition
for the recognitio of the Apostolic See in accordance with the norm of law, with the preceding versions
in use up till now being emended accurately in fidelity to the original Latin text.
Furthermore, this third typical Latin edition of the Missale Romanum may be used in the celebration of the Most Holy Eucharist from the day on which it is published, but it will come into force on
the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of the Lord in the year 2000.
All things to the contrary notwithstanding.

APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION
PROMULGATION OF THE MISSALE ROMANUM
RENEWED BY DECREE OF THE SECOND ECUMENICAL
COUNCIL OF THE VATICAN

Paul, Bishop
servant of the servants of god
for an everlasting memorial

The Missale Romanum promulgated in accordance with the decree of the Council of Trent by Our Predecessor Saint Pius V in the year 1570,1 is recognized by all as being numbered among the many wonderful
fruits that issued from that same Sacred Synod to the benefit of the whole Church of Christ. For throughout four centuries not only have Priests of the Latin Rite had it as their norm for celebrating the Eucharistic Sacrifice, but messengers of the holy Gospel have also carried it into almost every land. Moreover,
innumerable men of great holiness have abundantly nourished their devotion to God by drawing from
it both readings taken from the Sacred Scripture and prayers, the chief part of which Saint Gregory the
Great had arranged in a certain order.
Yet since the time when there began to grow and gain strength among the Christian people a concern for promoting the Sacred Liturgy which, in the opinion of Our Predecessor of venerable memory
Pius XII, manifested both an indication of the very great favor of God’s providence towards the men of
this age, and the salvific movement of the Holy Spirit through his Church, it has similarly become clear
that the formulas of the Roman Missal need both to be somewhat revised and also to be enriched with
additions.2 This task Our same Predecessor inaugurated with the restoration of the Easter Vigil and of
the Rite of Holy Week,3 and thus took, as it were, a first step towards the adaptation of the Roman Missal
to the sensitivities of this new age.
The recent Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, in the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium,
laid the foundations for the general renewal of the Roman Missal, laying down that “texts and rites
should be ordered in such a way that they express more clearly the holy things they signify,”4 and later
that “the Order of Mass should be revised in such a way that the purpose proper to its individual parts, as
also the connection between them, may be more clearly evident, and that devout and active participation
by the faithful may be facilitated,”5 then that “the treasures of the Bible be opened up more abundantly
so that richer fare may be spread before the faithful at the table of God’s Word,”6 and finally that “a new
rite for concelebration is to be drawn up and inserted into the Roman Pontifical and the Roman Missal.”7

APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION OF POPE PAUL VI

However, it should in no way be thought that this revision of the Roman Missal has been introduced without preparation, since without any doubt the way was prepared by progress in liturgical
disciplines these last four centuries. For if, after the Council of Trent, the reading and examination of
“ancient manuscripts, both those in the Vatican library and others discovered elsewhere” helped not
a little in the revision of the Roman Missal, as is confirmed by the Apostolic Constitution Quo primum
issued by Our Predecessor Saint Pius V, subsequently on the one hand very ancient liturgical sources
have of course been discovered and published, and on the other hand the liturgical formularies of the
Eastern Church have been studied more deeply. As a result, it has been the desire of many that not only
these doctrinal and spiritual riches not lie in the darkness of archives, but rather be brought out into the
light to enlighten and nourish the minds and spirits of Christians.
Now, however, in order to set out, at least in broad outline, the new arrangement of the Roman
Missal, We first point out that in the Institutio Generalis, which We have used as a proemium to the book,
new norms are given for the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice, regarding both the rites to be carried
out and the functions proper to each person present and participating and to the furnishings and the
places necessary for the conduct of divine worship.
The principal innovation is to be considered to lie in the restoration concerning the Eucharistic
Prayer, as it is called. For although in the Roman Rite the first part of this Prayer, that is, the Preface,
acquired various formulas over the passage of centuries, the second part, which was called the Canon
Actionis, took on a fixed form between the fourth and fifth centuries; whereas, by contrast, the Oriental
Liturgies admitted a certain variety among the Anaphoras themselves. Regarding this matter, besides
the endowment of the Eucharistic Prayer with a number of Prefaces, either taken from the earlier tradition of the Roman Church or now newly composed, so that through them particular parts of the mystery
of salvation may become more clearly evident and more numerous and richer motives for thanksgiving,
We have also ordered that three new Canons be provided, added alongside this same Prayer. However,
both for what are called pastoral reasons and to facilitate concelebration, We have ordered that the
words of the Lord be one and the same in each formula of the Canon. Hence in each Eucharistic Prayer
We wish those words to be proclaimed as follows: over the bread, Accipite et manducate ex hoc omnes: Hoc
est enim Corpus meum, quod pro vobis tradetur; and over the chalice: Accipite et bibite ex eo omnes: Hic est enim
calix Sanguinis mei novi et aeterni testamenti, qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum.
Hoc facite in meam commemorationem. As to the words Mysterium fidei, removed from the context of the
words of Christ our Lord and spoken by the Priest, these open the way, as it were, to the acclamation of
the faithful.
Regarding the Order of Mass, “the rites have been simplified, due care being taken to preserve
their substance.”8 For those things “that, with the passage of time, came to be duplicated or were added
to little advantage”9 have been omitted, especially with regard to the rites for the offering of the bread
and wine and with regard to the rites of the breaking of the bread and of Communion.
	Furthermore, “there have been restored . . . in accordance with the ancient norm of the holy
Fathers, various elements which have suffered injury through accidents of history.”10 Among such are
the Homily,11 the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful,12 and the Penitential Rite or rite of reconciliation with God and with the brethren, to be enacted at the beginning of Mass: to which due importance
has been restored, as was opportune.
In addition, according to the prescription of the Second Vatican Council that “over the course
of a prescribed number of years a more representa­tive portion of the Holy Scriptures be read to the
people,”13 the entire body of readings to be read on Sundays has been arranged over three years. Moreover, on days that are in any way festive, the readings of the Epistle and Gospel are preceded by another

reading taken from the Old Testament, or during Easter Time from the Acts of the Apostles. For by this
means, the continuous process of the mystery of salvation is illustrated, as set forth in the revealed
words of God. This great abundance of biblical readings, which sets before the faithful on feast days the
most precious part of the Sacred Scriptures, is completed by the addition of other parts of the sacred
books, which are read on days that are not festive.
All these things have been arranged in this way so as to arouse more and more among Christ’s
faithful that hunger for the Word of God14 by which, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the people
of the New Covenant can be seen, as it were, to be impelled towards the perfect unity of the Church. We
trust that given this arrangement both Priests and faithful may make more devout spiritual preparation
for the Lord’s Supper and that, meditating more deeply on Sacred Scripture, they will be nourished
more abundantly each day by the words of the Lord. In consequence, in accord with the teachings of the
Second Vatican Council, Sacred Scripture will be regarded by all as an abiding fountain of spiritual life,
as the principal basis for the handing on of Christian doctrine, and finally as the core of all theological
formation.
In this restoration of the Missale Romanum, not only have the three parts We have already mentioned been changed, namely the Eucharistic Prayer, the Order of Mass, and the Order of Readings, but
the others in which it consists have been revised and notably modified, that is: the Temporal, the Sanctoral, the Common of Saints, the Ritual Masses, and the Votive Masses, as they are called. Among these,
particular care has been taken with the orations, which have not only been increased in number, so
that new prayers respond to the new needs of these times, but also the most ancient prayers have been
revised to accord with the ancient texts. As a result, to each weekday of the principal liturgical times,
namely, Advent, Christmas, Lent, and Easter, has now been assigned its own distinct oration.
Moreover, although the text of the Graduale Romanum, at least as regards the music, has been left
unchanged, for the sake of easier understanding, the Responsorial Psalm, which Saint Augustine and
Saint Leo the Great often mention, and the Entrance and Communion Antiphons for use where appropriate in Masses without singing, have been restored.
Finally, from the matters that We have explained so far concerning the new Missale Romanum,
there is something that We are now pleased to insist upon and to effect. When Our Predecessor Saint
Pius V promulgated the editio princeps of the Missale Romanum, he presented it to the Christian people
as an instrument, as it were, of liturgical unity and as a monument of true and reverent worship in the
Church. We, too, no less, even though We have accepted into the new Roman Missal “lawful variations
and adaptations”15 in virtue of what the Second Vatican Council prescribed, We are no less confident
that it will be received by the Christian faithful as a help in witnessing to and strengthening the unity
of all, by means of which, in the variety of so many languages, one and the same prayer of all will rise
up, more fragrant than any incense, to the heavenly Father, through our High Priest Jesus Christ, in the
Holy Spirit.
What We have prescribed in this Our Constitution shall enter into force on the thirtieth day of the
month of November this year, that is, the First Sunday of Advent.
We decree that these Our laws and prescriptions be firm and effective now and in the future,
notwithstanding, to the extent necessary, the Apostolic Constitutions and Ordinances issued by Our
Predecessors nor other prescriptions, even those worthy of particular mention and derogation.
Given at Rome, at Saint Peter’s, on the third day of the month of April, the day of the Supper of
Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the year 1969, the sixth of Our Pontificate.

THE GENERAL INSTRUCTION
OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

INTRODUCTION
1.	As Christ the Lord was about to celebrate with the disciples the paschal supper in which he instituted the Sacrifice of his Body and Blood, he commanded that a large, furnished upper room be prepared
(Lk 22:12). Indeed, the Church has always judged that this command also applied to herself whenever
she decided about things related to the disposition of people’s minds, and of places, rites and texts for
the Celebration of the Most Holy Eucharist. The present norms, too, prescribed in keeping with the will
of the Second Vatican Council, together with the new Missal with which the Church of the Roman Rite
will henceforth celebrate the Mass, are again a demonstration of this same solicitude of the Church, of
her faith and her unaltered love for the supreme mystery of the Eucharist, and also attest to her continuous and consistent tradition, even though certain new elements have been introduced.

Testimony of an Unaltered Faith
2. 	The sacrificial nature of the Mass, solemnly defended by the Council of Trent, because it accords
with the universal tradition of the Church,1 was once more stated by the Second Vatican Council,
which pronounced these clear words about the Mass: “At the Last Supper, Our Savior instituted the
Eucharistic Sacrifice of his Body and Blood, by which the Sacrifice of his Cross is perpetuated until
he comes again; and till then he entrusts the memorial of his Death and Resurrection to his beloved
spouse, the Church.”2
What is taught in this way by the Council is consistently expressed in the formulas of the Mass.
Moreover, the doctrine which stands out in the following sentence, already notable and concisely
expressed in the ancient Sacramentary commonly called the Leonine—“for whenever the memorial
of this sacrifice is celebrated the work of our redemption is accomplished”3—is aptly and exactly
expounded in the Eucharistic Prayers; for as in these the Priest enacts the anamnesis, while turned
towards God likewise in the name of all the people, he renders thanks and offers the living and holy
sacrifice, that is, the Church’s oblation and the sacrificial Victim by whose death God himself willed to
reconcile us to himself;4 and the Priest also prays that the Body and Blood of Christ may be a sacrifice
which is acceptable to the Father and which brings salvation to the whole world.5
So, in the new Missal the rule of prayer (lex orandi) of the Church corresponds to her perennial
rule of faith (lex credendi), by which we are truly taught that the sacrifice of his Cross and its sacramental renewal in the Mass, which Christ the Lord instituted at the Last Supper and commanded his
Apostles to do in his memory, are one and the same, differing only in the manner of their offering; and
as a result, that the Mass is at one and the same time a sacrifice of praise, thanksgiving, propitiation,
and satisfaction.
3.
Moreover, the wondrous mystery of the real presence of the Lord under the Eucharistic species,
confirmed by the Second Vatican Council6 and other teachings of the Church’s Magisterium7 in the
same sense and with the same doctrine as the Council of Trent proposed that it must be believed,8

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

is proclaimed in the celebration of the Mass, not only by the very words of consecration by which
Christ is rendered present through transubstantiation, but also with a sense and a demonstration of
the greatest reverence and adoration which strives for realization in the Eucharistic liturgy. For the
same reason, the Christian people are led to worship this wondrous Sacrament through adoration in
a special way on Thursday of the Lord’s Supper in Holy Week and on the Solemnity of the Most Holy
Body and Blood of Christ.
4.	In truth, the nature of the ministerial Priesthood proper to the Bishop and the Priest, who offer
the Sacrifice in the person of Christ and who preside over the gathering of the holy people, shines
forth in the form of the rite itself, on account of the more prominent place and function given to the
Priest. The essential elements of this function are set out and explained clearly and extensively in the
Preface for the Chrism Mass on Thursday of Holy Week, the day, namely, when the institution of the
Priesthood is commemorated. For in the Preface is made clear how the conferral of Priestly power is
accomplished through the laying on of hands; and, by the listing one by one of its duties, that power
is described which is the continuation of the power of Christ, the High Priest of the New Testament.
5.
Moreover, by this nature of the ministerial Priesthood, something else is put in its proper light,
something certainly to be held in great esteem, namely, the royal Priesthood of the faithful, whose
spiritual sacrifice is brought to completion through the ministry of the Bishop and the Priests, in union
with the Sacrifice of Christ, the sole Mediator.9 For the celebration of the Eucharist is the action of the
whole Church, and in it each one should carry out solely but totally that which pertains to him, in
virtue of the place of each within the People of God. The result of this is that greater consideration is
also given to some aspects of the celebration that have sometimes been accorded less attention in the
course of the centuries. For this people is the People of God, purchased by Christ’s Blood, gathered
together by the Lord, nourished by his word, the people called to present to God the prayers of the
entire human family, a people that gives thanks in Christ for the mystery of salvation by offering his
Sacrifice, a people, finally, that is brought together in unity by Communion in the Body and Blood of
Christ. This people, though holy in its origin, nevertheless grows constantly in holiness by conscious,
active, and fruitful participation in the mystery of the Eucharist.10

Uninterrupted Tradition
6.
When it set out its instructions for the renewal of the Order of Mass, the Second Vatican Council,
using, namely, the same words as did St. Pius V in the Apostolic Constitution Quo primum, by which
the Missal of Trent was promulgated in 1570, also ordered, among other things, that a number of rites
be restored “to the original norm of the holy Fathers.”11 From the fact that the same words are used, it
can be noted how the two Roman Missals, although four centuries have intervened, embrace one and
the same tradition. Furthermore, if the inner elements of this tradition are reflected upon, it is also
understood how outstandingly and felicitously the older Roman Missal is brought to fulfillment in the
later one.
7. 	In truly difficult times, when the Catholic faith in the sacrificial nature of the Mass, the ministerial Priesthood, and the real and perpetual presence of Christ under the Eucharistic species were called
into question, St. Pius V was first of all concerned with preserving the more recent tradition, then
unjustly assailed, introducing only very slight changes into the sacred rite. In fact, the Missal of 1570
differs very little from the very first printed edition of 1474, which in turn faithfully takes up again
the Missal used in the time of Pope Innocent III. Moreover, manuscript books in the Vatican Library,
even though they provided material for several textual emendations, by no means made it possible to

pursue inquiry into “ancient and approved authors” further back than the liturgical commentaries of
the Middle Ages.
8. 	Today, however, innumerable writings of scholars have shed light on the “norm of the holy
Fathers,” which the revisers of the Missal of St. Pius V assiduously followed. For following the first
publication in 1571 of the Sacramentary called the Gregorian, critical editions of other ancient Roman
and Ambrosian Sacramentaries were disseminated, often in printed form, as were ancient Hispanic
and Gallican liturgical books; these editions brought to light numerous prayers of no slight spiritual
value but previously unknown.
In the same way, traditions of the first centuries, before the rites of East and West were formed,
are now better known because of the discovery of so many liturgical documents.
Furthermore, continuing progress in the study of the holy Fathers has also shed upon the theology of the mystery of the Eucharist the light brought by the doctrine of such illustrious Fathers of
Christian antiquity as St. Irenaeus, St. Ambrose, St. Cyril of Jerusalem, and St. John Chrysostom.
9. 	Hence, the “norm of the holy Fathers” requires not only the preservation of what our immediate forebears have handed on to us, but also an understanding and a more profound pondering of the
Church’s entire past ages and of all the ways in which her one faith has been expressed in forms of
human and social culture so greatly differing among themselves, indeed, as those prevailing in the
Semitic, Greek, and Latin regions. Moreover, this broader view allows us to see how the Holy Spirit
endows the People of God with a marvelous fidelity in preserving the unalterable deposit of faith,
even though there is a very great variety of prayers and rites.

Accommodation to New Conditions
10. 	Hence, the new Missal, while bearing witness to the Roman Church’s rule of prayer (lex orandi),
also safeguards the deposit of faith handed down by the more recent Councils and marks in its turn a
step of great importance in liturgical tradition.
For, when the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council reaffirmed the dogmatic pronouncements
of the Council of Trent, they spoke at a far different time in world history, and, for that reason, were
able to bring forward proposals and measures regarding pastoral life that could not have even been
foreseen four centuries earlier.
11. 	The Council of Trent had already recognized the great catechetical usefulness contained in the
celebration of Mass but was unable to bring out all its consequences in regard to actual practice.
In fact, many at that time requested that permission be given to use the vernacular in celebrating
the Eucharistic Sacrifice. To such a request, the Council, by reason of the circumstances of that age,
judged it a matter of duty to answer by insisting once more on the teaching of the Church as had been
handed on, according to which the Eucharistic Sacrifice is in the first place the action of Christ himself,
whose inherent efficacy is therefore unaffected by the manner in which the faithful participate in it.
The Council for this reason stated in these firm and likewise measured words: “Although the Mass
contains much instruction for the faithful people, it did not seem to the Fathers expedient, however,
that it be celebrated indiscriminately in the vernacular.”12 And the Council declared worthy of censure
anyone maintaining that “the rite of the Roman Church, in which part of the Canon and the words of
consecration are pronounced in a low voice, is to be condemned, or that the Mass must be celebrated
only in the vernacular.”13 Nevertheless, at the same time as it prohibited the use of the vernacular in
the Mass, it ordered, on the other hand, pastors of souls to put appropriate catechesis in its place:
“Lest Christ’s flock go hungry . . . the Holy Synod commands pastors and each and all of those others
having the care of souls that frequently during the celebration of Mass, either personally or through

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

others, they should explain what is read at Mass; and expound, among other things, something of the
mystery of this most holy Sacrifice, especially on Sundays and feast days.”14
12. 	Hence, the Second Vatican Council, having come together in order to accommodate the Church
to the requirements of her proper apostolic office precisely in these times, considered thoroughly, as
had the Council of Trent, the catechetical and pastoral character of the Sacred Liturgy.15 And since no
Catholic would now deny a sacred rite celebrated in Latin to be legitimate and efficacious, the Council
was also able to concede that “not rarely adopting the vernacular language may be of great usefulness
for the people” and gave permission for it to be used.16 The eagerness with which this measure was
everywhere received has certainly been so great that it has led, under the guidance of the Bishops and
the Apostolic See itself, to permission for all liturgical celebrations in which the people participate to
be in the vernacular, so that the people may more fully understand the mystery which is celebrated.
13. 	In this regard, although the use of the vernacular in the Sacred Liturgy is a means, admittedly
of great importance, for expressing more clearly catechesis on the mystery, a catechesis inherent in the
celebration itself, the Second Vatican Council ordered additionally that certain prescriptions of the
Council of Trent that had not been followed everywhere be brought to fruition, such as the Homily to
be given on Sundays and feast days17 and the faculty to interject certain explanations during the sacred
rites themselves.18
Above all, the Second Vatican Council, which recommended “that more perfect form of participation in the Mass by which the faithful, after the Priest’s Communion, receive the Lord’s Body from
the same Sacrifice,”19 called for another desire of the Fathers of Trent to be put into effect, namely, that
for the sake of a fuller participation in the Holy Eucharist “at each Mass the faithful present should
communicate not only by spiritual desire but also by sacramental reception of the Eucharist.”20
14. 	Prompted by the same intention and pastoral zeal, the Second Vatican Council was able to give
renewed consideration to what was established by Trent on Communion under both kinds. And
indeed, since nowadays the doctrinal principles on the complete efficacy of Eucharistic Communion
received under the species of bread alone are not in any way called into question, the Council gave
permission for the reception on occasion of Communion under both kinds, because this clearer form
of the sacramental sign offers a particular opportunity for understanding more deeply the mystery in
which the faithful participate.21
15. 	In this manner the Church, while remaining faithful to her office as teacher of truth, safeguarding “things old,” that is, the deposit of tradition, fulfills at the same time the duty of examining and
prudently adopting “things new” (cf. Mt 13:52).
For part of the new Missal orders the prayers of the Church in a way more open to the needs of
our times. Of this kind are above all the Ritual Masses and Masses for Various Needs, in which tradition and new elements are appropriately brought together. Thus, while a great number of expressions,
drawn from the Church’s most ancient tradition and familiar through the many editions of the Roman
Missal, have remained unchanged, numerous others have been accommodated to the needs and conditions proper to our own age, and still others, such as the prayers for the Church, for the laity, for
the sanctification of human labor, for the community of all nations, and certain needs proper to our

era, have been newly composed, drawing on the thoughts and often the very phrasing of the recent
documents of the Council.
On account, moreover, of the same attitude toward the new state of the world as it now is, it
seemed to cause no harm at all to so revered a treasure if some phrases were changed so that the language would be in accord with that of modern theology and would truly reflect the current state of
the Church’s discipline. Hence, several expressions regarding the evaluation and use of earthly goods
have been changed, as have several which alluded to a certain form of outward penance which was
proper to other periods of the Church’s past.
In this way, finally, the liturgical norms of the Council of Trent have certainly been completed
and perfected in many particulars by those of the Second Vatican Council, which has carried into
effect the efforts to bring the faithful closer to the Sacred Liturgy that have been taken up these last
four centuries and especially those of recent times, and above all the attention to the Liturgy promoted
by St. Pius X and his Successors.

Chapter I

The Importance and Dignity
of the Celebration of the Eucharist
16. 	The celebration of Mass, as the action of Christ and of the People of God arrayed hierarchically,
is the center of the whole of Christian life for the Church both universal and local, as well as for each
of the faithful individually.22 For in it is found the high point both of the action by which God sanctifies
the world in Christ and of the worship that the human race offers to the Father, adoring him through
Christ, the Son of God, in the Holy Spirit.23 In it, moreover, during the course of the year, the mysteries
of redemption are celebrated so as to be in some way made present.24 As to the other sacred actions and
all the activities of the Christian life, these are bound up with it, flow from it, and are ordered to it.25
17. 	It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that the celebration of the Mass or the Lord’s Supper
be so ordered that the sacred ministers and the faithful taking part in it, according to the state proper
to each, may draw from it more abundantly26 those fruits, to obtain which, Christ the Lord instituted
the Eucharistic Sacrifice of his Body and Blood and entrusted it as the memorial of his Passion and
Resurrection to the Church, his beloved Bride.27
18. This will fittingly come about if, with due regard for the nature and other circumstances of each
liturgical assembly, the entire celebration is arranged in such a way that it leads to a conscious, active,
and full participation of the faithful, namely in body and in mind, a participation fervent with faith,
hope, and charity, of the sort which is desired by the Church and which is required by the very nature
of the celebration and to which the Christian people have a right and duty in virtue of their Baptism.28
19. 	Even though it is on occasion not possible to have the presence and active participation of the
faithful, which manifest more clearly the ecclesial nature of the celebration,29 the celebration of the
Eucharist is always endowed with its own efficacy and dignity, since it is the act of Christ and of
the Church, in which the Priest fulfills his own principal function and always acts for the sake of the
people’s salvation.
Hence the Priest is recommended to celebrate the Eucharistic Sacrifice, in so far as he can, even
daily.30
20. Since, however, the celebration of the Eucharist, like the entire Liturgy, is carried out by means
of perceptible signs by which the faith is nourished, strengthened, and expressed,31 the greatest care is
to be taken that those forms and elements proposed by the Church are chosen and arranged, which,

THE IMPORTANCE AND DIGNITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF THE EUCHARIST

25

given the circumstances of persons and places, more effectively foster active and full participation and
more aptly respond to the spiritual needs of the faithful.
21. 	Hence this Instruction aims both to offer general lines for a suitable ordering of the celebration
of the Eucharist and to explain the rules by which individual forms of celebration may be arranged.32
22. 	The celebration of the Eucharist in a particular Church is of the utmost importance.
For the Diocesan Bishop, the prime steward of the mysteries of God in the particular Church
entrusted to his care, is the moderator, promoter, and guardian of the whole of liturgical life.33 In celebrations that take place with the Bishop presiding, and especially in the celebration of the Eucharist
by the Bishop himself with the Presbyterate, the Deacons, and the people taking part, the mystery of
the Church is manifest. Hence, solemn celebrations of Mass of this sort must be exemplary for the
entire diocese.
The Bishop should therefore be determined that the Priests, the Deacons, and the lay Christian
faithful grasp ever more deeply the genuine significance of the rites and liturgical texts, and thereby
be led to the active and fruitful celebration of the Eucharist. To that end, he should also be vigilant in
ensuring that the dignity of these celebrations be enhanced and, in promoting such dignity, the beauty
of the sacred place, of the music, and of art should contribute as greatly as possible.
23. Moreover, in order that such a celebration may correspond more fully to the prescriptions and
spirit of the Sacred Liturgy, and also in order that its pastoral effectiveness be enhanced, certain accommodations and adaptations are set out in this General Instruction and in the Order of Mass.
24. These adaptations consist, for the most part, in the choice of certain rites or texts, that is, of the
chants, readings, prayers, explanatory interventions, and gestures capable of responding better to
the needs, the preparation, and the culture of the participants and which are entrusted to the Priest
Celebrant. However, the Priest will remember that he is the servant of the Sacred Liturgy and that he
himself is not permitted, on his own initiative, to add, to remove, or to change anything in the celebration of Mass.34
25. 	In addition, at the proper place in the Missal are indicated certain adaptations which in accordance with the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy pertain respectively to the Diocesan Bishop or to
the Conference of Bishops35 (cf. below nos. 387, 388-393).
26. 	As for variations and the more profound adaptations which give consideration to the traditions
and culture of peoples and regions, to be introduced in accordance with article 40 of the Constitution
on the Sacred Liturgy, for reasons of usefulness or necessity, those norms set out in the Instruction on
the Roman Liturgy and Inculturation36 and below in nos. 395-399 are to be observed.

CHAPTER II

The Structure of the Mass,
Its Elements, and Its Parts
I. THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE MASS
27. 	At Mass or the Lord’s Supper the People of God is called together, with a Priest presiding and
acting in the person of Christ, to celebrate the memorial of the Lord or Eucharistic Sacrifice.37 In an outstanding way there applies to such a local gathering of the holy Church the promise of Christ: “Where
two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in their midst” (Mt 18:20). For in the celebration of
Mass, in which the Sacrifice of the Cross is perpetuated,38 Christ is really present in the very assembly
gathered in his name, in the person of the minister, in his word, and indeed substantially and uninterruptedly under the Eucharistic species.39
28. 	The Mass consists in some sense of two parts, namely the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of
the Eucharist, these being so closely interconnected that they form but one single act of worship.40 For
in the Mass is spread the table both of God’s Word and of the Body of Christ, and from it the faithful
are to be instructed and refreshed.41 There are also certain rites that open and conclude the celebration.

II. THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE MASS
Reading and Explaining the Word of God
29. When the Sacred Scriptures are read in the Church, God himself speaks to his people, and Christ,
present in his word, proclaims the Gospel.
Therefore, the readings from the Word of God are to be listened to reverently by everyone, for
they are an element of the greatest importance in the Liturgy. Although in the readings from Sacred
Scripture the Word of God is addressed to all people of whatever era and is understandable to them,
a fuller understanding and a greater efficaciousness of the word is nevertheless fostered by a living
commentary on the word, that is, by the Homily, as part of the liturgical action.42

The Prayers and Other Parts Pertaining to the Priest
30. 	Among those things assigned to the Priest, the prime place is occupied by the Eucharistic Prayer,
which is the high point of the whole celebration. Next are the orations, that is to say, the Collect, the
Prayer over the Offerings, and the Prayer after Communion. These prayers are addressed to God by

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MASS, ITS ELEMENTS, AND its PARTS

27

the Priest who presides over the assembly in the person of Christ, in the name of the entire holy people
and of all present.43 Hence they are rightly called the “presidential prayers.”
31. Likewise it is also for the Priest, in the exercise of his office of presiding over the gathered assembly, to offer certain explanations that are foreseen in the rite itself. Where this is laid down by the
rubrics, the celebrant is permitted to adapt them somewhat so that they correspond to the capacity
for understanding of those participating. However, the Priest should always take care to keep to the
sense of the explanatory text given in the Missal and to express it in just a few words. It is also for the
presiding Priest to regulate the Word of God and to impart the final blessing. He is permitted, furthermore, in a very few words, to give the faithful an introduction to the Mass of the day (after the initial
Greeting and before the Penitential Act), to the Liturgy of the Word (before the readings), and to the
Eucharistic Prayer (before the Preface), though never during the Eucharistic Prayer itself; he may also
make concluding comments regarding the entire sacred action before the Dismissal.
32. 	The nature of the “presidential” parts requires that they be spoken in a loud and clear voice
and that everyone listen to them attentively.44 Therefore, while the Priest is pronouncing them, there
should be no other prayers or singing, and the organ or other musical instruments should be silent.
33. 	For the Priest, as the one who presides, expresses prayers in the name of the Church and of the
assembled community; but at times he prays only in his own name, asking that he may exercise his
ministry with greater attention and devotion. Prayers of this kind, which occur before the reading of
the Gospel, at the Preparation of the Gifts, and also before and after the Communion of the Priest, are
said quietly.

Other Formulas Occurring during the Celebration
34. Since the celebration of Mass by its nature has a “communitarian” character,45 both the dialogues
between the Priest and the assembled faithful, and the acclamations are of great significance;46 for
they are not simply outward signs of communal celebration but foster and bring about communion
between Priest and people.
35. 	The acclamations and the responses of the faithful to the Priest’s greetings and prayers constitute that level of active participation that is to be made by the assembled faithful in every form of the
Mass, so that the action of the whole community may be clearly expressed and fostered.47
36. 	Other parts, most useful for expressing and fostering the active participation of the faithful, and
which are assigned to the whole gathering, include especially the Penitential Act, the Profession of
Faith, the Universal Prayer, and the Lord’s Prayer.

28

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

37. 	Finally, among other formulas:
a) Some constitute an independent rite or act, such as the Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the
highest), the Responsorial Psalm, the Alleluia and Verse before the Gospel, the Sanctus (Holy,
Holy, Holy), the Memorial Acclamation, and the chant after Communion;
b) Others, on the other hand, accompany some other rite, such as the chants at the Entrance, at
the Offertory, at the fraction (Agnus Dei, Lamb of God) and at Communion.

The Manner of Pronouncing the Different Texts
38. 	In texts that are to be pronounced in a loud and clear voice, whether by the Priest or the Deacon, or
by a reader, or by everyone, the voice should correspond to the genre of the text itself, that is, depending
upon whether it is a reading, a prayer, an explanatory comment, an acclamation, or a sung text; it should
also be suited to the form of celebration and to the solemnity of the gathering. Consideration should also
be given to the characteristics of different languages and of the culture of different peoples.
Therefore, in the rubrics and in the norms that follow, words such as “say” and “proclaim” are
to be understood either of singing or of reciting, with due regard for the principles stated here above.

The Importance of Singing
39. 	The Christian faithful who come together as one in expectation of the Lord’s coming are
instructed by the Apostle Paul to sing together Psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles (cf. Col 3:16).
Singing is the sign of the heart’s joy (cf. Acts 2:46). Thus St. Augustine says rightly, “Singing is for one
who loves,”48 and there is also an ancient proverb: “Whoever sings well prays twice over.”
40. 	Great importance should therefore be attached to the use of singing in the celebration of the Mass,
with due consideration for the culture of peoples and abilities of each liturgical assembly. Although it
is not always necessary (e.g., in weekday Masses) to sing all the texts that are in principle meant to be
sung, every care should be taken that singing by the ministers and the people not be absent in celebrations that occur on Sundays and on Holydays of Obligation.
However, in the choosing of the parts actually to be sung, preference is to be given to those that
are of greater importance and especially to those which are to be sung by the Priest or the Deacon or a
reader, with the people replying, or by the Priest and people together.49
41. 	The main place should be given, all things being equal, to Gregorian chant, as being proper to
the Roman Liturgy. Other kinds of sacred music, in particular polyphony, are in no way excluded,
provided that they correspond to the spirit of the liturgical action and that they foster the participation
of all the faithful.50
Since the faithful from different countries come together ever more frequently, it is desirable that
they know how to sing together at least some parts of the Ordinary of the Mass in Latin, especially the
Profession of Faith and the Lord’s Prayer, according to the simpler settings.51

Gestures and Bodily Posture
42. 	The gestures and bodily posture of both the Priest, the Deacon, and the ministers, and also of
the people, must be conducive to making the entire celebration resplendent with beauty and noble

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MASS, ITS ELEMENTS, AND its PARTS

29

simplicity, to making clear the true and full meaning of its different parts, and to fostering the participation of all.52 Attention must therefore be paid to what is determined by this General Instruction and
by the traditional practice of the Roman Rite and to what serves the common spiritual good of the
People of God, rather than private inclination or arbitrary choice.
A common bodily posture, to be observed by all those taking part, is a sign of the unity of the
members of the Christian community gathered together for the Sacred Liturgy, for it expresses the
intentions and spiritual attitude of the participants and also fosters them.
43. 	The faithful should stand from the beginning of the Entrance Chant, or while the Priest
approaches the altar, until the end of the Collect; for the Alleluia Chant before the Gospel; while the
Gospel itself is proclaimed; during the Profession of Faith and the Universal Prayer; and from the invitation, Orate, fratres (Pray, brethren), before the Prayer over the Offerings until the end of Mass, except
at the places indicated here below.
The faithful should sit, on the other hand, during the readings before the Gospel and the Responsorial Psalm and for the Homily and during the Preparation of the Gifts at the Offertory; and, if appropriate, they may sit or kneel during the period of sacred silence after Communion.
In the dioceses of the United States of America, they should kneel beginning after the singing or
recitation of the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy) until after the Amen of the Eucharistic Prayer, except when
prevented on occasion by ill health, or for reasons of lack of space, of the large number of people present, or for another reasonable cause. However, those who do not kneel ought to make a profound bow
when the Priest genuflects after the Consecration. The faithful kneel after the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God)
unless the Diocesan Bishop determines otherwise.53
For the sake of uniformity in gestures and bodily postures during one and the same celebration,
the faithful should follow the instructions which the Deacon, a lay minister, or the Priest gives, according to what is laid down in the Missal.
44. 	Among gestures are included also actions and processions, by which the Priest, with the Deacon
and ministers, goes to the altar; the Deacon carries the Evangeliary or Book of the Gospels to the ambo
before the proclamation of the Gospel; the faithful bring up the gifts and come forward to receive
Communion. It is appropriate that actions and processions of this sort be carried out with decorum
while the chants proper to them are sung, in accordance with the norms laid down for each.

Silence
45. Sacred silence also, as part of the celebration, is to be observed at the designated times.54 Its
nature, however, depends on the moment when it occurs in the different parts of the celebration. For
in the Penitential Act and again after the invitation to pray, individuals recollect themselves; whereas
after a reading or after the Homily, all meditate briefly on what they have heard; then after Communion, they praise God in their hearts and pray to him.
Even before the celebration itself, it is a praiseworthy practice for silence to be observed in the
church, in the sacristy, in the vesting room, and in adjacent areas, so that all may dispose themselves
to carry out the sacred celebration in a devout and fitting manner.

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

III. THE INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF THE MASS
A) The Introductory Rites
46. 	The rites that precede the Liturgy of the Word, namely, the Entrance, the Greeting, the Penitential Act, the Kyrie, the Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) and Collect, have the character of a
beginning, an introduction, and a preparation.
Their purpose is to ensure that the faithful, who come together as one, establish communion
and dispose themselves properly to listen to the Word of God and to celebrate the Eucharist worthily.
In certain celebrations that are combined with Mass according to the norms of the liturgical
books, the Introductory Rites are omitted or take place in a particular way.

The Entrance
47. When the people are gathered, and as the Priest enters with the Deacon and ministers, the
Entrance Chant begins. Its purpose is to open the celebration, foster the unity of those who have been
gathered, introduce their thoughts to the mystery of the liturgical time or festivity, and accompany the
procession of the Priest and ministers.
48. This chant is sung alternately by the choir and the people or similarly by a cantor and the people,
or entirely by the people, or by the choir alone. In the Dioceses of the United States of America there
are four options for the Entrance Chant: (1) the antiphon from the Missal or the antiphon with its
Psalm from the Graduale Romanum as set to music there or in another setting; (2) the antiphon and
Psalm of the Graduale Simplex for the liturgical time; (3) a chant from another collection of Psalms and
antiphons, approved by the Conference of Bishops or the Diocesan Bishop, including Psalms arranged
in responsorial or metrical forms; (4) another liturgical chant that is suited to the sacred action, the day,
or the time of year, similarly approved by the Conference of Bishops or the Diocesan Bishop.
If there is no singing at the Entrance, the antiphon given in the Missal is recited either by the
faithful, or by some of them, or by a reader; otherwise, it is recited by the Priest himself, who may even
adapt it as an introductory explanation (cf. no. 31).

Reverence to the Altar and Greeting of the Assembled People
49. When they have arrived at the sanctuary, the Priest, the Deacon, and the ministers reverence the
altar with a profound bow.
Moreover, as an expression of veneration, the Priest and Deacon then kiss the altar itself; the
Priest, if appropriate, also incenses the cross and the altar.
50. When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest stands at the chair and, together with the
whole gathering, signs himself with the Sign of the Cross. Then by means of the Greeting he signifies
the presence of the Lord to the assembled community. By this greeting and the people’s response, the
mystery of the Church gathered together is made manifest.
After the greeting of the people, the Priest, or the Deacon, or a lay minister may very briefly
introduce the faithful to the Mass of the day.

The Penitential Act
51. 	After this, the Priest calls upon the whole community to take part in the Penitential Act, which,
after a brief pause for silence, it does by means of a formula of general confession. The rite concludes
with the Priest’s absolution, which, however, lacks the efficacy of the Sacrament of Penance.
From time to time on Sundays, especially in Easter Time, instead of the customary Penitential
Act, the blessing and sprinkling of water may take place as a reminder of Baptism.55
55

Cf. below, pp. 1453-1456.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MASS, ITS ELEMENTS, AND its PARTS

31

The Kyrie, Eleison
52. 	After the Penitential Act, the Kyrie, eleison (Lord, have mercy), is always begun, unless it has
already been part of the Penitential Act. Since it is a chant by which the faithful acclaim the Lord and
implore his mercy, it is usually executed by everyone, that is to say, with the people and the choir or
cantor taking part in it.
Each acclamation is usually pronounced twice, though it is not to be excluded that it be repeated
several times, by reason of the character of the various languages, as well as of the artistry of the music
or of other circumstances. When the Kyrie is sung as a part of the Penitential Act, a “trope” precedes
each acclamation.

The Gloria in Excelsis
53. 	The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is a most ancient and venerable hymn by which
the Church, gathered in the Holy Spirit, glorifies and entreats God the Father and the Lamb. The text
of this hymn may not be replaced by any other. It is intoned by the Priest or, if appropriate, by a cantor or by the choir; but it is sung either by everyone together, or by the people alternately with the
choir, or by the choir alone. If not sung, it is to be recited either by everybody together or by two choirs
responding one to the other.
It is sung or said on Sundays outside Advent and Lent, and also on Solemnities and Feasts, and
at particular celebrations of a more solemn character.

The Collect
54. Next the Priest calls upon the people to pray and everybody, together with the Priest, observes
a brief silence so that they may become aware of being in God’s presence and may call to mind their
intentions. Then the Priest pronounces the prayer usually called the “Collect” and through which the
character of the celebration finds expression. By an ancient tradition of the Church, the Collect prayer
is usually addressed to God the Father, through Christ, in the Holy Spirit,56 and is concluded with a
Trinitarian ending, or longer ending, in the following manner:
– 	If the prayer is directed to the Father: Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and
reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever;
– 	If it is directed to the Father, but the Son is mentioned at the end: Who lives and reigns with you
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever;
– 	If it is directed to the Son: Who live and reign with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
The people, joining in this petition, make the prayer their own by means of the acclamation
Amen.
At Mass only a single Collect is ever said.

B) The Liturgy of the Word
55. 	The main part of the Liturgy of the Word is made up of the readings from Sacred Scripture
together with the chants occurring between them. As for the Homily, the Profession of Faith, and the
Universal Prayer, they develop and conclude it. For in the readings, as explained by the Homily, God
speaks to his people,57 opening up to them the mystery of redemption and salvation, and offering
spiritual nourishment; and Christ himself is present through his word in the midst of the faithful.58

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

By silence and by singing, the people make this divine word their own, and affirm their adherence to
it by means of the Profession of Faith; finally, having been nourished by the divine word, the people
pour out their petitions by means of the Universal Prayer for the needs of the whole Church and for
the salvation of the whole world.

Silence
56. 	The Liturgy of the Word is to be celebrated in such a way as to favor meditation, and so any
kind of haste such as hinders recollection is clearly to be avoided. In the course of it, brief periods of
silence are also appropriate, accommodated to the assembled congregation; by means of these, under
the action of the Holy Spirit, the Word of God may be grasped by the heart and a response through
prayer may be prepared. It may be appropriate to observe such periods of silence, for example, before
the Liturgy of the Word itself begins, after the First and Second Reading, and lastly at the conclusion
of the Homily.59

The Biblical Readings
57. 	In the readings, the table of God’s Word is spread before the faithful, and the treasures of the
Bible are opened to them.60 Hence, it is preferable that the arrangement of the biblical readings be
maintained, for by them the unity of both Testaments and of salvation history is brought out. Nor is
it lawful to replace the readings and Responsorial Psalm, which contain the Word of God, with other,
non-biblical texts.61
58. 	In the celebration of the Mass with the people, the readings are always read from the ambo.
59. 	The function of proclaiming the readings is by tradition not presidential but ministerial. Therefore the readings are to be read by a reader, but the Gospel by the Deacon or, in his absence, by another
Priest. If, however, a Deacon or another Priest is not present, the Priest Celebrant himself should read
the Gospel, and moreover, if no other suitable reader is present, the Priest Celebrant should also proclaim the other readings as well.
After each reading, whoever reads it pronounces the acclamation, and by means of the reply the
assembled people give honor to the Word of God that they have received in faith and with gratitude.
60. 	The reading of the Gospel constitutes the high point of the Liturgy of the Word. The Liturgy
itself teaches the great reverence that is to be shown to this reading by setting it off from the other
readings with special marks of honor, by the fact of which minister is appointed to proclaim it and by
the blessing or prayer with which he prepares himself; and also by the fact that through their acclamations the faithful acknowledge and confess that Christ is present and is speaking to them and stand as
they listen to the reading; and by the mere fact of the marks of reverence that are given to the Book of
the Gospels.

The Responsorial Psalm
61. After the First Reading follows the Responsorial Psalm, which is an integral part of the Liturgy
of the Word and which has great liturgical and pastoral importance, since it fosters meditation on the
Word of God.
The Responsorial Psalm should correspond to each reading and should usually be taken from
the Lectionary.

p. 910.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MASS, ITS ELEMENTS, AND its PARTS

33

It is preferable for the Responsorial Psalm to be sung, at least as far as the people’s response is
concerned. Hence the psalmist, or cantor of the Psalm, sings the Psalm verses at the ambo or another
suitable place, while the whole congregation sits and listens, normally taking part by means of the
response, except when the Psalm is sung straight through, that is, without a response. However, in
order that the people may be able to sing the Psalm response more easily, texts of some responses and
Psalms have been chosen for the different times of the year or for the different categories of Saints.
These may be used instead of the text corresponding to the reading whenever the Psalm is sung. If the
Psalm cannot be sung, then it should be recited in a way that is particularly suited to fostering meditation on the Word of God.
In the Dioceses of the United States of America, instead of the Psalm assigned in the Lectionary,
there may be sung either the Responsorial Gradual from the Graduale Romanum, or the Responsorial
Psalm or the Alleluia Psalm from the Graduale Simplex, as described in these books, or an antiphon and
Psalm from another collection of Psalms and antiphons, including Psalms arranged in metrical form,
providing that they have been approved by the Conference of Bishops or the Diocesan Bishop. Songs
or hymns may not be used in place of the Responsorial Psalm.

The Acclamation before the Gospel
62. 	After the reading that immediately precedes the Gospel, the Alleluia or another chant laid down
by the rubrics is sung, as the liturgical time requires. An acclamation of this kind constitutes a rite or
act in itself, by which the gathering of the faithful welcomes and greets the Lord who is about to speak
to them in the Gospel and profess their faith by means of the chant. It is sung by everybody, standing,
and is led by the choir or a cantor, being repeated as the case requires. The verse, on the other hand, is
sung either by the choir or by a cantor.
a) 	The Alleluia is sung in every time of year other than Lent. The verses are taken from the Lectionary or the Graduale.
b) During Lent, instead of the Alleluia, the Verse before the Gospel as given in the Lectionary is
sung. It is also possible to sing another Psalm or Tract, as found in the Graduale.
63.

When there is only one reading before the Gospel:
a) during a time of year when the Alleluia is prescribed, either an Alleluia Psalm or the Responsorial Psalm followed by the Alleluia with its verse may be used;
b) during a time of year when the Alleluia is not foreseen, either the Psalm and the Verse before
the Gospel or the Psalm alone may be used;
c) the Alleluia or the Verse before the Gospel, if not sung, may be omitted.

64. 	The Sequence which, except on Easter Sunday and on Pentecost Day, is optional, is sung before
the Alleluia.

The Homily
65. 	The Homily is part of the Liturgy and is highly recommended,62 for it is necessary for the nurturing of the Christian life. It should be an explanation of some aspect of the readings from Sacred
Scripture or of another text from the Ordinary or the Proper of the Mass of the day and should take
into account both the mystery being celebrated and the particular needs of the listeners.63

(1964), p. 890.

34

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

66. 	The Homily should ordinarily be given by the Priest Celebrant himself or be entrusted by him
to a concelebrating Priest, or from time to time and, if appropriate, to the Deacon, but never to a lay
person.64 In particular cases and for a just cause, the Homily may even be given by a Bishop or a Priest
who is present at the celebration but cannot concelebrate.
On Sundays and Holydays of Obligation there is to be a Homily at every Mass that is celebrated
with the people attending, and it may not be omitted without a grave reason. On other days it is recommended, especially on the weekdays of Advent, Lent, and Easter Time, as well as on other festive
days and occasions when the people come to church in greater numbers.65
It is appropriate for a brief period of silence to be observed after the Homily.

The Profession of Faith
67. 	The purpose of the Creed or Profession of Faith is that the whole gathered people may respond
to the Word of God proclaimed in the readings taken from Sacred Scripture and explained in the Homily and that they may also honor and confess the great mysteries of the faith by pronouncing the rule
of faith in a formula approved for liturgical use and before the celebration of these mysteries in the
Eucharist begins.
68. 	The Creed is to be sung or said by the Priest together with the people on Sundays and Solemnities. It may be said also at particular celebrations of a more solemn character.
If it is sung, it is intoned by the Priest or, if appropriate, by a cantor or by the choir. It is then sung
either by everybody together or by the people alternating with the choir.
If it is not sung, it is to be recited by everybody together or by two choirs responding one to
the other.

The Universal Prayer
69. 	In the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful, the people respond in some sense to the Word
of God which they have received in faith and, exercising the office of their baptismal Priesthood, offer
prayers to God for the salvation of all. It is desirable that there usually be such a form of prayer in
Masses celebrated with the people, so that petitions may be offered for holy Church, for those who
govern with authority over us, for those weighed down by various needs, for all humanity, and for the
salvation of the whole world.66
70. 	The series of intentions is usually to be:
a)
b)
c)
d)

for the needs of the Church;
for public authorities and the salvation of the whole world;
for those burdened by any kind of difficulty;
for the local community.

Nevertheless, in any particular celebration, such as a Confirmation, a Marriage, or at a Funeral,
the series of intentions may be concerned more closely with the particular occasion.
71. 	It is for the Priest Celebrant to regulate this prayer from the chair. He himself begins it with
a brief introduction, by which he calls upon the faithful to pray, and likewise he concludes it with

an oration. The intentions announced should be sober, be composed with a wise liberty and in few
words, and they should be expressive of the prayer of the entire community.
They are announced from the ambo or from another suitable place, by the Deacon or by a cantor,
a reader, or one of the lay faithful.67
The people, for their part, stand and give expression to their prayer either by an invocation said
in common after each intention or by praying in silence.

C) The Liturgy of the Eucharist
72. 	At the Last Supper Christ instituted the Paschal Sacrifice and banquet, by which the Sacrifice of
the Cross is continuously made present in the Church whenever the Priest, representing Christ the Lord,
carries out what the Lord himself did and handed over to his disciples to be done in his memory.68
For Christ took the bread and the chalice, gave thanks, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying: Take, eat and drink: this is my Body; this is the chalice of my Blood. Do this in memory
of me. Hence, the Church has arranged the entire celebration of the Liturgy of the Eucharist in parts
corresponding to precisely these words and actions of Christ, namely:
a) 	At the Preparation of the Gifts, bread and wine with water are brought to the altar, the same
elements, that is to say, which Christ took into his hands.
b) 	In the Eucharistic Prayer, thanks is given to God for the whole work of salvation, and the
offerings become the Body and Blood of Christ.
c) 	Through the fraction and through Communion, the faithful, though many, receive from the
one bread the Lord’s Body and from the one chalice the Lord’s Blood in the same way that
the Apostles received them from the hands of Christ himself.

The Preparation of the Gifts
73. 	At the beginning of the Liturgy of the Eucharist the gifts which will become Christ’s Body and
Blood are brought to the altar.
First of all, the altar or Lord’s table, which is the center of the whole Liturgy of the Eucharist,69
is made ready when on it are placed the corporal, purificator, Missal, and chalice (unless this last is
prepared at the credence table).
The offerings are then brought forward. It is a praiseworthy practice for the bread and wine to be
presented by the faithful. They are then accepted at an appropriate place by the Priest or the Deacon to
be carried to the altar. Even though the faithful no longer bring from their own possessions the bread
and wine intended for the liturgy as was once the case, nevertheless the rite of carrying up the offerings still keeps its spiritual efficacy and significance.
Even money or other gifts for the poor or for the Church, brought by the faithful or collected in
the church, are acceptable; given their purpose, they are to be put in a suitable place away from the
Eucharistic table.
74. 	The procession bringing the gifts is accompanied by the Offertory Chant (cf. no. 37 b), which
continues at least until the gifts have been placed on the altar. The norms on the manner of singing are
the same as for the Entrance Chant (cf. no. 48). Singing may always accompany the rite at the Offertory, even when there is no procession with the gifts.

36

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

75. 	The bread and wine are placed on the altar by the Priest to the accompaniment of the prescribed
formulas; the Priest may incense the gifts placed on the altar and then incense the cross and the altar
itself, so as to signify the Church’s offering and prayer rising like incense in the sight of God. Next,
the Priest, because of his sacred ministry, and the people, by reason of their baptismal dignity, may be
incensed by the Deacon or by another minister.
76. 	Then the Priest washes his hands at the side of the altar, a rite in which the desire for interior
purification finds expression.

The Prayer over the Offerings
77. 	Once the offerings have been placed on the altar and the accompanying rites completed, by
means of the invitation to pray with the Priest and by means of the Prayer over the Offerings, the
Preparation of the Gifts is concluded and preparation made for the Eucharistic Prayer.
At Mass, a single Prayer over the Offerings is said, and it ends with the shorter conclusion, that
is: Through Christ our Lord. If, however, the Son is mentioned at the end of this prayer, the conclusion
is: Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
The people, joining in this petition, make the prayer their own by means of the acclamation Amen.

The Eucharistic Prayer
78. Now the center and high point of the entire celebration begins, namely, the Eucharistic Prayer
itself, that is, the prayer of thanksgiving and sanctification. The Priest calls upon the people to lift up
their hearts towards the Lord in prayer and thanksgiving; he associates the people with himself in
the Prayer that he addresses in the name of the entire community to God the Father through Jesus
Christ in the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, the meaning of this Prayer is that the whole congregation of
the faithful joins with Christ in confessing the great deeds of God and in the offering of Sacrifice. The
Eucharistic Prayer requires that everybody listens to it with reverence and in silence.
79. 	The main elements of which the Eucharistic Prayer consists may be distinguished from one
another in this way:
a) 	The thanksgiving (expressed especially in the Preface), in which the Priest, in the name of the
whole of the holy people, glorifies God the Father and gives thanks to him for the whole
work of salvation or for some particular aspect of it, according to the varying day, festivity,
or time of year.
b) 	The acclamation, by which the whole congregation, joining with the heavenly powers, sings
the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy). This acclamation, which constitutes part of the Eucharistic
Prayer itself, is pronounced by all the people with the Priest.
c) 	The epiclesis, in which, by means of particular invocations, the Church implores the power of
the Holy Spirit that the gifts offered by human hands be consecrated, that is, become Christ’s
Body and Blood, and that the unblemished sacrificial Victim to be consumed in Communion
may be for the salvation of those who will partake of it.
d) 	The Institution narrative and Consecration, by which, by means of the words and actions of
Christ, that Sacrifice is effected which Christ himself instituted during the Last Supper, when
he offered his Body and Blood under the species of bread and wine, gave them to the Apostles
to eat and drink, and leaving with the latter the command to perpetuate this same mystery.
e) 	The anamnesis, by which the Church, fulfilling the command that she received from Christ
the Lord through the Apostles, celebrates the memorial of Christ, recalling especially his
blessed Passion, glorious Resurrection, and Ascension into heaven.
f) 	The oblation, by which, in this very memorial, the Church, in particular that gathered here
and now, offers the unblemished sacrificial Victim in the Holy Spirit to the Father. The
Church’s intention, indeed, is that the faithful not only offer this unblemished sacrificial

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MASS, ITS ELEMENTS, AND its PARTS

37

Victim but also learn to offer their very selves,70 and so day by day to be brought, through
the mediation of Christ, into unity with God and with each other, so that God may at last be
all in all.71
g) 	The intercessions, by which expression is given to the fact that the Eucharist is celebrated in
communion with the whole Church, of both heaven and of earth, and that the oblation is
made for her and for all her members, living and dead, who are called to participate in the
redemption and salvation purchased by the Body and Blood of Christ.
h) 	The concluding doxology, by which the glorification of God is expressed and which is affirmed
and concluded by the people’s acclamation Amen.

The Communion Rite
80. Since the celebration of the Eucharist is the Paschal Banquet, it is desirable that in accordance
with the Lord’s command his Body and Blood should be received as spiritual food by those of the
faithful who are properly disposed. This is the sense of the fraction and the other preparatory rites by
which the faithful are led more immediately to Communion.

The Lord’s Prayer
81. In the Lord’s Prayer a petition is made for daily bread, which for Christians means principally
the Eucharistic Bread, and entreating also purification from sin, so that what is holy may in truth be
given to the holy. The Priest pronounces the invitation to the prayer, and all the faithful say the prayer
with him; then the Priest alone adds the embolism, which the people conclude by means of the doxology. The embolism, developing the last petition of the Lord’s Prayer itself, asks for deliverance from
the power of evil for the whole community of the faithful.
The invitation, the Prayer itself, the embolism, and the doxology by which the people conclude
these things are sung or are said aloud.

The Rite of Peace
82. 	There follows the Rite of Peace, by which the Church entreats peace and unity for herself and for
the whole human family, and the faithful express to each other their ecclesial communion and mutual
charity before communicating in the Sacrament.
As for the actual sign of peace to be given, the manner is to be established by the Conferences
of Bishops in accordance with the culture and customs of the peoples. However, it is appropriate that
each person, in a sober manner, offer the sign of peace only to those who are nearest.

The Fraction of the Bread
83. 	The Priest breaks the Eucharistic Bread, with the assistance, if the case requires, of the Deacon
or a concelebrant. The gesture of breaking bread done by Christ at the Last Supper, which in apostolic
times gave the entire Eucharistic Action its name, signifies that the many faithful are made one body (1
Cor 10:17) by receiving Communion from the one Bread of Life, which is Christ, who for the salvation
of the world died and rose again. The fraction or breaking of bread is begun after the sign of peace and
is carried out with proper reverence, and should not be unnecessarily prolonged or accorded exaggerated importance. This rite is reserved to the Priest and the Deacon.

38

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

The Priest breaks the Bread and puts a piece of the host into the chalice to signify the unity of
the Body and Blood of the Lord in the work of salvation, namely, of the Body of Jesus Christ, living
and glorious. The supplication Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) is usually sung by the choir or cantor with the
congregation replying; or at least recited aloud. This invocation accompanies the fraction of the bread
and, for this reason, may be repeated as many times as necessary until the rite has been completed.
The final time it concludes with the words grant us peace.

Communion
84. 	The Priest prepares himself by a prayer, said quietly, so that he may fruitfully receive the Body
and Blood of Christ. The faithful do the same, praying silently.
Then the Priest shows the faithful the Eucharistic Bread, holding it over the paten or over the
chalice, and invites them to the banquet of Christ; and along with the faithful, he then makes an act of
humility, using the prescribed words from the Gospels.
85. 	It is most desirable that the faithful, just as the Priest himself is bound to do, receive the Lord’s
Body from hosts consecrated at the same Mass and that, in the cases where this is foreseen, they partake of the chalice (cf. no. 283), so that even by means of the signs Communion may stand out more
clearly as a participation in the sacrifice actually being celebrated.72
86. While the Priest is receiving the Sacrament, the Communion Chant is begun, its purpose being
to express the spiritual union of the communicants by means of the unity of their voices, to show
gladness of heart, and to bring out more clearly the “communitarian” character of the procession to
receive the Eucharist. The singing is prolonged for as long as the Sacrament is being administered to
the faithful.73 However, if there is to be a hymn after Communion, the Communion Chant should be
ended in a timely manner.
Care should be taken that singers, too, can receive Communion with ease.
87. 	In the Dioceses of the United States of America, there are four options for singing at Communion: (1) the antiphon from the Missal or the antiphon with its Psalm from the Graduale Romanum, as
set to music there or in another musical setting; (2) the antiphon with Psalm from the Graduale Simplex
of the liturgical time; (3) a chant from another collection of Psalms and antiphons, approved by the
Conference of Bishops or the Diocesan Bishop, including Psalms arranged in responsorial or metrical
forms; (4) some other suitable liturgical chant (cf. no. 86) approved by the Conference of Bishops or the
Diocesan Bishop. This is sung either by the choir alone or by the choir or a cantor with the people.
However, if there is no singing, the antiphon given in the Missal may be recited either by the
faithful, or by some of them, or by a reader; otherwise, it is recited by the Priest himself after he has
received Communion and before he distributes Communion to the faithful.
88. When the distribution of Communion is over, if appropriate, the Priest and faithful pray quietly
for some time. If desired, a Psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may also be sung by the whole
congregation.
89. 	To bring to completion the prayer of the People of God, and also to conclude the whole Communion Rite, the Priest pronounces the Prayer after Communion, in which he prays for the fruits of
the mystery just celebrated.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MASS, ITS ELEMENTS, AND its PARTS

39

At Mass a single Prayer after Communion is said, and it ends with the shorter conclusion; that is:
–
–
–

if the prayer is directed to the Father: Through Christ our Lord;
if it is directed to the Father, but the Son is mentioned at the end: Who lives and reigns for ever
and ever;
if it is directed to the Son: Who live and reign for ever and ever.

The people make the prayer their own by means of the acclamation Amen.
D) The Concluding Rites
90. 	To the Concluding Rites belong the following:
a) brief announcements, should they be necessary;
b) the Priest’s Greeting and Blessing, which on certain days and occasions is expanded and
expressed by the Prayer over the People or another more solemn formula;
c) the Dismissal of the people by the Deacon or the Priest, so that each may go back to doing
good works, praising and blessing God;
d) the kissing of the altar by the Priest and the Deacon, followed by a profound bow to the altar
by the Priest, the Deacon, and the other ministers.

Chapter III

Duties and Ministries in the Mass
91. 	The celebration of the Eucharist is the action of Christ and of the Church, namely, of the holy
people united and ordered under the Bishop. It therefore pertains to the whole Body of the Church,
manifests it, and has its effect upon it. Indeed, it also affects the individual members of the Church in a
different way, according to their different orders, functions, and actual participation.74 In this way, the
Christian people, “a chosen race, a royal Priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession,”
expresses its cohesion and its hierarchical ordering.75 All, therefore, whether ordained ministers or
lay Christian faithful, in fulfilling their function or their duty, should carry out solely but totally that
which pertains to them.76

I. THE DUTIES OF THOSE IN HOLY ORDERS
92. 	Every legitimate celebration of the Eucharist is directed by the Bishop, either in person or
through Priests who are his helpers.77
When the Bishop is present at a Mass where the people are gathered, it is most fitting that he
himself celebrate the Eucharist and associate Priests with himself in the sacred action as concelebrants.
This is done not for the sake of adding outward solemnity to the rite, but to signify more vividly the
mystery of the Church, “the sacrament of unity.”78
If, on the other hand, the Bishop does not celebrate the Eucharist but has assigned it to someone
else to do this, then it is appropriate that he should preside over the Liturgy of the Word, wearing the
pectoral cross, stole, and cope over an alb, and that he should give the blessing at the end of Mass.79
93. 	A Priest, also, who possesses within the Church the sacred power of Orders to offer sacrifice in
the person of Christ,80 presides by this fact over the faithful people gathered here and now, presides
over their prayer, proclaims to them the message of salvation, associates the people with himself in
the offering of sacrifice through Christ in the Holy Spirit to God the Father, and gives his brothers and
sisters the Bread of eternal life and partakes of it with them. Therefore, when he celebrates the Eucharist, he must serve God and the people with dignity and humility, and by his bearing and by the way
he pronounces the divine words he must convey to the faithful the living presence of Christ.
94. 	After the Priest, the Deacon, in virtue of the sacred Ordination he has received, holds first place
among those who minister in the celebration of the Eucharist. For the sacred Order of the Diaconate
has been held in high honor in the Church even from the early time of the Apostles.81 At Mass the
Deacon has his own part in proclaiming the Gospel, from time to time in preaching God’s Word, in
announcing the intentions of the Universal Prayer, in ministering to the Priest, in preparing the altar
and in serving the celebration of the Sacrifice, in distributing the Eucharist to the faithful, especially

DUTIES AND MINISTRIES IN THE MASS

under the species of wine, and from time to time in giving instructions regarding the people’s gestures
and posture.

II. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD
95. 	In the celebration of Mass the faithful form a holy people, a people of God’s own possession and
a royal Priesthood, so that they may give thanks to God and offer the unblemished sacrificial Victim
not only by means of the hands of the Priest but also together with him and so that they may learn to
offer their very selves.82 They should, moreover, take care to show this by their deep religious sense
and their charity toward brothers and sisters who participate with them in the same celebration.
They are consequently to avoid any appearance of singularity or division, keeping in mind that
they have only one Father in heaven and that hence are all brothers or sisters one to the other.
96. Moreover, they are to form one body, whether in hearing the Word of God, or in taking part in
the prayers and in the singing, or above all by the common offering of the Sacrifice and by participating together at the Lord’s table. This unity is beautifully apparent from the gestures and bodily postures observed together by the faithful.
97. 	The faithful, moreover, should not refuse to serve the People of God in gladness whenever they
are asked to perform some particular service or function in the celebration.

III. PARTICULAR MINISTRIES
The Ministry of the Instituted Acolyte and Lector
98. 	The acolyte is instituted for service at the altar and to assist the Priest and Deacon. It is his place
principally to prepare the altar and the sacred vessels and, if necessary, to distribute the Eucharist to
the faithful as an extraordinary minister.83
In the ministry of the altar, the acolyte has his own proper functions (cf. nos. 187-193), which he
must carry out in person.
99. 	The lector is instituted to proclaim the readings from Sacred Scripture, with the exception of the
Gospel. He may also announce the intentions for the Universal Prayer and, in the absence of a psalmist, recite the Psalm between the readings.
In the celebration of the Eucharist, the lector has his own proper function (cf. nos. 194-198),
which he himself must carry out.

Other Functions
100. 	In the absence of an instituted acolyte, there may be deputed lay ministers to serve at the altar
and assist the Priest and the Deacon; these carry the cross, the candles, the thurible, the bread, the wine,
and the water, or who are even deputed to distribute Holy Communion as extraordinary ministers.84

42

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

101. 	In the absence of an instituted lector, other lay people may be deputed to proclaim the readings from Sacred Scripture, people who are truly suited to carrying out this function and carefully
prepared, so that by their hearing the readings from the sacred texts the faithful may conceive in their
hearts a sweet and living affection for Sacred Scripture.85
102. 	It is the psalmist’s place to sing the Psalm or other biblical canticle to be found between the readings. To carry out this function correctly, it is necessary for the psalmist to be accomplished in the art
of singing Psalms and have a facility in public speaking and elocution.
103. 	Among the faithful, the schola cantorum or choir exercises its own liturgical function, its place
being to take care that the parts proper to it, in keeping with the different genres of chant, are properly
carried out and to foster the active participation of the faithful by means of the singing.86 What is said
about the schola cantorum also applies, with due regard for the relevant norms, to other musicians, and
especially the organist.
104. 	It is fitting that there be a cantor or a choir director to direct and support the people’s singing.
Indeed, when there is no choir, it is up to the cantor to direct the different chants, with the people taking the part proper to them.87
105. 	A liturgical function is also exercised by:
a) 	The sacristan, who diligently arranges the liturgical books, the vestments, and other things
that are necessary for the celebration of Mass.
b) 	The commentator, who, if appropriate, provides the faithful briefly with explanations and
exhortations so as to direct their attention to the celebration and ensure that they are better
disposed for understanding it. The commentator’s remarks should be thoroughly prepared
and notable for their restraint. In performing this function the commentator stands in a suitable place within sight of the faithful, but not at the ambo.
c) 	Those who take up the collections in the church.
d) 	Those who, in some regions, welcome the faithful at the church doors, seat them appropriately, and marshal them in processions.
106. 	It is desirable, at least in cathedrals and in larger churches, to have some competent minister or
master of ceremonies, to see to the appropriate arrangement of sacred actions and to their being carried out by the sacred ministers and lay faithful with decorum, order, and devotion.
107. Liturgical functions that are not proper to the Priest or the Deacon and are mentioned above
(nos. 100-106) may even be entrusted by means of a liturgical blessing or a temporary deputation to
suitable lay persons chosen by the pastor or the rector of the church.88 As to the function of serving the
Priest at the altar, the norms established by the Bishop for his diocese should be observed.

DUTIES AND MINISTRIES IN THE MASS

43

IV. THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNCTIONS AND
THE PREPARATION OF THE CELEBRATION
108. 	One and the same Priest must always exercise the presidential function in all of its parts, except
for those parts which are proper to a Mass at which the Bishop is present (cf. above no. 92).
109. 	If there are several present who are able to exercise the same ministry, nothing forbids their distributing among themselves and performing different parts of the same ministry or duty. For example,
one Deacon may be assigned to execute the sung parts, another to serve at the altar; if there are several
readings, it is well to distribute them among a number of readers, and the same applies for other matters. However, it is not at all appropriate that several persons divide a single element of the celebration
among themselves, e.g., that the same reading be proclaimed by two readers, one after the other, with
the exception of the Passion of the Lord.
110. 	If at a Mass with the people only one minister is present, that minister may exercise several different functions.
111. 	There should be harmony and diligence among all those involved in the effective preparation
of each liturgical celebration in accordance with the Missal and other liturgical books, both as regards
the rites and as regards the pastoral and musical aspects. This should take place under the direction of
the rector of the church and after consultation with the faithful in things that directly pertain to them.
However, the Priest who presides at the celebration always retains the right of arranging those things
that pertain to him.89

89

Cf. Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Sacrosanctum Concilium, no. 22.

Chapter IV

The Different Forms
of Celebrating Mass
112. 	In the local Church, first place should certainly be given, because of its significance, to the Mass
at which the Bishop presides, surrounded by his Presbyterate, Deacons, and lay ministers,90 and in
which the holy People of God participate fully and actively, for it is there that the principal manifestation of the Church is found.
At a Mass celebrated by the Bishop or at which he presides without celebrating the Eucharist,
the norms found in the Caeremoniale Episcoporum (Ceremonial of Bishops) should be observed.91
113. 	Great importance should also be given to a Mass celebrated with any community, but especially
with the parish community, inasmuch as it represents the universal Church at a given time and place,
and chiefly in the common Sunday celebration.92
114. Moreover, among those Masses celebrated by some communities, a particular place belongs to
the Conventual Mass, which is a part of the daily Office, or the “community” Mass. Although such
Masses do not involve any special form of celebration, it is nevertheless most fitting that they be celebrated with singing, especially with the full participation of all members of the community, whether
of religious or of canons. Therefore, in these Masses all should exercise their function according to the
Order or ministry they have received. Hence, it is desirable that all the Priests who are not obliged to
celebrate individually for the pastoral benefit of the faithful concelebrate in so far as possible at the
conventual or community Mass. In addition, all Priests belonging to the community who are obliged,
as a matter of duty, to celebrate individually for the pastoral benefit of the faithful may also on the
same day concelebrate at the conventual or community Mass.93 For it is preferable that Priests who
are present at a celebration of the Eucharist, unless excused for a just reason, should usually exercise
the function proper to their Order and hence take part as concelebrants, wearing sacred vestments.
Otherwise, they wear their proper choir dress or a surplice over a cassock.

I. MASS WITH THE PEOPLE
115. 	By Mass with the people is meant a Mass celebrated with the participation of the faithful. Moreover, it is appropriate, in so far as possible, and especially on Sundays and Holydays of Obligation,
that the celebration take place with singing and with a suitable number of ministers.94 It may, however,
take place even without singing and with only one minister.
116. 	If at any celebration of Mass a Deacon is present, he should exercise his function. Furthermore, it
is desirable that an acolyte, a reader, and a cantor should usually be there to assist the Priest Celebrant.
Indeed, the rite described below foresees an even greater number of ministers.

44

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

45

Things to Be Prepared
117. 	The altar is to be covered with at least one white cloth. In addition, on or next to the altar are to
be placed candlesticks with lighted candles: at least two in any celebration, or even four or six, especially for a Sunday Mass or a Holyday of Obligation, or if the Diocesan Bishop celebrates, then seven
candlesticks with lighted candles. Likewise, on the altar or close to it, there is to be a cross adorned
with a figure of Christ crucified. The candles and the cross with the figure of Christ crucified may also
be carried in the procession at the Entrance. On the altar itself may be placed a Book of the Gospels distinct from the book of other readings, unless it is carried in the Entrance Procession.
118. Likewise these should be prepared:
a) next to the Priest’s chair: the Missal and, if appropriate, a hymnal;
b) at the ambo: the Lectionary;
c) on the credence table: the chalice, corporal, purificator, and, if appropriate, the pall; the paten
and, if needed, ciboria; bread for the Communion of the Priest who presides, the Deacon, the
ministers, and the people; cruets containing the wine and the water, unless all of these are
presented by the faithful in the procession at the Offertory; the vessel of water to be blessed,
if the sprinkling of holy water takes place; the Communion-plate for the Communion of the
faithful; and whatever is needed for the washing of hands.
It is a praiseworthy practice for the chalice to be covered with a veil, which may be either of the
color of the day or white.
119. 	In the sacristy, according to the various forms of celebration, there should be prepared the sacred
vestments (cf. nos. 337-341) for the Priest, the Deacon, and other ministers:
a) for the Priest: the alb, the stole, and the chasuble;
b) for the Deacon: the alb, the stole, and the dalmatic; the latter may be omitted, however,
either out of necessity or on account of a lesser degree of solemnity;
c) for the other ministers: albs or other lawfully approved attire.95
All who wear an alb should use a cincture and an amice unless, due to the form of the alb, they
are not needed.
When the Entrance takes place with a procession, the following are also to be prepared: a Book of
the Gospels; on Sundays and festive days, a thurible and incense boat, if incense is being used; the cross
to be carried in procession; and candlesticks with lighted candles.

A) Mass without a Deacon
The Introductory Rites
120. When the people are gathered, the Priest and ministers, wearing the sacred vestments, go in
procession to the altar in this order:
a) the thurifer carrying a smoking thurible, if incense is being used;
b) ministers who carry lighted candles, and between them an acolyte or other minister with
the cross;
c) the acolytes and the other ministers;
d) a reader, who may carry a Book of the Gospels (though not a Lectionary), slightly elevated;
e) the Priest who is to celebrate the Mass.
95

Cf. the Interdicasterial Instruction on certain questions regarding the collaboration of the non-ordained faithful in the
sacred ministry of Priests, Ecclesiae de mysterio, August 15, 1997, art. 6: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), p. 869.

46

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

If incense is being used, before the procession begins, the Priest puts some into the thurible and
blesses it with the Sign of the Cross without saying anything.
121. During the procession to the altar, the Entrance Chant takes place (cf. nos. 47-48).
122. When they reach the altar, the Priest and ministers make a profound bow.
The cross adorned with a figure of Christ crucified, and carried in procession, may be placed
next to the altar to serve as the altar cross, in which case it must be the only cross used; otherwise it
is put away in a dignified place. As for the candlesticks, these are placed on the altar or near it. It is a
praiseworthy practice for the Book of the Gospels to be placed on the altar.
123. 	The Priest goes up to the altar and venerates it with a kiss. Then, if appropriate, he incenses the
cross and the altar, walking around the latter.
124. 	Once all this has been done, the Priest goes to the chair. When the Entrance Chant is concluded,
with everybody standing, the Priest and faithful sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross. The Priest
says: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. The people reply, Amen.
Then, facing the people and extending his hands, the Priest greets the people, using one of the
formulas indicated. The Priest himself or some other minister may also very briefly introduce the
faithful to the Mass of the day.
125. 	The Penitential Act follows. After this, the Kyrie is sung or said, in accordance with the rubrics
(cf. no. 52).
126. 	For celebrations where it is prescribed, the Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is either
sung or said (cf. no. 53).
127. 	The Priest then calls upon the people to pray, saying, with hands joined, Let us pray. All pray
silently with the Priest for a brief time. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Collect, at the
end of which the people acclaim, Amen.

The Liturgy of the Word
128. 	After the Collect, all sit. The Priest may, very briefly, introduce the faithful to the Liturgy of the
Word. Then the reader goes to the ambo and, from the Lectionary already placed there before Mass,
proclaims the First Reading, to which all listen. At the end, the reader pronounces the acclamation The
word of the Lord, and all reply, Thanks be to God.
Then a few moments of silence may be observed, if appropriate, so that all may meditate on
what they have heard.
129. 	Then the psalmist or the reader proclaims the verses of the Psalm and the people make the
response as usual.
130. 	If there is to be a Second Reading before the Gospel, the reader proclaims it from the ambo. All
listen and at the end reply to the acclamation, as noted above (no. 128). Then, if appropriate, a few
moments of silence may be observed.
131. 	After this, all rise, and the Alleluia or other chant is sung as the liturgical time requires (cf. nos.
62-64).

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

47

132. During the singing of the Alleluia or other chant, if incense is being used, the Priest puts some
into the thurible and blesses it. Then, with hands joined, he bows profoundly before the altar and quietly says the prayer Munda cor meum (Cleanse my heart).
133. 	If the Book of the Gospels is on the altar, the Priest then takes it and approaches the ambo, carrying the Book of the Gospels slightly elevated. He is preceded by the lay ministers, who may carry the
thurible and the candles. Those present turn towards the ambo as a sign of special reverence for the
Gospel of Christ.
134. 	At the ambo, the Priest opens the book and, with hands joined, says, The Lord be with you, to
which the people reply, And with your spirit. Then he says, A reading from the holy Gospel, making the
Sign of the Cross with his thumb on the book and on his forehead, mouth, and breast, which everyone
else does as well. The people acclaim, Glory to you, O Lord. The Priest incenses the book, if incense is
being used (cf. nos. 276-277). Then he proclaims the Gospel and at the end pronounces the acclamation The Gospel of the Lord, to which all reply, Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. The Priest kisses the book,
saying quietly the formula Per evangelica dicta (Through the words of the Gospel).
135. If no reader is present, the Priest himself proclaims all the readings and the Psalm, standing at
the ambo. If incense is being used, he puts some incense into the thurible at the ambo, blesses it, and,
bowing profoundly, says the prayer Munda cor meum (Cleanse my heart).
136. 	The Priest, standing at the chair or at the ambo itself or, if appropriate, in another worthy place,
gives the Homily. When the Homily is over, a period of silence may be observed.
137. 	The Symbol or Creed is sung or recited by the Priest together with the people (cf. no. 68) with
everyone standing. At the words et incarnatus est, etc. (and by the Holy Spirit . . . and became man) all make a
profound bow; but on the Solemnities of the Annunciation and of the Nativity of the Lord, all genuflect.
138. 	After the recitation of the Symbol or Creed, the Priest, standing at the chair with his hands
joined, by means of a brief address calls upon the faithful to participate in the Universal Prayer. Then
the cantor, the reader, or another person announces the intentions from the ambo or from some other
suitable place while facing the people. The latter take their part by replying in supplication. At the
very end, the Priest, with hands extended, concludes the petitions with a prayer.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
139. When the Universal Prayer is over, all sit, and the Offertory Chant begins (cf. no. 74).
An acolyte or other lay minister places the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the
Missal on the altar.
140. 	It is desirable that the participation of the faithful be expressed by an offering, whether of bread
and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist or of other gifts to relieve the needs of the Church and of
the poor.
The offerings of the faithful are received by the Priest, assisted by the acolyte or other minister.
The bread and wine for the Eucharist are carried to the Celebrant, who places them on the altar, while
other gifts are put in another suitable place (cf. no. 73).
141. 	The Priest accepts the paten with the bread at the altar, holds it slightly raised above the altar
with both hands and says quietly, Benedictus es, Domine (Blessed are you, Lord God). Then he places the
paten with the bread on the corporal.

48

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

142. After this, as the minister presents the cruets, the Priest stands at the side of the altar and pours
wine and a little water into the chalice, saying quietly, Per huius aquae (By the mystery of this water). He
returns to the middle of the altar and with both hands raises the chalice a little, and says quietly, Benedictus es, Domine (Blessed are you, Lord God). Then he places the chalice on the corporal and, if appropriate, covers it with a pall.
If, however, there is no Offertory Chant and the organ is not played, in the presentation of the
bread and wine the Priest may say the formulas of blessing aloud and the people acclaim, Blessed be
God for ever.
143. 	After placing the chalice on the altar, the Priest bows profoundly and says quietly, In spiritu
humilitatis (With humble spirit).
144. 	If incense is being used, the Priest then puts some in the thurible, blesses it without saying
anything, and incenses the offerings, the cross, and the altar. While standing at the side of the altar, a
minister incenses the Priest and then the people.
145. 	After the prayer In spiritu humilitatis (With humble spirit) or after the incensation, the Priest
washes his hands standing at the side of the altar and, as the minister pours the water, says quietly,
Lava me, Domine (Wash me, O Lord).
146. 	Returning to the middle of the altar, and standing facing the people, the Priest extends and then
joins his hands, and calls upon the people to pray, saying, Orate, fratres (Pray, brethren). The people rise
and make the response May the Lord accept the sacrifice, etc. Then the Priest, with hands extended, says
the Prayer over the Offerings. At the end the people acclaim, Amen.
147. 	Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer. In accordance with the rubrics (cf. no. 365), he
selects a Eucharistic Prayer from those found in the Roman Missal or approved by the Apostolic See.
By its very nature, the Eucharistic Prayer requires that only the Priest say it, in virtue of his Ordination.
The people, for their part, should associate themselves with the Priest in faith and in silence, as well
as by means of their interventions as prescribed in the course of the Eucharistic Prayer: namely, the
responses in the Preface dialogue, the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy), the acclamation after the Consecration, the acclamation Amen after the concluding doxology, as well as other acclamations approved by
the Conference of Bishops with the recognitio of the Holy See.
It is most appropriate that the Priest sing those parts of the Eucharistic Prayer for which musical
notation is provided.
148. 	As he begins the Eucharistic Prayer, the Priest extends his hands and sings or says, The Lord be
with you. The people reply, And with your spirit. As he continues, saying, Lift up your hearts, he raises his
hands. The people reply, We lift them up to the Lord. Then the Priest, with hands extended, adds, Let us
give thanks to the Lord our God, and the people reply, It is right and just. After this, the Priest, with hands
extended, continues the Preface. At its conclusion, he joins his hands and, together with all those present, sings or says aloud the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy) (cf. no. 79 b).
149. 	The Priest continues the Eucharistic Prayer in accordance with the rubrics that are set out in each
of the Prayers.
If the celebrant is a Bishop, in the Prayers, after the words N., our Pope, he adds, and me,
your unworthy servant. If, however, the Bishop is celebrating outside his own diocese, after the words
with . . . N., our Pope, he adds, my brother N., the Bishop of this Church, and me, your unworthy servant; or
after the words especially . . . N., our Pope, he adds, my brother N., the Bishop of this Church, and me, your
unworthy servant.

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

49

The Diocesan Bishop, or one who is equivalent to the Diocesan Bishop in law, must be mentioned by means of this formula: together with your servant N., our Pope, and N., our Bishop (or Vicar,
Prelate, Prefect, Abbot).
It is permitted to mention Coadjutor Bishop and Auxiliary Bishops in the Eucharistic Prayer, but
not other Bishops who happen to be present. When several are to be mentioned, this is done with the
collective formula: N., our Bishop and his assistant Bishops.
In each of the Eucharistic Prayers, these formulas are to be adapted according to the requirements of grammar.
150. 	A little before the Consecration, if appropriate, a minister rings a small bell as a signal to the
faithful. The minister also rings the small bell at each elevation by the Priest, according to local custom.
If incense is being used, when the host and the chalice are shown to the people after the Consecration, a minister incenses them.
151. 	After the Consecration when the Priest has said, The mystery of faith, the people pronounce the
acclamation, using one of the prescribed formulas.
At the end of the Eucharistic Prayer, the Priest takes the paten with the host and the chalice and
elevates them both while pronouncing alone the doxology Through him. At the end the people acclaim,
Amen. After this, the Priest places the paten and the chalice on the corporal.
152. 	After the Eucharistic Prayer is concluded, the Priest, with hands joined, says alone the introduction
to the Lord’s Prayer, and then with hands extended, he pronounces the prayer together with the people.
153. 	After the Lord’s Prayer is concluded, the Priest, with hands extended, says alone the embolism
Libera nos (Deliver us, Lord). At the end, the people acclaim, For the kingdom.
154. 	Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud the prayer Domine Iesu Christe, qui dixisti (Lord
Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles) and when it is concluded, extending and then joining his hands,
he announces the greeting of peace, facing the people and saying, The peace of the Lord be with you
always. The people reply, And with your spirit. After this, if appropriate, the Priest adds, Let us offer each
other the sign of peace.
The Priest may give the Sign of Peace to the ministers but always remains within the sanctuary,
so that the celebration is not disrupted. In the Dioceses of the United States of America, for a good
reason, on special occasions (for example, in the case of a funeral, a wedding, or when civic leaders
are present), the Priest may offer the Sign of Peace to a small number of the faithful near the sanctuary.
According to what is decided by the Conference of Bishops, all express to one another peace, communion, and charity. While the Sign of Peace is being given, it is permissible to say, The peace of the Lord be
with you always, to which the reply is Amen.
155. 	After this, the Priest takes the host, breaks it over the paten, and places a small piece in the chalice, saying quietly, Haec commixtio (May this mingling). Meanwhile the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) is sung
or said by the choir and by the people (cf. no. 83).
156. 	Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly the prayer for Communion, either Domine Iesu
Christe, Fili Dei vivi (Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God) or Perceptio Corporis et Sanguinis tui (May the
receiving of your Body and Blood).
157. When the prayer is concluded, the Priest genuflects, takes a host consecrated at the same Mass,
and, holding it slightly raised above the paten or above the chalice, facing the people, says, Ecce Agnus
Dei (Behold the Lamb of God) and together with the people he adds, Lord, I am not worthy.

50

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

158. 	After this, standing facing the altar, the Priest says quietly, Corpus Christi custodiat me in vitam
aeternam (May the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life), and reverently consumes the Body of Christ.
Then he takes the chalice, saying quietly, Sanguis Christi custodiat me in vitam aeternam (May the Blood of
Christ keep me safe for eternal life), and reverently partakes of the Blood of Christ.
159. While the Priest is receiving the Sacrament, the Communion Chant begins (cf. no. 86).
160. 	The Priest then takes the paten or ciborium and approaches the communicants, who usually
come up in procession.
It is not permitted for the faithful to take the consecrated Bread or the sacred chalice by themselves
and, still less, to hand them on from one to another among themselves. The norm established for the
Dioceses of the United States of America is that Holy Communion is to be received standing, unless
an individual member of the faithful wishes to receive Communion while kneeling (Congregation
for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Instruction Redemptionis Sacramentum,
March 25, 2004, no. 91).
When receiving Holy Communion, the communicant bows his or her head before the Sacrament
as a gesture of reverence and receives the Body of the Lord from the minister. The consecrated host
may be received either on the tongue or in the hand, at the discretion of each communicant. When
Holy Communion is received under both kinds, the sign of reverence is also made before receiving
the Precious Blood.
161. 	If Communion is given only under the species of bread, the Priest raises the host slightly and
shows it to each, saying, The Body of Christ. The communicant replies, Amen, and receives the Sacrament either on the tongue or, where this is allowed, in the hand, the choice lying with the communicant. As soon as the communicant receives the host, he or she consumes the whole of it.
If, however, Communion is given under both kinds, the rite prescribed in nos. 284-287 is to
be followed.
162. 	In the distribution of Communion the Priest may be assisted by other Priests who happen to be
present. If such Priests are not present and there is a truly large number of communicants, the Priest
may call upon extraordinary ministers to assist him, that is, duly instituted acolytes or even other
faithful who have been duly deputed for this purpose.96 In case of necessity, the Priest may depute
suitable faithful for this single occasion.97
These ministers should not approach the altar before the Priest has received Communion, and
they are always to receive from the hands of the Priest Celebrant the vessel containing the species of
the Most Holy Eucharist for distribution to the faithful.
163. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Priest himself immediately and completely
consumes at the altar any consecrated wine that happens to remain; as for any consecrated hosts that
are left, he either consumes them at the altar or carries them to the place designated for the reservation
of the Eucharist.
Upon returning to the altar, the Priest collects the fragments, should any remain, and he stands
at the altar or at the credence table and purifies the paten or ciborium over the chalice, and after this
purifies the chalice, saying quietly the formula Quod ore sumpsimus, Domine (What has passed our lips),
and dries the chalice with a purificator. If the vessels are purified at the altar, they are carried to the
credence table by a minister. Nevertheless, it is also permitted to leave vessels needing to be purified,

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

51

especially if there are several, on a corporal, suitably covered, either on the altar or on the credence
table, and to purify them immediately after Mass, after the Dismissal of the people.
164. 	After this, the Priest may return to the chair. A sacred silence may now be observed for some
time, or a Psalm or other canticle of praise or a hymn may be sung (cf. no. 88).
165. 	Then, standing at the chair or at the altar, and facing the people with hands joined, the Priest
says, Let us pray; then, with hands extended, he recites the Prayer after Communion. A brief period of
silence may precede the prayer, unless this has been already observed immediately after Communion.
At the end of the prayer the people acclaim, Amen.

The Concluding Rites
166. When the Prayer after Communion is concluded, brief announcements should be made to the
people, if there are any.
167. 	Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people, saying, The Lord be with you. They reply,
And with your spirit. The Priest, joining his hands again and then immediately placing his left hand on
his breast, raises his right hand and adds, May almighty God bless you and, as he makes the Sign of the
Cross over the people, he continues, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. All reply, Amen.
On certain days and occasions this blessing, in accordance with the rubrics, is expanded and
expressed by a Prayer over the People or another more solemn formula.
A Bishop blesses the people with the appropriate formula, making the Sign of the Cross three
times over the people.98
168. 	Immediately after the Blessing, with hands joined, the Priest adds, Ite, missa est (Go forth, the Mass
is ended) and all reply, Thanks be to God.
169. 	Then the Priest venerates the altar as usual with a kiss and, after making a profound bow with
the lay ministers, he withdraws with them.
170. 	If, however, another liturgical action follows the Mass, the Concluding Rites, that is, the Greeting, the Blessing, and the Dismissal, are omitted.

B) Mass with a Deacon
171. When he is present at the celebration of the Eucharist, a Deacon should exercise his ministry,
wearing sacred vestments. In fact, the Deacon:
a) assists the Priest and walks at his side;
b) ministers at the altar, both as regards the chalice and the book;
c) proclaims the Gospel and may, at the direction of the Priest Celebrant, give the Homily
(cf. no. 66);
d) guides the faithful people by giving appropriate instructions, and announces the intentions
of the Universal Prayer;
e) assists the Priest Celebrant in distributing Communion, and purifies and arranges the
sacred vessels;
f) carries out the duties of other ministers himself, if necessary, when none of them is present.

52

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

The Introductory Rites
172. 	Carrying the Book of the Gospels slightly elevated, the Deacon precedes the Priest as he approaches
the altar or else walks at the Priest’s side.
173. When he reaches the altar, if he is carrying the Book of the Gospels, he omits the sign of reverence
and goes up to the altar. It is a praiseworthy practice for him to place the Book of the Gospels on the altar,
after which, together with the Priest, he venerates the altar with a kiss.
If, however, he is not carrying the Book of the Gospels, he makes a profound bow to the altar with
the Priest in the customary way and with him venerates the altar with a kiss.
Lastly, if incense is being used, he assists the Priest in putting some into the thurible and in
incensing the cross and the altar.
174. 	Once the altar has been incensed, the Deacon goes to the chair together with the Priest and there
stands at the Priest’s side and assists him as necessary.

The Liturgy of the Word
175. During the singing of the Alleluia or other chant, if incense is being used, the Deacon ministers
to the Priest as he puts incense into the thurible. Then, bowing profoundly before the Priest, he asks
for the blessing, saying in a low voice, Your blessing, Father. The Priest blesses him, saying, May the Lord
be in your heart. The Deacon signs himself with the Sign of the Cross and replies, Amen. Having bowed
to the altar, he then takes up the Book of the Gospels which was placed on it and proceeds to the ambo,
carrying the book slightly elevated. He is preceded by a thurifer carrying a smoking thurible and by
ministers with lighted candles. At the ambo the Deacon greets the people, with hands joined, saying,
The Lord be with you. After this, at the words A reading from the holy Gospel, he signs with his thumb
the book and then himself on his forehead, mouth, and breast. He incenses the book and proclaims
the Gospel reading. When this is done, he acclaims, The Gospel of the Lord, and all reply, Praise to you,
Lord Jesus Christ. He then venerates the book with a kiss, saying quietly the formula Per evangelica dicta
(Through the words of the Gospel), and returns to the Priest’s side.
When the Deacon is assisting the Bishop, he carries the book to him to be kissed, or else kisses it
himself, saying quietly the formula Per evangelica dicta (Through the words of the Gospel). In more solemn
celebrations, if appropriate, the Bishop may impart a blessing to the people with the Book of the Gospels.
Lastly, the Deacon may carry the Book of the Gospels to the credence table or to another suitable
and dignified place.
176. Moreover, if there is no other suitable reader present, the Deacon should proclaim the other
readings as well.
177. 	After the introduction by the Priest, it is the Deacon himself who announces the intentions of the
Universal Prayer, usually from the ambo.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
178. 	After the Universal Prayer, while the Priest remains at the chair, the Deacon prepares the altar,
assisted by the acolyte, but it is the Deacon’s place to take care of the sacred vessels himself. He also
assists the Priest in receiving the people’s gifts. After this, he hands the Priest the paten with the bread
to be consecrated, pours wine and a little water into the chalice, saying quietly, By the mystery of this
water, etc., and after this presents the chalice to the Priest. He may also carry out the preparation of the
chalice at the credence table. If incense is being used, the Deacon assists the Priest during the incensation of the offerings, the cross, and the altar; and after this the Deacon himself or the acolyte incenses
the Priest and the people.

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

53

179. During the Eucharistic Prayer, the Deacon stands near the Priest, but slightly behind him, so that
when necessary he may assist the Priest with the chalice or the Missal.
From the epiclesis until the Priest shows the chalice, the Deacon usually remains kneeling. If
several Deacons are present, one of them may place incense in the thurible for the Consecration and
incense the host and the chalice at the elevation.
180. 	At the concluding doxology of the Eucharistic Prayer, the Deacon stands next to the Priest, and
holds the chalice elevated while the Priest elevates the paten with the host, until the people have
acclaimed, Amen.
181. 	After the Priest has said the prayer for the Rite of Peace and the greeting The peace of the Lord be
with you always and the people have replied, And with your spirit, the Deacon, if appropriate, says the
invitation to the Sign of Peace. With hands joined, he faces the people and says, Let us offer each other the
sign of peace. Then he himself receives the Sign of Peace from the Priest and may offer it to those other
ministers who are nearest to him.
182. 	After the Priest’s Communion, the Deacon receives Communion under both kinds from the
Priest himself and then assists the Priest in distributing Communion to the people. If Communion is
given under both kinds, the Deacon himself administers the chalice to the communicants; and, when
the distribution is over, standing at the altar, he immediately and reverently consumes all of the Blood
of Christ that remains, assisted, if the case requires, by other Deacons and Priests.
183. When the distribution of Communion is over, the Deacon returns to the altar with the Priest,
collects the fragments, should any remain, and then carries the chalice and other sacred vessels to
the credence table, where he purifies them and arranges them as usual, while the Priest returns to the
chair. Nevertheless, it is also permitted to leave vessels needing to be purified on a corporal, suitably
covered, on the credence table, and to purify them immediately after Mass, following the Dismissal
of the people.

The Concluding Rites
184. Once the Prayer after Communion has been said, the Deacon makes brief announcements to the
people, if indeed any need to be made, unless the Priest prefers to do this himself.
185. If a Prayer over the People or a formula of Solemn Blessing is used, the Deacon says, Bow down for
the blessing. After the Priest’s blessing, the Deacon, with hands joined and facing the people, dismisses
the people, saying, Ite, missa est (Go forth, the Mass is ended).
186. 	Then, together with the Priest, the Deacon venerates the altar with a kiss, makes a profound
bow, and withdraws in a manner similar to the Entrance Procession.
C) The Functions of the Acolyte
187. 	The functions that the acolyte may carry out are of various kinds and several may occur at the
same moment. Hence, it is desirable that these duties be suitably distributed among several acolytes.
If, in fact, only one acolyte is present, he should perform the more important duties while the rest are
to be distributed among several ministers.

The Introductory Rites
188. 	In the procession to the altar, the acolyte may carry the cross, walking between two ministers
with lighted candles. Upon reaching the altar, however, the acolyte places the cross upright near the

54

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

altar so that it may serve as the altar cross; otherwise, he puts it away in a dignified place. Then he
takes his place in the sanctuary.
189. 	Through the entire celebration, it is for the acolyte to approach the Priest or the Deacon, whenever necessary, in order to present the book to them and to assist them in any other way required. Thus
it is appropriate that, in so far as possible, the acolyte should occupy a place from which he can easily
carry out his ministry either at the chair or at the altar.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
190. 	In the absence of a Deacon, after the Universal Prayer and while the Priest remains at the chair,
the acolyte places the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar. Then,
if necessary, the acolyte assists the Priest in receiving the gifts of the people and, if appropriate, brings
the bread and wine to the altar and hands them to the Priest. If incense is being used, the acolyte presents the thurible to the Priest and assists him while he incenses the offerings, the cross, and the altar.
Then the acolyte incenses the Priest and the people.
191. 	A duly instituted acolyte, as an extraordinary minister, may, if necessary, assist the Priest in
distributing Communion to the people.99 If Communion is given under both kinds, in the absence of
a Deacon, the acolyte administers the chalice to the communicants or holds the chalice if Communion
is given by intinction.
192. Likewise, after the distribution of Communion is complete, a duly instituted acolyte helps the
Priest or Deacon to purify and arrange the sacred vessels. In the absence of a Deacon, a duly instituted acolyte carries the sacred vessels to the credence table and there purifies them, wipes them, and
arranges them as usual.
193. 	After the celebration of Mass, the acolyte and other ministers return together with the Deacon and the Priest in procession to the sacristy, in the same manner and in the same order in which
they entered.

D) The Functions of the Reader
Introductory Rites
194. 	In the procession to the altar, in the absence of a Deacon, the reader, wearing approved attire,
may carry the Book of the Gospels, slightly elevated. In that case, the reader walks in front of the Priest
but otherwise walks along with the other ministers.
195. 	Upon reaching the altar, the reader makes a profound bow with the others. If he is carrying the
Book of the Gospels, he approaches the altar and places the Book of the Gospels upon it. Then the reader
takes his own place in the sanctuary with the other ministers.

The Liturgy of the Word
196. 	The reader reads from the ambo the readings that precede the Gospel. In the absence of a psalmist, the reader may also proclaim the Responsorial Psalm after the First Reading.

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

55

197. 	In the absence of a Deacon, the reader, after the introduction by the Priest, may announce the
intentions of the Universal Prayer from the ambo.
198. 	If there is no singing at the Entrance or at Communion and the antiphons given in the Missal are
not recited by the faithful, the reader may read them at an appropriate time (cf. nos. 48, 87).

II. CONCELEBRATED MASS
199. 	Concelebration, by which the unity of the Priesthood, of the Sacrifice, and also of the whole
People of God is appropriately expressed, is prescribed by the rite itself for the Ordination of a Bishop
and of Priests, at the Blessing of an Abbot, and at the Chrism Mass.
It is recommended, moreover, unless the good of the Christian faithful requires or suggests otherwise, at:
a)
b)
c)
d)

the Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper;
the Mass during Councils, gatherings of Bishops, and Synods;
the Conventual Mass and the principal Mass in churches and oratories;
Masses at any kind of gathering of Priests, either secular or religious.100

Every Priest, however, is allowed to celebrate the Eucharist individually, though not at the same
time as a concelebration is taking place in the same church or oratory. However, on Holy Thursday,
and for the Mass of the Easter Vigil, it is not permitted to celebrate Mass individually.
200. 	Visiting Priests should be gladly admitted to concelebration of the Eucharist, provided their
Priestly standing has been ascertained.
201. When there is a large number of Priests, concelebration may take place even several times on the
same day, where necessity or pastoral advantage commend it. However, this must be done at different
times or in distinct sacred places.101
202. 	It is for the Bishop, in accordance with the norm of law, to regulate the discipline for concelebration in all churches and oratories of his diocese.
203. 	To be held in particularly high regard is that concelebration in which the Priests of any given
diocese concelebrate with their own Bishop at a stational Mass, especially on the more solemn days of
the liturgical year, at the Ordination Mass of a new Bishop of the diocese or of his Coadjutor or Auxiliary, at the Chrism Mass, at the Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper, at celebrations of the Founder
Saint of a local Church or the Patron of the diocese, on anniversaries of the Bishop, and, lastly, on the
occasion of a Synod or a pastoral visitation.
In the same way, concelebration is recommended whenever Priests gather together with their
own Bishop whether on the occasion of a retreat or at any other gathering. In these cases the sign of the
unity of the Priesthood and also of the Church inherent in every concelebration is made more clearly
manifest.102

56

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

204. 	For a particular reason, having to do either with the significance of the rite or of the festivity, the
faculty is given to celebrate or concelebrate more than once on the same day in the following cases:
a) a Priest who has celebrated or concelebrated the Chrism Mass on Thursday of Holy Week
may also celebrate or concelebrate the Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper;
b) a Priest who has celebrated or concelebrated the Mass of the Easter Vigil may celebrate or
concelebrate Mass during the day on Easter Sunday;
c) on the Nativity of the Lord (Christmas Day), all Priests may celebrate or concelebrate three
Masses, provided the Masses are celebrated at their proper times of day;
d) on the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day), all Priests may celebrate or concelebrate three Masses, provided that the celebrations take place at different
times, and with due regard for what has been laid down regarding the application of second
and third Masses;103
e) a Priest who concelebrates with the Bishop or his delegate at a Synod or pastoral visitation,
or concelebrates on the occasion of a gathering of Priests, may celebrate Mass again for
the benefit of the faithful. This holds also, with due regard for the prescriptions of law, for
groups of religious.
205. 	A concelebrated Mass, whatever its form, is arranged in accordance with the norms commonly
in force (cf. nos. 112-198), observing or adapting however what is set out below.
206. No one is ever to join a concelebration or to be admitted as a concelebrant once the Mass has
already begun.
207. 	In the sanctuary there should be prepared:
a) seats and texts for the concelebrating Priests;
b) on the credence table: a chalice of sufficient size or else several chalices.
208. 	If a Deacon is not present, the functions proper to him are to be carried out by some of the
concelebrants.
If other ministers are also absent, their proper parts may be entrusted to other suitable faithful
laypeople; otherwise, they are carried out by some of the concelebrants.
209. 	The concelebrants put on in the vesting room, or other suitable place, the sacred vestments they
customarily wear when celebrating Mass individually. However, should a just cause arise (e.g., a more
considerable number of concelebrants or a lack of vestments), concelebrants other than the principal
celebrant may omit the chasuble and simply wear the stole over the alb.

The Introductory Rites
210. When everything has been properly arranged, the procession moves as usual through the church
to the altar. The concelebrating Priests walk ahead of the principal celebrant.
211. 	On arriving at the altar, the concelebrants and the principal celebrant, after making a profound
bow, venerate the altar with a kiss, then go to their designated seats. As for the principal celebrant, if
appropriate, he incenses the cross and the altar and then goes to the chair.

pp. 401-404.

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

57

The Liturgy of the Word
212. During the Liturgy of the Word, the concelebrants remain at their places, sitting or standing
whenever the principal celebrant does.
When the Alleluia is begun, all rise, except for a Bishop, who puts incense into the thurible without saying anything and blesses the Deacon or, in the absence of a Deacon, the concelebrant who is to
proclaim the Gospel. However, in a concelebration where a Priest presides, the concelebrant who in
the absence of a Deacon proclaims the Gospel neither requests nor receives the blessing of the principal celebrant.
213. 	The Homily is usually given by the principal celebrant or by one of the concelebrants.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
214. 	The Preparation of the Gifts (cf. nos. 139-146) is carried out by the principal celebrant, while the
other concelebrants remain at their places.
215. 	After the Prayer over the Offerings has been said by the principal celebrant, the concelebrants
approach the altar and stand around it, but in such a way that they do not obstruct the execution of
the rites and that the sacred action may be seen clearly by the faithful. Nor should they obstruct the
Deacon whenever he needs to approach the altar by reason of his ministry.
The Deacon exercises his ministry near the altar, assisting whenever necessary with the chalice
and the Missal. However, in so far as possible, he stands back slightly, behind the concelebrating
Priests standing around the principal celebrant.

The Manner of Pronouncing the Eucharistic Prayer
216. 	The Preface is sung or said by the principal Priest Celebrant alone; but the Sanctus (Holy, Holy,
Holy) is sung or recited by all the concelebrants, together with the people and the choir.
217. 	After the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy), the concelebrating Priests continue the Eucharistic Prayer
in the way described below. Only the principal celebrant makes the gestures, unless other indications
are given.
218. 	The parts pronounced by all the concelebrants together and especially the words of Consecration, which all are obliged to say, are to be recited in such a manner that the concelebrants speak them
in a low voice and that the principal celebrant’s voice is heard clearly. In this way the words can be
more easily understood by the people.
It is a praiseworthy practice for the parts that are to be said by all the concelebrants together and
for which musical notation is provided in the Missal to be sung.

Eucharistic Prayer I, or the Roman Canon
219. 	In Eucharistic Prayer I, or the Roman Canon, the Te igitur (To you, therefore, most merciful Father)
is said by the principal celebrant alone, with hands extended.
220. 	It is appropriate that the commemoration (Memento) of the living and the Communicantes (In
communion with those) be assigned to one or other of the concelebrating Priests, who then pronounces
these prayers alone, with hands extended, and in a loud voice.
221. 	The Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) is said once again by the principal celebrant alone, with
hands extended.

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

222. 	From the Quam oblationem (Be pleased, O God, we pray) up to and including the Supplices (In
humble prayer we ask you, almighty God), the principal celebrant alone makes the gestures, while all the
concelebrants pronounce everything together, in this manner:
a) the Quam oblationem (Be pleased, O God, we pray) with hands extended toward the offerings;
b) the Qui pridie (On the day before he was to suffer) and the Simili modo (In a similar way) with
hands joined;
c) the words of the Lord, with each extending his right hand toward the bread and toward the
chalice, if this seems appropriate; and at the elevation looking toward them and after this
bowing profoundly;
d) the Unde et memores (Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial) and the Supra quae (Be
pleased to look upon) with hands extended;
e) for the Supplices (In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God) up to and including the words
through this participation at the altar, bowing with hands joined; then standing upright and
crossing themselves at the words may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing.
223. 	It is appropriate that the commemoration (Memento) of the dead and the Nobis quoque peccatoribus (To us, also, your servants) be assigned to one or other of the concelebrants, who pronounces them
alone, with hands extended, and in a loud voice.
224. 	At the words To us, also, your servants, who though sinners, of the Nobis quoque peccatoribus, all the
concelebrants strike their breast.
225. 	The Per quem haec omnia (Through whom you continue) is said by the principal celebrant alone.

Eucharistic Prayer II
226. 	In Eucharistic Prayer II, the part You are indeed Holy, O Lord is pronounced by the principal celebrant alone, with hands extended.
227. 	In the parts from Make holy, therefore, these gifts to the end of Humbly we pray, all the concelebrants
pronounce everything together as follows:
a) the part Make holy, therefore, these gifts, with hands extended toward the offerings;
b) the parts At the time he was betrayed and In a similar way with hands joined;
c) the words of the Lord, with each extending his right hand toward the bread and toward the
chalice, if this seems appropriate; and at the elevation looking toward them and after this

c) the words of the Lord, with each extending his right hand toward the bread and toward the
chalice, if this seems appropriate; and at the elevation looking toward them and after this
bowing profoundly;
d) the parts Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial and Look, we pray, upon the oblation with
hands extended.
231. 	It is appropriate that the intercessions May he make of us an eternal offering to you, and May this

232. 	In Eucharistic Prayer IV, the part We give you praise, Father most holy up to and including the
words he might sanctify creation to the full is pronounced by the principal celebrant alone, with hands
extended.
233. 	In the parts from Therefore, O Lord, we pray to the end of Look, O Lord, upon the Sacrifice, all the
concelebrants pronounce everything together as follows:
a) the part Therefore, O Lord, we pray with hands extended toward the offerings;
b) the parts For when the hour had come and In a similar way with hands joined;

and in a loud voice.
235. 	As for other Eucharistic Prayers approved by the Apostolic See, the norms laid down for each
one are to be observed.
236. 	The concluding doxology of the Eucharistic Prayer is pronounced solely by the principal Priest
Celebrant or together, if this is desired, with the other concelebrants, but not by the faithful.

The Communion Rite
237. 	Then the principal celebrant, with hands joined, says the introduction to the Lord’s Prayer. Next,
with hands extended, he says the Lord’s Prayer itself together with the other concelebrants, who also
pray with hands extended, and together with the people.
238. 	The Libera nos (Deliver us) is said by the principal celebrant alone, with hands extended. All the
concelebrants, together with the people, pronounce the concluding acclamation For the kingdom.
239. 	After the Deacon or, in the absence of a Deacon, one of the concelebrants, has given the instruction Let us offer each other the sign of peace, all give one another the Sign of Peace. Those concelebrants
nearer the principal celebrant receive the Sign of Peace from him before the Deacon does.
240. During the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God), the Deacons or some of the concelebrants may help the
principal celebrant to break the hosts for the Communion of both the concelebrants and the people.

60

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

241. 	After the commingling, the principal celebrant alone, with hands joined, quietly says either the
prayer Domine Iesu Christe, Fili Dei vivi (Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God) or the prayer Perceptio
Corporis et Sanguinis tui (May the receiving of your Body and Blood).
242. 	Once the prayer for Communion has been said, the principal celebrant genuflects and steps
back a little. Then one after another the concelebrants come to the middle of the altar, genuflect, and
reverently take the Body of Christ from the altar. Then holding it in their right hand, with the left hand
placed underneath, they return to their places. However, the concelebrants may remain in their places
and take the Body of Christ from the paten held for them by the principal celebrant or held by one
or more of the concelebrants passing in front of them, or they may do so by handing the paten one to
another, and so to the last of them.
243. 	Then the principal celebrant takes a host consecrated in the same Mass, holds it slightly raised
above the paten or the chalice, and, facing the people, says the Ecce Agnus Dei (Behold the Lamb of God).
With the concelebrants and the people he continues, saying the Domine, non sum dignus (Lord, I am not
worthy).
244. 	Then the principal celebrant, facing the altar, says quietly, Corpus Christi custodiat me in vitam
aeternam (May the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life), and reverently receives the Body of Christ.
The concelebrants do likewise, giving themselves Communion. After them the Deacon receives the
Body and Blood of the Lord from the principal celebrant.
245. 	The Blood of the Lord may be consumed either by drinking from the chalice directly, or by
intinction, or by means of a tube or a spoon.
246. 	If Communion is consumed by drinking directly from the chalice, one of these procedures may
be followed:
a) 	The principal celebrant, standing at the middle of the altar, takes the chalice and says quietly,
Sanguis Christi custodiat me in vitam aeternam (May the Blood of Christ keep me safe for eternal
life). He consumes a little of the Blood of Christ and hands the chalice to the Deacon or a
concelebrant. He then distributes Communion to the faithful (cf. nos. 160-162).
		The concelebrants approach the altar one after another or, if two chalices are used, two
by two. They genuflect, partake of the Blood of Christ, wipe the rim of the chalice, and return
to their seats.
b) 	The principal celebrant consumes the Blood of the Lord standing as usual at the middle of
the altar.
		The concelebrants, however, may partake of the Blood of the Lord while remaining in
their places and drinking from the chalice presented to them by the Deacon or by one of the
concelebrants, or even passed from one to the other. The chalice is always wiped either by
the one who drinks from it or by the one who presents it. After each has communicated, he
returns to his seat.
247. 	The Deacon reverently drinks at the altar all of the Blood of Christ that remains, assisted, if the
case requires, by some of the concelebrants. He then carries the chalice to the credence table and there
he or a duly instituted acolyte purifies it, wipes it, and arranges it as usual (cf. no. 183).
248. 	The Communion of the concelebrants may also be arranged in such a way that each communicates from the Body of the Lord at the altar and, immediately afterwards, from the Blood of the Lord.
In this case the principal celebrant receives Communion under both kinds in the usual way (cf.
no. 158), observing, however, the rite chosen in each particular instance for Communion from the
chalice; and the other concelebrants should do the same.

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

61

After the principal celebrant’s Communion, the chalice is placed at the side of the altar on
another corporal. The concelebrants approach the middle of the altar one by one, genuflect, and communicate from the Body of the Lord; then they move to the side of the altar and partake of the Blood
of the Lord, following the rite chosen for Communion from the chalice, as has been remarked above.
The Communion of the Deacon and the purification of the chalice take place as described above.
249. 	If the concelebrants’ Communion is by intinction, the principal celebrant partakes of the Body
and Blood of the Lord in the usual way, but making sure that enough of the precious Blood remains
in the chalice for the Communion of the concelebrants. Then the Deacon, or one of the concelebrants,
arranges the chalice together with the paten containing particles of the host, if appropriate, either in
the center of the altar or at the side on another corporal.
The concelebrants approach the altar one by one, genuflect, and take a particle, intinct it partly
into the chalice, and, holding a purificator under their mouth, consume the intincted particle. They
then return to their places as at the beginning of Mass.
The Deacon also receives Communion by intinction and to the concelebrant’s words, Corpus et
Sanguis Christi (The Body and Blood of Christ) replies, Amen. Moreover, the Deacon consumes at the altar
all that remains of the Precious Blood, assisted, if the case requires, by some of the concelebrants. He
carries the chalice to the credence table and there he or a duly instituted acolyte purifies it, wipes it,
and arranges it as usual.

The Concluding Rites
250. 	Everything else until the end of Mass is done by the principal celebrant in the usual way (cf. nos.
166-168), with the other concelebrants remaining at their seats.
251. 	Before leaving the altar, the concelebrants make a profound bow to the altar. For his part the
principal celebrant, along with the Deacon, venerates the altar as usual with a kiss.

III. MASS AT WHICH ONLY ONE MINISTER PARTICIPATES
252. 	At a Mass celebrated by a Priest with only one minister to assist him and to make the responses,
the rite of Mass with the people is followed (cf. nos. 120-169), the minister saying the people’s parts
if appropriate.
253. 	If, however, the minister is a Deacon, he performs his proper functions (cf. nos. 171-186) and
likewise carries out the other parts, that is, those of the people.
254. Mass should not be celebrated without a minister, or at least one of the faithful, except for a just
and reasonable cause. In this case, the greetings, the instructions, and the blessing at the end of Mass
are omitted.
255. 	Before Mass, the necessary vessels are prepared either at the credence table or on the right hand
side of the altar.

The Introductory Rites
256. The Priest approaches the altar and, after making a profound bow along with the minister, venerates the altar with a kiss and goes to the chair. If he wishes, the Priest may remain at the altar; in which
case, the Missal is also prepared there. Then the minister or the Priest says the Entrance Antiphon.

62

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

257. 	Then the Priest, standing, makes with the minister the Sign of the Cross as the Priest says, In the
name of the Father, etc. Facing the minister, he greets him, choosing one of the formulas provided.
258. 	Then the Penitential Act takes place, and, in accordance with the rubrics, the Kyrie and the Gloria
in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) are said.
259. 	Then, with hands joined, the Priest pronounces, Let us pray, and after a suitable pause, with
hands extended he pronounces the Collect. At the end the minister acclaims, Amen.

The Liturgy of the Word
260. 	The readings should, in so far as possible, be proclaimed from the ambo or a lectern.
261. 	After the Collect, the minister reads the First Reading and Psalm, the Second Reading, when it
is to be said, and the verse of the Alleluia or other chant.
262. 	Then the Priest, bowing profoundly, says the prayer Munda cor meum (Cleanse my heart) and after
this reads the Gospel. At the end he says, The Gospel of the Lord, to which the minister replies, Praise to
you, Lord Jesus Christ. The Priest then venerates the book with a kiss, saying quietly the formula Per
evangelica dicta (Through the words of the Gospel).
263. 	After this, the Priest says the Symbol or Creed, in accordance with the rubrics, together with
the minister.
264. 	The Universal Prayer follows, which may be said even in this form of Mass. The Priest introduces and concludes it, with the minister announcing the intentions.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
265. 	In the Liturgy of the Eucharist, everything is done as at Mass with the people, except for
the following.
266. 	After the acclamation at the end of the embolism that follows the Lord’s Prayer, the Priest says
the prayer Domine Iesu Christe, qui dixisti (Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles). He then adds, The
peace of the Lord be with you always, to which the minister replies, And with your spirit. If appropriate, the
Priest gives the Sign of Peace to the minister.
267. 	Then, while he says the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) with the minister, the Priest breaks the host over
the paten. After the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God), he performs the commingling, saying quietly the prayer
Haec commixtio (May this mingling).
268. 	After the commingling, the Priest quietly says either the prayer Domine Iesu Christe, Fili Dei vivi
(Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God) or the prayer Perceptio Corporis et Sanguinis tui (May the receiving
of your Body and Blood). Then he genuflects, takes the host, and, if the minister is to receive Communion, turns to the minister and, holding the host a little above the paten or the chalice, says the Ecce
Agnus Dei (Behold the Lamb of God), adding with the minister, Lord, I am not worthy. Then facing the altar,
the Priest partakes of the Body of Christ. If, however, the minister does not receive Communion, the
Priest, after genuflecting, takes the host and, facing the altar, says quietly, Lord, I am not worthy, etc., and
the Corpus Christi custodiat me in vitam aeternam (May the Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life), and
consumes the Body of Christ. Then he takes the chalice and says quietly, Sanguis Christi custodiat me in
vitam aeternam (May the Blood of Christ keep me safe for eternal life), and consumes the Blood of Christ.

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

63

269. 	Before Communion is given to the minister, the Communion Antiphon is said by the minister or
by the Priest himself.
270. 	The Priest purifies the chalice at the credence table or at the altar. If the chalice is purified at the
altar, it may be carried to the credence table by the minister or may be arranged once again on the altar,
at the side.
271. 	After the purification of the chalice, the Priest should observe a brief pause for silence, and after
this he says the Prayer after Communion.

The Concluding Rites
272. 	The Concluding Rites are carried out as at a Mass with the people, but the Ite, missa est (Go forth,
the Mass is ended) is omitted. The Priest venerates the altar as usual with a kiss and, after making a
profound bow with the minister, withdraws.

IV. SOME GENERAL NORMS FOR ALL FORMS OF MASS
Veneration of the Altar and the Book of the Gospels
273. 	According to traditional practice, the veneration of the altar and of the Book of the Gospels is done
by means of a kiss. However, where a sign of this kind is not in harmony with the traditions or the
culture of some region, it is for the Conference of Bishops to establish some other sign in its place, with
the consent of the Apostolic See.

Genuflections and Bows
274. 	A genuflection, made by bending the right knee to the ground, signifies adoration, and therefore
it is reserved for the Most Blessed Sacrament, as well as for the Holy Cross from the solemn adoration
during the liturgical celebration on Good Friday until the beginning of the Easter Vigil.
During Mass, three genuflections are made by the Priest Celebrant: namely, after the elevation
of the host, after the elevation of the chalice, and before Communion. Certain specific features to be
observed in a concelebrated Mass are noted in their proper place (cf. nos. 210-251).
If, however, the tabernacle with the Most Blessed Sacrament is situated in the sanctuary, the
Priest, the Deacon, and the other ministers genuflect when they approach the altar and when they
depart from it, but not during the celebration of Mass itself.
Otherwise, all who pass before the Most Blessed Sacrament genuflect, unless they are moving
in procession.
Ministers carrying the processional cross or candles bow their heads instead of genuflecting.
275. 	A bow signifies reverence and honor shown to the persons themselves or to the signs that represent them. There are two kinds of bow: a bow of the head and a bow of the body.
a) 	A bow of the head is made when the three Divine Persons are named together and at
the names of Jesus, of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of the Saint in whose honor Mass is
being celebrated.
b) 	A bow of the body, that is to say, a profound bow, is made to the altar; during the prayers
Munda cor meum (Cleanse my heart) and In spiritu humilitatis (With humble spirit); in the Creed at
the words et incarnatus est (and by the Holy Spirit . . . and became man); in the Roman Canon at the
Supplices te rogamus (In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God). The same kind of bow is made
by the Deacon when he asks for a blessing before the proclamation of the Gospel. In addition,
the Priest bows slightly as he pronounces the words of the Lord at the Consecration.

64

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

Incensation
276. 	Thurification or incensation is an expression of reverence and of prayer, as is signified in Sacred
Scripture (cf. Ps 140 [141]:2; Rev 8:3).
Incense may be used optionally in any form of Mass:
a)
b)
c)
d)

during the Entrance Procession;
at the beginning of Mass, to incense the cross and the altar;
at the procession before the Gospel and the proclamation of the Gospel itself;
after the bread and the chalice have been placed on the altar, to incense the offerings, the
cross, and the altar, as well as the Priest and the people;
e) at the elevation of the host and the chalice after the Consecration.
277. 	The Priest, having put incense into the thurible, blesses it with the Sign of the Cross, without
saying anything.
Before and after an incensation, a profound bow is made to the person or object that is incensed,
except for the altar and the offerings for the Sacrifice of the Mass.
Three swings of the thurible are used to incense: the Most Blessed Sacrament, a relic of the Holy
Cross and images of the Lord exposed for public veneration, the offerings for the Sacrifice of the Mass,
the altar cross, the Book of the Gospels, the paschal candle, the Priest, and the people.
Two swings of the thurible are used to incense relics and images of the Saints exposed for public veneration; this should be done, however, only at the beginning of the celebration, following the
incensation of the altar.
The altar is incensed with single swings of the thurible in this way:
a) if the altar is freestanding with respect to the wall, the Priest incenses walking around it;
b) if the altar is not freestanding, the Priest incenses it while walking first to the right hand side,
then to the left.
The cross, if situated on the altar or near it, is incensed by the Priest before he incenses the altar;
otherwise, he incenses it when he passes in front of it.
The Priest incenses the offerings with three swings of the thurible or by making the Sign of the
Cross over the offerings with the thurible before going on to incense the cross and the altar.

The Purification
278. Whenever a fragment of the host adheres to his fingers, especially after the fraction or after the
Communion of the faithful, the Priest should wipe his fingers over the paten or, if necessary, wash
them. Likewise, he should also gather any fragments that may have fallen outside the paten.
279. 	The sacred vessels are purified by the Priest, the Deacon, or an instituted acolyte after Communion or after Mass, in so far as possible at the credence table. The purification of the chalice is done
with water alone or with wine and water, which is then consumed by whoever does the purification.
The paten is wiped clean as usual with the purificator.
Care is to be taken that whatever may remain of the Blood of Christ after the distribution of
Communion is consumed immediately and completely at the altar.
280. 	If a host or any particle should fall, it is to be picked up reverently; and if any of the Precious
Blood is spilled, the area where the spill occurred should be washed with water, and this water should
then be poured into the sacrarium in the sacristy.

THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CELEBRATING MASS

65

Communion under Both Kinds
281. 	Holy Communion has a fuller form as a sign when it takes place under both kinds. For in this
form the sign of the Eucharistic banquet is more clearly evident and clearer expression is given to the
divine will by which the new and eternal Covenant is ratified in the Blood of the Lord, as also the
connection between the Eucharistic banquet and the eschatological banquet in the Kingdom of the
Father.104
282. Sacred pastors should take care to ensure that the faithful who participate in the rite or are present at it, are made aware by the most suitable means possible of the Catholic teaching on the form of
Holy Communion as laid down by the Ecumenical Council of Trent. Above all, they should instruct
the Christian faithful that the Catholic faith teaches that Christ, whole and entire, and the true Sacrament, is received even under only one species, and hence that as regards the resulting fruits, those
who receive under only one species are not deprived of any grace that is necessary for salvation.105
Furthermore, they should teach that the Church, in her administration of the Sacraments, has the
power to lay down or alter whatever provisions, apart from the substance of the Sacraments, that she
judges to be more readily conducive to reverence for the Sacraments and the good of the recipients,
in view of changing conditions, times, and places.106 However, at the same time the faithful should be
instructed to participate more readily in this sacred rite, by which the sign of the Eucharistic banquet
is made more fully evident.
283. 	In addition to those cases given in the ritual books, Communion under both kinds is permitted for:
a) 	Priests who are not able to celebrate or concelebrate Mass;
b) the Deacon and others who perform some duty at the Mass;
c) members of communities at the Conventual Mass or the “community” Mass, along with seminarians, and all those engaged in a retreat or taking part in a spiritual or pastoral gathering.
The Diocesan Bishop may establish norms for Communion under both kinds for his own diocese, which are also to be observed in churches of religious and at celebrations with small groups.
The Diocesan Bishop is also given the faculty to permit Communion under both kinds whenever it
may seem appropriate to the Priest to whom a community has been entrusted as its own shepherd,
provided that the faithful have been well instructed and that there is no danger of profanation of the
Sacrament or of the rite’s becoming difficult because of the large number of participants or for some
other cause.
In all that pertains to Communion under both kinds, the Norms for the Distribution and Reception
of Holy Communion under Both Kinds in the Dioceses of the United States of America are to be followed
(particularly nos. 27-54).
284. When Communion is distributed under both kinds:
a) the chalice is usually administered by a Deacon or, in the absence of a Deacon, by a Priest,
or even by a duly instituted acolyte or another extraordinary minister of Holy Communion,
or by one of the faithful who, in a case of necessity, has been entrusted with this duty for a
single occasion;
b) whatever may remain of the Blood of Christ is consumed at the altar by the Priest or the
Deacon or the duly instituted acolyte who ministered the chalice. The same then purifies,
wipes, and arranges the sacred vessels in the usual way.

66

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

Any of the faithful who wish to receive Holy Communion under the species of bread alone
should be given Communion in this form.
285. 	For Communion under both kinds the following should be prepared:
a) 	If Communion from the chalice is done by drinking directly from the chalice, a chalice of a sufficiently large size or several chalices are prepared. However, care should be taken lest beyond
what is needed of the Blood of Christ remains to be consumed at the end of the celebration.
b) 	If Communion from the chalice is done by intinction, the hosts should be neither too thin nor
too small, but rather a little thicker than usual, so that after being intincted partly into the
Blood of Christ they can still be easily distributed.
286. 	If Communion of the Blood of Christ is carried out by communicants’ drinking from the chalice,
each communicant, after receiving the Body of Christ, moves to the minister of the chalice and stands
facing him. The minister says, The Blood of Christ, the communicant replies, Amen, and the minister
hands over the chalice, which the communicant raises to his or her mouth. Each communicant drinks
a little from the chalice, hands it back to the minister, and then withdraws; the minister wipes the rim
of the chalice with the purificator.
287. 	If Communion from the chalice is carried out by intinction, each communicant, holding a
Communion-plate under the mouth, approaches the Priest who holds a vessel with the sacred particles,
with a minister standing at his side and holding the chalice. The Priest takes a host, intincts it partly in
the chalice and, showing it, says, The Body and Blood of Christ. The communicant replies, Amen, receives
the Sacrament in the mouth from the Priest, and then withdraws.

Chapter V

THE ARRANGEMENT AND
ORNAMENTATION OF CHURCHES
FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE EUCHARIST
I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
288. 	For the celebration of the Eucharist, the People of God are normally gathered together in a
church or, if there is no church or if it is too small, then in another respectable place that is nonetheless
worthy of so great a mystery. Therefore, churches or other places should be suitable for carrying out
the sacred action and for ensuring the active participation of the faithful. Moreover, sacred buildings
and requisites for divine worship should be truly worthy and beautiful and be signs and symbols of
heavenly realities.107
289. 	Consequently, the Church constantly seeks the noble assistance of the arts and admits the artistic
expressions of all peoples and regions.108 In fact, just as she is intent on preserving the works of art and
the artistic treasures handed down from past centuries109 and, in so far as necessary, on adapting them
to new needs, so also she strives to promote new works of art that are in harmony with the character
of each successive age.110
On account of this, in appointing artists and choosing works of art to be admitted into a church,
what should be looked for is that true excellence in art which nourishes faith and devotion and accords
authentically with both the meaning and the purpose for which it is intended.111
290. 	All churches should be dedicated or at least blessed. Cathedrals and parish churches, however,
are to be dedicated with a solemn rite.
291. 	For the proper construction, restoration, and arrangement of sacred buildings, all those involved
should consult the diocesan commission for the Sacred Liturgy and sacred art. Moreover, the Diocesan
Bishop should employ the counsel and help of this commission whenever it comes to laying down
norms on this matter, approving plans for new buildings, and making decisions on the more important matters.112
292. 	The ornamentation of a church should contribute toward its noble simplicity rather than to ostentation. Moreover, in the choice of elements attention should be paid to authenticity and there should be
the intention of fostering the instruction of the faithful and the dignity of the entire sacred place.

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

293. 	The suitable arrangement of a church, and of what goes with it, in such a way as to meet appropriately the needs of our own age requires not only that care be taken as regards whatever pertains
more immediately to the celebration of sacred actions but also that the faithful be provided with
whatever is conducive to their appropriate comfort and is normally provided in places where people
habitually gather.
294. 	The People of God which is gathered for Mass is coherently and hierarchically ordered, and this
finds its expression in the variety of ministries and the variety of actions according to the different
parts of the celebration. Hence the general arrangement of the sacred building must be such that in
some way it conveys the image of the assembled congregation and allows the appropriate ordering of
all the participants, as well as facilitating each in the proper carrying out of his function.
The faithful and the schola cantorum (choir) shall have a place that facilitates their active
participation.113
The Priest Celebrant, the Deacon, and the other ministers have places in the sanctuary. There,
also, should be prepared seats for concelebrants, but if their number is great, seats should be arranged
in another part of the church, though near the altar.
All these elements, even though they must express the hierarchical structure and the diversity
of functions, should nevertheless bring about a close and coherent unity that is clearly expressive of
the unity of the entire holy people. Indeed, the nature and beauty of the place and all its furnishings
should foster devotion and express visually the holiness of the mysteries celebrated there.

II. ARRANGEMENT OF THE SANCTUARY
FOR THE SACRED SYNAXIS
295. 	The sanctuary is the place where the altar stands, the Word of God is proclaimed, and the Priest,
the Deacon, and the other ministers exercise their functions. It should be appropriately marked off
from the body of the church either by its being somewhat elevated or by a particular structure and
ornamentation. It should, moreover, be large enough to allow the Eucharist to be easily celebrated and
seen.114

The Altar and its Ornamentation
296. 	The altar, on which is effected the Sacrifice of the Cross made present under sacramental signs,
is also the table of the Lord to which the People of God is convoked to participate in the Mass, and it
is also the center of the thanksgiving that is accomplished through the Eucharist.
297. 	The celebration of the Eucharist in a sacred place is to take place on an altar; however, outside
a sacred place, it may take place on a suitable table, always with the use of a cloth, a corporal, a cross,
and candles.
298. 	It is desirable that in every church there be a fixed altar, since this more clearly and permanently
signifies Christ Jesus, the Living Stone (1 Pt 2:4; cf. Eph 2:20). In other places set aside for sacred celebrations, the altar may be movable.
An altar is said to be fixed if it is so constructed as to be attached to the floor and not removable;
it is said to be movable if it can be displaced.
299. 	The altar should be built separate from the wall, in such a way that it is possible to walk around
it easily and that Mass can be celebrated at it facing the people, which is desirable wherever possible.
113
114

Cf. ibidem, no. 91: p. 898.

THE ARRANGEMENT AND ORNAMENTATION OF CHURCHES

69

Moreover, the altar should occupy a place where it is truly the center toward which the attention of the
whole congregation of the faithful naturally turns.115 The altar should usually be fixed and dedicated.
300. 	An altar, whether fixed or movable, should be dedicated according to the rite prescribed in the
Roman Pontifical; but it is permissible for a movable altar simply to be blessed.
301. 	In keeping with the Church’s traditional practice and with what the altar signifies, the table
of a fixed altar should be of stone and indeed of natural stone. In the Dioceses of the United States
of America, wood which is dignified, solid, and well-crafted may be used, provided that the altar is
structurally immobile. As to the supports or base for supporting the table, these may be made of any
material, provided it is dignified and solid.
A movable altar may be constructed of any noble and solid material suited to liturgical use,
according to the traditions and usages of the different regions.
302. 	The practice of the deposition of relics of Saints, even those not Martyrs, under the altar to be
dedicated is fittingly retained. However, care should be taken to ensure the authenticity of such relics.
303. 	In building new churches, it is preferable for a single altar to be erected, one that in the gathering
of the faithful will signify the one Christ and the one Eucharist of the Church.
In already existing churches, however, when the old altar is so positioned that it makes the people’s participation difficult but cannot be moved without damage to artistic value, another fixed altar,
skillfully made and properly dedicated, should be erected and the sacred rites celebrated on it alone.
In order that the attention of the faithful not be distracted from the new altar, the old altar should not
be decorated in any special way.
304. 	Out of reverence for the celebration of the memorial of the Lord and for the banquet in which the
Body and Blood of the Lord are offered, there should be, on an altar where this is celebrated, at least
one cloth, white in color, whose shape, size, and decoration are in keeping with the altar’s structure.
When, in the Dioceses of the United States of America, other cloths are used in addition to the altar
cloth, then those cloths may be of other colors possessing Christian honorific or festive significance
according to longstanding local usage, provided that the uppermost cloth covering the mensa (i.e., the
altar cloth itself) is always white in color.
305. Moderation should be observed in the decoration of the altar.
During Advent the floral decoration of the altar should be marked by a moderation suited to the
character of this time of year, without expressing in anticipation the full joy of the Nativity of the Lord.
During Lent it is forbidden for the altar to be decorated with flowers. Exceptions, however, are Laetare
Sunday (Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts.
Floral decoration should always show moderation and be arranged around the altar rather than
on the altar table.
306. 	For only what is required for the celebration of the Mass may be placed on the altar table: namely,
from the beginning of the celebration until the proclamation of the Gospel, the Book of the Gospels; then
from the Presentation of the Gifts until the purification of the vessels, the chalice with the paten, a
ciborium, if necessary, and, finally, the corporal, the purificator, the pall, and the Missal.
In addition, arranged discreetly, there should be whatever may be needed to amplify the
Priest’s voice.

115

Cf. ibidem.

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

307. The candlesticks required for the different liturgical services for reasons of reverence or the
festive character of the celebration (cf. no. 117) should be appropriately placed either on the altar or
around it, according to the design of the altar and the sanctuary, so that the whole may be harmonious and the faithful may not be impeded from a clear view of what takes place at the altar or what is
placed upon it.
308. Likewise, either on the altar or near it, there is to be a cross, with the figure of Christ crucified
upon it, a cross clearly visible to the assembled people. It is desirable that such a cross should remain
near the altar even outside of liturgical celebrations, so as to call to mind for the faithful the saving
Passion of the Lord.

The Ambo
309. 	The dignity of the Word of God requires that in the church there be a suitable place from which
it may be proclaimed and toward which the attention of the faithful naturally turns during the Liturgy
of the Word.116
It is appropriate that generally this place be a stationary ambo and not simply a movable lectern.
The ambo must be located in keeping with the design of each church in such a way that the ordained
ministers and readers may be clearly seen and heard by the faithful.
From the ambo only the readings, the Responsorial Psalm, and the Easter Proclamation (Exsultet)
are to be proclaimed; likewise it may be used for giving the Homily and for announcing the intentions
of the Universal Prayer. The dignity of the ambo requires that only a minister of the word should stand
at it.
It is appropriate that before being put into liturgical use a new ambo be blessed according to the
rite described in the Roman Ritual.117

The Chair for the Priest Celebrant and Other Seats
310. 	The chair of the Priest Celebrant must signify his function of presiding over the gathering and
of directing the prayer. Thus the more suitable place for the chair is facing the people at the head of
the sanctuary, unless the design of the building or other features prevent this: as, for example, if on
account of too great a distance, communication between the Priest and the congregation would be difficult, or if the tabernacle were to be positioned in the center behind the altar. In any case, any appearance of a throne is to be avoided.118 It is appropriate that before being put into liturgical use, the chair
be blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.119
Likewise, seats should be arranged in the sanctuary for concelebrating Priests as well as for
Priests who are present at the celebration in choir dress but without concelebrating.
The seat for the Deacon should be placed near that of the celebrant. For the other ministers seats
should be arranged so that they are clearly distinguishable from seats for the clergy and so that the
ministers are easily able to carry out the function entrusted to them.120

THE ARRANGEMENT AND ORNAMENTATION OF CHURCHES

71

III. THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE CHURCH
The Places for the Faithful
311. 	Places for the faithful should be arranged with appropriate care so that they are able to participate in the sacred celebrations, duly following them with their eyes and their attention. It is desirable
that benches or seating usually should be provided for their use. However, the custom of reserving
seats for private persons is to be reprobated.121 Moreover, benches or seating should be so arranged,
especially in newly built churches, that the faithful can easily take up the bodily postures required for
the different parts of the celebration and can have easy access for the reception of Holy Communion.
Care should be taken to ensure that the faithful be able not only to see the Priest, the Deacon, and
the readers but also, with the aid of modern technical means, to hear them without difficulty.

The Place for the Schola Cantorum and the Musical Instruments
312. 	The schola cantorum (choir) should be so positioned with respect to the arrangement of each church
that its nature may be clearly evident, namely as part of the assembled community of the faithful undertaking a specific function. The positioning should also help the choir to exercise this function more easily
and allow each choir member full sacramental participation in the Mass in a convenient manner.122
313. 	The organ and other lawfully approved musical instruments should be placed in a suitable place
so that they can sustain the singing of both the choir and the people and be heard with ease by everybody if they are played alone. It is appropriate that before being put into liturgical use, the organ be
blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.123
In Advent the use of the organ and other musical instruments should be marked by a moderation suited to the character of this time of year, without expressing in anticipation the full joy of the
Nativity of the Lord.
In Lent the playing of the organ and musical instruments is allowed only in order to support the
singing. Exceptions, however, are Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts.

The Place for the Reservation of the Most Holy Eucharist
314. 	In accordance with the structure of each church and legitimate local customs, the Most Blessed
Sacrament should be reserved in a tabernacle in a part of the church that is truly noble, prominent,
conspicuous, worthily decorated, and suitable for prayer.124
The tabernacle should usually be the only one, be irremovable, be made of solid and inviolable
material that is not transparent, and be locked in such a way that the danger of profanation is prevented to the greatest extent possible.125 Moreover, it is appropriate that before it is put into liturgical
use, the tabernacle be blessed according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.126

72

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

315. 	It is more appropriate as a sign that on an altar on which Mass is celebrated there not be a tabernacle in which the Most Holy Eucharist is reserved.127
Consequently, it is preferable that the tabernacle be located, according to the judgment of the
Diocesan Bishop:
a) either in the sanctuary, apart from the altar of celebration, in a appropriate form and place,
not excluding its being positioned on an old altar no longer used for celebration (cf. no. 303);
b) or even in some chapel suitable for the private adoration and prayer of the faithful128 and
organically connected to the church and readily noticeable by the Christian faithful.
316. 	In accordance with traditional custom, near the tabernacle a special lamp, fueled by oil or wax,
should shine permanently to indicate the presence of Christ and honor it.129
317. 	In no way should any of the other things be forgotten which are prescribed by law concerning
the reservation of the Most Holy Eucharist.130

Sacred Images
318. 	In the earthly Liturgy, the Church participates, by a foretaste, in that heavenly Liturgy which
is celebrated in the holy city of Jerusalem, toward which she journeys as a pilgrim, and where Christ
is seated at the right hand of God; and by venerating the memory of the Saints, she hopes one day to
have some share and fellowship with them.131
Thus, in sacred buildings images of the Lord, of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of the Saints, in
accordance with most ancient tradition of the Church, should be displayed for veneration by the faithful132 and should be so arranged so as to lead the faithful toward the mysteries of faith celebrated there.
Care should, therefore, be taken that their number not be increased indiscriminately, and moreover
that they be arranged in proper order so as not to draw the attention of the faithful to themselves and
away from the celebration itself.133 There should usually be only one image of any given Saint. Generally speaking, in the ornamentation and arrangement of a church, as far as images are concerned, provision should be made for the devotion of the entire community as well as for the beauty and dignity
of the images.

Chapter VI

THE REQUISITES FOR THE CELEBRATION OF MASS
I. THE BREAD AND WINE FOR
CELEBRATING THE EUCHARIST
319. 	Following the example of Christ, the Church has always used bread and wine with water to
celebrate the Lord’s Supper.
320. 	The bread for celebrating the Eucharist must be made only from wheat, must be recently made,
and, according to the ancient tradition of the Latin Church, must be unleavened.
321. 	By reason of the sign, it is required that the material for the Eucharistic Celebration truly have
the appearance of food. Therefore, it is desirable that the Eucharistic Bread, even though unleavened
and made in the traditional form, be fashioned in such a way that the Priest at Mass with the people
is truly able to break it into parts and distribute these to at least some of the faithful. However, small
hosts are not at all excluded when the large number of those receiving Holy Communion or other pastoral reasons call for them. Moreover, the gesture of the fraction or breaking of bread, which was quite
simply the term by which the Eucharist was known in apostolic times, will bring out more clearly the
force and importance of the sign of the unity of all in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the
fact that the one bread is distributed among the brothers and sisters.
322. The wine for the celebration of the Eucharist must be from the fruit of the vine (cf. Lk 22:18),
natural, and unadulterated, that is, without admixture of extraneous substances.
323. Diligent care should be taken to ensure that the bread and wine intended for the Eucharist are
kept in a perfect state of conservation: that is, that the wine does not turn to vinegar nor the bread spoil
or become too hard to be broken easily.
324. 	If after the Consecration or as he receives Communion, the Priest notices that not wine but only
water was poured into the chalice, he pours the water into some container, pours wine with water into
the chalice and consecrates it, saying the part of narrative relating to the Consecration of the chalice,
without being obliged to consecrate the bread again.

II. SACRED FURNISHINGS IN GENERAL
325. 	As in the case of the building of churches, so also regarding all sacred furnishings, the Church
admits the manner of art of each individual region and accepts those adaptations that are in keeping
with the culture and traditions of the individual nations, provided that all are suited to the purpose
for which the sacred furnishings are intended.134
In this matter as well, that noble simplicity should be ensured which is the best accompaniment
of genuine art.
326. 	In choosing materials for sacred furnishings, besides those which are traditional, others are admissible that, according to the mentality of our own age, are considered to be noble and are durable, and

134

Cf. Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Sacrosanctum Concilium, no. 128.

73

74

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

well suited for sacred use. In the Dioceses of the United States of America these materials may include
wood, stone, or metal which are solid and appropriate to the purpose for which they are employed.

III. SACRED VESSELS
327. 	Among the requisites for the celebration of Mass, the sacred vessels are held in special honor,
and among these especially the chalice and paten, in which the bread and wine are offered and consecrated and from which they are consumed.
328. Sacred vessels should be made from precious metal. If they are made from metal that rusts or
from a metal less precious than gold, they should generally be gilded on the inside.
329. 	In the Dioceses of the United States of America, sacred vessels may also be made from other
solid materials which in the common estimation in each region are considered precious or noble, for
example, ebony or other harder woods, provided that such materials are suitable for sacred use. In
this case, preference is always to be given to materials that do not easily break or deteriorate. This
applies to all vessels that are intended to hold the hosts, such as the paten, the ciborium, the pyx, the
monstrance, and others of this kind.
330. 	As regards chalices and other vessels that are intended to serve as receptacles for the Blood of
the Lord, they are to have a bowl of material that does not absorb liquids. The base, on the other hand,
may be made of other solid and worthy materials.
331. 	For the Consecration of hosts, a large paten may fittingly be used, on which is placed the bread
both for the Priest and the Deacon and also for the other ministers and for the faithful.
332. 	As regards the form of the sacred vessels, it is for the artist to fashion them in a manner that
is more particularly in keeping with the customs of each region, provided the individual vessels are
suitable for their intended liturgical use and are clearly distinguishable from vessels intended for
everyday use.
333. 	As for the blessing of sacred vessels, the rites prescribed in the liturgical books should be
followed.135
334. 	The practice should be kept of building in the sacristy a sacrarium into which is poured the water
from the washing of sacred vessels and linens (cf. no. 280).

IV. SACRED VESTMENTS
335. 	In the Church, which is the Body of Christ, not all members have the same function. This diversity of offices is shown outwardly in the celebration of the Eucharist by the diversity of sacred vestments, which must therefore be a sign of the function proper to each minister. Moreover, these same
sacred vestments should also contribute to the decoration of the sacred action itself. The vestments
worn by Priests and Deacons, as well as the attire worn by lay ministers, are blessed before being put
into liturgical use according to the rite described in the Roman Ritual.136

The REQUISITES FOR THE CELEBRATION OF MASS

75

336. The sacred garment common to all ordained and instituted ministers of any rank is the alb, to be
tied at the waist with a cincture unless it is made so as to fit even without such. Before the alb is put on,
should this not completely cover the ordinary clothing at the neck, an amice should be used. The alb may
not be exchanged for a surplice, not even over a cassock, on occasions when a chasuble or dalmatic is to
be worn or when, according to the norms, only a stole is worn without a chasuble or dalmatic.
337. 	The vestment proper to the Priest Celebrant at Mass and during other sacred actions directly
connected with Mass is the chasuble worn, unless otherwise indicated, over the alb and stole.
338. 	The vestment proper to the Deacon is the dalmatic, worn over the alb and stole; however, the
dalmatic may be omitted out of necessity or on account of a lesser degree of solemnity.
339. 	In the Dioceses of the United States of America, acolytes, altar servers, readers, and other lay
ministers may wear the alb or other appropriate and dignified clothing.
340. The stole is worn by the Priest around his neck and hanging down in front of his chest, while it
is worn by the Deacon over his left shoulder and drawn diagonally across the chest to the right side,
where it is fastened.
341. 	The cope is worn by the Priest in processions and during other sacred actions, in accordance
with the rubrics proper to the individual rites.
342. 	As regards the form of sacred vestments, Conferences of Bishops may determine and propose to
the Apostolic See adaptations that correspond to the needs and the usages of the individual regions.137
343. 	For making sacred vestments, in addition to traditional materials, natural fabrics proper to each
region may be used, and also artificial fabrics that are in keeping with the dignity of the sacred action
and the sacred person. The Conference of Bishops will be the judge of this matter.138
344. 	It is fitting that the beauty and nobility of each vestment not be sought in an abundance of overlaid ornamentation, but rather in the material used and in the design. Ornamentation on vestments
should, moreover, consist of figures, that is, of images or symbols, that denote sacred use, avoiding
anything unbecoming to this.
345. Diversity of color in the sacred vestments has as its purpose to give more effective expression
even outwardly whether to the specific character of the mysteries of faith to be celebrated or to a sense
of Christian life’s passage through the course of the liturgical year.
346. 	As regards the color of sacred vestments, traditional usage should be observed, namely:
a) 	The color white is used in the Offices and Masses during Easter Time and Christmas Time;
on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity; and furthermore on celebrations of the Lord other
than of his Passion, celebrations of the Blessed Virgin Mary, of the Holy Angels, and of Saints
who were not Martyrs; on the Solemnities of All Saints (November 1) and of the Nativity of
St. John the Baptist (June 24); and on the Feasts of St. John the Evangelist (December 27), of
the Chair of St. Peter (February 22), and of the Conversion of St. Paul (January 25).
b) 	The color red is used on Palm Sunday of the Lord’s Passion and on Friday of Holy Week
(Good Friday), on Pentecost Sunday, on celebrations of the Lord’s Passion, on the “birthday”
feast days of Apostles and Evangelists, and on celebrations of Martyr Saints.

c) 	The color green is used in the Offices and Masses of Ordinary Time.
d) 	The color violet or purple is used in Advent and Lent. It may also be worn in Offices and
Masses for the Dead.
e) 	Besides the color violet, the colors white or black may be used at funeral services and at
other Offices and Masses for the Dead in the Dioceses of the United States of America.
f) 	The color rose may be used, where it is the practice, on Gaudete Sunday (Third Sunday of
Advent) and on Laetare Sunday (Fourth Sunday of Lent).
g) 	On more solemn days, festive, that is, more precious, sacred vestments may be used even if
not of the color of the day.
h) 	The colors gold or silver may be worn on more solemn occasions in the Dioceses of the
United States of America.
347. 	Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper color, in white, or in a festive color; Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are celebrated in the color proper to the day or the time of year or in
violet if they have a penitential character, for example, nos. 31, 33, or 38; Votive Masses are celebrated
in the color suited to the Mass itself or even in the color proper to the day or the time of the year.

V. OTHER THINGS INTENDED FOR CHURCH USE
348. 	Besides the sacred vessels and the sacred vestments, for which some particular material is prescribed, other furnishings that either are intended for direct liturgical use139 or are in any other way
admitted into a church should be worthy and in keeping with their particular intended purpose.
349. Special care must be taken to ensure that the liturgical books, particularly the Book of the Gospels
and the Lectionary, which are intended for the proclamation of the Word of God and hence receive
special veneration, are to be in a liturgical action truly signs and symbols of higher realities and hence
should be truly worthy, dignified, and beautiful.
350. 	Furthermore, every care is to be taken with respect to those things directly associated with the altar
and the celebration of the Eucharist, for example, the altar cross and the cross carried in procession.
351. 	Every effort should be made, even in minor matters, to observe appropriately the requirements
of art and to ensure that a noble simplicity is combined with elegance.

Chapter VII

The Choice of the Mass and Its Parts
352. 	The pastoral effectiveness of a celebration will be greatly increased if the texts of the readings,
the prayers, and the liturgical chants correspond as aptly as possible to the needs, the preparation, and
the culture of the participants. This will be achieved by appropriate use of the many possibilities of
choice described below.
Hence in arranging the celebration of Mass, the Priest should be attentive rather to the common
spiritual good of the People of God than to his own inclinations. He should also remember that choices
of this kind are to be made in harmony with those who exercise some part in the celebration, including
the faithful, as regards the parts that more directly pertain to them.
Since, indeed, many possibilities are provided for choosing the different parts of the Mass, it is
necessary for the Deacon, the readers, the psalmist, the cantor, the commentator, and the choir to know
properly before the celebration the texts that concern each and that are to be used, and it is necessary
that nothing be in any sense improvised. For harmonious ordering and carrying out of the rites will
greatly help in disposing the faithful for participation in the Eucharist.

I. THE CHOICE OF MASS
353. 	On Solemnities the Priest is obliged to follow the Calendar of the church where he is celebrating.
354. On Sundays, on the weekdays during Advent, Christmas Time, Lent, and Easter Time, on Feasts,
and on Obligatory Memorials:
a) 	If Mass is celebrated with the people, the Priest should follow the Calendar of the church
where he is celebrating;
b) 	If Mass is celebrated with the participation of one minister only, the Priest may choose either
the Calendar of the church or his proper Calendar.
355. 	On Optional Memorials,
a) 	On the weekdays of Advent from December 17 to December 24, on days within the Octave
of the Nativity of the Lord, and on the weekdays of Lent, except Ash Wednesday and during Holy Week, the Mass texts for the current liturgical day are used; but the Collect may be
taken from a Memorial which happens to be inscribed in the General Calendar for that day,
except on Ash Wednesday and during Holy Week. On weekdays of Easter Time, Memorials
of Saints may rightly be celebrated in full.
b) 	On weekdays of Advent before December 17, on weekdays of Christmas Time from January 2,
and on weekdays of Easter Time, one of the following may be chosen: either the Mass of the
weekday, or the Mass of the Saint or of one of the Saints whose Memorial is observed, or the
Mass of any Saint inscribed in the Martyrology for that day.
c) 	On weekdays in Ordinary Time, there may be chosen either the Mass of the weekday, or the
Mass of an Optional Memorial which happens to occur on that day, or the Mass of any Saint
inscribed in the Martyrology for that day, or a Mass for Various Needs, or a Votive Mass.
If he celebrates with the people, the Priest will take care not to omit too frequently and without sufficient reason the readings assigned each day in the Lectionary to the weekdays, for the Church desires
that a richer portion at the table of God’s Word should be spread before the people.140
For the same reason he should choose Masses for the Dead in moderation, for every Mass is offered
for both the living and the dead, and there is a commemoration of the dead in the Eucharistic Prayer.
140

78

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

Where, however, the Optional Memorials of the Blessed Virgin Mary or of the Saints are dear to
the faithful, the legitimate devotion of the latter should be satisfied.
Moreover, as regards the option of choosing between a Memorial inscribed in the General Calendar and one inserted in a diocesan or religious Calendar, preference should be given, all else being
equal and in keeping with tradition, to the Memorial in the particular Calendar.

II. THE CHOICE OF TEXTS FOR THE MASS
356. 	In choosing texts for the different parts of the Mass, whether for the time of the year or for Saints,
the norms that follow should be observed.

The Readings
357. Sundays and Solemnities have assigned to them three readings, that is, from a Prophet, an Apostle, and a Gospel, by which the Christian people are instructed in the continuity of the work of salvation according to God’s wonderful design. These readings should be followed strictly. In Easter Time,
according to the tradition of the Church, instead of being from the Old Testament, the reading is taken
from the Acts of the Apostles.
For Feasts, two readings are assigned. If, however, according to the norms a Feast is raised to the
rank of a Solemnity, a third reading is added, and this is taken from the Common.
For Memorials of Saints, unless proper readings are given, the readings assigned for the weekday are normally used. In certain cases, particularized readings are provided, that is to say, readings
which highlight some particular aspect of the spiritual life or activity of the Saint. The use of such
readings is not to be insisted upon, unless a pastoral reason truly suggests it.
358. 	In the Lectionary for weekdays, readings are provided for each day of every week throughout
the entire course of the year; hence, these readings will in general be used on the days to which they
are assigned, unless there occurs a Solemnity, a Feast, or Memorial that has its own New Testament
readings, that is to say, readings in which mention is made of the Saint being celebrated.
Should, however, the continuous reading during the week from time to time be interrupted, on
account of some Solemnity or Feast, or some particular celebration, then the Priest shall be permitted,
bearing in mind the scheme of readings for the entire week, either to combine parts omitted with other
readings or to decide which readings are to be given preference over others.
In Masses for special groups, the Priest shall be allowed to choose texts more particularly suited
to the particular celebration, provided they are taken from the texts of an approved Lectionary.
359. In addition, in the Lectionary a special selection of texts from Sacred Scripture is given for Ritual
Masses into which certain Sacraments or Sacramentals are incorporated, or for Masses that are celebrated for certain needs.
Sets of readings of this kind have been so prescribed so that through a more apt hearing of the
Word of God the faithful may be led to a fuller understanding of the mystery in which they are participating, and may be educated to a more ardent love of the Word of God.
Therefore, the texts proclaimed in the celebration are to be chosen keeping in mind both an
appropriate pastoral reason and the options allowed in this matter.
360. 	At times, a longer and shorter form of the same text is given. In choosing between these two
forms, a pastoral criterion should be kept in mind. On such an occasion, attention should be paid to
the capacity of the faithful to listen with fruit to a reading of greater or lesser length, and to their capacity to hear a more complete text, which is then explained in the Homily.141

141	Missale Romanum, Ordo lectionum Missae, editio typica altera, 1981, Praenotanda, no. 80

THE CHOICE OF THE MASS AND ITS PARTS

79

361. When a possibility is given of choosing between one or other text laid down, or suggested as
optional, attention shall be paid to the good of participants, whether, that is to say, it is a matter of
using an easier text or one more appropriate for a given gathering, or of repeating or setting aside a
text that is assigned as proper to some particular celebration while being optional for another,142 just
as pastoral advantage may suggest.
Such a situation may arise either when the same text would have to be read again within a few
days, as, for example, on a Sunday and on a subsequent weekday, or when it is feared that a certain
text might give rise to some difficulties for a particular group of the Christian faithful. However, care
should be taken that, when choosing scriptural passages, parts of Sacred Scripture are not permanently excluded.
362. 	The adaptations to the Ordo Lectionum Missae as contained in the Lectionary for Mass for use in
the Dioceses of the United States of America should be carefully observed.

The Orations
363. In any Mass the orations proper to that Mass are used, unless otherwise noted.
On Memorials of Saints, the proper Collect is said or, if this is lacking, one from an appropriate Common. As to the Prayer over the Offerings and the Prayer after Communion, unless these are
proper, they may be taken either from the Common or from the weekday of the current time of year.
On the weekdays in Ordinary Time, however, besides the orations from the previous Sunday, orations from another Sunday in Ordinary Time may be used, or one of the Prayers for Various Needs provided in the Missal. However, it shall always be permissible to use from these Masses the Collect alone.
In this way a richer collection of texts is provided, by which the prayer life of the faithful is more
abundantly nourished.
However, during the more important times of the year, provision has already been made for this
by means of the orations proper to these times of the year that exist for each weekday in the Missal.

The Eucharistic Prayer
364. 	The numerous Prefaces with which the Roman Missal is endowed have as their purpose to bring
out more fully the motives for thanksgiving within the Eucharistic Prayer and to set out more clearly
the different facets of the mystery of salvation.
365. The choice between the Eucharistic Prayers found in the Order of Mass is suitably guided by the
following norms:
a) 	Eucharistic Prayer I, or the Roman Canon, which may always be used, is especially suited
for use on days to which a proper text for the Communicantes (In communion with those whose
memory we venerate) is assigned or in Masses endowed with a proper form of the Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) and also in the celebrations of the Apostles and of the Saints
mentioned in the Prayer itself; likewise it is especially suited for use on Sundays, unless for
pastoral reasons Eucharistic Prayer III is preferred.
b) 	Eucharistic Prayer II, on account of its particular features, is more appropriately used on
weekdays or in special circumstances. Although it is provided with its own Preface, it may
also be used with other Prefaces, especially those that sum up the mystery of salvation, for
example, the Common Prefaces. When Mass is celebrated for a particular deceased person,
the special formula given may be used at the proper point, namely, before the part Remember
also our brothers and sisters.

142

Ibidem, no. 81.

80

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

c) Eucharistic Prayer III may be said with any Preface. Its use should be preferred on Sundays
and festive days. If, however, this Eucharistic Prayer is used in Masses for the Dead, the special formula for a deceased person may be used, to be included at the proper place, namely
after the words: in your compassion, O merciful Father, gather to yourself all your children scattered
throughout the world.
d) 	Eucharistic Prayer IV has an invariable Preface and gives a fuller summary of salvation
history. It may be used when a Mass has no Preface of its own and on Sundays in Ordinary
Time. On account of its structure, no special formula for a deceased person may be inserted
into this prayer.

The Chants
366. 	It is not permitted to substitute other chants for those found in the Order of Mass, for example,
at the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God).
367. 	In choosing the chants between the readings, as well as the chants at the Entrance, at the Offertory, and at Communion, the norms laid down in their proper places are to be observed (cf. nos. 40-41,
47-48, 61-64, 74, 86-88).

Chapter VIII

Masses and Prayers for Various NEEDS AND
OCCASIONS and Masses for the Dead
I. MASSES AND PRAYERS FOR
VARIOUS NEEDS AND OCCASIONS
368. Since the liturgy of the Sacraments and Sacramentals has as its effect that for the faithful who
are properly disposed almost every event in life is sanctified by the divine grace that flows from the
Paschal Mystery,143 and because the Eucharist is the Sacrament of Sacraments, the Missal provides
examples of Mass formularies and orations that may be used in the various occasions of Christian life
for the needs of the whole world or for the needs of the Church, whether universal or local.
369. In view of the rather broad possibilities of choice among the readings and orations, it is desirable
that Masses for Various Needs and Occasions be used in moderation, that is, when truly required.
370. 	In all the Masses for Various Needs and Occasions, unless expressly indicated otherwise, it is
permissible to use the weekday readings and also the chants between them, if they are suited to
the celebration.
371. 	Among Masses of this kind are included Ritual Masses, Masses for Various Needs and Occasions, and Votive Masses.
372. 	Ritual Masses are connected to the celebration of certain Sacraments or Sacramentals. They are
prohibited on Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter, on Solemnities, on the days within the Octave of
Easter, on the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day), on Ash Wednesday, and
during Holy Week, and furthermore due regard is to be had for the norms set out in the ritual books
or in the Masses themselves.
373. Masses for Various Needs and Occasions are used in certain situations either as occasion arises
or at fixed times.
Days or periods of prayer for the fruits of the earth, prayer for human rights and equality,
prayer for world justice and peace, and penitential observances outside Lent are to be observed in the
Dioceses of the United States of America at times to be designated by the Diocesan Bishop.
In all the Dioceses of the United States of America, January 22 (or January 23, when January
22 falls on a Sunday) shall be observed as a particular day of prayer for the full restoration of the legal
guarantee of the right to life and of penance for violations to the dignity of the human person committed through acts of abortion. The liturgical celebrations for this day may be the Mass “For Giving
Thanks to God for the Gift of Human Life” (no. 48/1 of the Masses and Prayers for Various Needs and
Occasions), celebrated with white vestments, or the Mass “For the Preservation of Peace and Justice”
(no. 30 of the Masses and Prayers for Various Needs and Occasions), celebrated with violet vestments.
374. 	If any case of a graver need or of pastoral advantage should arise, at the direction of the Diocesan
Bishop or with his permission, an appropriate Mass may be celebrated on any day except Solemnities,

143

Cf. Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Sacrosanctum Concilium, no. 61.

81

82

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

the Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter, days within the Octave of Easter, the Commemoration of All
the Faithful Departed (All Souls’ Day), Ash Wednesday, and the days of Holy Week.
375. 	Votive Masses of the mysteries of the Lord or in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary or of the
Angels or of any given Saint or of all the Saints may be said in response to the devotion of the faithful
on weekdays in Ordinary Time, even if an Optional Memorial occurs. However, it is not permitted
to celebrate as Votive Masses those that refer to mysteries related to events in the life of the Lord or
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with the exception of the Mass of the Immaculate Conception, since their
celebration is an integral part of the course of the liturgical year.
376. 	On days when there occurs an Obligatory Memorial or on a weekday of Advent up to and including December 16, of Christmas Time from January 2, and of Easter Time after the Octave of Easter,
Masses for Various Needs and Occasions and Votive Masses are in principle forbidden. If, however,
some real necessity or pastoral advantage calls for it, in the estimation of the rector of the church or the
Priest Celebrant himself, a Mass appropriate to the same may be used in a celebration with the people.
377. 	On weekdays in Ordinary Time when an Optional Memorial occurs or when the Office is of the
weekday, it is permissible to celebrate any Mass for Various Needs and Occasions, or use any prayer
for the same, but to the exclusion of Ritual Masses.
378. 	Particularly recommended is the Saturday commemoration of the Blessed Virgin Mary, because
it is to the Mother of the Redeemer that in the Liturgy of the Church firstly and before all the Saints
veneration is given.144

II. MASSES FOR THE DEAD
379. 	The Church offers the Eucharistic Sacrifice of Christ’s Pasch for the dead so that, since all the
members of Christ’s Body are in communion with one another, what implores spiritual help for some,
may bring comforting hope to others.
380. 	Among the Masses for the Dead, the Funeral Mass holds first place. It may be celebrated on any
day except for Solemnities that are Holydays of Obligation, Thursday of Holy Week (Holy Thursday),
the Paschal Triduum, and the Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter, with due regard also for all the
other requirements of the norm of the law.145
381. 	A Mass for the Dead, on receiving the news of a death, for the final burial, or the first anniversary, may be celebrated even on days within the Octave of the Nativity of the Lord, on days when an
Obligatory Memorial occurs, and on weekdays other than Ash Wednesday or the weekdays of Holy
Week.
Other Masses for the Dead or “daily” Masses, may be celebrated on weekdays in Ordinary Time
on which Optional Memorials occur or when the Office is of the weekday, provided such Masses are
actually applied for the dead.
382. 	At Funeral Masses there should usually be a short Homily, but to the exclusion of a funeral
eulogy of any kind.

MASSES FOR VARIOUS NEEDS AND OCCASIONS AND FOR THE DEAD

83

383. 	The faithful, and especially those of the deceased’s family, should be urged to participate in the
Eucharistic Sacrifice offered for the deceased person, also by receiving Holy Communion.
384. 	If the Funeral Mass is directly joined to the rite of burial, once the Prayer after Communion has
been said and omitting the Concluding Rites, there takes place the Rite of Final Commendation or
Farewell. This rite is celebrated only if the body is present.
385. 	In the arranging and choosing of the variable parts of the Mass for the Dead, especially the
Funeral Mass (for example, orations, readings, and the Universal Prayer), pastoral considerations
bearing upon the deceased, the family, and those attending should be kept in mind.
Moreover, pastors should take into special account those who are present at a liturgical celebration or who hear the Gospel on the occasion of the funeral and who may be non-Catholics or Catholics
who never or hardly ever participate in the Eucharist or who seem even to have lost the faith. For
Priests are ministers of Christ’s Gospel for all.

Chapter IX

Adaptations Within the Competence of
Bishops and Bishops’ Conferences
386. 	The renewal of the Roman Missal carried out in our time in accordance with the decrees of the
Second Vatican Ecumenical Council has taken great care that all the faithful may display in the celebration of the Eucharist that full, conscious, and active participation that is required by the very nature
of the Liturgy and to which the faithful, in virtue of their status as such, have a right and duty.146
However, in order that such a celebration may correspond all the more fully to the norms and the
spirit of the Sacred Liturgy, certain further adaptations are set out in this Instruction and in the Order
of Mass and entrusted to the judgment either of the Diocesan Bishop or of the Conferences of Bishops.
387. 	The Diocesan Bishop, who is to be regarded as the High Priest of his flock, from whom the life
in Christ of his faithful in some sense derives and upon whom it depends,147 must promote, regulate,
and be vigilant over the liturgical life in his diocese. It is to him that in this Instruction is entrusted the
regulating of the discipline of concelebration (cf. nos. 202, 374) and the establishing of norms regarding the function of serving the Priest at the altar (cf. no. 107), the distribution of Holy Communion
under both kinds (cf. no. 283), and the construction and ordering of churches (cf. no. 291). It is above
all for him, moreover, to nourish the spirit of the Sacred Liturgy in the Priests, Deacons, and faithful.
388. 	Those adaptations spoken of below that necessitate a wider degree of coordination are to be
decided, in accord with the norm of law, in the Conference of Bishops.
389. It is the competence, in the first place, of the Conferences of Bishops to prepare and approve an edition of this Roman Missal in the authorized vernacular languages, so that, once their decisions have been
accorded the recognitio of the Apostolic See, the edition may be used in the regions to which it pertains.148
The Roman Missal, whether in Latin or in legitimately approved vernacular translations, is to be
published in its entirety.
390. It is for the Conferences of Bishops to formulate the adaptations indicated in this General Instruction and in the Order of Mass and, once their decisions have been accorded the recognitio of the Apostolic See, to introduce them into the Missal itself. They are such as these:
–
–
–
–
–
–
–

the gestures and bodily posture of the faithful (cf. no. 43);
the gestures of veneration toward the altar and the Book of the Gospels (cf. no. 273);
the texts of the chants at the Entrance, at the Presentation of the Gifts, and at Communion
(cf. nos. 48, 74, 87);
the readings from Sacred Scripture to be used in special circumstances (cf. no. 362);
the form of the gesture of peace (cf. no. 82);
the manner of receiving Holy Communion (cf. nos. 160, 283);
the materials for the altar and sacred furnishings, especially the sacred vessels, and also the
materials, form, and color of the liturgical vestments (cf. nos. 301, 326, 329, 339, 342-346).

It shall be permissible for Directories or pastoral Instructions that the Conferences of Bishops
judge useful to be included, with the prior recognitio of the Apostolic See, in the Roman Missal at an
appropriate place.

Cf. Code of Canon Law, can. 838 §3.

84

Adaptations Within the competence of Bishops and bishops’ conferences

85

391. 	It is for the same Conferences of Bishops to attend to the translations of the biblical texts that
are used in the celebration of Mass, exercising special care in this. For it is out of the Sacred Scripture
that the readings are read and are explained in the Homily and that Psalms are sung, and it is by the
influence of Sacred Scripture and at its prompting that prayers, orations, and liturgical chants are
fashioned in such a way that it is from Sacred Scripture that actions and signs derive their meaning.149
Language should be used that corresponds to the capacity for understanding of the faithful and
is suitable for public proclamation, while maintaining those characteristics that are proper to the different ways of speaking used in the biblical books.
392. 	It shall also be for Conferences of Bishops to prepare with care a translation of the other texts, so
that, even though the character of each language is respected, the meaning of the original Latin text is
fully and faithfully rendered. In accomplishing this task, it is desirable that the different literary genres
used at Mass be taken into account, such as the presidential prayers, the antiphons, the acclamations,
the responses, the litanies of supplication, and so on.
It should be borne in mind that the primary purpose of the translation of the texts is not for
meditation, but rather for their proclamation or singing during an actual celebration.
Language should be used that is accommodated to the faithful of the region, but is noble and
marked by literary quality, even though there will always be a necessity for some catechesis on the
biblical and Christian meaning of certain words and expressions.
Moreover, it is preferable that in regions that share the same language, the same translation be
used in so far as possible for liturgical texts, especially for biblical texts and for the Order of Mass.150
393. Bearing in mind the important place that singing has in a celebration as a necessary or integral part of the Liturgy,151 all musical settings for the texts of the Ordinary of Mass, for the people’s
responses and acclamations, and for the special rites that occur in the course of the liturgical year must
be submitted to the Secretariat of Divine Worship of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops
for review and approval prior to publication.
While the organ is to be accorded pride of place, other wind, stringed, or percussion instruments
may be admitted into divine worship in the Dioceses of the United States of America, according to
longstanding local usage, in so far as these are truly suitable for sacred use, or can be made suitable.
394. 	Each diocese should have its own Calendar and Proper of Masses. For its part, the Conference
of Bishops should draw up a proper Calendar for the nation or, together with other Conferences, a
Calendar for a wider territory, to be approved by the Apostolic See.152
In carrying out this task, to the greatest extent possible the Lord’s Day is to be preserved and
safeguarded, as the primordial feast day, and hence other celebrations, unless they are truly of the
greatest importance, should not have precedence over it.153 Care should likewise be taken that the liturgical year as revised by decree of the Second Vatican Council not be obscured by secondary elements.
In the drawing up of the Calendar of a nation, the Rogation Days and Ember Days should be
indicated (cf. no. 373), as well as the forms and texts for their celebration,154 and other special measures
should also be kept in mind.
It is appropriate that in publishing the Missal, celebrations proper to an entire nation or territory
be inserted at the proper place among the celebrations of the General Calendar, while those proper to
a region or diocese should have a place in a special appendix.

GENERAL INSTRUCTION OF THE ROMAN MISSAL

395. 	Finally, if the participation of the faithful and their spiritual welfare require variations and profounder adaptations in order for the sacred celebration to correspond with the culture and traditions
of the different nations, then Conferences of Bishops may propose these to the Apostolic See in accordance with article 40 of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy for introduction with the Apostolic See’s
consent, especially in the case of nations to whom the Gospel has been more recently proclaimed.155
The special norms handed down by means of the Instruction on the Roman Liturgy and Inculturation156
should be attentively observed.
As regards the procedures in this matter, these should be observed:
Firstly, a detailed preliminary proposal should be set before the Apostolic See, so that, after the
necessary faculty has been granted, the detailed working out of the individual points of adaptation
may proceed.
Once these proposals have been duly approved by the Apostolic See, experiments should be
carried out for specified periods and at specified places. When the period of experimentation is concluded, the Conference of Bishops shall decide, if the case requires, upon pursuing the adaptations
and shall submit a mature formulation of the matter to the judgment of the Apostolic See.157
396. 	However, before proceeding to new adaptations, especially profounder ones, great care shall be
taken to promote due instruction of the clergy and the faithful in a wise and orderly manner, so as to
take advantage of the faculties already foreseen and to apply fully the pastoral norms in keeping with
the spirit of the celebration.
397. The principle shall moreover be respected, according to which each particular Church must be
in accord with the universal Church not only regarding the doctrine of the faith and sacramental signs,
but also as to the usages universally received from apostolic and unbroken tradition. These are to be
kept not only so that errors may be avoided, but also so that the faith may be handed on in its integrity,
since the Church’s rule of prayer (lex orandi) corresponds to her rule of faith (lex credendi).158
The Roman Rite constitutes a notable and precious part of the liturgical treasure and patrimony
of the Catholic Church; its riches are conducive to the good of the universal Church, so that their loss
would gravely harm her.
This Rite has in the course of the centuries not only preserved the liturgical usages that arose
in the city of Rome, but has also in a deep, organic, and harmonious way integrated into itself certain
other usages derived from the customs and culture of different peoples and of various particular
Churches whether of the West or the East, so acquiring a certain supra-regional character. As to our
own times, the identity and unitary expression of this Rite is found in the typical editions of the liturgical books promulgated by authority of the Supreme Pontiff, and in the liturgical books corresponding
to them approved for their territories by the Conferences of Bishops and endowed with the recognitio
of the Apostolic See.159
398. 	The norm established by the Second Vatican Council, namely that in the liturgical renewal innovations should not be made unless required by true and certain usefulness to the Church, nor without exercising caution to ensure that new forms grow in some sense organically from forms already
existing,160 must also be applied to implementation of the inculturation of the Roman Rite as such.161

Adaptations Within the competence of Bishops and bishops’ conferences

Inculturation, moreover, requires a necessary length of time, lest the authentic liturgical tradition suffer hasty and incautious contamination.
Finally, the pursuit of inculturation does not have as its purpose in any way the creation of new
families of rites, but aims rather at meeting the needs of a particular culture, though in such a way
that adaptations introduced either into the Missal or coordinated with other liturgical books are not at
variance with the proper character of the Roman Rite.162
399. 	And so, the Roman Missal, though in a diversity of languages and with some variety of customs,163
must in the future be safeguarded as an instrument and an outstanding sign of the integrity and unity
of the Roman Rite.164

HOLY COMMUNION:
THE BODY AND BLOOD OF THE LORD JESUS
The Mystery of the Holy Eucharist
1. 	On the night before he died, Christ gathered his Apostles in the upper room to celebrate the Last
Supper and to give us the inestimable gift of his Body and Blood. “He did this in order to perpetuate
the sacrifice of the Cross throughout the centuries until He should come again, and so to entrust to His
beloved spouse, the Church, a memorial of His death and resurrection. . . .”1 Thus, in the eucharistic
Liturgy we are joined with Christ on the altar of the cross and at the table of the upper room in “the
sacrificial memorial in which the sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated and [in] the sacred banquet of
communion with the Lord’s body and blood.”2
2.
Like all acts of the sacred Liturgy, the Eucharist uses signs to convey sacred realities. Sacrosanctum Concilium: Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy reminds us that “the sanctification of man is manifested by signs perceptible to the senses, and is effected in a way which is proper to each of these
signs.”3 In a preeminent way the eucharistic Liturgy uses the signs of bread and wine in obedience to
the Lord’s command and after their transformation gives them to us as the Body and Blood of Christ
in the act of communion. It is by taking and sharing the eucharistic bread and chalice—“signs perceptible to the senses” —that we obey the Lord’s command and grow in the likeness of the Lord whose
Body and Blood they both signify and contain.
3. 	The Eucharist constitutes “the Church’s entire spiritual wealth, that is, Christ Himself, our Passover and living bread.”4 It is the “Sacrament of Sacraments.”5 Through it “the work of our redemption
is accomplished.”6 He who is the “living bread that came down from heaven” (Jn 6:51) assures us,
“Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. For
my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink” (Jn 6:54-55).
4. 	The eyes of faith enable the believer to recognize the ineffable depths of the mystery that is the
Holy Eucharist. The Catechism of the Catholic Church offers us a number of images from our tradition to
refer to this most sacred reality: Eucharistic assembly (synaxis), action of thanksgiving, breaking of the
bread, memorial, holy sacrifice, Lord’s Supper, holy and divine Liturgy, Holy Communion, and Holy
Mass.7 The eucharistic species of bread and wine derive from the work of human hands. In the action
of the Eucharist this bread and this wine are transformed and become our spiritual food and drink. It
is Christ, the true vine, who gives life to the branches (cf. Jn 15:1-6). As bread from heaven (cf. Jn 6:41),
bread of angels, the chalice of salvation, and the medicine of immortality,8 the Eucharist is the promise
of eternal life to all who eat and drink it (cf. Jn 6:50-51). The Eucharist is a sacred meal, “a sacrament of
love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity”9 in which Christ calls us as his friends to share in the banquet of

the kingdom of heaven (cf. Jn 15:15). This bread and chalice were given to his disciples at the Last Supper. This spiritual food has been the daily bread and sustenance for his disciples throughout the ages.
The bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper—his Body and Blood—as broken and poured out constitute
the irreplaceable food for the journey of the “pilgrim church on earth.”10 The Eucharist perpetuates the
sacrifice of Christ, offered once and for all for us and for our salvation, making present the victory and
triumph of Christ’s death and resurrection.11 It is strength for those who journey in hope through this
life and who desire to dwell with God in the life to come. Our final sharing in the Eucharist is viaticum,
the food for the final journey of the believer to heaven itself. Through these many images, the Church
helps us to see the Eucharist as union with Christ from whom she came, through whom she lives, and
towards whom she directs her life.12

Holy Communion
5.
While the heart of the celebration of the Eucharist is the Eucharistic Prayer, the consummation of the Mass is found in Holy Communion, whereby the people purchased for the Father by his
beloved Son eat and drink the Body and Blood of Christ. They are thereby joined together as members
of Christ’s mystical Body, sharing the one life of the Spirit. In the great sacrament of the altar, they are
joined to Christ Jesus and to one another.
It was also Christ’s will that this sacrament be received as the soul’s spiritual food to sustain and
build up those who live with his life, as he said, “He who eats me, he also shall live because of me”
(Jn 6:57). This sacrament is also to be a remedy to free us from our daily defects and to keep us from
mortal sin. It was Christ’s will, moreover, that this sacrament be a pledge of our future glory and our
everlasting happiness and, likewise, a symbol of that one body of which he is the head (cf. Lk 22:19
and 1 Cor 11:3). He willed that we, as members of this body should be united to it by firm bonds of
faith, hope, and love, so that we might all say the same thing, and that there might be no dissensions
among us (cf. 1 Cor 1:10).13
As Catholics, we fully participate in the celebration of the Eucharist when we receive Holy Communion. We are encouraged to receive Communion devoutly and frequently. In order to be properly
disposed to receive Communion, participants should not be conscious of grave sin and normally
should have fasted for one hour. A person who is conscious of grave sin is not to receive the Body and
Blood of the Lord without prior sacramental confession except for a grave reason where there is no
opportunity for confession. In this case, the person is to be mindful of the obligation to make an act
of perfect contrition, including the intention of confessing as soon as possible (canon 916). A frequent
reception of the Sacrament of Penance is encouraged for all.14

Union with Christ
6. 	The Lord himself gave us the Eucharist at the Last Supper. The eucharistic sacrifice “is wholly
directed toward the intimate union of the faithful with Christ through communion.”15 It is Christ himself who is received in Holy Communion, who said to his disciples, “Take and eat, this is my body.”
Giving thanks, he then took the chalice and said: “Take and drink, this is the cup of my blood. Do this
in remembrance of me” (Mt 26:26-27; 1 Cor 11:25).

7.	Bread and wine are presented by the faithful and placed upon the altar by the Priest. These are
simple gifts, but they were foreshadowed in the Old Testament and chosen by Christ himself for the
Eucharistic sacrifice. When these gifts of bread and wine are offered by the Priest in the name of the
Church to the Father in the great Eucharistic Prayer of thanksgiving, they are transformed by the Holy
Spirit into the Body and Blood of the only-begotten Son of the Father. Finally, when the one bread is
broken, the unity of the faithful is expressed and through Communion they “receive from the one
bread the Lord’s Body and from the one chalice the Lord’s Blood in the same way that the Apostles
received them from the hands of Christ himself.”16 Hence the import of the words of the hymn adapted
from the Didache:
As grain once scattered on the hillsides
was in this broken bread made one
so from all lands your church be gathered
into your kingdom by your Son.17

Christ Himself Is Present in the Eucharistic Species
8. 	Christ is “truly, really, and substantially contained”18 in Holy Communion. His presence is not
momentary nor simply signified, but wholly and permanently real under each of the consecrated species of bread and wine.19
9. 	The Council of Trent teaches that “the true body and blood of our Lord, together with his soul
and divinity, exist under the species of bread and wine. His body exists under the species of bread and
his blood under the species of wine, according to the import of his words.”20
10. 	The Church also teaches and believes that “immediately after the consecration the true body of our
Lord and his true blood exist along with his soul and divinity under the form of bread and wine. The
body is present under the form of bread and the blood under the form of wine, by virtue of the words [of
Christ]. The same body, however, is under the form of wine and the blood under the form of bread, and
the soul under either form, by virtue of the natural link and concomitance by which the parts of Christ
the Lord, who has now risen from the dead and will die no more, are mutually united.”21
11. Since, however, by reason of the sign value, sharing in both eucharistic species reflects more
fully the sacred realities that the Liturgy signifies, the Church in her wisdom has made provisions in
recent years so that more frequent eucharistic participation from both the sacred host and the chalice
of salvation might be made possible for the laity in the Latin Church.

of the Church, and this holy council now again declares it that, by the consecration of the bread and wine a change takes
place in which the whole substance of bread is changed into the substance of the Body of Christ our Lord and the whole
substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church fittingly and properly names
transubstantiation.”

NORMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND RECEPTION OF

Holy Communion as an Act of Faith
12. 	Christ’s presence in the Eucharist challenges human understanding, logic, and ultimately reason. His presence cannot be known by the senses, but only through faith22—a faith that is continually
deepened through that communion which takes place between the Lord and his faithful in the very
act of the celebration of the Eucharist. Thus the Fathers frequently warned the faithful that by relying
solely on their senses they would see only bread and wine. Rather, they exhorted the members of the
Church to recall the word of Christ by whose power the bread and wine have been transformed into
his own Body and Blood.23
13. 	The teaching of St. Cyril of Jerusalem assists the Church even today in understanding this great
mystery:
We have been instructed in these matters and filled with an unshakable faith that what
seems to be bread is not bread, though it tastes like it, but the Body of Christ, and that what
seems to be wine is not wine, though it tastes like it, but the Blood of Christ.24
14. 	The act of Communion, therefore, is also an act of faith. For when the minister says, “The Body
of Christ” or “The Blood of Christ,” the communicant’s “Amen” is a profession in the presence of the
saving Christ, body and blood, soul and divinity, who now gives life to the believer.
15. 	The communicant makes this act of faith in the total presence of the Lord Jesus Christ whether in
Communion under one form or in Communion under both kinds. It should never be construed, therefore, that Communion under the form of bread alone or Communion under the form of wine alone
is somehow an incomplete act or that Christ is not fully present to the communicant. The Church’s
unchanging teaching from the time of the Fathers through the ages—notably in the ecumenical councils of Lateran IV, Constance, Florence, Trent, and Vatican II—has witnessed to a constant unity of faith
in the presence of Christ in both elements.25 Clearly there are some pastoral circumstances that require
eucharistic sharing in one species only, such as when Communion is brought to the sick or when one is
unable to receive either the Body of the Lord or the Precious Blood due to an illness. Even in the earliest days of the Church’s life, when Communion under both species was the norm, there were always
instances when the Eucharist was received under only the form of bread or wine. Those who received
Holy Communion at home or who were sick would usually receive under only one species, as would
the whole Church during the Good Friday Liturgy.26 Thus, the Church has always taught the doctrine
of concomitance, by which we know that under each species alone, the whole Christ is sacramentally
present and we “receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace.”27
16. 	At the same time an appreciation for reception of “the whole Christ” through one species should
not diminish in any way the fuller sign value of reception of Holy Communion under both kinds. For
just as Christ offered his whole self, body and blood, as a sacrifice for our sins, so too is our reception of
his Body and Blood under both kinds an especially fitting participation in his memorial of eternal life.

HOLY COMMUNION under both kinds 

97

Holy Communion under Both Kinds
17. 	From the first days of the Church’s celebration of the Eucharist, Holy Communion consisted of
the reception of both species in fulfillment of the Lord’s command to “take and eat . . . take and drink.”
The distribution of Holy Communion to the faithful under both kinds was thus the norm for more
than a millennium of Catholic liturgical practice.
18. 	The practice of Holy Communion under both kinds at Mass continued until the late eleventh
century, when the custom of distributing the Eucharist to the faithful under the form of bread alone
began to grow. By the twelfth century theologians such as Peter Cantor speak of Communion under
one kind as a “custom” of the Church.28 This practice spread until the Council of Constance in 1415
decreed that Holy Communion under the form of bread alone would be distributed to the faithful.
19.	In 1963, the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council authorized the extension of the faculty for
Holy Communion under both kinds in Sacrosanctum Concilium:
The dogmatic principles which were laid down by the Council of Trent remaining intact,
Communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fit, not only to clerics and
religious, but also to the laity, in cases to be determined by the Apostolic See. . . .29
20. 	The Council’s decision to restore Holy Communion under both kinds at the bishop’s discretion
took expression in the first edition of the Missale Romanum and enjoys an even more generous application in the third typical edition of the Missale Romanum:
Holy Communion has a fuller form as a sign when it takes place under both kinds. For in
this form the sign of the Eucharistic banquet is more clearly evident and clearer expression is
given to the divine will by which the new and eternal Covenant is ratified in the Blood of the
Lord, as also the connection between the Eucharistic banquet and the eschatological banquet in
the Kingdom of the Father.30
The General Instruction further states that “at the same time the faithful should be instructed to
participate more readily in this sacred rite, by which the sign of the Eucharistic banquet is made more
fully evident.”31
21. 	The extension of the faculty for the distribution of Holy Communion under both kinds does not
represent a change in the Church’s immemorial beliefs concerning the Holy Eucharist. Rather, today the
Church finds it salutary to restore a practice, when appropriate, that for various reasons was not opportune when the Council of Trent was convened in 1545.32 But with the passing of time, and under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit, the reform of the Second Vatican Council has resulted in the restoration of
a practice by which the faithful are again able to experience “a fuller sign of the Eucharistic banquet.”33

the most suitable means possible of the Catholic teaching on the form of Holy Communion as laid down by the Ecumenical
Council of Trent. Above all, they should instruct the Christian faithful that the Catholic faith teaches that Christ, whole and
entire, and the true Sacrament, is received even under only one species, and hence that as regards the resulting fruits, those
who receive under only one species are not deprived of any grace that is necessary for salvation.
“Furthermore, they should teach that the Church, in her administration of the Sacraments, has the power to lay down
or alter whatever provisions, apart from the substance of the Sacraments, that she judges to be more readily conducive to
reverence for the Sacraments and the good of the recipients, in view of changing conditions, times, and places” (no. 282).

Part II

NORMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION
OF HOLY COMMUNION UNDER BOTH KINDS
The Purpose of These Norms
22. In response to a provision of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops herein describes the methods of distributing Holy Communion to the faithful
under both kinds and approves the following norms, with the proper recognitio of the Apostolic See.34
The purpose of these norms is to ensure the reverent and careful distribution of Holy Communion
under both kinds.

When Communion Under Both Kinds May Be Given
23. 	The revised Missale Romanum, third typical edition, significantly expands those opportunities
when Holy Communion may be offered under both kinds. In addition to those instances specified
by individual ritual books, the General Instruction states that Communion under both kinds may be
permitted as follows:
a. for Priests who are not able to celebrate or concelebrate
b. for the Deacon and others who perform some duty at Mass
c. members of communities at the Conventual Mass or the “community” Mass, along with seminarians, and all those engaged in a retreat or taking part in a spiritual or pastoral gathering35
24. 	The General Instruction then indicates that the Diocesan Bishop may lay down norms for the
distribution of Communion under both kinds for his own diocese, which must be observed. . . . The
Diocesan Bishop also has the faculty to allow Communion under both kinds, whenever it seems
appropriate to the Priest to whom charge of a given community has been entrusted as [its] own pastor, provided that the faithful have been well instructed and there is no danger of the profanation of
the Sacrament or that the rite would be difficult to carry out on account of the number of participants
or for some other reason.36
In practice, the need to avoid obscuring the role of the Priest and the Deacon as the ordinary
ministers of Holy Communion by an excessive use of extraordinary minister might in some circumstances constitute a reason either for limiting the distribution of Holy Communion under both species
or for using intinction instead of distributing the Precious Blood from the chalice.
Norms established by the Diocesan Bishop must be observed wherever the Eucharist is celebrated in the diocese, “which are also to be observed in churches of religious and at celebrations with
small groups.”37

Cf. GIRM, no. 283. The text before approval of Adaptations for the Dioceses of the United States of America read, “As to
the manner of distributing Holy Communion under both kinds to the faithful and the extent of the faculty for doing so, the
Conferences of Bishops may publish norms, once their decisions have received the recognitio of the Apostolic See.”

Catechesis for Receiving the Body and Blood of the Lord
25. When Communion under both kinds is first introduced by the Diocesan Bishop and also whenever the opportunity for instruction is present, the faithful should be properly catechized on the following matters in the light of the teaching and directives of the General Instruction:
a. the ecclesial nature of the Eucharist as the common possession of the whole Church;
b. the Eucharist as the memorial of Christ’s sacrifice, his death and resurrection, and as the
sacred banquet;
c. the real presence of Christ in the eucharistic elements, whole and entire—in each element of
consecrated bread and wine (the doctrine of concomitance);
d. the kinds of reverence due at all times to the sacrament, whether within the eucharistic Liturgy or outside the celebration;38 and
e. the role that ordinary and, if necessary, extraordinary ministers of the Eucharist are assigned
in the eucharistic assembly.

The Minister of Holy Communion
26. 	By virtue of his sacred ordination, the bishop or Priest offers the sacrifice in the person of Christ,
the Head of the Church. He receives gifts of bread and wine from the faithful, offers the sacrifice to
God, and returns to them the very Body and Blood of Christ, as from the hands of Christ himself.39
Thus bishops and Priests are considered the ordinary ministers of Holy Communion. In addition the
Deacon who assists the bishop or Priest in distributing Communion is an ordinary minister of Holy
Communion. When the Eucharist is distributed under both forms, “the Deacon himself administers
the chalice.”40
27. 	In every celebration of the Eucharist there should be a sufficient number of ministers for Holy
Communion so that it can be distributed in an orderly and reverent manner. Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons distribute Holy Communion by virtue of their office as ordinary ministers of the Body and
Blood of the Lord.41

Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion
28. When the size of the congregation or the incapacity of the bishop, Priest, or Deacon requires
it, the celebrant may be assisted by other bishops, Priests, or Deacons.42 If such ordinary ministers of
Holy Communion are not present, “the Priest may call upon extraordinary ministers to assist him,
that is, duly instituted acolytes or even other faithful who have been duly deputed for this purpose. In
case of necessity, the Priest may depute suitable faithful for this single occasion.”43 Extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion should receive sufficient spiritual, theological, and practical preparation
to fulfill their role with knowledge and reverence. When recourse is had to Extraordinary Minister of
Holy Communion, especially in the distribution of Holy Communion under both kinds, their number
should not be increased beyond what is required for the orderly and reverent distribution of the Body
and Blood of the Lord. In all matters such Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion should follow
the guidance of the Diocesan Bishop.

NORMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND RECEPTION OF

Reverence
29. 	All ministers of Holy Communion should show the greatest reverence for the Most Holy Eucharist by their demeanor, their attire, and the manner in which they handle the consecrated bread or
wine. Should there be any mishap—as when, for example, the consecrated wine is spilled from the
chalice—then the affected “area . . . should be washed with water, and this water should be then
poured into the sacrarium.”44

Planning
30. When Holy Communion is to be distributed under both species, careful planning should be
undertaken so that:
•

•

enough bread and wine are made ready for the communication of the faithful at each Mass.45
As a general rule, Holy Communion is given from hosts consecrated at the same Mass and
not from those reserved in the tabernacle. Precious Blood may not be reserved at one Mass
for use at another;46 and
a suitable number of ministers of Holy Communion are provided at each Mass. For Communion from the chalice, it is desirable that there be generally two ministers of the Precious Blood
for each minister of the Body of Christ, lest the liturgical celebration be unduly prolonged.

31. 	Even when Communion will be ministered in the form of bread alone to the congregation, care
should be taken that sufficient amounts of the elements are consecrated so that the Precious Blood
may be distributed to all concelebrating Priests.

Preparations
32. 	Before Mass begins, wine and hosts should be provided in vessels of appropriate size and number. The presence on the altar of a single chalice and one large paten can signify the one bread and one
chalice by which we are gathered “into one Body by the Holy Spirit… [and] may truly become a living
sacrifice in Christ.”47 When this is not possible, care should be taken that the number of vessels should
not exceed the need.
33. 	The unity of all in the one bread will be better expressed when the bread to be broken is of sufficient size that at least some of the faithful are able to receive a piece broken from it. When the number
of the faithful is great, however, a single large bread may be used for the breaking of the bread with
small breads provided for the rest of the faithful.48
34. Sacred vessels, which “hold a place of honor,” should be of noble materials, appropriate to their
use, and in conformity to the requirements of liturgical law, as specified in the General Instruction of the
Roman Missal, nos. 327-332.

44

GIRM, no. 280.
Cf. EM, no. 31 (DOL 179, no. 1260): “The faithful share more fully in the celebration of the eucharist through sacramental
communion. It is strongly recommended that they should receive it as a rule in the Mass itself and at that point in the
celebration which is prescribed by the rite, that is, right after the communion of the Priest celebrant.
		 “In order that the communion may stand out more clearly even through signs as a participation in the sacrifice actually
being celebrated, steps should be taken that enable the faithful to receive hosts consecrated at that Mass.”
46
Cf. GIRM, no. 284b: “Whatever may remain of the Blood of Christ [after the distribution of Holy Communion] is consumed at the altar by the Priest or the Deacon or the duly instituted acolyte who ministered the chalice.”

48
Cf. GIRM, no. 321.

HOLY COMMUNION UNDER BOTH KINDS

101

35. 	Before being used, vessels for the celebration must be blessed by the bishop or Priest according
to the Rite of Blessing a Chalice and Paten.49

At the Preparation of the Gifts
36. The altar is prepared with corporal, purificator, Missal, and chalice (unless the chalice is prepared at a side table) by the Deacon and the servers. The gifts of bread and wine are brought forward
by the faithful and received by the Priest or Deacon or at a convenient place.50 If one chalice is not sufficient for Holy Communion to be distributed under both kinds to the Priest concelebrants or Christ’s
faithful, several chalices are placed on a corporal on the altar in an appropriate place, filled with wine.
It is praiseworthy that the main chalice be larger than the other chalices prepared for distribution.51

At the Breaking of the Bread
37. 	As the Agnus Dei or Lamb of God is begun, the Bishop or Priest alone, or with the assistance of the
Deacon, and if necessary of concelebrating Priests, breaks the eucharistic bread. Other empty ciboria
or patens are then brought to the altar if this is necessary. The Deacon or Priest places the consecrated
bread in several ciboria or patens, if necessary, as required for the distribution of Holy Communion. If
it is not possible to accomplish this distribution in a reasonable time, the celebrant may call upon the
assistance of other Deacons or concelebrating Priests.
38. 	If extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion are required by pastoral need, they should not
approach the altar before the Priest has received Communion. After the Priest has concluded his own
Communion, he distributes Communion to the extraordinary ministers, assisted by the Deacon, and
then hands the sacred vessels to them for distribution of Holy Communion to the people.
39. 	All receive Holy Communion in the manner described by the General Instruction to the Roman
Missal, whether Priest concelebrants (cf. GIRM, nos. 159, 242, 243, 246), Deacons (cf. GIRM, nos. 182,
244, 246), or extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion (cf. GIRM, no. 284). Neither Deacons nor lay
ministers may ever receive Holy Communion in the manner of a concelebrating Priest. The practice
of extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion waiting to receive Holy Communion until after the
distribution of Holy Communion is not in accord with liturgical law.
40. 	After all eucharistic ministers have received Communion, the bishop or Priest celebrant reverently hands vessels containing the Body or the Blood of the Lord to the Deacons or extraordinary ministers who will assist with the distribution of Holy Communion. The Deacon may assist the Priest in
handing the vessels containing the Body and Blood of the Lord to the extraordinary ministers of Holy
Communion.

Distribution of the Body and Blood of the Lord
41. 	Holy Communion under the form of bread is offered to the communicant with the words “The
Body of Christ.” The communicant may choose whether to receive the Body of Christ in the hand or
on the tongue. When receiving in the hand, the communicant should be guided by the words of St.
Cyril of Jerusalem: “When you approach, take care not to do so with your hand stretched out and your
fingers open or apart, but rather place your left hand as a throne beneath your right, as befits one who
is about to receive the King. Then receive him, taking care that nothing is lost.”52

102

NORMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION AND RECEPTION OF

42. 	Among the ways of ministering the Precious Blood as prescribed by the General Instruction of the
Roman Missal, Communion from the chalice is generally the preferred form in the Latin Church, provided that it can be carried out properly according to the norms and without any risk of even apparent
irreverence toward the Blood of Christ.53
43. 	The chalice is offered to the communicant with the words “The Blood of Christ,” to which the
communicant responds, “Amen.”
44. 	The chalice may never be left on the altar or another place to be picked up by the communicant
for self-communication (except in the case of concelebrating bishops or Priests), nor may the chalice
be passed from one communicant to another. There shall always be a minister of the chalice.
45. 	After each communicant has received the Blood of Christ, the minister carefully wipes both
sides of the rim of the chalice with a purificator. This action is a matter of both reverence and hygiene.
For the same reason, the minister turns the chalice slightly after each communicant has received the
Precious Blood.
46. 	It is the choice of the communicant, not the minister, to receive from the chalice.
47. 	Children are encouraged to receive Communion under both kinds provided that they are properly instructed and that they are old enough to receive from the chalice.

Other Forms of Distribution of the Precious Blood
48. Distribution of the Precious Blood by a spoon or through a straw is not customary in the Latin
dioceses of the United States of America.
49. 	Holy Communion may be distributed by intinction in the following manner: “Each communicant, while holding a Communion-plate under the mouth, approaches the Priest who holds a vessel
with the sacred particles, with a minister standing at his side and holding the chalice. The Priest takes
a host, intincts it partly in the chalice and, showing it, says: ‘The Body and Blood of Christ.’ The communicant replies, ‘Amen,’ receives the Sacrament in the mouth from the Priest, and then withdraws.”54
50. 	The communicant, including the extraordinary minister, is never allowed to self-communicate,
even by means of intinction. Communion under either form, bread or wine, must always be given by
an ordinary or extraordinary minister of Holy Communion.

Purification of Sacred Vessels
51. 	After Communion the consecrated bread that remains is to be reserved in the tabernacle. Care
should be taken with any fragments remaining on the corporal or in the sacred vessels. The Deacon
returns to the altar with the Priest and collects and consumes any remaining fragments.
52. When more of the Precious Blood remains than was necessary for Communion, and if not consumed by the bishop or Priest celebrant, the Deacon, standing at the altar, “immediately and reverently consumes all of the Blood of Christ that remains, assisted, if the case requires, by other Deacons

HOLY COMMUNION UNDER BOTH KINDS

103

and Priests.”55 When there are extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, they may consume what
remains of the Precious Blood from their chalice of distribution with permission of the Diocesan Bishop.
53. 	The sacred vessels are to be purified by the Priest, the Deacon or an instituted acolyte.56 The chalice and other vessels may be taken to a side table, where they are cleansed and arranged in the usual
way. Other sacred vessels that held the Precious Blood are purified in the same way as chalices. Provided the remaining consecrated bread has been consumed or reserved and the remaining Precious
Blood has been consumed, “it is also permitted to leave vessels needing to be purified on a corporal,
suitably covered, on the credence table, and to purify them immediately after Mass, following the
Dismissal of the people.”57
54.	The Precious Blood may not be reserved, except for giving Communion to someone who is sick.
Only sick people who are unable to receive Communion under the form of bread may receive it under
the form of wine alone at the discretion of the Priest. If not consecrated at a Mass in the presence of the
sick person, the Blood of the Lord is kept in a properly covered vessel and is placed in the tabernacle
after Communion. The Precious Blood should be carried to the sick in a vessel that is closed in such a
way as to eliminate all danger of spilling. If some of the Precious Blood remains after the sick person
has received Communion, it should be consumed by the minister, who should also see to it that the
vessel is properly purified.
55. 	The reverence due to the Precious Blood of the Lord demands that it be fully consumed after
Communion is completed and never be poured into the ground or the sacrarium.

Conclusion
56. 	The norms and directives established by the Church for the celebration of any liturgical rite
always have as their immediate goal the proper and careful celebration of those rites. However, such
directives also have as their purpose the fostering of celebrations that glorify God and deepen the
faith, hope, and charity of the participants in liturgical worship. The ordered preparation and celebration of the Mass, and of Holy Communion in particular, should always profoundly affect the faith of
communicants in all its aspects and dimensions. In the case of the distribution of Holy Communion
under both kinds, Christian faith in the real presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist can only be
renewed and deepened in the life of the faithful by this esteemed practice.
57. 	In all other matters pertaining to the Rite of Communion under both kinds, the directives of the
General Instruction, nos. 281-287, are to be consulted.

APOSTOLIC LETTER
MOTU PROPRIO
APPROVAL OF THE UNIVERSAL NORMS
ON THE LITURGICAL YEAR
AND THE NEW GENERAL ROMAN CALENDAR
Pope Paul VI
	The Paschal Mystery’s celebration is of supreme importance in Christian worship, as we are
clearly taught by the sacred Second Vatican Council, and its meaning is unfolded over the course of
days, of weeks, and of the whole year. From this it follows that it is necessary that this same Paschal
Mystery of Christ be placed in clearer light in the reform of the liturgical year, for which norms were
given by the Sacred Synod itself, with regard at once to the arrangement of what is known as the
Proper of Time and of the Proper of Saints and to the revision of the Roman Calendar.1
I
	For in fact, with the passage of centuries, it has happened that, partly from the increase in the
number of vigils, religious festivals and their extension over an octave, and partly from the gradual
introduction of new elements into the liturgical year, the Christian faithful had come not rarely to
practice particular pious exercises in such a way that their minds seemed to have become somewhat
distracted from the principal mysteries of divine redemption.
	Yet everybody knows that several decisions were issued by Our Predecessors Saint Pius X and
John XXIII, of blessed memory, with the intention on the one hand that Sunday, restored to its original dignity, should be truly considered by all as “the primordial feast day,”2 and on the other that the
liturgical celebration of Holy Lent should be restored. It is no less true that Our Predecessor Pius XII,
of blessed memory, ordered by means of a decree3 that in the Western Church during Easter Night the
solemn vigil be restored, so that during it the People of God might renew their spiritual covenant with
Christ the risen Lord in the course of celebrating the Sacraments of Christian Initiation.
	That is to say, these Supreme Pontiffs, following the teaching of the holy Fathers and holding
firmly to the doctrine handed down by the Catholic Church, rightly considered not only that in the
course of the liturgical year those deeds are commemorated by means of which Christ Jesus in dying
brought us salvation, and the memory of past actions is recalled, so that the Christian faithful, even

APOSTOLIC Letter

the more simple of them, may receive spiritual instruction and nourishment, but these Popes also
taught that the celebration of the liturgical year “possesses a distinct sacramental power and efficacy
to strengthen Christian life.”4 This is also Our own mind and teaching.
	Rightly and properly, therefore, as we celebrate the “mystery of the Nativity of Christ”5 and
his appearance in the world, we pray that “we may be inwardly transformed through him whom we
recognize as outwardly like ourselves,”6 and that while we celebrate Christ’s Pasch, we ask almighty
God that those who have been reborn with Christ may “hold fast in their lives to the Sacrament they
have received in faith.”7 For, in the words of the Second Vatican Council, “honoring thus the mysteries
of redemption, the Church opens to the faithful the riches of her Lord’s powers and merits, so that these
are in some way made present in every age in order that the faithful may touch them and be filled with
the grace of salvation.”8
	Hence the purpose of the revision of the liturgical year and of the norms accomplishing
its reform, is nothing other than that through faith, hope, and charity the faithful may share more
deeply in “the whole mystery of Christ, unfolded through the cycle of the year.”9
II
We see no contradiction between what has already been said and the clear brightness that
shines from the feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, “who is joined by an inseparable bond to the saving
work of her Son,”10 and the Memorials of the Saints, to which the birthdays of “our Lords the Martyrs
and Victors”11 are rightly joined, since “the feasts of the Saints proclaim the wonderful works of Christ
in his servants and offer the faithful fitting examples for their imitation.”12 Furthermore, the Catholic
Church has always held firmly and with assurance that in the feasts of the Saints the Paschal Mystery
of Christ is proclaimed and renewed.13
	Therefore, since it cannot be denied that with the passage of centuries more feasts of the Saints
were introduced than was appropriate, the Sacred Synod duly cautioned: “Lest the feasts of the Saints
take precedence over the feasts commemorating the very mysteries of salvation, many of them should
be left to be celebrated by a particular Church or nation or religious family; and only those should be
extended to the Universal Church that commemorate Saints having universal importance.”14
	Furthermore, to put these decrees of the Ecumenical Council into effect, the names of some
Saints have been removed from the General Calendar, and likewise permission has been granted for
the observation of the Memorials of some other Saints to be made optional, and that their cult be
appropriately restored to their own regions. As a result, the removal from the Roman Calendar of the
names of certain Saints not known throughout the world has allowed the addition of names of some
Martyrs from regions to which the announcement of the Gospel spread in later times. Thus the single
catalog displays in equal dignity, as representatives of all peoples, as it were, some who either shed
their blood for Christ or were outstanding in their most signal virtues.
	For these reasons we regard the new General Calendar drawn up for use in the Latin Rite as
being more in keeping with the spiritual attitudes and sentiments of these times and to be a clearer

reflection of that characteristic of the Church which is her universality, since it proposes henceforth
names of outstanding men to put before the whole People of God clear examples of holiness, developed in many different ways. There is no need to speak of the immense spiritual value of this for the
whole multitude of Christians.
	Therefore, after most carefully pondering all these matters before the Lord, with Our Apostolic
Authority We approve the new General Roman Calendar drawn up by the Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy and likewise the universal norms governing the
ordering of the liturgical year, so that they may come into force on the first day of the month of January in the coming year, 1970, in accordance with the decrees that the Sacred Congregation of Rites has
prepared in conjunction with the aforementioned Consilium, which are to remain in force until the
publication of the duly renewed Roman Missal and Breviary.
Whatsoever we have laid down motu proprio in these Our Letters we order to be held firm and
valid, notwithstanding, to the extent necessary, the Constitutions and Apostolic Ordinances issued by
Our Predecessors, or other prescriptions worthy of mention and derogation.

UNIVERSAL NORMS ON THE
LITURGICAL YEAR AND THE CALENDAR
Chapter I

THE LITURGICAL YEAR
1.	Holy Church celebrates the saving work of Christ on prescribed days in the course of the year
with sacred remembrance. Each week, on the day called the Lord’s Day, she commemorates the Resurrection of the Lord, which she also celebrates once a year in the great Paschal Solemnity, together with
his blessed Passion. In fact, throughout the course of the year the Church unfolds the entire mystery
of Christ and observes the birthdays of the Saints.
During the different periods of the liturgical year, in accord with traditional discipline, the
Church completes the education of the faithful by means of both spiritual and bodily devotional practices, instruction, prayer, works of penance, and works of mercy.1
2.	The principles that follow can and must be applied both to the Roman Rite and all other Rites;
however, the practical norms are to be understood as applying solely to the Roman Rite, except in the
case of those that by their very nature also affect the other Rites.2

Title I—The Liturgical Days
I. The Liturgical Day in General
3.	Each and every day is sanctified by the liturgical celebrations of the People of God, especially by
the Eucharistic Sacrifice and the Divine Office.
The liturgical day runs from midnight to midnight. However, the celebration of Sunday and of
Solemnities begins already on the evening of the previous day.

II. Sunday
4.	On the first day of each week, which is known as the Day of the Lord or the Lord’s Day, the
Church, by an apostolic tradition that draws its origin from the very day of the Resurrection of Christ,
celebrates the Paschal Mystery. Hence, Sunday must be considered the primordial feast day.3
5.	Because of its special importance, the celebration of Sunday gives way only to Solemnities and
Feasts of the Lord; indeed, the Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter have precedence over all Feasts of
the Lord and over all Solemnities. In fact, Solemnities occurring on these Sundays are transferred to
the following Monday unless they occur on Palm Sunday or on Sunday of the Lord’s Resurrection.
6.

Sunday excludes in principle the permanent assigning of any other celebration. However:
a) the Sunday within the Octave of the Nativity is the Feast of the Holy Family;
b) the Sunday following January 6 is the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord;
c) the Sunday after Pentecost is the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity;

110

On the Liturgical Year	

111

d) the Last Sunday in Ordinary Time is the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of
the Universe.
7.
Where the Solemnities of the Epiphany, the Ascension and the Most Holy Body and Blood of
Christ are not observed as Holydays of Obligation, they should be assigned to a Sunday as their
proper day in this manner:
a) the Epiphany is assigned to the Sunday that falls between January 2 and January 8;
b) the Ascension to the Seventh Sunday of Easter;
c) the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ to the Sunday after Trinity Sunday.

III. Solemnities, Feasts, and Memorials
8.	In the cycle of the year, as she celebrates the mystery of Christ, the Church also venerates with
a particular love the Blessed Mother of God, Mary, and proposes to the devotion of the faithful the
Memorials of the Martyrs and other Saints.4
9.	The Saints who have universal importance are celebrated in an obligatory way throughout the
whole Church; other Saints are either inscribed in the calendar, but for optional celebration, or are left
to be honored by a particular Church, or nation, or religious family.5
10. Celebrations, according to the importance assigned to them, are hence distinguished one from
another and termed: Solemnity, Feast, Memorial.
11. Solemnities are counted among the most important days, whose celebration begins with First
Vespers (Evening Prayer I) on the preceding day. Some Solemnities are also endowed with their own
Vigil Mass, which is to be used on the evening of the preceding day, if an evening Mass is celebrated.
12. The celebration of the two greatest Solemnities, Easter and the Nativity, is extended over eight
days. Each Octave is governed by its own rules.
13. Feasts are celebrated within the limits of the natural day; accordingly they have no First Vespers
(Evening Prayer I), except in the case of Feasts of the Lord that fall on a Sunday in Ordinary Time or
in Christmas Time and which replace the Sunday Office.
14. Memorials are either obligatory or optional; their observance is integrated into the celebration
of the occurring weekday in accordance with the norms set forth in the General Instruction of the Roman
Missal and of the Liturgy of the Hours.
Obligatory Memorials which fall on weekdays of Lent may only be celebrated as Optional
Memorials.
If several Optional Memorials are inscribed in the Calendar on the same day, only one may be
celebrated, the others being omitted.
15. On Saturdays in Ordinary Time when no Obligatory Memorial occurs, an Optional Memorial of
the Blessed Virgin Mary may be celebrated.

Universal NOrms

112

IV. Weekdays
16. The days of the week that follow Sunday are called weekdays; however, they are celebrated differently according to the importance of each.
a)	Ash Wednesday and the weekdays of Holy Week, from Monday up to and including Thursday, take precedence over all other celebrations.
b)	The weekdays of Advent from December 17 up to and including December 24 and all the
weekdays of Lent have precedence over Obligatory Memorials.
c)	Other weekdays give way to all Solemnities and Feasts and are combined with Memorials.

Title II—The Cycle of the Year
17. Over the course of the year the Church celebrates the whole mystery of Christ, from the Incarnation to Pentecost Day and the days of waiting for the Advent of the Lord.6

I. The Paschal Triduum
18. Since Christ accomplished his work of human redemption and of the perfect glorification of God
principally through his Paschal Mystery, in which by dying he has destroyed our death, and by rising
restored our life, the sacred Paschal Triduum of the Passion and Resurrection of the Lord shines forth as
the high point of the entire liturgical year.7 Therefore the preeminence that Sunday has in the week, the
Solemnity of Easter has in the liturgical year.8
19. The Paschal Triduum of the Passion and Resurrection of the Lord begins with the evening Mass
of the Lord’s Supper, has its center in the Easter Vigil, and closes with Vespers (Evening Prayer) of the
Sunday of the Resurrection.
20. On Friday of the Passion of the Lord9 (Good Friday) and, if appropriate, also on Holy Saturday
until the Easter Vigil,10 the sacred Paschal Fast is everywhere observed.
21. The Easter Vigil, in the holy night when the Lord rose again, is considered the “mother of all
holy Vigils,”11 in which the Church, keeping watch, awaits the Resurrection of Christ and celebrates it
in the Sacraments. Therefore, the entire celebration of this sacred Vigil must take place at night, so that
it both begins after nightfall and ends before the dawn on the Sunday.

II. Easter Time
22. The fifty days from the Sunday of the Resurrection to Pentecost Sunday are celebrated in joy and
exultation as one feast day, indeed as one “great Sunday.”12
These are the days above all others in which the Alleluia is sung.

23. The Sundays of this time of year are considered to be Sundays of Easter and are called, after Easter Sunday itself, the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Sundays of Easter. This sacred
period of fifty days concludes with Pentecost Sunday.
24. The first eight days of Easter Time constitute the Octave of Easter and are celebrated as Solemnities of the Lord.
25. On the fortieth day after Easter the Ascension of the Lord is celebrated, except where, not being
observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it has been assigned to the Seventh Sunday of Easter (cf. no. 7).
26. The weekdays from the Ascension up to and including the Saturday before Pentecost prepare
for the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete.

III. Lent
27. Lent is ordered to preparing for the celebration of Easter, since the Lenten liturgy prepares for
celebration of the Paschal Mystery both catechumens, by the various stages of Christian Initiation, and
the faithful, who recall their own Baptism and do penance.13
28. The forty days of Lent run from Ash Wednesday up to but excluding the Mass of the Lord’s Supper exclusive.
From the beginning of Lent until the Paschal Vigil, the Alleluia is not said.
29. On Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, which is observed everywhere as a fast day,14 ashes
are distributed.
30. The Sundays of this time of year are called the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sundays of
Lent. The Sixth Sunday, on which Holy Week begins, is called “Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord.”
31. Holy Week is ordered to the commemoration of Christ’s Passion, beginning with his Messianic
entrance into Jerusalem.
On Thursday of Holy Week, in the morning, the Bishop concelebrates Mass with his presbyterate and blesses the holy oils and consecrates the chrism.

IV. Christmas Time
32. After the annual celebration of the Paschal Mystery, the Church has no more ancient custom
than celebrating the memorial of the Nativity of the Lord and of his first manifestations, and this takes
place in Christmas Time.
33. Christmas Time runs from First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the Nativity of the Lord up to and
including the Sunday after Epiphany or after January 6.
34. The Vigil Mass of the Nativity is used on the evening of December 24, either before or after First
Vespers (Evening Prayer I).
On the day of the Nativity of the Lord, following ancient Roman tradition, Mass may be celebrated three times, that is, in the night, at dawn, and during the day.

Universal NOrms

114

35.

The Nativity of the Lord has its own Octave, arranged thus:
a) Sunday within the Octave or, if there is no Sunday, December 30, is the Feast of the Holy
Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph;
b) December 26 is the Feast of Saint Stephen, the First Martyr;
c) December 27 is the Feast of Saint John, Apostle and Evangelist;
d) December 28 is the Feast of the Holy Innocents;
e) December 29, 30, and 31 are days within the Octave;
f) January 1, the Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord, is the Solemnity of Mary, the Holy
Mother of God, and also the commemoration of the conferral of the Most Holy Name of Jesus.

36.

The Sunday falling between January 2 and January 5 is the Second Sunday after the Nativity.

37. The Epiphany of the Lord is celebrated on January 6, unless, where it is not observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it has been assigned to the Sunday occurring between January 2 and 8 (cf. no. 7).
38.

The Sunday falling after January 6 is the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord.

V. Advent
39. Advent has a twofold character, for it is a time of preparation for the Solemnities of Christmas, in
which the First Coming of the Son of God to humanity is remembered, and likewise a time when, by
remembrance of this, minds and hearts are led to look forward to Christ’s Second Coming at the end
of time. For these two reasons, Advent is a period of devout and expectant delight.
40. Advent begins with First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the Sunday that falls on or closest to
November 30 and it ends before First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of Christmas.
41. The Sundays of this time of year are named the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Sundays
of Advent.
42. The weekdays from December 17 up to and including December 24 are ordered in a more direct
way to preparing for the Nativity of the Lord.

VI. Ordinary Time
43. Besides the times of year that have their own distinctive character, there remain in the yearly
cycle thirty-three or thirty-four weeks in which no particular aspect of the mystery of Christ is celebrated, but rather the mystery of Christ itself is honored in its fullness, especially on Sundays. This
period is known as Ordinary Time.
44. Ordinary Time begins on the Monday which follows the Sunday occurring after January 6 and
extends up to and including the Tuesday before the beginning of Lent; it begins again on the Monday
after Pentecost Sunday and ends before First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) of the First Sunday of Advent.
During these times of the year there is used the series of formularies given for the Sundays and
weekdays of this time both in the Missal and in the Liturgy of the Hours (Vol. III-IV).

VII. Rogation Days and Ember Days
45. On Rogation and Ember Days the Church is accustomed to entreat the Lord for the various
needs of humanity, especially for the fruits of the earth and for human labor, and to give thanks to
him publicly.

On the Liturgical Year	

115

46. In order that the Rogation Days and Ember Days may be adapted to the different regions and
different needs of the faithful, the Conferences of Bishops should arrange the time and manner in
which they are held.
Consequently, concerning their duration, whether they are to last one or more days, or be
repeated in the course of the year, norms are to be established by the competent authority, taking into
consideration local needs.
47. The Mass for each day of these celebrations should be chosen from among the Masses for Various
Needs, and should be one which is more particularly appropriate to the purpose of the supplications.

Chapter II

THE CALENDAR
Title I—The Calendar
and Celebrations to Be inscribed in it
48. The ordering of the celebration of the liturgical year is governed by a calendar, which is either
general or particular, depending on whether it has been laid down for the use of the entire Roman
Rite, or for the use of a Particular Church or religious family.
49. In the General Calendar is inscribed both the entire cycle of celebrations of the mystery of salvation in the Proper of Time, and that of those Saints who have universal significance and therefore are
obligatorily celebrated by everyone, and of other Saints who demonstrate the universality and continuity of sainthood within the People of God.
Particular calendars, on the other hand, contain celebrations of a more proper character, appropriately combined organically with the general cycle.15 For individual Churches or religious families show
special honor to those Saints who are proper to them for some particular reason.
Particular calendars, however, are to be drawn up by the competent authority and approved by
the Apostolic See.
50.

In drawing up a particular calendar, attention should be paid to the following:
a)	The Proper of Time, that is, the cycle of Times, Solemnities, and Feasts by which the mystery of redemption is unfolded and honored during the liturgical year, must always be kept
intact and enjoy its rightful preeminence over particular celebrations.
b)	Proper celebrations must be combined organically with universal celebrations, with attention to the rank and precedence indicated for each in the Table of Liturgical Days. So that
particular calendars may not be overburdened, individual Saints should have only one celebration in the course of the liturgical year, although, where pastoral reasons recommend it,
there may be another celebration in the form of an Optional Memorial marking the translatio
or inventio of the bodies of Patron Saints or Founders of Churches or of religious families.
c)	Celebrations granted by indult should not duplicate other celebrations already occurring in
the cycle of the mystery of salvation, nor should their number be increased out of proportion.

51. Although it is appropriate for each diocese to have its own Calendar and Proper for the Office
and Mass, there is nevertheless nothing to prevent entire provinces, regions, nations, or even larger
areas, having Calendars and Propers in common, prepared by cooperation among all concerned.
This principle may also be similarly observed in the case of religious calendars for several provinces under the same civil jurisdiction.
52. A particular calendar is prepared by the insertion in the General Calendar of proper Solemnities,
Feasts and Memorials, that is:
a) in a diocesan calendar, besides celebrations of Patrons and of the dedication of the cathedral
church, the Saints and Blessed who have special connections with the diocese, e.g., by their
birth, residence over a long period, or their death;

15

Cf. Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship, Instruction, Calendaria particularia, June 24,1970: Acta Apostolicae Sedis 62
(1970), pp. 651-663.

116

ON THE CALENDAR

117

b) in a religious calendar, besides celebrations of the Title, the Founder and the Patron, those
Saints and Blessed who were members of that religious family or had a special relationship
with it;
c) in calendars for individual churches, besides the proper celebrations of the diocese or religious family, celebrations proper to the church that are listed in the Table of Liturgical Days,
and Saints whose body is kept in the church. Members of religious families, too, join the
community of the local Church in celebrating the anniversary of the dedication of the cathedral church and the principal Patrons of the place and of the wider region where they live.
53. When a diocese or religious family has the distinction of having many Saints and Blessed, care
must be taken so that the calendar of the entire diocese or entire institute does not become overburdened. Consequently:
a)	A common celebration can, first of all, be held of all the Saints and Blessed of a diocese or
religious family, or of some category among them.
b)	Only the Saints and Blessed of particular significance for the entire diocese or the entire religious family should be inscribed in the calendar as an individual celebration.
c)	The other Saints or Blessed should be celebrated only in those places with which they have
closer ties or where their bodies are kept.
54. Proper celebrations should be inscribed in the Calendar as Obligatory or Optional Memorials,
unless other provisions have been made for them in the Table of Liturgical Days, or there are special historical or pastoral reasons. There is no reason, however, why some celebrations may not be
observed in certain places with greater solemnity than in the rest of the diocese or religious family.
55. Celebrations inscribed in a particular calendar must be observed by all who are bound to follow
that calendar and may only be removed from the calendar or changed in rank with the approval of the
Apostolic See.

Title II—The Proper Day for Celebrations
56. The Church’s practice has been to celebrate the Saints on their “birthday,” a practice that it is
appropriate to follow when proper celebrations are inscribed in particular calendars.
However, even though proper celebrations have special importance for individual particular
Churches or individual religious families, it is greatly expedient that there be as much unity as possible
in the celebration of Solemnities, Feasts and Obligatory Memorials inscribed in the General Calendar.
Consequently in inscribing proper celebrations in a particular calendar, the following should
be observed:
a)	Celebrations that are also listed in the General Calendar are to be inscribed on the same date
in a particular calendar, with a change if necessary in the rank of celebration.
		The same must be observed with regard to a diocesan or religious calendar for the
inscription of celebrations proper to a single church.
b)	Celebrations of Saints not found in the General Calendar should be assigned to their “birthday.” If this is not known, the celebrations should be assigned to a date proper to the Saint
for some other reason, e.g., the date of ordination or of the inventio or translatio of the Saint’s
body; otherwise to a day that is free from other celebrations in the particular Calendar.
c)	If, on the other hand, the “birthday” or other proper day is impeded by another obligatory
celebration, even of lower rank, in the General Calendar or in a particular calendar, the celebration should be assigned to the closest date not so impeded.

118

UNIVERSAL NORMS

d)	However, if it is a question of celebrations that for pastoral reasons cannot be transferred to
another date, the impeding celebration must itself be transferred.
e)	Other celebrations, termed celebrations by indult, should be inscribed on a date more pastorally appropriate.
f)	In order that the cycle of the liturgical year shine forth in all its clarity, but that the celebration of the Saints not be permanent­ly impeded, dates that usually fall during Lent and the
Octave of Easter, as well as the weekdays from December 17 to December 31, should remain
free of any particular celebration, unless it is a question of Obligatory Memorials, of Feasts
found in the Table of Liturgical Days under no. 8: a, b, c, d, or of Solemnities that cannot be
transferred to another time of the year.
The Solemnity of Saint Joseph, where it is observed as a Holyday of Obligation, should it fall on
Palm Sunday of the Lord’s Passion, is anticipated on the preceding Saturday, March18. Where, on the
other hand, it is not observed as a Holyday of Obligation, it may be transferred by the Conference of
Bishops to another day outside Lent.
57. If any Saints or Blessed are inscribed together in the Calendar, they are always celebrated
together, whenever their celebrations are of equal rank, even though one or more of them may be more
proper. If, however, the celebration of one or more of these Saints or Blessed is of a higher rank, the
Office of this or those Saints or Blessed alone is celebrated and the celebration of the others is omitted,
unless it is appropriate to assign them to another date in the form of an Obligatory Memorial.
58. For the pastoral good of the faithful, it is permitted to observe on Sundays in Ordinary Time
those celebrations that fall during the week and that are agreeable to the devotion of the faithful,
provided the celebrations rank above that Sunday in the Table of Liturgical Days. The Mass of such
celebrations may be used at all the celebrations of Mass at which the people are present.
59. Precedence among liturgical days, as regards their celebration, is governed solely by the following Table.

ON THE CALENDAR

119

precedence over it should be transferred to the closest day not listed under nos. 1-8 in the Table of Precedence, provided that what is laid down in no. 5 is observed. As to the Solemnity of the Annunciation
of the Lord, whenever it falls on any day of Holy Week, it shall always be transferred to the Monday

in cases of equal rank, Vespers (Evening Prayer) of the current day takes precedence.

For in the waters of the Jordan
you revealed with signs and wonders a new Baptism,
so that through the voice that came down from heaven
we might come to believe in your Word dwelling among us,
and by the Spirit’s descending in the likeness of a dove
we might know that Christ your Servant
has been anointed with the oil of gladness
and sent to bring the good news to the poor.
And so, with the Powers of heaven,
we worship you constantly on earth,
and before your majesty
without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

Communion Antiphon

Jn 1: 32, 34

Behold the One of whom John said:
I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.

Prayer after Communion

Nourished with these sacred gifts,
we humbly entreat your mercy, O Lord,
that, faithfully listening to your Only Begotten Son,
we may be your children in name and in truth.
Through Christ our Lord.
Ordinary Time lasts from the Monday after this Sunday to the Tuesday before Lent. For
Masses both on Sundays and on weekdays, the texts given below, pp. 459 ff., are used.

LENT

1. 	It is strongly recommended that the tradition of gathering the local Church after the fashion
of the Roman “stations” be kept and promoted, especially during Lent and at least in larger
towns and cities, in a way best suited to individual places.
Such gatherings of the faithful can take place, especially with the chief Pastor of the
diocese presiding, on Sundays or on other more convenient days during the week, either at
the tombs of the Saints, or in the principal churches or shrines of a city, or even in the more
frequently visited places of pilgrimage in the diocese.
If a procession precedes a Mass celebrated for such a gathering, according to circumstances
and local conditions, the faithful gather at a smaller church or some other suitable place
other than in the church to which the procession will head.
After greeting the people, the Priest says a Collect of The Mystery of the Holy Cross
(cf. below, pp. 1331), For the Forgiveness of Sins (cf. below, pp. 1306-1307), or For the
Church, especially For the Particular Church (cf. below, pp. 1242), or one of the Prayers
over the People. Then the procession makes its way to the church in which Mass will be
celebrated and meanwhile the Litany of the Saints is sung. Invocations to the Patron Saint
or the Founder Saint and to the Saints of the local Church may be inserted at the appropriate
point in the Litany.
When the procession reaches the church, the Priest venerates the altar and, if appropriate,
incenses it. Afterwards, omitting the Introductory Rites and, if appropriate, the Kyrie, he
says the Collect of the Mass, and then continues the Mass in the usual way.
2.	At these gatherings, instead of Mass, some celebration of the Word of God may also take place,
especially in the form of the penitential celebrations given in the Roman Ritual for Lent.
3.	On weekdays of Lent, at the end of Mass and before the final blessing, the Prayer over the
People indicated for each day may appropriately be used.
4.

During Lent, it is not permitted to decorate the altar with flowers, and the use of musical
instruments is allowed only so as to support the singing. Nevertheless, Laetare Sunday (the
Fourth Sunday of Lent), Solemnities, and Feasts are exceptions to this rule.
208

Ash Wednesday
In the course of today’s Mass, ashes are blessed and distributed. These are made from the olive
branches or branches of other trees that were blessed the previous year.

Introductory Rites and Liturgy of the Word
Entrance Antiphon

Wis 11: 24, 25, 27

You are merciful to all, O Lord,
and despise nothing that you have made.
You overlook people’s sins, to bring them to repentance,
and you spare them, for you are the Lord our God.
The Penitential Act is omitted, and the Distribution of Ashes takes its place.

Collect

Grant, O Lord, that we may begin with holy fasting
this campaign of Christian service,
so that, as we take up battle against spiritual evils,
we may be armed with weapons of self-restraint.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

Blessing and Distribution of Ashes
After the Homily, the Priest, standing with hands joined, says:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), let us humbly ask God
our Father
that he be pleased to bless with the abundance of his grace
these ashes, which we will put on our heads in penitence.
After a brief prayer in silence, and, with hands extended, he continues:

O God, who are moved by acts of humility
and respond with forgiveness to works of penance,
lend your merciful ear to our prayers
and in your kindness pour out the grace of your X blessing
on your servants who are marked with these ashes,
that, as they follow the Lenten observances,
they may be worthy to come with minds made pure
to celebrate the Paschal Mystery of your Son.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or:

O God, who desire not the death of sinners,
but their conversion,
mercifully hear our prayers
and in your kindness be pleased to bless X these ashes,
which we intend to receive upon our heads,
that we, who acknowledge we are but ashes
and shall return to dust,
may, through a steadfast observance of Lent,
gain pardon for sins and newness of life
after the likeness of your Risen Son.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
He sprinkles the ashes with holy water, without saying anything.

ash Wednesday

211

Then the Priest places ashes on the head of all those present who come to him, and says to
each one:

Repent, and believe in the Gospel.
Or:

Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.
Meanwhile, the following are sung:

Antiphon 1
Let us change our garments to sackcloth and ashes,
let us fast and weep before the Lord,
that our God, rich in mercy, might forgive us our sins.

Antiphon 2 	Cf. Jl 2: 17; Est 4: 17
Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord,
stand between the porch and the altar and weep and cry out:
Spare, O Lord, spare your people;
do not close the mouths of those who sing your praise, O Lord.

Antiphon 3 	Ps 51 (50): 3
Blot out my transgressions, O Lord.
This may be repeated after each verse of Psalm 51 (50) (Have mercy on me, O God).

Responsory 	Cf. Bar 3: 2; Ps 79 (78): 9

R. Let us correct our faults which we have committed in ignorance,
let us not be taken unawares by the day of our death, looking in
vain for leisure to repent. * Hear us, O Lord, and show us your
mercy, for we have sinned against you.
V.	Help us, O God our Savior; for the sake of your name, O Lord, set
us free. * Hear us, O Lord . . .
Another appropriate chant may also be sung.
After the distribution of ashes, the Priest washes his hands and proceeds to the Universal
Prayer, and continues the Mass in the usual way.
The Creed is not said.

212

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
Prayer over the Offerings

As we solemnly offer
the annual sacrifice for the beginning of Lent,
we entreat you, O Lord,
that, through works of penance and charity,
we may turn away from harmful pleasures
and, cleansed from our sins, may become worthy
to celebrate devoutly the Passion of your Son.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
Preface III or IV of Lent, pp. 550-553.

Communion Antiphon	Cf. Ps 1: 2-3
He who ponders the law of the Lord day and night
will yield fruit in due season.

Prayer after Communion

May the Sacrament we have received sustain us, O Lord,
that our Lenten fast may be pleasing to you
and be for us a healing remedy.
Through Christ our Lord.
Prayer over the People
For the dismissal, the Priest stands facing the people and, extending his hands over them,
says this prayer:

Pour out a spirit of compunction, O God,
on those who bow before your majesty,
and by your mercy may they merit the rewards you promise
to those who do penance.
Through Christ our Lord.
The blessing and distribution of ashes may also take place outside Mass. In this case, the
rite is preceded by a Liturgy of the Word, with the Entrance Antiphon, the Collect, and the
readings with their chants as at Mass. Then there follow the Homily and the blessing and
distribution of ashes. The rite is concluded with the Universal Prayer, the Blessing, and the
Dismissal of the Faithful.

HOLY WEEK

Palm Sunday of the
Passion of the Lord
1.	On this day the Church recalls the entrance of Christ the Lord into Jerusalem to accomplish
his Paschal Mystery. Accordingly, the memorial of this entrance of the Lord takes place at all
Masses, by means of the Procession or the Solemn Entrance before the principal Mass or the
Simple Entrance before other Masses. The Solemn Entrance, but not the Procession, may be
repeated before other Masses that are usually celebrated with a large gathering of people.
It is desirable that, where neither the Procession nor the Solemn Entrance can take place,
there be a sacred celebration of the Word of God on the messianic entrance and on the
Passion of the Lord, either on Saturday evening or on Sunday at a convenient time.

The Commemoration of the Lord’s
Entrance into Jerusalem
First Form: The Procession
2.	At an appropriate hour, a gathering takes place at a smaller church or other suitable place
other than inside the church to which the procession will go. The faithful hold branches in
their hands.
3.

Wearing the red sacred vestments as for Mass, the Priest and the Deacon, accompanied by
other ministers, approach the place where the people are gathered. Instead of the chasuble,
the Priest may wear a cope, which he leaves aside when the procession is over, and puts on a
chasuble.

4.

Meanwhile, the following antiphon or another appropriate chant is sung.

5.	After this, the Priest and people sign themselves, while the Priest says: In the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Then he greets the people in the usual way. A
brief address is given, in which the faithful are invited to participate actively and consciously
in the celebration of this day, in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
since the beginning of Lent until now
we have prepared our hearts by penance and charitable works.
Today we gather together to herald with the whole Church
the beginning of the celebration
of our Lord’s Paschal Mystery,
that is to say, of his Passion and Resurrection.
For it was to accomplish this mystery
that he entered his own city of Jerusalem.
Therefore, with all faith and devotion,
let us commemorate
the Lord’s entry into the city for our salvation,
following in his footsteps,
so that, being made by his grace partakers of the Cross,
we may have a share also in his Resurrection and in his life.

of the passion of the lord

275

6.	After the address, the Priest says one of the following prayers with hands extended.

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
sanctify X these branches with your blessing,
that we, who follow Christ the King in exultation,
may reach the eternal Jerusalem through him.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or:

Increase the faith of those who place their hope in you, O God,
and graciously hear the prayers of those who call on you,
that we, who today hold high these branches
to hail Christ in his triumph,
may bear fruit for you by good works accomplished in him.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
He sprinkles the branches with holy water without saying anything.

7.	Then a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, a Priest, proclaims in the usual way the Gospel
concerning the Lord’s entrance according to one of the four Gospels. If appropriate, incense
may be used.

“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord”

Year A:

X A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.
When Jesus and the disciples drew near Jerusalem and
came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent
two disciples, 2 saying to them,
“Go into the village opposite you,
and immediately you will find an ass tethered,
and a colt with her.
Untie them and bring them here to me.
3
	And if anyone should say anything to you, reply,
‘The master has need of them.’ Then he will send them
at once.”
4
This happened so that what had been spoken through the
prophet
might be fulfilled:
5
Say to daughter Zion,
“Behold, your king comes to you, meek and riding
on an ass,
and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.”
6
The disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them.
7
They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks
over them, and he sat upon them.
8
The very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
while others cut branches from the trees and strewed
them on the road.
9
The crowds preceding him and those following
kept crying out and saying:
“Hosanna to the Son of David;
blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord;
hosanna in the highest.”
10
And when he entered Jerusalem
the whole city was shaken and asked, “Who is this?”
11
	And the crowds replied,
“This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.”

Year B:

X A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark.
When Jesus and his disciples drew near to Jerusalem, to
Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives,
he sent two of his disciples 2 and said to them,
“Go into the village opposite you, and immediately on
entering it,
you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat.
Untie it and bring it here.
3
	If anyone should say to you,
‘Why are you doing this?’ reply,
‘The Master has need of it
and will send it back here at once.’ “
4
	So they went off
and found a colt tethered at a gate outside on the street,
and they untied it.
5
	Some of the bystanders said to them,
“What are you doing, untying the colt?”
6
They answered them just as Jesus had told them to, and
they permitted them to do it.
7
	So they brought the colt to Jesus and put their cloaks over it.
And he sat on it.
8
	Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others
spread leafy branches
that they had cut from the fields.
9
Those preceding him as well as those following kept
crying out: “Hosanna!
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
10
Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is
to come!
Hosanna in the highest!”

PALM SUNDAY

X A reading from the holy Gospel according to John.

12: 12-16

When the great crowd that had come to the feast heard
that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
13
they took palm branches and went out to meet him, and
cried out:
“Hosanna!
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the king
of Israel.”
14
Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is written:
15
Fear no more, O daughter Zion;
see, your king comes, seated upon an ass’s colt.
16
His disciples did not understand this at first, but when
Jesus had been glorified
they remembered that these things were written about
him and that they had done this for him.
12

The Gospel of the Lord.
Year C

X A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke.
Jesus proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem.
29
As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the place
called the Mount of Olives,
he sent two of his disciples.
30
He said, “Go into the village opposite you,
and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered on which
no one has ever sat.
Untie it and bring it here.
31
And if anyone should ask you,
‘Why are you untying it?’ you will answer,
‘The Master has need of it.’ “
32
So those who had been sent went off
and found everything just as he had told them.
33
And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to
them, “Why are you untying this colt?”
34
They answered,
“The Master has need of it.”35 So they brought it to Jesus,
threw their cloaks over the colt,
and helped Jesus to mount.

of the passion of the lord

279

As he rode along,
the people were spreading their cloaks on the road;
37
and now as he was approaching the slope of the Mount of
Olives, the whole multitude of his disciples
began to praise God aloud with joy
for all the mighty deeds they had seen.
38
They proclaimed:
“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord.
39
Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.”
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher,
rebuke your disciples.”
40
He said in reply,
“I tell you, if they keep silent, the stones will cry out!”
The Gospel of the Lord.
36

8.	After the Gospel, a brief homily may be given. Then, to begin the Procession, an invitation
may be given by a Priest or a Deacon or a lay minister, in these or similar words:

PALM SUNDAY

9.	The Procession to the church where Mass will be celebrated then sets off in the usual way. If
incense is used, the thurifer goes first, carrying a thurible with burning incense, then an acolyte
or another minister, carrying a cross decorated with palm branches according to local custom,
between two ministers with lighted candles. Then follow the Deacon carrying the Book of the
Gospels, the Priest with the ministers, and, after them, all the faithful carrying branches.
As the Procession moves forward, the following or other suitable chants in honor of
Christ the King are sung by the choir and people.

Antiphon 1
The children of the Hebrews, carrying olive branches,
went to meet the Lord, crying out and saying:
Hosanna in the highest.
If appropriate, this antiphon is repeated between the strophes of the following Psalm.
Psalm 24 (23)

The Lord’s is the earth and its fullness, *
the world, and those who dwell in it.
It is he who set it on the seas;*
on the rivers he made it firm.
(The antiphon is repeated)

Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?*
The clean of hands and pure of heart,
whose soul is not set on vain things, †
who has not sworn deceitful words.*
(The antiphon is repeated)

Blessings from the Lord shall he receive,*
and right reward from the God who saves him.
Such are the people who seek him,*
who seek the face of the God of Jacob.
(The antiphon is repeated)

O gates, lift high your heads; †
grow higher, ancient doors.*
Let him enter, the king of glory!
Who is this king of glory?*
The Lord, the mighty, the valiant;
the Lord, the valiant in war.
(The antiphon is repeated)

of the passion of the lord

O gates, lift high your heads; †
grow higher, ancient doors.*
Let him enter, the king of glory!
Who is this king of glory?*
He, the Lord of hosts,
he is the king of glory.
(The antiphon is repeated)

Antiphon 2
The children of the Hebrews spread their garments on the road,
crying out and saying: Hosanna to the Son of David;
blesssed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
If appropriate, this antiphon is repeated between the strophes of the following Psalm.
Psalm 47 (46)

All peoples, clap your hands.*
Cry to God with shouts of joy!
For the Lord, the Most high, is awesome,*
the great king over all the earth.
(The antiphon is repeated)

He humbles peoples under us*
and nations under our feet.
Our heritage he chose for us,*
the pride of Jacob whom he loves.
God goes up with shouts of joy.*
The Lord goes up with trumpet blast.
(The antiphon is repeated)

Sing praise for God; sing praise!*
Sing praise to our king; sing praise!
God is king of all earth.*
Sing praise with all your skill.
(The antiphon is repeated)

God reigns over the nations.*
God sits upon his holy throne.
The princes of the peoples are assembled
with the people of the God of Abraham. †
The rulers of the earth belong to God,*
who is greatly exalted.
(The antiphon is repeated)

PALM SUNDAY

Hymn to Christ the King
Chorus:

Glory and honor and praise be to you, Christ, King and Redeemer,
to whom young children cried out loving Hosannas with joy.
All repeat: Glory and honor . . .
Chorus:
Israel’s King are you, King David’s magnificent offspring;
you are the ruler who come blest in the name of the Lord.
All repeat: Glory and honor . . .
Chorus:
Heavenly hosts on high unite in singing your praises;
men and women on earth and all creation join in.
All repeat: Glory and honor . . .
Chorus:
Bearing branches of palm, Hebrews came crowding to greet you;
see how with prayers and hymns we come to pay you our vows.
All repeat: Glory and honor . . .

They offered gifts of praise to you, so near to your Passion;
see how we sing this song now to you reigning on high.
All repeat: Glory and honor . . .
Chorus:
Those you were pleased to accept; now accept our gifts of devotion,
good and merciful King, lover of all that is good.
All repeat: Glory and honor . . .
10.	As the procession enters the church, there is sung the following responsory or another chant,
which should speak of the Lord’s entrance.

R. As the Lord entered the holy city, the children of the Hebrews proclaimed the
resurrection of life. *Waving their branches of palm, they cried: Hosanna in
the Highest.
V. When the people heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they went out to
meet him. *Waving their branches.
11.

When the Priest arrives at the altar, he venerates it and, if appropriate, incenses it. Then he
goes to the chair, where he puts aside the cope, if he has worn one, and puts on the chasuble.
Omitting the other Introductory Rites of the Mass and, if appropriate, the Kyrie (Lord, have
mercy), he says the Collect of the Mass, and then continues the Mass in the usual way.

of the passion of the lord

283

Second Form: The Solemn Entrance
12.

When a procession outside the church cannot take place, the entrance of the Lord is celebrated
inside the church by means of a Solemn Entrance before the principal Mass.

13.	Holding branches in their hands, the faithful gather either outside, in front of the church
door, or inside the church itself. The Priest and ministers and a representative group of the
faithful go to a suitable place in the church outside the sanctuary, where at least the greater
part of the faithful can see the rite.
14.

While the Priest approaches the appointed place, the antiphon Hosanna or another
appropriate chant is sung. Then the blessing of branches and the proclamation of the Gospel
of the Lord’s entrance into Jerusalem take place as above (nos. 5-7). After the Gospel, the
Priest processes solemnly with the ministers and the representative group of the faithful
through the church to the sanctuary, while the responsory As the Lord entered (no. 10) or
another appropriate chant is sung.

15.	Arriving at the altar, the Priest venerates it. He then goes to the chair and, omitting the
Introductory Rites of the Mass and, if appropriate, the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), he says the
Collect of the Mass, and then continues the Mass in the usual way.

Third Form: The Simple Entrance
16.	At all other Masses of this Sunday at which the Solemn Entrance is not held, the memorial of
the Lord’s entrance into Jerusalem takes place by means of a Simple Entrance.
17.

While the Priest proceeds to the altar, the Entrance Antiphon with its Psalm (no. 18) or another
chant on the same theme is sung. Arriving at the altar, the Priest venerates it and goes to the
chair. After the Sign of the Cross, he greets the people and continues the Mass in the usual way.
At other Masses, in which singing at the entrance cannot take place, the Priest, as soon as
he has arrived at the altar and venerated it, greets the people, reads the Entrance Antiphon,
and continues the Mass in the usual way.

18.

Entrance Antiphon	Cf. Jn 12: 1, 12-13; Ps 24 (23): 9-10
Six days before the Passover,
when the Lord came into the city of Jerusalem,
the children ran to meet him;
in their hands they carried palm branches
and with a loud voice cried out:
*Hosanna in the highest!
Blessed are you, who have come in your abundant mercy!
O gates, lift high your heads;
grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!
Who is this king of glory?
He, the Lord of hosts, he is the king of glory.
*Hosanna in the highest!
Blessed are you, who have come in your abundant mercy!

284

PALM SUNDAY

At the Mass
19.	After the Procession or Solemn Entrance the Priest begins the Mass with the Collect.
20.

Collect

Almighty ever-living God,
who as an example of humility for the human race to follow
caused our Savior to take flesh and submit to the Cross,
graciously grant that we may heed his lesson of patient suffering
and so merit a share in his Resurrection.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
21.	The narrative of the Lord’s Passion is read without candles and without incense, with no
greeting or signing of the book. It is read by a Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, by a Priest. It
may also be read by readers, with the part of Christ, if possible, reserved to a Priest.
Deacons, but not others, ask for the blessing of the Priest before singing the Passion, as
at other times before the Gospel.
22.	After the narrative of the Passion, a brief homily should take place, if appropriate. A period
of silence may also be observed.
The Creed is said, and the Universal Prayer takes place.
23.

Prayer over the Offerings

Through the Passion of your Only Begotten Son, O Lord,
may our reconciliation with you be near at hand,
so that, though we do not merit it by our own deeds,
yet by this sacrifice made once for all,
we may feel already the effects of your mercy.
Through Christ our Lord.

289

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [Holy Thursday]
1.	In accordance with a most ancient tradition of the Church, on this day all Masses without the
people are forbidden.

The Chrism Mass
2.	The blessing of the Oil of the Sick and of the Oil of Catechumens and the consecration of the
Chrism are carried out by the Bishop, according to the Rite described in the Roman Pontifical,
usually on this day, at a proper Mass to be celebrated during the morning.
3.	If, however, it is very difficult for the clergy and the people to gather with the Bishop on this
day, the Chrism Mass may be anticipated on another day, but near to Easter.
4.	This Mass, which the Bishop concelebrates with his presbyterate, should be, as it were, a
manifestation of the Priests’ communion with their Bishop. Accordingly it is desirable that
all the Priests participate in it, insofar as is possible, and during it receive Communion even
under both kinds. To signify the unity of the presbyterate of the diocese, the Priests who
concelebrate with the Bishop should be from different regions of the diocese.
5.	In accord with traditional practice, the blessing of the Oil of the Sick takes place before the
end of the Eucharistic Prayer, but the blessing of the Oil of Catechumens and the consecration
of the Chrism take place after Communion. Nevertheless, for pastoral reasons, it is permitted
for the entire rite of blessing to take place after the Liturgy of the Word.
6.

Entrance Antiphon

Rev 1: 6

Jesus Christ has made us into a kingdom, priests for his God and Father.
To him be glory and power for ever and ever. Amen.
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.
7.

Collect

O God, who anointed your Only Begotten Son with the Holy Spirit
and made him Christ and Lord,
graciously grant
that, being made sharers in his consecration,
we may bear witness to your Redemption in the world.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
8.	After the reading of the Gospel, the Bishop preaches the Homily in which, taking his starting
point from the text of the readings proclaimed in the Liturgy of the Word, he speaks to the
people and to his Priests about priestly anointing, urging the Priests to be faithful in their
office and calling on them to renew publicly their priestly promises.

290

the chrism mass

291

Renewal of Priestly Promises
9.	After the Homily, the Bishop speaks with the Priests in these or similar words.

Beloved sons,
on the anniversary of that day
when Christ our Lord conferred his priesthood
on his Apostles and on us,
are you resolved to renew,
in the presence of your Bishop and God’s holy people,
the promises you once made?
The Priests, all together, respond: I am.

Are you resolved to be more united with the Lord Jesus
and more closely conformed to him,
denying yourselves and confirming those promises
about sacred duties towards Christ’s Church
which, prompted by love of him,
you willingly and joyfully pledged
on the day of your priestly ordination?
Priests: I am.

Are you resolved to be faithful stewards of the mysteries of God
in the Holy Eucharist and the other liturgical rites
and to discharge faithfully the sacred office of teaching,
following Christ the Head and Shepherd,
not seeking any gain,
but moved only by zeal for souls?
Priests: I am.
Then, turned towards the people, the Bishop continues:

As for you, dearest sons and daughters,
pray for your Priests,
that the Lord may pour out his gifts abundantly upon them,
and keep them faithful as ministers of Christ, the High Priest,
so that they may lead you to him,
who is the source of salvation.

292

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

People: Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.

And pray also for me,
that I may be faithful to the apostolic office
entrusted to me in my lowliness
and that in your midst I may be made day by day
a living and more perfect image of Christ,
the Priest, the Good Shepherd,
the Teacher and the Servant of all.
People: Christ, hear us. Christ, graciously hear us.

May the Lord keep us all in his charity
and lead all of us,
shepherds and flock,
to eternal life.
All: Amen.
10. 	The Creed is not said.
11.

Prayer over the Offerings

May the power of this sacrifice, O Lord, we pray,
mercifully wipe away what is old in us
and increase in us grace of salvation and newness of life.
Through Christ our Lord.

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
you made your Only Begotten Son
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,
and by your wondrous design were pleased to decree
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.
For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood
the people he has made his own,
but with a brother’s kindness he also chooses men
to become sharers in his sacred ministry
through the laying on of hands.
They are to renew in his name
the sacrifice of human redemption,
to set before your children the paschal banquet,
to lead your holy people in charity,
to nourish them with the word
and strengthen them with the Sacraments.
As they give up their lives for you
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

13.

Communion Antiphon

Ps 89 (88): 2

I will sing for ever of your mercies, O Lord;
through all ages my mouth will proclaim your fidelity.
14.

Prayer after Communion

We beseech you, almighty God,
that those you renew by your Sacraments
may merit to become the pleasing fragrance of Christ.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
15.	The reception of the Holy Oils may take place in individual parishes either before the celebration
of the Evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper or at another time that seems more appropriate.

THE SACRED
PASCHAL TRIDUUM

1.	In the Sacred Triduum, the Church solemnly celebrates the greatest mysteries of our
redemption, keeping by means of special celebrations the memorial of her Lord, crucified,
buried, and risen.
The Paschal Fast should also be kept sacred. It is to be celebrated everywhere on the
Friday of the Lord’s Passion and, where appropriate, prolonged also through Holy Saturday
as a way of coming, with spirit uplifted, to the joys of the Lord’s Resurrection.
2.	For a fitting celebration of the Sacred Triduum, a sufficient number of lay ministers is required,
who must be carefully instructed as to what they are to do.
The singing of the people, the ministers, and the Priest Celebrant has a special importance
in the celebrations of these days, for when texts are sung, they have their proper impact.
Pastors should, therefore, not fail to explain to the Christian faithful, as best they can,
the meaning and order of the celebrations and to prepare them for active and fruitful
participation.
3.	The celebrations of the Sacred Triduum are to be carried out in cathedral and parochial
churches and only in those churches in which they can be performed with dignity, that is,
with a good attendance of the faithful, an appropriate number of ministers, and the means to
sing at least some of the parts.
Consequently, it is desirable that small communities, associations, and special groups of
various kinds join together in these churches to carry out the sacred celebrations in a more
noble manner.
298

THURSDAY OF THE LORD’S SUPPER

At the Evening Mass
1.	The Mass of the Lord’s Supper is celebrated in the evening, at a convenient time, with the full
participation of the whole local community and with all the Priests and ministers exercising
their office.
2.	All Priests may concelebrate even if they have already concelebrated the Chrism Mass on
this day, or if they have to celebrate another Mass for the good of the Christian faithful.
3.

Where a pastoral reason requires it, the local Ordinary may permit another Mass to be celebrated
in churches and oratories in the evening and, in case of genuine necessity, even in the morning,
but only for the faithful who are in no way able to participate in the evening Mass. Care should,
nevertheless, be taken that celebrations of this sort do not take place for the advantage of private
persons or special small groups, and do not prejudice the evening Mass.

4.	Holy Communion may only be distributed to the faithful during Mass; but it may be brought
to the sick at any hour of the day.
5.	The altar may be decorated with flowers with a moderation that accords with the character
of this day. The tabernacle should be entirely empty; but a sufficient amount of bread should
be consecrated in this Mass for the Communion of the clergy and the people on this and the
following day.
6.

Entrance Antiphon

Cf. Gal 6: 14

We should glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
in whom is our salvation, life and resurrection,
through whom we are saved and delivered.
7. 	The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said. While the hymn is being sung,
bells are rung, and when it is finished, they remain silent until the Gloria in excelsis of the
Easter Vigil, unless, if appropriate, the Diocesan Bishop has decided otherwise. Likewise,
during this same period, the organ and other musical instruments may be used only so as to
support the singing.
8.

Collect

O God, who have called us to participate
in this most sacred Supper,
in which your Only Begotten Son,
when about to hand himself over to death,
entrusted to the Church a sacrifice new for all eternity,
the banquet of his love,
grant, we pray,
that we may draw from so great a mystery,
the fullness of charity and of life.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

9.	After the proclamation of the Gospel, the Priest gives a homily in which light is shed on
the principal mysteries that are commemorated in this Mass, namely, the institution of the
Holy Eucharist and of the priestly Order, and the commandment of the Lord concerning
fraternal charity.

The Washing of Feet
10.	After the Homily, where a pastoral reason suggests it, the Washing of Feet follows.
11.	The men who have been chosen are led by the ministers to seats prepared in a suitable place.
Then the Priest (removing his chasuble if necessary) goes to each one, and, with the help of
the ministers, pours water over each one’s feet and then dries them.
12.

Meanwhile some of the following antiphons or other appropriate chants are sung.

Antiphon 1	Cf. Jn 13: 4, 5, 15
After the Lord had risen from supper,
he poured water into a basin
and began to wash the feet of his disciples:
he left them this example.

Antiphon 2	Cf. Jn 13: 12, 13, 15
The Lord Jesus, after eating supper with his disciples,
washed their feet and said to them:
Do you know what I, your Lord and Master, have done for you?
I have given you an example, that you should do likewise.

Antiphon 3
Lord, are you to wash my feet? Jesus said to him in answer:
If I do not wash your feet, you will have no share with me.
V. So he came to Simon Peter and Peter said to him:
—Lord.
V. What I am doing, you do not know for now,
but later you will come to know.
—Lord.

Jn 13: 6, 7, 8

mass of the lord’s supper

301

Antiphon 4	Cf. Jn 13: 14
If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
how much more should you wash each other’s feet?

Antiphon 5

Jn 13: 35

This is how all will know that you are my disciples:
if you have love for one another.
V. Jesus said to his disciples:
—This is how.

Antiphon 6

Jn 13: 34

I give you a new commandment,
that you love one another
as I have loved you, says the Lord.

Antiphon 7

1 Cor 13:13

Let faith, hope and charity, these three, remain among you,
but the greatest of these is charity.

V. Now faith, hope and charity, these three, remain;
but the greatest of these is charity.
—Let.
13.	After the Washing of Feet, the Priest washes and dries his hands, puts the chasuble back on,
and returns to the chair, and from there he directs the Universal Prayer.
The Creed is not said.

mass of the lord’s supper

303

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
14.	At the beginning of the Liturgy of the Eucharist, there may be a procession of the faithful in
which gifts for the poor may be presented with the bread and wine.
Meanwhile the following, or another appropriate chant, is sung.

Ant. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there.
V.	By the love of Christ we have been brought together:
V. let us find in him our gladness and our pleasure;
V. may we love him and revere him, God the living,
V. and in love respect each other with sincere hearts.
Ant. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there.
V. So when we as one are gathered all together,
V. let us strive to keep our minds free of division;
V. may there be an end to malice, strife and quarrels,
V. and let Christ our God be dwelling here among us.
Ant. Where true charity is dwelling, God is present there.
V. May your face thus be our vision, bright in glory,
V. 	Christ our God, with all the blessed Saints in heaven:
V. such delight is pure and faultless, joy unbounded,
V. which endures through countless ages world without end. Amen.
15.

Prayer over the Offerings

Grant us, O Lord, we pray,
that we may participate worthily in these mysteries,
for whenever the memorial of this sacrifice is celebrated
the work of our redemption is accomplished.
Through Christ our Lord.

17.

When the Roman Canon is used, this special form of it is said, with proper formulas for the
Communicantes (In communion with those), Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray), and
Qui pridie (On the day before he was to suffer).

18.	The Priest, with hands extended, says:

To you, therefore, most merciful Father,
we make humble prayer and petition
through Jesus Christ, your Son, our Lord:

Celebrant alone

He joins his hands and says:

that you accept
He makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying:

and bless X these gifts, these offerings,
these holy and unblemished sacrifices,
With hands extended, he continues:

which we offer you firstly
for your holy catholic Church.
Be pleased to grant her peace,
to guard, unite and govern her
throughout the whole world,
together with your servant N. our Pope
and N. our Bishop,*
and all those who, holding to the truth,
hand on the catholic and apostolic faith.

Mention may be made here of the Coadjutor Bishop, or Auxiliary Bishops, as noted in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal,
no. 149.

The Priest joins his hands and prays briefly for those for whom he intends to pray.

Remember, Lord, your servants N. and N.

Then, with hands extended, he continues:

and all gathered here,
whose faith and devotion are known to you.
For them we offer you this sacrifice of praise
or they offer it for themselves
and all who are dear to them:
for the redemption of their souls,
in hope of health and well-being,
and paying their homage to you,
the eternal God, living and true.

With hands extended, the Priest continues:

Therefore, Lord, we pray:
Celebrant alone
graciously accept this oblation of our service,
that of your whole family,
which we make to you
as we observe the day
on which our Lord Jesus Christ
handed on the mysteries of his Body and Blood
for his disciples to celebrate;
order our days in your peace,
and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation
and counted among the flock of those you have chosen.
He joins his hands.

(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
22.	Holding his hands extended over the offerings, he says:

Be pleased, O God, we pray,
to bless, acknowledge,
and approve this offering in every respect;
make it spiritual and acceptable,
so that it may become for us
the Body and Blood of your most beloved Son,
our Lord Jesus Christ.
He joins his hands.

Celebrant with

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

23.	In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly,
as the nature of these words requires.

On the day before he was to suffer
for our salvation and the salvation of all,
that is today,
He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

he took bread in his holy and venerable hands,
He raises his eyes.

and with eyes raised to heaven
to you, O God, his almighty Father,
giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
broke the bread
and gave it to his disciples, saying:
He bows slightly.

Take this, all of you, and eat of it,
for this is my Body,
which will be given up for you.
He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects
in adoration.
24.	After this, the Priest continues:

In a similar way, when supper was ended,
He takes the chalice and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

he took this precious chalice
in his holy and venerable hands,
and once more giving you thanks, he said the blessing
and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:
He bows slightly.

Take this, all of you, and drink from it,
for this is the chalice of my Blood,
the Blood of the new and eternal covenant,
which will be poured out for you and for many
for the forgiveness of sins.

Do this in memory of me.
He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration.

25.	Then he says:

The mystery of faith.

Celebrant alone

And the people continue, acclaiming:

We proclaim your Death, O Lord,
and profess your Resurrection
until you come again.
Or:

When we eat this Bread and drink this Cup,
we proclaim your Death, O Lord,
until you come again.
Or:

Save us, Savior of the world,
for by your Cross and Resurrection
you have set us free.
26.	Then the Priest, with hands extended, says:

Therefore, O Lord,
as we celebrate the memorial of the blessed Passion,
the Resurrection from the dead,
and the glorious Ascension into heaven
of Christ, your Son, our Lord,
we, your servants and your holy people,
offer to your glorious majesty
from the gifts that you have given us,
this pure victim,
this holy victim,
this spotless victim,
the holy Bread of eternal life
and the Chalice of everlasting salvation.
27.

Be pleased to look upon these offerings
with a serene and kindly countenance,
and to accept them,
as once you were pleased to accept
the gifts of your servant Abel the just,
the sacrifice of Abraham, our father in faith,
and the offering of your high priest Melchizedek,
a holy sacrifice, a spotless victim.

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

28.	Bowing, with hands joined, he continues:

In humble prayer we ask you, almighty God:
command that these gifts be borne
by the hands of your holy Angel
to your altar on high
in the sight of your divine majesty,
so that all of us, who through this participation at the altar
receive the most holy Body and Blood of your Son,
He stands upright and signs himself with the Sign of the Cross, saying:

may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing.
He joins his hands.

(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
29. 	Commemoration of the Dead
With hands extended, the Priest says:

Remember also, Lord, your servants N. and N.,
who have gone before us with the sign of faith
and rest in the sleep of peace.

Celebrant or one
concelebrant

He joins his hands and prays briefly for those who have died and for whom he intends
to pray.
Then, with hands extended he continues:

Grant them, O Lord, we pray,
and all who sleep in Christ,
a place of refreshment, light and peace.
He joins his hands.

(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)

31.	And he continues:

you continue to make all these good things, O Lord;
you sanctify them, fill them with life,
bless them, and bestow them upon us.
32.	He takes the chalice and the paten with the host and, elevating both, he says:
Celebrant alone or
Through him, and with him, and in him,
with
concelebrants
O God, almighty Father,

in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all honor and glory is yours,
for ever and ever.
The people acclaim:

Amen.
Then follows the Communion Rite, p. 663.

312

THURSDAY OF HOLY WEEK [HOLY THURSDAY]

33.	At an appropriate moment during Communion, the Priest entrusts the Eucharist from the
table of the altar to Deacons or acolytes or other extraordinary ministers, so that afterwards
it may be brought to the sick who are to receive Holy Communion at home.
34.

Communion Antiphon

1 Cor 11: 24-25

This is the Body that will be given up for you;
this is the Chalice of the new covenant in my Blood, says the Lord;
do this, whenever you receive it, in memory of me.
35.	After the distribution of Communion, a ciborium with hosts for Communion on the following
day is left on the altar. The Priest, standing at the chair, says the Prayer after Communion.
36.

Prayer after Communion

Grant, almighty God,
that, just as we are renewed
by the Supper of your Son in this present age,
so we may enjoy his banquet for all eternity.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.

mass of the lord’s supper

313

The Transfer of the Most Blessed Sacrament
37.	After the Prayer after Communion, the Priest puts incense in the thurible while standing,
blesses it and then, kneeling, incenses the Blessed Sacrament three times. Then, having put
on a white humeral veil, he rises, takes the ciborium, and covers it with the ends of the veil.
38.	A procession is formed in which the Blessed Sacrament, accompanied by torches and incense,
is carried through the church to a place of repose prepared in a part of the church or in a chapel
suitably decorated. A lay minister with a cross, standing between two other ministers with
lighted candles leads off. Others carrying lighted candles follow. Before the Priest carrying
the Blessed Sacrament comes the thurifer with a smoking thurible. Meanwhile, the hymn
Pange, lingua (exclusive of the last two stanzas) or another eucharistic chant is sung.
39.

When the procession reaches the place of repose, the Priest, with the help of the Deacon if
necessary, places the ciborium in the tabernacle, the door of which remains open. Then he
puts incense in the thurible and, kneeling, incenses the Blessed Sacrament, while Tantum
ergo Sacramentum or another eucharistic chant is sung. Then the Deacon or the Priest
himself places the Sacrament in the tabernacle and closes the door.

40.	After a period of adoration in silence, the Priest and ministers genuflect and return to the
sacristy.
41.	At an appropriate time, the altar is stripped and, if possible, the crosses are removed from the
church. It is expedient that any crosses which remain in the church be veiled.
42.	Vespers (Evening Prayer) is not celebrated by those who have attended the Mass of the Lord’s
Supper.
43.	The faithful are invited to continue adoration before the Blessed Sacrament for a suitable
length of time during the night, according to local circumstances, but after midnight the
adoration should take place without solemnity.
44.	If the celebration of the Passion of the Lord on the following Friday does not take place in the
same church, the Mass is concluded in the usual way and the Blessed Sacrament is placed in
the tabernacle.

FRIDAY OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD
[Good Friday]
1.	On this and the following day, by a most ancient tradition, the Church does not celebrate the
Sacraments at all, except for Penance and the Anointing of the Sick.
2.	On this day, Holy Communion is distributed to the faithful only within the celebration of
the Lord’s Passion; but it may be brought at any hour of the day to the sick who cannot
participate in this celebration.
3.	The altar should be completely bare: without a cross, without candles and without cloths.

The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord
4.	On the afternoon of this day, about three o’clock (unless a later hour is chosen for a pastoral
reason), there takes place the celebration of the Lord’s Passion consisting of three parts,
namely, the Liturgy of the Word, the Adoration of the Cross, and Holy Communion.
In the United States, if the size or nature of a parish or other community indicates the
pastoral need for an additional liturgical service, the Diocesan Bishop may permit the
service to be repeated later. This liturgy by its very nature may not, however, be celebrated
in the absence of a Priest.
5.	The Priest and the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, wearing red vestments as for Mass, go
to the altar in silence and, after making a reverence to the altar, prostrate themselves or, if
appropriate, kneel and pray in silence for a while. All others kneel.
6.	Then the Priest, with the ministers, goes to the chair where, facing the people, who are
standing, he says, with hands extended, one of the following prayers, omitting the invitation
Let us pray.

314

the passion of the lord

315

Prayer

Remember your mercies, O Lord,
and with your eternal protection sanctify your servants,
for whom Christ your Son,
by the shedding of his Blood,
established the Paschal Mystery.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or:

O God, who by the Passion of Christ your Son, our Lord,
abolished the death inherited from ancient sin
by every succeeding generation,
grant that just as, being conformed to him,
we have borne by the law of nature
the image of the man of earth,
so by the sanctification of grace
we may bear the image of the Man of heaven.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

First Part:
The Liturgy of the Word
7.	Then all sit and the First Reading, from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah (52: 13-53: 12), is read
with its Psalm.
8.	The Second Reading, from the Letter to the Hebrews (4: 14-16; 5: 7-9), follows, and then the
chant before the Gospel.
9.	Then the narrative of the Lord’s Passion according to John (18: 1–19: 42) is read in the same
way as on the preceding Sunday.
10.	After the reading of the Lord’s Passion, the Priest gives a brief homily and, at its end, the
faithful may be invited to spend a short time in prayer.

316

FRIDAY OF HOLY WEEK [GOOD FRIDAY]

The Solemn Intercessions
11.	The Liturgy of the Word concludes with the Solemn Intercessions, which take place in this
way: the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, or if he is not, a lay minister, stands at the ambo, and
sings or says the invitation in which the intention is expressed. Then all pray in silence for
a while, and afterwards the Priest, standing at the chair or, if appropriate, at the altar, with
hands extended, sings or says the prayer.
The faithful may remain either kneeling or standing throughout the entire period of
the prayers.
12. 	Before the Priest’s prayer, in accord with tradition, it is permissible to use the Deacon’s
invitations Let us kneel — Let us stand, with all kneeling for silent prayer.

Second Part:
The Adoration of the Holy Cross
14.	After the Solemn Intercessions, the solemn Adoration of the Holy Cross takes place. Of the
two forms of the showing of the Cross presented here, the more appropriate one, according
to pastoral needs, should be chosen.

The Showing of the Holy Cross
First Form
15.	The Deacon accompanied by ministers, or another suitable minister, goes to the sacristy,
from which, in procession, accompanied by two ministers with lighted candles, he carries
the Cross, covered with a violet veil, through the church to the middle of the sanctuary.
The Priest, standing before the altar and facing the people, receives the Cross, uncovers a
little of its upper part and elevates it while beginning the Ecce lignum Crucis (Behold the
wood of the Cross). He is assisted in singing by the Deacon or, if need be, by the choir. All
respond, Come, let us adore. At the end of the singing, all kneel and for a brief moment
adore in silence, while the Priest stands and holds the Cross raised.

Behold the wood of the Cross,
on which hung the salvation of the world.
R. Come, let us adore.
Then the Priest uncovers the right arm of the Cross and again, raising up the Cross, begins,
Behold the wood of the Cross and everything takes place as above.
Finally, he uncovers the Cross entirely and, raising it up, he begins the invitation Behold the
wood of the Cross a third time and everything takes place like the first time.

Second Form
16. 	The Priest or the Deacon accompanied by ministers, or another suitable minister, goes to
the door of the church, where he receives the unveiled Cross, and the ministers take lighted
candles; then the procession sets off through the church to the sanctuary. Near the door, in the
middle of the church and before the entrance of the sanctuary, the one who carries the Cross
elevates it, singing, Behold the wood of the Cross, to which all respond, Come, let us adore.
After each response all kneel and for a brief moment adore in silence, as above.

The Adoration of the Holy Cross
17.	Then, accompanied by two ministers with lighted candles, the Priest or the Deacon carries
the Cross to the entrance of the sanctuary or to another suitable place and there puts it
down or hands it over to the ministers to hold. Candles are placed on the right and left
sides of the Cross.
18.	For the Adoration of the Cross, first the Priest Celebrant alone approaches, with the chasuble
and his shoes removed, if appropriate. Then the clergy, the lay ministers, and the faithful
approach, moving as if in procession, and showing reverence to the Cross by a simple
genuflection or by some other sign appropriate to the usage of the region, for example, by
kissing the Cross.
19.	Only one Cross should be offered for adoration. If, because of the large number of people, it
is not possible for all to approach individually, the Priest, after some of the clergy and faithful
have adored, takes the Cross and, standing in the middle before the altar, invites the people
in a few words to adore the Holy Cross and afterwards holds the Cross elevated higher for a
brief time, for the faithful to adore it in silence.
20.

While the adoration of the Holy Cross is taking place, the antiphon Crucem tuam adoramus
(We adore your Cross, O Lord), the Reproaches, the hymn Crux fidelis (Faithful Cross) or other
suitable chants are sung, during which all who have already adored the Cross remain seated.

Ant. We adore your Cross, O Lord,
we praise and glorify your holy Resurrection,

joy has come to the whole world.
May God have mercy on us and bless us;
may he let his face shed its light upon us
and have mercy on us.

Cf. Ps 67 (66): 2

And the antiphon is repeated: We adore . . .

For our self-inflicted doom,

Blood and water, double warrant,
Issue from his wounded side,
Washing in a mighty torrent

Never was there such a scion,

Carries what the world has cost!

FRIDAY OF HOLY WEEK [GOOD FRIDAY]

The following conclusion is never to be omitted:
All:

Wisdom, power, and adoration
To the blessed Trinity
For redemption and salvation
Through the Paschal Mystery,
Now, in every generation,
And for all eternity. Amen.
In accordance with local circumstances or popular traditions and if it is pastorally appropriate,
the Stabat Mater may be sung, as found in the Graduale Romanum, or another suitable chant
in memory of the compassion of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
21.

When the adoration has been concluded, the Cross is carried by the Deacon or a minister to
its place at the altar. Lighted candles are placed around or on the altar or near the Cross.

Third Part:
Holy Communion
22.	A cloth is spread on the altar, and a corporal and the Missal put in place. Meanwhile the
Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself, putting on a humeral veil, brings the
Blessed Sacrament back from the place of repose to the altar by a shorter route, while all
stand in silence. Two ministers with lighted candles accompany the Blessed Sacrament and
place their candlesticks around or upon the altar.
When the Deacon, if a Deacon is present, has placed the Blessed Sacrament upon the
altar and uncovered the ciborium, the Priest goes to the altar and genuflects.
23. 	Then the Priest, with hands joined, says aloud:

At the Savior’s command
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:
The Priest, with hands extended says, and all present continue:

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Text with music, p. 663.
24.

With hands extended, the Priest continues alone:

the passion of the lord

337

Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,
that, by the help of your mercy,
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,
as we await the blessed hope
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
He joins his hands.
The people conclude the prayer, acclaiming:

For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours now and for ever.
Text with music, p. 664.
25.	Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly:

May the receiving of your Body and Blood,
Lord Jesus Christ,
not bring me to judgment and condemnation,
but through your loving mercy
be for me protection in mind and body
and a healing remedy.
26.	The Priest then genuflects, takes a particle, and, holding it slightly raised over the ciborium,
while facing the people, says aloud:

Behold the Lamb of God,
behold him who takes away the sins of the world.
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.
And together with the people he adds once:

Lord, I am not worthy
that you should enter under my roof,
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.
27.	And facing the altar, he reverently consumes the Body of Christ, saying quietly: May the
Body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life.
28.	He then proceeds to distribute Communion to the faithful. During Communion, Psalm 22
(21) or another appropriate chant may be sung.
29.

When the distribution of Communion has been completed, the ciborium is taken by the
Deacon or another suitable minister to a place prepared outside the church or, if circumstances
so require, it is placed in the tabernacle.

30.	Then the Priest says: Let us pray, and, after a period of sacred silence, if circumstances so
suggest, has been observed, he says the Prayer after Communion.

338

FRIDAY OF HOLY WEEK [GOOD FRIDAY]

Almighty ever-living God,
who have restored us to life
by the blessed Death and Resurrection of your Christ,
preserve in us the work of your mercy,
that, by partaking of this mystery,
we may have a life unceasingly devoted to you.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

31. 	For the Dismissal the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself, may say the invitation
Bow down for the blessing.
Then the Priest, standing facing the people and extending his hands over them, says this
Prayer over the People:

May abundant blessing, O Lord, we pray,
descend upon your people,
who have honored the Death of your Son
in the hope of their resurrection:
may pardon come,
comfort be given,
holy faith increase,
and everlasting redemption be made secure.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
32.	And all, after genuflecting to the Cross, depart in silence.
33.	After the celebration, the altar is stripped, but the Cross remains on the altar with two or four
candlesticks.
34.	Vespers (Evening Prayer) is not celebrated by those who have been present at the solemn
afternoon liturgical celebration.

HOLY SATURDAY
1.	On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord’s tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on
his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.
2.	The Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after
the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes
for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.
3.	Holy Communion may only be given on this day as Viaticum.

easter TIME

EASTER SUNDAY
OF THE RESURRECTION
OF THE LORD

THE EASTER VIGIL IN THE HOLY NIGHT
1.	By most ancient tradition, this is the night of keeping vigil for the Lord (Ex 12: 42), in which,
following the Gospel admonition (Lk 12: 35-37), the faithful, carrying lighted lamps in their
hands, should be like those looking for the Lord when he returns, so that at his coming he
may find them awake and have them sit at his table.
2.	Of this night’s Vigil, which is the greatest and most noble of all solemnities, there is to be
only one celebration in each church. It is arranged, moreover, in such a way that after the
Lucernarium and Easter Proclamation (which constitutes the first part of this Vigil), Holy
Church meditates on the wonders the Lord God has done for his people from the beginning,
trusting in his word and promise (the second part, that is, the Liturgy of the Word) until, as
day approaches, with new members reborn in Baptism (the third part), the Church is called
to the table the Lord has prepared for his people, the memorial of his Death and Resurrection
until he comes again (the fourth part).
3.	The entire celebration of the Easter Vigil must take place during the night, so that it begins
after nightfall and ends before daybreak on the Sunday.
4.	The Mass of the Vigil, even if it is celebrated before midnight, is a paschal Mass of the Sunday
of the Resurrection.
5.	Anyone who participates in the Mass of the night may receive Communion again at Mass
during the day. A Priest who celebrates or concelebrates the Mass of the night may again
celebrate or concelebrate Mass during the day.
The Easter Vigil takes the place of the Office of Readings.
6.	The Priest is usually assisted by a Deacon. If, however, there is no Deacon, the duties of his
Order, except those indicated below, are assumed by the Priest Celebrant or by a concelebrant.
The Priest and Deacon vest as at Mass, in white vestments.
7.	Candles should be prepared for all who participate in the Vigil. The lights of the church are
extinguished.

343

344

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

First Part:
The Solemn Beginning of the Vigil or Lucernarium
The Blessing of the Fire and Preparation of the Candle
8.	A blazing fire is prepared in a suitable place outside the church. When the people are gathered
there, the Priest approaches with the ministers, one of whom carries the paschal candle. The
processional cross and candles are not carried.
Where, however, a fire cannot be lit outside the church, the rite is carried out as in no. 13,
below.
9.	The Priest and faithful sign themselves while the Priest says: In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and then he greets the assembled people in the usual way
and briefly instructs them about the night vigil in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
on this most sacred night,
in which our Lord Jesus Christ
passed over from death to life,
the Church calls upon her sons and daughters,
scattered throughout the world,
to come together to watch and pray.
If we keep the memorial
of the Lord’s paschal solemnity in this way,
listening to his word and celebrating his mysteries,
then we shall have the sure hope
of sharing his triumph over death
and living with him in God.
10. 	Then the Priest blesses the fire, saying with hands extended:

Let us pray.
O God, who through your Son
bestowed upon the faithful the fire of your glory,
sanctify X this new fire, we pray,
and grant that,
by these paschal celebrations,
we may be so inflamed with heavenly desires,
that with minds made pure
we may attain festivities of unending splendor.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

the easter vigil

345

11.	After the blessing of the new fire, one of the ministers brings the paschal candle to the Priest,
who cuts a cross into the candle with a stylus. Then he makes the Greek letter Alpha above
the cross, the letter Omega below, and the four numerals of the current year between the
arms of the cross, saying meanwhile:
1.

Christ yesterday and today

2.

the Beginning and the End

3.

(he cuts a horizontal line);

the Alpha

(he cuts the letter Alpha above the vertical line);

4.

and the Omega

5.

All time belongs to him

6.

and all the ages

7.

8.

12.

(he cuts a vertical line);

(he cuts the letter Omega below the vertical line).
(he cuts the first numeral of the current year in
the upper left corner of the cross);

0

4

(he cuts the second numeral of the current year in
the upper right corner of the cross).

To him be glory and power

(he cuts the third numeral of the current year in
the lower left corner of the cross);

through every age and for ever. Amen.
(he cuts the fourth numeral of the current year in
the lower right corner of the cross).

When the cutting of the cross and of the other signs has been completed, the Priest may insert
five grains of incense into the candle in the form of a cross, meanwhile saying:

By his holy
2. and glorious wounds,
3. may Christ the Lord
4. guard us
5. and protect us. Amen.
1.

Where, because of difficulties that may occur, a fire is not lit, the blessing of fire is adapted
to the circumstances. When the people are gathered in the church as on other occasions, the
Priest comes to the door of the church, along with the ministers carrying the paschal candle.
The people, insofar as is possible, turn to face the Priest.
The greeting and address take place as in no. 9 above; then the fire is blessed and the
candle is prepared, as above in nos. 10-12.

346

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

14.	The Priest lights the paschal candle from the new fire, saying:

May the light of Christ rising in glory

As regards the preceding elements, Conferences of Bishops may also establish other forms
more adapted to the culture of the different peoples.

Procession
15.

When the candle has been lit, one of the ministers takes burning coals from the fire and
places them in the thurible, and the Priest puts incense into it in the usual way. The Deacon
or, if there is no Deacon, another suitable minister, takes the paschal candle and a procession
forms. The thurifer with the smoking thurible precedes the Deacon or other minister who
carries the paschal candle. After them follows the Priest with the ministers and the people,
all holding in their hands unlit candles.
At the door of the church the Deacon, standing and raising up the candle, sings:

& œ

Or:

& œ œ

347

The Priest lights his candle from the flame of the paschal candle.
16.	Then the Deacon moves forward to the middle of the church and, standing and raising up the
candle, sings a second time:

The Light of Christ.
And all reply:

Thanks be to God.
All light their candles from the flame of the paschal candle and continue in procession.
17.

When the Deacon arrives before the altar, he stands facing the people, raises up the candle
and sings a third time:

The Light of Christ.
And all reply:

Thanks be to God.
Then the Deacon places the paschal candle on a large candlestand prepared next to the
ambo or in the middle of the sanctuary.
And lights are lit throughout the church, except for the altar candles.

The Easter Proclamation
(Exsultet)
18.	Arriving at the altar, the Priest goes to his chair, gives his candle to a minister, puts incense
into the thurible and blesses the incense as at the Gospel at Mass. The Deacon goes to the
Priest and saying, Your blessing, Father, asks for and receives a blessing from the Priest, who
says in a low voice:

May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips,
that you may proclaim his paschal praise worthily and well,
in the name of the Father and of the Son, X and of the Holy Spirit.
The Deacon replies: Amen.
This blessing is omitted if the Proclamation is made by someone who is not a Deacon.
19.	The Deacon, after incensing the book and the candle, proclaims the Easter Proclamation
(Exsultet) at the ambo or at a lectern, with all standing and holding lighted candles in their
hands.
The Easter Proclamation may be made, in the absence of a Deacon, by the Priest himself
or by another concelebrating Priest. If, however, because of necessity, a lay cantor sings
the Proclamation, the words Therefore, dearest friends up to the end of the invitation are
omitted, along with the greeting The Lord be with you.
The Proclamation may also be sung in the shorter form (pp. 357-361).

let the trumpet of salvation
sound aloud our mighty King’s triumph!
Be glad, let earth be glad, as glory floods her,
ablaze with light from her eternal King,
let all corners of the earth be glad,
knowing an end to gloom and darkness.
Rejoice, let Mother Church also rejoice,
arrayed with the lightning of his glory,

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

(Therefore, dearest friends,
standing in the awesome glory of this holy light,
invoke with me, I ask you,
the mercy of God almighty,
that he, who has been pleased to number me,
though unworthy, among the Levites,
may pour into me his light unshadowed,
that I may sing this candle’s perfect praises).
(V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.)
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.
It is truly right and just,
with ardent love of mind and heart
and with devoted service of our voice,
to acclaim our God invisible, the almighty Father,
and Jesus Christ, our Lord, his Son, his Only Begotten.
Who for our sake paid Adam’s debt to the eternal Father,
and, pouring out his own dear Blood,
wiped clean the record of our ancient sinfulness.
These, then, are the feasts of Passover,
in which is slain the Lamb, the one true Lamb,
whose Blood anoints the doorposts of believers.
This is the night,
when once you led our forebears, Israel’s children,
from slavery in Egypt
and made them pass dry-shod through the Red Sea.
This is the night
that with a pillar of fire
banished the darkness of sin.

the easter vigil

This is the night
that even now, throughout the world,
sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices
and from the gloom of sin,
leading them to grace
and joining them to his holy ones.
This is the night,
when Christ broke the prison-bars of death
and rose victorious from the underworld.
Our birth would have been no gain,
had we not been redeemed.
O wonder of your humble care for us!
O love, O charity beyond all telling,
to ransom a slave you gave away your Son!
O truly necessary sin of Adam,
destroyed completely by the Death of Christ!
O happy fault
that earned so great, so glorious a Redeemer!
O truly blessed night,
worthy alone to know the time and hour
when Christ rose from the underworld!
This is the night
of which it is written:
The night shall be as bright as day,
dazzling is the night for me,
and full of gladness.
The sanctifying power of this night
dispels wickedness, washes faults away,
restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to mourners,
drives out hatred, fosters concord, and brings down the mighty.

355

356

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

On this, your night of grace, O holy Father,
accept this candle, a solemn offering,
the work of bees and of your servants’ hands,
an evening sacrifice of praise,
this gift from your most holy Church.
But now we know the praises of this pillar,
which glowing fire ignites for God’s honor,
a fire into many flames divided,
yet never dimmed by sharing of its light,
for it is fed by melting wax,
drawn out by mother bees
to build a torch so precious.
O truly blessed night,
when things of heaven are wed to those of earth,
and divine to the human.
Therefore, O Lord,
we pray you that this candle,
hallowed to the honor of your name,
may persevere undimmed,
to overcome the darkness of this night.
Receive it as a pleasing fragrance,
and let it mingle with the lights of heaven.
May this flame be found still burning
by the Morning Star:
the one Morning Star who never sets,
Christ your Son,
who, coming back from death’s domain,
has shed his peaceful light on humanity,
and lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.

Shorter Form of the Easter Proclamation

xult, let them exult, the hosts of heaven,
exult, let Angel ministers of God exult,
let the trumpet of salvation
sound aloud our mighty King’s triumph!
Be glad, let earth be glad, as glory floods her,
ablaze with light from her eternal King,
let all corners of the earth be glad,
knowing an end to gloom and darkness.
Rejoice, let Mother Church also rejoice,
arrayed with the lightning of his glory,
let this holy building shake with joy,
filled with the mighty voices of the peoples.
(V. The Lord be with you.
R. And with your spirit.)
V. Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R. It is right and just.

œ

362

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

It is truly right and just,
with ardent love of mind and heart
and with devoted service of our voice,
to acclaim our God invisible, the almighty Father,
and Jesus Christ, our Lord, his Son, his Only Begotten.
Who for our sake paid Adam’s debt to the eternal Father,
and, pouring out his own dear Blood,
wiped clean the record of our ancient sinfulness.
These then are the feasts of Passover,
in which is slain the Lamb, the one true Lamb,
whose Blood anoints the doorposts of believers.
This is the night,
when once you led our forebears, Israel’s children,
from slavery in Egypt
and made them pass dry-shod through the Red Sea.
This is the night
that with a pillar of fire
banished the darkness of sin.
This is the night
that which even now, throughout the world,
sets Christian believers apart from worldly vices
and from the gloom of sin,
leading them to grace
and joining them to his holy ones.
This is the night,
when Christ broke the prison-bars of death
and rose victorious from the underworld.
O wonder of your humble care for us!
O love, O charity beyond all telling,
to ransom a slave you gave away your Son!
O truly necessary sin of Adam,
destroyed completely by the Death of Christ!

the easter vigil

O happy fault
that earned so great, so glorious a Redeemer!
The sanctifying power of this night
dispels wickedness, washes faults away,
restores innocence to the fallen, and joy to mourners.
O truly blessed night,
when things of heaven are wed to those of earth
and divine to the human.
On this, your night of grace, O holy Father,
accept this candle, a solemn offering,
the work of bees and of your servants’ hands,
an evening sacrifice of praise,
this gift from your most holy Church
Therefore, O Lord,
we pray you that this candle,
hallowed to the honor of your name,
may persevere undimmed,
to overcome the darkness of this night.
Receive it as a pleasing fragrance,
and let it mingle with the lights of heaven.
May this flame be found still burning
by the Morning Star:
the one Morning Star who never sets,
Christ your Son,
who, coming back from death’s domain,
has shed his peaceful light on humanity,
and lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

Second Part:
The Liturgy of the Word
20.	In this Vigil, the mother of all Vigils, nine readings are provided, namely seven from the
Old Testament and two from the New (the Epistle and Gospel), all of which should be read
whenever this can be done, so that the character of the Vigil, which demands an extended
period of time, may be preserved.
21.

Nevertheless, where more serious pastoral circumstances demand it, the number of readings
from the Old Testament may be reduced, always bearing in mind that the reading of the
Word of God is a fundamental part of this Easter Vigil. At least three readings should be
read from the Old Testament, both from the Law and from the Prophets, and their respective
Responsorial Psalms should be sung. Never, moreover, should the reading of chapter 14 of
Exodus with its canticle be omitted.

22.	After setting aside their candles, all sit. Before the readings begin, the Priest instructs the
people in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
now that we have begun our solemn Vigil,
let us listen with quiet hearts to the Word of God.
Let us meditate on how God in times past saved his people
and in these, the last days, has sent us his Son as our Redeemer.
Let us pray that our God may complete this paschal work
of salvation
by the fullness of redemption.
23.	Then the readings follow. A reader goes to the ambo and proclaims the reading. Afterwards
a psalmist or a cantor sings or says the Psalm with the people making the response. Then all
rise, the Priest says, Let us pray and, after all have prayed for a while in silence, he says the
prayer corresponding to the reading. In place of the Responsorial Psalm a period of sacred
silence may be observed, in which case the pause after Let us pray is omitted.

the easter vigil

365

Prayers after the Readings
24.	After the first reading (On creation: Gn 1: 1–2: 2 or 1: 1, 26-31a) and the Psalm (104 [103] or 33 [32]).

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
who are wonderful in the ordering of all your works,
may those you have redeemed understand
that there exists nothing more marvelous
than the world’s creation in the beginning
except that, at the end of the ages,
Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or, On the creation of man:

O God, who wonderfully created human nature
and still more wonderfully redeemed it,
grant us, we pray,
to set our minds against the enticements of sin,
that we may merit to attain eternal joys.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
25.	After the second reading (On Abraham’s sacrifice: Gn 22: 1-18 or 1-2, 9a, 10-13, 15-18) and the
Psalm (16 [15]).

Let us pray.
O God, supreme Father of the faithful,
who increase the children of your promise
by pouring out the grace of adoption
throughout the whole world
and who through the Paschal Mystery
make your servant Abraham father of nations,
as once you swore,
grant, we pray,
that your peoples may enter worthily
into the grace to which you call them.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

366

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

26.	After the third reading (On the passage through the Red Sea: Ex 14: 15-15: 1) and its canticle
(Ex 15).

Let us pray.
O God, whose ancient wonders
remain undimmed in splendor even in our day,
for what you once bestowed on a single people,
freeing them from Pharaoh’s persecution
by the power of your right hand
now you bring about as the salvation of the nations
through the waters of rebirth,
grant, we pray, that the whole world
may become children of Abraham
and inherit the dignity of Israel’s birthright.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or:

O God, who by the light of the New Testament
have unlocked the meaning
of wonders worked in former times,
so that the Red Sea prefigures the sacred font
and the nation delivered from slavery
foreshadows the Christian people,
grant, we pray, that all nations,
obtaining the privilege of Israel by merit of faith,
may be reborn by partaking of your Spirit.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
27. 	After the fourth reading (On the new Jerusalem: Is 54: 5-14) and the Psalm (30 [29]).

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
surpass, for the honor of your name,
what you pledged to the Patriarchs by reason of their faith,
and through sacred adoption increase the children of
your promise,
so that what the Saints of old never doubted would come to pass
your Church may now see in great part fulfilled.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

the easter vigil

367

Alternatively, other prayers may be used from among those which follow the readings that
have been omitted.
28. 	After the fifth reading (On salvation freely offered to all: Is 55: 1-11) and the canticle (Is 12).

Let us pray.
Almighty ever-living God,
sole hope of the world,
who by the preaching of your Prophets
unveiled the mysteries of this present age,
graciously increase the longing of your people,
for only at the prompting of your grace
do the faithful progress in any kind of virtue.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
29. 	After the sixth reading (On the fountain of wisdom: Bar 3: 9-15, 31–4: 4) and the Psalm (19 [18]).

Let us pray.
O God, who constantly increase your Church
by your call to the nations,
graciously grant
to those you wash clean in the waters of Baptism
the assurance of your unfailing protection.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
30. 	After the seventh reading (On a new heart and new spirit: Ez 36: 16-28) and the Psalm (42-43
[41-42]).

Let us pray.
O God of unchanging power and eternal light,
look with favor on the wondrous mystery of the whole Church
and serenely accomplish the work of human salvation,
which you planned from all eternity;
may the whole world know and see
that what was cast down is raised up,
what had become old is made new,
and all things are restored to integrity through Christ,
just as by him they came into being.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
Or:

368

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

O God, who by the pages of both Testaments
instruct and prepare us to celebrate the Paschal Mystery,
grant that we may comprehend your mercy,
so that the gifts we receive from you this night
may confirm our hope of the gifts to come.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
31.	After the last reading from the Old Testament with its Responsorial Psalm and its prayer, the
altar candles are lit, and the Priest intones the hymn Gloria in excelsis Deo (Glory to God in
the highest), which is taken up by all, while bells are rung, according to local custom.

¿



32.

When the hymn is concluded, the Priest says the Collect in the usual way.

Let us pray.
O God, who make this most sacred night radiant
with the glory of the Lord’s Resurrection,
stir up in your Church a spirit of adoption,
so that, renewed in body and mind,
we may render you undivided service.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
33.	Then the reader proclaims the reading from the Apostle.
34.	After the Epistle has been read, all rise, then the Priest solemnly intones the Alleluia three
times, raising his voice by a step each time, with all repeating it. If necessary, the psalmist
intones the Alleluia.

Then the psalmist or cantor proclaims Psalm 118 (117) with the people responding Alleluia.
35.	The Priest, in the usual way, puts incense in the thurible and blesses the Deacon. At the
Gospel lights are not carried, but only incense.
36.	After the Gospel, the Homily, even if brief, is not to be omitted.

the easter vigil

369

Third Part:
Baptismal Liturgy
37.	After the Homily the Baptismal Liturgy begins. The Priest goes with the ministers to the
baptismal font, if this can be seen by the faithful. Otherwise a vessel with water is placed in
the sanctuary.
38.	Catechumens, if there are any, are called forward and presented by their godparents in
front of the assembled Church or, if they are small children, are carried by their parents and
godparents.
39.	Then, if there is to be a procession to the baptistery or to the font, it forms immediately. A
minister with the paschal candle leads off, and those to be baptized follow him with their
godparents, then the ministers, the Deacon, and the Priest. During the procession, the Litany
(no. 43) is sung. When the Litany is completed, the Priest gives the address (no. 40).
40.	If, however, the Baptismal Liturgy takes place in the sanctuary, the Priest immediately makes
an introductory statement in these or similar words.
If there are candidates to be baptized:

Dearly beloved,
with one heart and one soul, let us by our prayers
come to the aid of these our brothers and sisters in their
blessed hope,
so that, as they approach the font of rebirth,
the almighty Father may bestow on them
all his merciful help.

370

If the font is to be blessed, but no one is to be baptized:

& œ á

!"#$%&'()"&*+",-

Dearly beloved,
let us humbly invoke upon this font
the grace of God the almighty Father,
that those who from it are born anew
may be numbered among the children of adoption in Christ.
41.	The Litany is sung by two cantors, with all standing (because it is Easter Time) and responding.
If, however, there is to be a procession of some length to the baptistery, the Litany is
sung during the procession; in this case, those to be baptized are called forward before the
procession begins, and the procession takes place led by the paschal candle, followed by
the catechumens with their godparents, then the ministers, the Deacon, and the Priest. The
address should occur before the Blessing of Water.
42.	If no one is to be baptized and the font is not to be blessed, the Litany is omitted, and the
Blessing of Water (no. 54) takes place at once.
43.	In the Litany the names of some Saints may be added, especially the Titular Saint of the
church and the Patron Saints of the place and of those to be baptized.

If there are candidates to be baptized, the Priest, with hands extended, says the following
prayer:

Almighty ever-living God,
be present by the mysteries of your great love
and send forth the spirit of adoption
to create the new peoples
brought to birth for you in the font of Baptism,
so that what is to be carried out by our humble service
may be brought to fulfillment by your mighty power.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

46.	The Priest then blesses the baptismal water, saying the following prayer with hands extended:

O

God, who by invisible power
accomplish a wondrous effect
through sacramental signs
and who in many ways have prepared water, your creation,
to show forth the grace of Baptism;
O God, whose Spirit
in the first moments of the world’s creation
hovered over the waters,
so that the very substance of water
would even then take to itself the power to sanctify;
O God, who by the outpouring of the flood
foreshadowed regeneration,
so that from the mystery of one and the same element of water
would come an end to vice and a beginning of virtue;
O God, who caused the children of Abraham
to pass dry-shod through the Red Sea,
so that the chosen people,
set free from slavery to Pharaoh,
would prefigure the people of the baptized;

O God, whose Son,
baptized by John in the waters of the Jordan,
was anointed with the Holy Spirit,
and, as he hung upon the Cross,
gave forth water from his side along with blood,
and after his Resurrection, commanded his disciples:
“Go forth, teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,”
look now, we pray, upon the face of your Church
and graciously unseal for her the fountain of Baptism.
May this water receive by the Holy Spirit
the grace of your Only Begotten Son,
so that human nature, created in your image
and washed clean through the Sacrament of Baptism
from all the squalor of the life of old,
may be found worthy to rise to the life of newborn children
through water and the Holy Spirit.

378

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

And, if appropriate, lowering the paschal candle into the water either once or three times,
he continues:

May the power of the Holy Spirit,
O Lord, we pray,
come down through your Son
into the fullness of this font,
and, holding the candle in the water, he continues:

so that all who have been buried with Christ
by Baptism into death
may rise again to life with him.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
R. Amen.
47.	Then the candle is lifted out of the water, as the people acclaim:

Springs of water, bless the Lord;
praise and exalt him above all for ever.
48.	After the blessing of baptismal water and the acclamation of the people, the Priest, standing,
puts the prescribed questions to the adults and the parents or godparents of the children, as
is set out in the respective Rites of the Roman Ritual, in order for them to make the required
renunciation.
If the anointing of the adults with the Oil of Catechumens has not taken place beforehand,
as part of the immediately preparatory rites, it occurs at this moment.
49.	Then the Priest questions the adults individually about the faith and, if there are children
to be baptized, he requests the triple profession of faith from all the parents and godparents
together, as is indicated in the respective Rites.
Where many are to be baptized on this night, it is possible to arrange the rite so that,
immediately after the response of those to be baptized and of the godparents and the parents,
the Celebrant asks for and receives the renewal of baptismal promises of all present.
50.

When the interrogation is concluded, the Priest baptizes the adult elect and the children.

51.	After the Baptism, the Priest anoints the infants with chrism. A white garment is given to
each, whether adults or children. Then the Priest or Deacon receives the paschal candle from
the hand of the minister, and the candles of the newly baptized are lighted. For infants the
rite of Ephphetha is omitted.
52.	Afterwards, unless the baptismal washing and the other explanatory rites have occurred
in the sanctuary, a procession returns to the sanctuary, formed as before, with the newly
baptized or the godparents or parents carrying lighted candles. During this procession, the
baptismal canticle Vidi aquam (I saw water) or another appropriate chant is sung (no. 56).
53.	If adults have been baptized, the Bishop or, in his absence, the Priest who has conferred
Baptism, should at once administer the Sacrament of Confirmation to them in the sanctuary,
as is indicated in the Roman Pontifical or Roman Ritual.

The Blessing of Water
54.	If no one present is to be baptized and the font is not to be blessed, the Priest introduces the
faithful to the blessing of water, saying:

Text without music:

Dear brothers and sisters,
let us humbly beseech the Lord our God
to bless this water he has created,
which will be sprinkled upon us
as a memorial of our Baptism.
May he graciously renew us,
that we may remain faithful to the Spirit
whom we have received.
And after a brief pause in silence, he proclaims the following prayer, with hands extended:

L

ord our God,
in your mercy be present to your people
who keep vigil on this most sacred night,
and, for us who recall the wondrous work of our creation
and the still greater work of our redemption,
graciously bless this water.
For you created water to make the fields fruitful
and to refresh and cleanse our bodies.
You also made water the instrument of your mercy:
for through water you freed your people from slavery
and quenched their thirst in the desert;
through water the Prophets proclaimed the new covenant
you were to enter upon with the human race;
and last of all,
through water, which Christ made holy in the Jordan,
you have renewed our corrupted nature
in the bath of regeneration.
Therefore, may this water be for us
a memorial of the Baptism we have received,
and grant that we may share
in the gladness of our brothers and sisters,
who at Easter have received their Baptism.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

382

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

The Renewal of Baptismal Promises
55.

When the Rite of Baptism (and Confirmation) has been completed or, if this has not taken
place, after the blessing of water, all stand, holding lighted candles in their hands, and renew
the promise of baptismal faith, unless this has already been done together with those to be
baptized (cf. no. 49).
The Priest addresses the faithful in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters), through the Paschal Mystery
we have been buried with Christ in Baptism,
so that we may walk with him in newness of life.
And so, now that our Lenten observance is concluded,
let us renew the promises of Holy Baptism,
by which we once renounced Satan and his works
and promised to serve God in the holy Catholic Church.
And so I ask you:
Priest:
All:
Priest:
All:		
Priest:
All:		

Do you renounce Satan?
I do.
And all his works?
I do.
And all his empty show?
I do.

	Or:
Priest:

		
All:		
Priest:

		
All:		
Priest:

		
All:		

Do you renounce sin,
so as to live in the freedom of the children of God?
I do.
Do you renounce the lure of evil,
so that sin may have no mastery over you?
I do.
Do you renounce Satan,
the author and prince of sin?
I do.

the easter vigil

383

If the situation warrants, this second formula may be adapted by Conferences of Bishops
according to local needs.
Then the Priest continues:
Priest:

		
		
All:		
Priest:

		
		
		
		
All:		
Priest:

		
		
		
		
		
All:		

Do you believe in God,
the Father almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth?
I do.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
who was born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered death and was buried,
rose again from the dead
and is seated at the right hand of the Father?
I do.
Do you believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy Catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting?
I do.

And the Priest concludes:

And may almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has given us new birth by water and the Holy Spirit
and bestowed on us forgiveness of our sins,
keep us by his grace,
in Christ Jesus our Lord,
for eternal life.
All: Amen.
56.	The Priest sprinkles the people with the blessed water, while all sing:

Ant. I saw water flowing from the Temple,

from its right-hand side, alleluia;
and all to whom this water came were saved
and shall say: Alleluia, alleluia.

Another chant that is baptismal in character may also be sung.
57.

Meanwhile the newly baptized are led to their place among the faithful.
If the blessing of baptismal water has not taken place in the baptistery, the Deacon and
the ministers reverently carry the vessel of water to the font.
If the blessing of the font has not occurred, the blessed water is put aside in an appropriate
place.

58.	After the sprinkling, the Priest returns to the chair where, omitting the Creed, he directs the
Universal Prayer, in which the newly baptized participate for the first time.

the easter vigil

385

Fourth Part:
The Liturgy of the Eucharist
59.	The Priest goes to the altar and begins the Liturgy of the Eucharist in the usual way.
60.	It is desirable that the bread and wine be brought forward by the newly baptized or, if they
are children, by their parents or godparents.
61.

Prayer over the Offerings

Accept, we ask, O Lord,
the prayers of your people
with the sacrificial offerings,
that what has begun in the paschal mysteries
may, by the working of your power,
bring us to the healing of eternity.
Through Christ our Lord.
62.

Preface I of Easter: The Paschal Mystery (. . . on this night above all . . .), p. 558.

63.	In the Eucharistic Prayer, a commemoration is made of the baptized and their godparents in
accord with the formulas which are found in the Roman Missal and Roman Ritual for each of
the Eucharistic Prayers.
64.	Before the Ecce Agnus Dei (Behold the Lamb of God), the Priest may briefly address the
newly baptized about receiving their first Communion and about the excellence of this great
mystery, which is the climax of Initiation and the center of the whole of Christian life.
65.	It is desirable that the newly baptized receive Holy Communion under both kinds, together
with their godfathers, godmothers, and Catholic parents and spouses, as well as their lay
catechists. It is even appropriate that, with the consent of the Diocesan Bishop, where the
occasion suggests this, all the faithful be admitted to Holy Communion under both kinds.
66.

Communion Antiphon
Christ our Passover has been sacrificed;
therefore let us keep the feast
with the unleavened bread of purity and truth, alleluia.
Psalm 118 (117) may appropriately be sung.

67.

Prayer after Communion

Pour out on us, O Lord, the Spirit of your love,
and in your kindness make those you have nourished
by this paschal Sacrament
one in mind and heart.
Through Christ our Lord.

1 Cor 5: 7-8

SUNDAY OF THE RESURRECTION

Solemn Blessing

May almighty God bless you
through today’s Easter Solemnity
and, in his compassion,
defend you from every assault of sin.
R. Amen.
And may he, who restores you to eternal life
in the Resurrection of his Only Begotten,
endow you with the prize of immortality.
R. Amen.
Now that the days of the Lord’s Passion have drawn to a close,
may you who celebrate the gladness of the Paschal Feast
come with Christ’s help, and exulting in spirit,
to those feasts that are celebrated in eternal joy.
R. Amen.
And may the blessing of almighty God,
the Father, and the Son, X and the Holy Spirit,
come down on you and remain with you for ever.
R. Amen.
The final blessing formula from the Rite of Baptism of Adults or of Children may also be
used, according to circumstances.
69.

To dismiss the people the Deacon or, if there is no Deacon, the Priest himself sings
or says:

O God, who on this day,

have conquered death
and unlocked for us the path to eternity,
grant, we pray, that we who keep
the solemnity of the Lord’s Resurrection
may, through the renewal brought by your Spirit,
rise up in the light of life.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
The Creed is said.
However, in Easter Sunday Masses which are celebrated with a congregation, the rite of the
renewal of baptismal promises may take place after the Homily, according to the text used
at the Easter Vigil (p. 382). In that case the Creed is omitted.
73.

Prayer over the Offerings

Exultant with paschal gladness, O Lord,
we offer the sacrifice
by which your Church
is wondrously reborn and nourished.
Through Christ our Lord.

Jn 16: 14

PENTECOST SUNDAY
Solemnity

At the Vigil Mass
Extended form

This Vigil Mass may be celebrated on the Saturday evening, either before or after First Vespers
(Evening Prayer I) of Pentecost Sunday.
1. 	In churches where the Vigil Mass is celebrated in an extended form, this may be done as
follows.
2.

a) If First Vespers (Evening Prayer I) celebrated in choir or in common immediately precede
Mass, the celebration may begin either from the introductory verse and the hymn (Veni,
creator Spiritus) or else from the singing of the Entrance Antiphon with the procession and
greeting of the Priest; in either case the Penitential Act is omitted (cf. General Instruction of the
Liturgy of the Hours, nos. 94 and 96).
Then the Psalmody prescribed for Vespers follows, up to but not including the Short
Reading.
After the Psalmody, omitting the Penitential Act, and if appropriate, the Kyrie (Lord,
have mercy), the Priest says the prayer Grant, we pray, almighty God, that the splendor, as
at the Vigil Mass.

3.

b) If Mass is begun in the usual way, after the Kyrie (Lord, have mercy), the Priest says the
prayer Grant, we pray, almighty God, that the splendor, as at the Vigil Mass.
Then the Priest may address the people in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
we have now begun our Pentecost Vigil,
after the example of the Apostles and disciples,
who with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, persevered in prayer,
awaiting the Spirit promised by the Lord;
like them, let us, too, listen with quiet hearts to the Word of God.
Let us meditate on how many great deeds
God in times past did for his people
and let us pray that the Holy Spirit,
whom the Father sent as the first fruits for those who believe,
may bring to perfection his work in the world.
4.	Then follow the readings proposed as options in the Lectionary. A reader goes to the ambo
and proclaims the reading. Afterwards a psalmist or a cantor sings or says the Psalm with
the people making the response. Then all rise, the Priest says, Let us pray and, after all have
prayed for a while in silence, he says the prayer corresponding to the reading. In place of the
Responsorial Psalm a period of sacred silence may be observed, in which case the pause after
Let us pray is omitted.

447

448

EASTER TIME

Prayers after the Readings
5.	After the first reading (On Babel: Gn 11: 1-9) and the Psalm (33 [32]: 10-11, 12-13, 14-15; R. v. 12b).

Let us pray.
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that your Church may always remain that holy people,
formed as one by the unity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
which manifests to the world
the Sacrament of your holiness and unity
and leads it to the perfection of your charity.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
6.	After the second reading (On God’s Descent on Mount Sinai: Ex 19: 3-8, 16-20b) and the
canticle (Dn 3: 52, 53, 54, 55, 56; R. v. 52b) or the Psalm (19 [18]: 8, 9, 10, 11; R. Jn 6: 68c).

Let us pray.
O God, who in fire and lightning
gave the ancient Law to Moses on Mount Sinai
and on this day manifested the new covenant
in the fire of the Spirit,
grant, we pray,
that we may always be aflame with that same Spirit
whom you wondrously poured out on your Apostles,
and that the new Israel,
gathered from every people,
may receive with rejoicing
the eternal commandment of your love.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

7. 	After the third reading (On the dry bones and God’s spirit: Ez 37: 1-14) and the Psalm (107
[106]: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9; R. v. 1 or Alleluia).

Let us pray.
Lord, God of power,
who restore what has fallen
and preserve what you have restored,
increase, we pray, the peoples
to be renewed by the sanctification of your name,
that all who are washed clean by holy Baptism
may always be directed by your prompting.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or:

pour out upon us your Holy Spirit,
that, walking in oneness of faith,
we may attain in our flesh
the incorruptible glory of the resurrection.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

May your people exult for ever, O God,
in renewed youthfulness of spirit,
so that, rejoicing now in the restored glory of our adoption,
we may look forward in confident hope
to the rejoicing of the day of resurrection.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
8. 	After the fourth reading (On the outpouring of the Spirit: Joel 3: 1-5) and the Psalm (104 [103]:
1-2a, 24, 35c, 27-28, 29bc-30; R. v. 30 or Alleluia).

Let us pray.
Fulfill for us your gracious promise,
O Lord, we pray, so that by his coming
the Holy Spirit may make us witnesses before the world
to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
R. Amen.

Spiritus); then the Prayer after Communion is said and the rest follows as usual.

R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.

For, bringing your Paschal Mystery to completion,
you bestowed the Holy Spirit today
on those you made your adopted children
by uniting them to your Only Begotten Son.
This same Spirit, as the Church came to birth,
opened to all peoples the knowledge of God
and brought together the many languages of the earth
in profession of the one faith.
Therefore, overcome with paschal joy,
every land, every people exults in your praise
and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts,
sing together the unending hymn of your glory,
as they acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
When the Roman Canon is used, the proper form of the Communicantes (In communion
with those) is said.

Communion Antiphon	Acts 2: 4, 11
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit
and spoke of the marvels of God, alleluia.

O God, who bestow heavenly gifts upon your Church,

may gain her abundance of eternal redemption.
Through Christ our Lord.

With Easter Time now concluded, the paschal candle is extinguished. It is desirable to
keep the paschal candle in the baptistery with due honor so that it is lit at the celebration of
Baptism and the candles of those baptized are lit from it.
Where the Monday or Tuesday after Pentecost are days on which the faithful are obliged
or accustomed to attend Mass, the Mass of Pentecost Sunday may be repeated, or a Mass of
the Holy Spirit, pp. 1338-1345, may be said.

ORDINARY TIME

1.	Ordinary Time contains thirty-three or thirty-four weeks. It begins on the Monday following
the Sunday after January 6 and continues until the beginning of Lent; it begins again on the
Monday after Pentecost Sunday and ends on the Saturday before the First Sunday of Advent.
2.	The numbering of Sundays and weeks in Ordinary Time is calculated as follows:
a) 	The Sunday on which the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord occurs takes the place of
the first Sunday in Ordinary Time; the week that follows is counted as the first week
in Ordinary Time. The remaining Sundays and weeks are numbered in order until the
beginning of Lent.
b) 	If there are thirty-four weeks in Ordinary Time, after Pentecost the series is resumed
with the week that follows immediately the last week celebrated before Lent; it should
be noted, however, that the Masses of Pentecost Sunday and of the Solemnity of the
Most Holy Trinity take the place of the Sunday Masses. If, however, there are thirtythree weeks in Ordinary Time, the first week that would otherwise follow Pentecost is
omitted.
3.	Thus, in the Missal, thirty-four Masses for the Sundays and weekdays in Ordinary Time are
found. They are used in this way:
a) 	On Sundays the Mass corresponding to the number of the Sunday in Ordinary Time is
ordinarily used, unless there occurs a Solemnity or a Feast of the Lord which takes the
place of the Sunday.
b) 	On weekdays, however, any of the thirty-four Masses may be used, provided the
pastoral needs of the faithful are taken into consideration.
4.	The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) and the Creed are said on Sundays; on
weekdays, however, both are omitted.

V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For with your Only Begotten Son and the Holy Spirit
you are one God, one Lord:
not in the unity of a single person,
but in a Trinity of one substance.
For what you have revealed to us of your glory
we believe equally of your Son
and of the Holy Spirit,
so that, in the confessing of the true and eternal Godhead,
you might be adored in what is proper to each Person,
their unity in substance,
and their equality in majesty.
For this is praised by Angels and Archangels,
Cherubim, too, and Seraphim,
who never cease to cry out each day,
as with one voice they acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

Communion Antiphon	Gal 4: 6
Since you are children of God,
God has sent into your hearts the Spirit of his Son,
the Spirit who cries out: Abba, Father.

It is desirable that a procession take place after the Mass in which the Host to be carried in
the procession is consecrated. However, nothing prohibits a procession from taking place
even after a public and lengthy period of adoration following the Mass. If a procession takes
place after Mass, when the Communion of the faithful is over, the monstrance in which the
consecrated host has been placed is set on the altar. When the Prayer after Communion has
been said, the Concluding Rites are omitted and the procession forms.

THE SOLEMNITIES OF THE LORD

504

Text without music:

V. The Lord be with you.
R.	And with your spirit.
V.	Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For raised up high on the Cross,
he gave himself up for us with a wonderful love
and poured out blood and water from his pierced side,
the wellspring of the Church’s Sacraments,
so that, won over to the open heart of the Savior,
all might draw water joyfully from the springs of salvation.
And so, with all the Angels and Saints,
we praise you, as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
Communion Antiphon	Cf. Jn 7: 37-38
Thus says the Lord:
Let whoever is thirsty come to me and drink.
Streams of living water will flow
from within the one who believes in me.
Or:

One of the soldiers opened his side with a lance,
and at once there came forth blood and water.

Prayer after Communion

May this sacrament of charity, O Lord,
make us fervent with the fire of holy love,
so that, drawn always to your Son,
we may learn to see him in our neighbor.
Through Christ our Lord.

Jn 19: 34

Last Sunday in Ordinary Time

Our Lord Jesus Christ,
King of the Universe
Solemnity

Entrance Antiphon

Rev 5: 12; 1: 6

How worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
to receive power and divinity,
and wisdom and strength and honor.
To him belong glory and power for ever and ever.
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.

Collect

Almighty ever-living God,
whose will is to restore all things
in your beloved Son, the King of the universe,
grant, we pray,
that the whole creation, set free from slavery,
may render your majesty service
and ceaselessly proclaim your praise.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
The Creed is said.

Prayer over the Offerings

As we offer you, O Lord, the sacrifice
by which the human race is reconciled to you,
we humbly pray
that your Son himself may bestow on all nations
the gifts of unity and peace.
Through Christ our Lord.

For you anointed your Only Begotten Son,

so that, by offering himself on the altar of the Cross
as a spotless sacrifice to bring us peace,
he might accomplish the mysteries of human redemption
and, making all created things subject to his rule,
he might present to the immensity of your majesty
an eternal and universal kingdom,
a kingdom of truth and life,
a kingdom of holiness and grace,
a kingdom of justice, love and peace.

Communion Antiphon

509

Ps 29 (28): 10-11

The Lord sits as King for ever.
The Lord will bless his people with peace.

Prayer after Communion

Having received the food of immortality,
we ask, O Lord,
that, glorying in obedience
to the commands of Christ, the King of the universe,
we may live with him eternally in his heavenly Kingdom.
Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.

THE ORDER OF MASS

The Introductory Rites
1.

When the people are gathered, the Priest approaches the altar with the ministers while the
Entrance Chant is sung.
When he has arrived at the altar, after making a profound bow with the ministers, the
Priest venerates the altar with a kiss and, if appropriate, incenses the cross and the altar.
Then, with the ministers, he goes to the chair.
When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest and the faithful, standing, sign
themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest, facing the people, says:

Penitential Act*
4.	Then follows the Penitential Act, to which the Priest invites the faithful, saying:

& á

á

& á

œ

œ

œ œ œ

œ œ

Brethren (brothers and sisters), let us acknowledge our sins,
and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.
	A brief pause for silence follows. Then all recite together the formula of general confession:

I

confess to almighty God
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have greatly sinned,
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,

	And, striking their breast, they say:

through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault;
	Then they continue:

therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,
all the Angels and Saints,
and you, my brothers and sisters,
to pray for me to the Lord our God.
	The absolution by the Priest follows:

Meanwhile, if incense is used, the Priest puts some into the thurible. After this, the Deacon
who is to proclaim the Gospel, bowing profoundly before the Priest, asks for the blessing,
saying in a low voice:

Your blessing, Father.
	The Priest says in a low voice:

May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips,
that you may proclaim his Gospel worthily and well,
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, X and of the Holy Spirit.
	The Deacon signs himself with the Sign of the Cross and replies:

Amen.

	If, however, a Deacon is not present, the Priest, bowing before the altar, says quietly:

Cleanse my heart and my lips, almighty God,
that I may worthily proclaim your holy Gospel.

ministers with incense and candles. There he says:

	Then he kisses the book, saying quietly:

Through the words of the Gospel

Holydays of Obligation; on other days, it is recommended.
18.	At the end of the Homily, the Symbol or Profession of Faith or Creed, when prescribed, is
either sung or said:

The Order of Mass

	An alternate musical setting of the Creed may be found in Appendix I, pp. 1439-1441.

I

believe in one God,
the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.

I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God,
born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us men and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
	At the words that follow, up to and including and became man, all bow.

and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
and became man.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
to judge the living and the dead
and his kingdom will have no end.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.
I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
and the life of the world to come. Amen.

527

528

The Order of Mass

19.	Instead of the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, especially during Lent and Easter Time, the
baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’ Creed, may be used.

I

believe in God,
the Father almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,

	At the words that follow, up to and including the Virgin Mary, all bow.

who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried;
he descended into hell;
on the third day he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.
20.	Then follows the Universal Prayer, that is, the Prayer of the Faithful or Bidding Prayers.

The Order of Mass

529

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
21.

When all this has been done, the Offertory Chant begins. Meanwhile, the ministers place the
corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar.

22.	It is desirable that the faithful express their participation by making an offering, bringing
forward bread and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist and perhaps other gifts to relieve
the needs of the Church and of the poor.
23.	The Priest, standing at the altar, takes the paten with the bread and holds it slightly raised
above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice:

Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the bread we offer you:
fruit of the earth and work of human hands,
it will become for us the bread of life.
	Then he places the paten with the bread on the corporal.
	If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud; at the
end, the people may acclaim:

Blessed be God for ever.
24.	The Deacon, or the Priest, pours wine and a little water into the chalice, saying quietly:

By the mystery of this water and wine
may we come to share in the divinity of Christ
who humbled himself to share in our humanity.
25.	The Priest then takes the chalice and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands,
saying in a low voice:

Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the wine we offer you:
fruit of the vine and work of human hands,
it will become our spiritual drink.
	Then he places the chalice on the corporal.
	If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud; at the
end, the people may acclaim:

Blessed be God for ever.
26.	After this, the Priest, bowing profoundly, says quietly:

With humble spirit and contrite heart
may we be accepted by you, O Lord,
and may our sacrifice in your sight this day
be pleasing to you, Lord God.

530

The Order of Mass

27.	If appropriate, he also incenses the offerings, the cross, and the altar. A Deacon or other
minister then incenses the Priest and the people.
28.	Then the Priest, standing at the side of the altar, washes his hands, saying quietly:

Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.
29.

Standing at the middle of the altar, facing the people, extending and then joining his hands,
he says:

& á

á

& á

œ œ œ œ

Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters),
that my sacrifice and yours
may be acceptable to God,
the almighty Father.
	The people rise and reply:

30.	Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer over the Offerings, at the end of which
the people acclaim:

Amen.

THE EUCHARISTIC PRAYER
31.	Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer.

	The Priest, raising his hands, continues:

Lift up your hearts.
	The people:

We lift them up to the Lord.
	The Priest, with hands extended, adds:

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
	The people:

It is right and just.
	The Priest, with hands extended, continues the Preface.

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For he assumed at his first coming
the lowliness of human flesh,
and so fulfilled the design you formed long ago,
and opened for us the way to eternal salvation,
that, when he comes again in glory and majesty
and all is at last made manifest,
we who watch for that day
may inherit the great promise
in which now we dare to hope.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

For all the oracles of the prophets foretold him,
the Virgin Mother longed for him
with love beyond all telling,
John the Baptist sang of his coming
and proclaimed his presence when he came.
It is by his gift that already we rejoice
at the mystery of his Nativity,
so that he may find us watchful in prayer
and exultant in his praise.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For on the feast of this awe-filled mystery,
though invisible in his own divine nature,
he has appeared visibly in ours;
and begotten before all ages,
he has begun to exist in time;
so that, raising up in himself all that was cast down,
he might restore unity to all creation
and call straying humanity back to the heavenly Kingdom.
And so, with all the Angels, we praise you,
as in joyful celebration we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
When the Roman Canon is used, there is a proper Communicantes, p. 637. At the Vigil Mass
and the Mass during the Night of the Nativity of the Lord: Celebrating the most sacred
night, etc., is said, while Celebrating the most sacred day, etc., is then said throughout the
Octave of the Nativity of the Lord.

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,

For through him the holy exchange that restores our life
has shone forth today in splendor:
when our frailty is assumed by your Word
not only does human mortality receive unending honor
but by this wondrous union we, too, are made eternal.
And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For today you have revealed the mystery
of our salvation in Christ

you made us new by the glory of his immortal nature.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,

and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

For by your gracious gift each year
your faithful await the sacred paschal feasts
with the joy of minds made pure,
so that, more eagerly intent on prayer
and on the works of charity,
and participating in the mysteries
by which they have been reborn,
they may be led to the fullness of grace
that you bestow on your sons and daughters.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.

For through the saving Passion of your Son
the whole world has received a heart
to confess the infinite power of your majesty,
since by the wondrous power of the Cross
your judgment on the world is now revealed
and the authority of Christ crucified.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.
For the days of his saving Passion
and glorious Resurrection are approaching,
by which the pride of the ancient foe is vanquished
and the mystery of our redemption in Christ is celebrated.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
at all times to acclaim you, O Lord,
but (on this night / on this day / in this time) above all
to laud you yet more gloriously,
when Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.
For he is the true Lamb
who has taken away the sins of the world;
by dying he has destroyed our death,
and by rising, restored our life.
Therefore, overcome with paschal joy,
every land, every people exults in your praise
and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts,
sing together the unending hymn of your glory,
as they acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

When the Roman Canon is used, there is a proper Communicantes and a proper Hanc igitur,
as below, p. 637. In the Communicantes at the Easter Vigil, Celebrating the most sacred
night, etc. is said.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For the Lord Jesus, the King of glory,
conqueror of sin and death,
ascended (today) to the highest heavens,
as the Angels gazed in wonder.
Mediator between God and man,
judge of the world and Lord of hosts,
he ascended, not to distance himself from our lowly state
but that we, his members, might be confident of following
where he, our Head and Founder, has gone before.
Therefore, overcome with paschal joy,
every land, every people exults in your praise
and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts,
sing together the unending hymn of your glory,
as they acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

When the Roman Canon is used on the Ascension, there is a proper Communicantes, p. 637.

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For after his Resurrection
he plainly appeared to all his disciples
and was taken up to heaven in their sight,
that he might make us sharers in his divinity.
Therefore, overcome with paschal joy,
every land, every people exults in your praise
and even the heavenly Powers, with the angelic hosts,
sing together the unending hymn of your glory,
as they acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For through his Paschal Mystery,
he accomplished the marvelous deed,
by which he has freed us from the yoke of sin and death,
summoning us to the glory of being now called
a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
a holy nation, a people for your own possession,
to proclaim everywhere your mighty works,
for you have called us out of darkness
into your own wonderful light.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

For out of compassion for the waywardness that is ours,

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For we know it belongs to your boundless glory,
that you came to the aid of mortal beings with your divinity
and even fashioned for us a remedy out of mortality itself,
that the cause of our downfall
might become the means of our salvation,
through Christ our Lord.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim:

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.

For you so loved the world
that in your mercy you sent us the Redeemer,
to live like us in all things but sin,
so that you might love in us what you loved in your Son,
by whose obedience we have been restored to those gifts of yours
that, by sinning, we had lost in disobedience.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.

For, when your children were scattered afar by sin,
through the Blood of your Son and the power of the Spirit,
you gathered them again to yourself,
that a people, formed as one by the unity of the Trinity,
made the body of Christ and the temple of the Holy Spirit,
might, to the praise of your manifold wisdom,
be manifest as the Church.
And so, in company with the choirs of Angels,
we praise you, and with joy we proclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

PREFACE I OF THE MOST HOLY EUCHARIST
The Sacrifice and the Sacrament of Christ
60.	The following Preface is said in the Mass of the Lord’s Supper (text with music, p. 304). It
may also be said on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ (Corpus
Christi) and in Votive Masses of the Most Holy Eucharist.

V. The Lord be with you.
R.	And with your spirit.
V.	Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For he is the true and eternal Priest,
who instituted the pattern of an everlasting sacrifice
and was the first to offer himself as the saving Victim,
commanding us to make this offering as his memorial.
As we eat his flesh that was sacrificed for us,
we are made strong,
and, as we drink his Blood that was poured out for us,
we are washed clean.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
When the Roman Canon is used in the Mass of the Lord’s Supper, there is a proper
Communicantes, Hanc igitur and Qui pridie. For ease of use, the entire Canon has been
printed with these incorporated, pp. 635-643.

PREFACE II OF THE MOST HOLY EUCHARIST
The fruits of the Most Holy Eucharist
61.	The following Preface is said on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ
(Corpus Christi) and in Votive Masses of the Most Holy Eucharist (text with music, p. 500).

V. The Lord be with you.
R.	And with your spirit.
V.	Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For at the Last Supper with his Apostles,
establishing for the ages to come the saving memorial of the Cross,
he offered himself to you as the unblemished Lamb,
the acceptable gift of perfect praise.
Nourishing your faithful by this sacred mystery,
you make them holy, so that the human race,
bounded by one world,
may be enlightened by one faith
and united by one bond of charity.
And so, we approach the table of this wondrous Sacrament,
so that, bathed in the sweetness of your grace,
we may pass over to the heavenly realities here foreshadowed.
Therefore, all creatures of heaven and earth
sing a new song in adoration,
and we, with all the host of Angels,
cry out, and without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
and to praise, bless, and glorify your name
(on the Solemnity of the Motherhood /
on the feast day / on the Nativity / in veneration )
of the Blessed ever-Virgin Mary.
For by the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit
she conceived your Only Begotten Son,
and without losing the glory of virginity,
brought forth into the world the eternal Light,
Jesus Christ our Lord.
Through him the Angels praise your majesty,
Dominions adore and Powers tremble before you.
Heaven and the Virtues of heaven and the blessed Seraphim
worship together with exultation.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in humble praise, as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
to praise your mighty deeds in the exaltation of all the Saints,
and especially, as we celebrate the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
to proclaim your kindness as we echo her thankful hymn of praise.
For truly even to earth’s ends you have done great things
and extended your abundant mercy from age to age:
when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid,
you gave us through her the author of our salvation,
your Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
and rejoices in your presence for ever.
May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.

For you are praised in the company of your Saints
and, in crowning their merits, you crown your own gifts.
By their way of life you offer us an example,
by communion with them you give us companionship,
by their intercession, sure support,
so that, encouraged by so great a cloud of witnesses,
we may run as victors in the race before us
and win with them the imperishable crown of glory,
through Christ our Lord.
And so, with the Angels and Archangels,
and with the great multitude of the Saints,
we sing the hymn of your praise,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

For the blood of your blessed Martyr N.,

And so, with the Powers of heaven,
we worship you constantly on earth,
and before your majesty
without end we acclaim:

cry out, and without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

In him you have been pleased to renew all things,
giving us all a share in his fullness.
For though he was in the form of God, he emptied himself
and by the blood of his Cross brought peace to all creation.
Therefore he has been exalted above all things,
and to all who obey him,
has become the source of eternal salvation.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.

For just as through your beloved Son
you created the human race,
so also through him
with great goodness you formed it anew.
And so, it is right that all your creatures serve you,
all the redeemed praise you,
and all your Saints with one heart bless you.
Therefore, we, too, extol you with all the Angels,
as in joyful celebration we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

In him the hope of blessed resurrection has dawned,
that those saddened by the certainty of dying
might be consoled by the promise of immortality to come.
Indeed for your faithful, Lord,
life is changed not ended,
and, when this earthly dwelling turns to dust,
an eternal dwelling is made ready for them in heaven.
And so, with Angels and Archangels,
with Thrones and Dominions,
and with all the hosts and Powers of heaven,
we sing the hymn of your glory,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For even though by our own fault we perish,
yet by your compassion and your grace,
when seized by death according to our sins,
we are redeemed through Christ’s great victory,
and with him called back into life.
And so, with the Powers of heaven,
we worship you constantly on earth,
and before your majesty
without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

EUCHARISTIC PRAYER IV
116.	It is not permitted to change the Preface of this Eucharistic Prayer because of the structure of the
Prayer itself, which presents a summary of the history of salvation (text with music, p. 736).

V. The Lord be with you.
R.	And with your spirit.
V.	Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right to give you thanks,
truly just to give you glory, Father most holy,
for you are the one God living and true,
existing before all ages and abiding for all eternity,
dwelling in unapproachable light;
yet you, who alone are good, the source of life,
have made all that is,
so that you might fill your creatures with blessings
and bring joy to many of them by the glory of your light.

And so, in your presence are countless hosts of Angels,
who serve you day and night
and, gazing upon the glory of your face,
glorify you without ceasing.
With them we, too, confess your name in exultation,
giving voice to every creature under heaven,
as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

W

Celebrant alone
e give you praise, Father most holy,
for you are great
and you have fashioned all your works
in wisdom and in love.
You formed man in your own image
and entrusted the whole world to his care,
so that in serving you alone, the Creator,
he might have dominion over all creatures.
And when through disobedience he had lost your friendship,
you did not abandon him to the domain of death.
For you came in mercy to the aid of all,
so that those who seek might find you.
Time and again you offered them covenants
and through the prophets
taught them to look forward to salvation.

And you so loved the world, Father most holy,
that in the fullness of time
you sent your Only Begotten Son to be our Savior.
Made incarnate by the Holy Spirit
and born of the Virgin Mary,
he shared our human nature
in all things but sin.
To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation,
to prisoners, freedom,
and to the sorrowful of heart, joy.
To accomplish your plan,
he gave himself up to death,
and, rising from the dead,
he destroyed death and restored life.
And that we might live no longer for ourselves
but for him who died and rose again for us,
he sent the Holy Spirit from you, Father,
as the first fruits for those who believe,
so that, bringing to perfection his work in the world,
he might sanctify creation to the full.

For when the hour had come
for him to be glorified by you, Father most holy,
having loved his own who were in the world,
he loved them to the end:
and while they were at supper,
	He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

he took bread, blessed and broke it,

THE ORDER OF MASS
WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF
A SINGLE MINISTER

The Introductory Rites
1.	The Priest approaches the altar with the minister and after making a profound bow with the
minister, venerates the altar with a kiss and goes to the chair.
Then the minister or the Priest himself recites the Entrance Antiphon and the Priest and
the minister, standing, sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest, facing
the minister, says:

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
	The minister replies:

Amen.
2.	Then the Priest, facing the minister and extending his hands, greets him, saying:

The Lord be with you.
	The minister replies:

And with your spirit.
	Other formulas of greeting may also be used, as found in the Order of Mass (pp. 513-514).
3.	Then the Priest and the minister recite together the formula of general confession:

I confess to almighty God
and to you, my brother,
that I have greatly sinned,
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,
	And, striking their breast, they say:

through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault;
	Then they continue:

therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,
all the Angels and Saints,
and you, my brother,
to pray for me to the Lord our God.
	The absolution by the Priest follows:

May almighty God have mercy on us,
forgive us our sins,
and bring us to everlasting life.
	The minister replies:

Amen.
	Other formulas for the Penitential Act may also be used, as found in the Order of Mass (pp.
515-519).
747

748

excelsis (Glory to God in the highest).

When this hymn is concluded, the Priest, with hands joined, says:

Let us pray.
	After a moment of prayer in silence, he extends his hands and says the Collect prayer, at the
end of which the minister acclaims:

Amen.
The Liturgy of the Word
7.	Then the minister or the Priest himself reads the First Reading, the Psalm and the Second
Reading, if there is to be one, along with the other chant.
8.	Then the Priest, bowing profoundly before the altar, says quietly:

Cleanse my heart and my lips, almighty God,
that I may worthily proclaim your holy Gospel.
9.	After this, with hands joined, he says:

The Lord be with you.
	The minister replies:

And with your spirit.

Glory to you, O Lord.
	Then the Priest proclaims the Gospel, at the end of which he acclaims:

The Gospel of the Lord.

WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF A SINGLE MINISTER

749

	The minister replies:

Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.
	Then the Priest kisses the book, saying quietly:

Through the words of the Gospel
may our sins be wiped away.
10.

When it is prescribed, the Priest and the minister recite together the Symbol or Profession of
Faith or Creed.

11.	After this there may follow the Universal Prayer, that is, the Prayer of the Faithful or Bidding
Prayers. In it the Priest says the introduction and conclusion and the minister the intentions.

The Liturgy of the Eucharist
12.	The minister places the corporal, the purificator and the chalice on the altar, unless this was
already done at the beginning of Mass. The Priest goes to the middle of the altar.
Then the minister brings the paten with the bread, which the Priest takes and holds
slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying:

Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the bread we offer you:
fruit of the earth and work of human hands,
it will become for us the bread of life.
	Then he places the paten with the bread on the corporal.
	At the end, the minister may acclaim:

Blessed be God for ever.
14.	After this the Priest pours wine and a little water into the chalice, saying quietly:

By the mystery of this water and wine
may we come to share in the divinity of Christ
who humbled himself to share in our humanity.
15.	Then he takes the chalice and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying:

Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
for through your goodness we have received
the wine we offer you:
fruit of the vine and work of human hands,
it will become our spiritual drink.
	Then he places the chalice on the corporal.
	At the end, the minister may acclaim:

Blessed be God for ever.

750

THE ORDER OF MASS

16.	After this, the Priest, bowing profoundly, says quietly:

With humble spirit and contrite heart
may we be accepted by you, O Lord,
and may our sacrifice in your sight this day
be pleasing to you, Lord God.
17.	Then standing at the side of the altar, he washes his hands, saying quietly:

Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity
and cleanse me from my sin.
18.

Standing at the middle of the altar, facing the minister, extending and then joining his hands,
he says:

Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters),
that my sacrifice and yours
may be acceptable to God,
the almighty Father.
	The minister replies:

May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands
for the praise and glory of his name,
for our good
and the good of all his holy Church.
	Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer over the Offerings, at the end of
which the minister acclaims: Amen.
19.	Then the Priest says the Eucharistic Prayer, according to the norms indicated in each
Eucharistic Prayer (pp. 635-662 and 757-798).

The Communion Rite
20.	After the doxology at the end of the Eucharistic Prayer, and after the chalice and paten have
been set down, the Priest, with hands joined, says:

At the Savior’s command
and formed by divine teaching,
we dare to say:

WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF A SINGLE MINISTER

He extends his hands and, together with the minister, continues:

Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
21.

With hands extended, the Priest alone continues, saying:

Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,
that, by the help of your mercy,
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,
as we await the blessed hope
and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
	He joins his hands.
	The minister concludes the prayer, acclaiming:

For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours
now and for ever.
22.	Then the Priest, with hands extended, says aloud:

Lord Jesus Christ,
who said to your Apostles:
Peace I leave you, my peace I give you,
look not on our sins,
but on the faith of your Church,
and graciously grant her peace and unity
in accordance with your will.
	He joins his hands.

Who live and reign for ever and ever.
	The minister replies:

Amen.

751

752

THE ORDER OF MASS

23.	The Priest, facing the minister, extending and then joining his hands, adds:

The peace of the Lord be with you always.
	The minister replies:

And with your spirit.
	Then, if appropriate, the Priest gives the sign of peace to the minister.
24.	Then he takes the host and breaks it over the paten, while the minister says:

Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.
Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.
	The Priest places a small piece in the chalice, saying quietly:

May this mingling of the Body and Blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ
bring eternal life to us who receive it.
25.	Then the Priest, with hands joined, says quietly:

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,
who, by the will of the Father
and the work of the Holy Spirit,
through your Death gave life to the world,
free me by this, your most holy Body and Blood,
from all my sins and from every evil;
keep me always faithful to your commandments,
and never let me be parted from you.
Or:

May the receiving of your Body and Blood,
Lord Jesus Christ,
not bring me to judgment and condemnation,
but through your loving mercy
be for me protection in mind and body
and a healing remedy.

WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF A SINGLE MINISTER

753

26.	The Priest genuflects, takes the host and, holding it slightly raised above the paten or above
the chalice, while facing the minister, says aloud:

Behold the Lamb of God,
behold him who takes away the sins of the world.
Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.
	And together with the minister he adds once:

Lord, I am not worthy
that you should enter under my roof,
but only say the word
and my soul shall be healed.
	If the minister is not to receive Communion, the Priest, having taken up the host, immediately
says, Lord, I am not worthy, etc.
27.	The Priest then says quietly:

May the Body of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life.
	And he reverently consumes the Body of Christ.
	Then he takes the chalice and says quietly:

May the Blood of Christ
keep me safe for eternal life.
	And he reverently consumes the Blood of Christ.
28.

Meanwhile the minister recites the Communion Antiphon.

29.	After this, the Priest takes the paten and approaches the minister, if he is to receive Communion,
and raises a host slightly, showing it to the minister and saying:

The Body of Christ.
	The minister replies:

Amen.
	And receives Holy Communion.
30.	Then the Priest purifies the paten over the chalice and also the chalice itself. The chalice, paten,
corporal and purificator are taken by the minister to the credence table or left on the altar.
While he carries out the purification, the Priest says quietly:

What has passed our lips as food, O Lord,
may we possess in purity of heart,
that what has been given to us in time
may be our healing for eternity.
31. 	A sacred silence may be observed for a while.

754

THE ORDER OF MASS

32. 	Then, with hands joined, the Priest says:

Let us pray.
	After a brief pause for silence, unless silence has just been observed, he extends his hands
and says the Prayer after Communion, at the end of which the minister acclaims:

Amen.
The Concluding Rites
33.	Then the Priest, facing the minister and extending his hands, says:

The Lord be with you.
	The minister replies:

And with your spirit.
	The Priest blesses the minister, saying:

May almighty God bless you,
the Father, and the Son, X and the Holy Spirit.
	The minister replies:

Amen.
34.	Then the Priest venerates the altar with a kiss, and after making a profound bow with the
minister, he withdraws.

EUCHARISTIC PRAYERS
FOR RECONCILIATION
The Eucharistic Prayers for Reconciliation may be used in Masses in which the mystery of reconciliation
is conveyed to the faithful in a special way, as, for example, in the Masses for Promoting Harmony,
For Reconciliation, For the Preservation of Peace and Justice, In Time of War or Civil Disturbance, For
the Forgiveness of Sins, For Charity, of the Mystery of the Holy Cross, of the Most Holy Eucharist, of
the Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, as well as in Masses during Lent. Although these
Eucharistic Prayers have been provided with a proper Preface, they may also be used with other
Prefaces that refer to penance and conversion, as, for example, the Prefaces of Lent.

APPENDIX TO THE ORDER OF MASS

Text without music:
1.

V. The Lord be with you.
R. 	And with your spirit.
V. 	Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V. 	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just
that we should always give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For you do not cease to spur us on
to possess a more abundant life
and, being rich in mercy,
you constantly offer pardon
and call on sinners
to trust in your forgiveness alone.

Never did you turn away from us,
and, though time and again we have broken your covenant,
you have bound the human family to yourself
through Jesus your Son, our Redeemer,
with a new bond of love so tight
that it can never be undone.
Even now you set before your people
a time of grace and reconciliation,
and, as they turn back to you in spirit,
you grant them hope in Christ Jesus
and a desire to be of service to all,
while they entrust themselves
more fully to the Holy Spirit.
And so, filled with wonder,
we extol the power of your love,
and, proclaiming our joy
at the salvation that comes from you,
we join in the heavenly hymn of countless hosts,
as without end we acclaim:

EUCHARISTIC PRAYER FOR RECONCILIATION I

761

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
2.	The Priest, with hands extended, says:

You are indeed Holy, O Lord,
and from the world’s beginning
are ceaselessly at work,
so that the human race may become holy,
just as you yourself are holy.
3.

Celebrant alone

He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says:

Look, we pray, upon your people’s offerings
and pour out on them the power of your Spirit,

Celebrant
with concelebrants

	He joins his hands and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together,
saying:

that they may become the Body and X Blood
	He joins his hands.

of your beloved Son, Jesus Christ,
in whom we, too, are your sons and daughters.
Indeed, though we once were lost
and could not approach you,
you loved us with the greatest love:
for your Son, who alone is just,
handed himself over to death,
and did not disdain to be nailed for our sake
to the wood of the Cross.
But before his arms were outstretched between heaven and earth,
to become the lasting sign of your covenant,
he desired to celebrate the Passover with his disciples.

762

APPENDIX TO THE ORDER OF MASS

4.	In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly,
as the nature of these words requires.

As he ate with them,
He takes the bread and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

he took bread
and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
broke the bread and gave it to them, saying:
	He bows slightly.

take this, all of you, and eat of it,
for this is my body,
which will be given up for you.
	He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in
adoration.
5.	After this, he continues:

In a similar way, when supper was ended,
knowing that he was about to reconcile all things in himself
through his Blood to be shed on the Cross,
He takes the chalice and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:

he took the chalice, filled with the fruit of the vine,
and once more giving you thanks,
handed the chalice to his disciples, saying:

PROPER OF SAINTS

1.	The rank of the celebration, namely Solemnity, Feast, or Memorial, is indicated for each day.
If no other indication is given, the celebration is an Optional Memorial.
2.	For each Solemnity and Feast a complete proper Mass is provided. This is therefore said
as printed.
3.	As regards Memorials, the following are to be observed:
a) 	The proper texts proposed for certain days are always to be used.
b) Whenever there is a reference to a particular Common, the more appropriate texts should
be chosen according to the principles explained at the beginning of the Commons. The
page reference given in each case only indicates a text that is particularly suitable.
c) 	If, however, a reference is given to several Commons, one or other of them may be used,
with due regard for pastoral concerns; it is always allowed to exchange texts among
several Masses of the same Common.
For example, if a Saint is both a Martyr and a Bishop, either the Common of Martyrs
or the Common of Pastors (for Bishops) may be used.
d) Moreover, as well as the Commons that refer to a particular category of Saint (e.g., of
Martyrs, Virgins, Pastors, etc.), it is always permitted to use the texts from the Common
of Holy Men and Women, which refers to Sainthood in general.
e) 	The Prayers over the Offerings and after Communion, unless they are proper, are taken
either from the Common or from the current time of the liturgical year.
4.	The Masses contained in this Proper of Saints are also used as Votive Masses, with the
exception of Masses of the mysteries of the life of the Lord and of the Blessed Virgin Mary (cf.
General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 375) and also of Masses of certain Saints for whom
a special Votive Mass is provided. When Masses of the Proper of Saints are used as Votive
Masses, words in the prayers indicating the heavenly birthday or the Solemnity or Feast are
not used but are replaced by the word memorial or commemoration.

1.	At an appropriate hour, a gathering takes place at a smaller church or other suitable place
other than inside the church to which the procession will go. The faithful hold in their hands
unlighted candles.
2.	The Priest, wearing white vestments as for Mass, approaches with the ministers. Instead of
the chasuble, the Priest may wear a cope, which he leaves aside after the procession is over.
3.

While the candles are being lit, the following antiphon or another appropriate chant is sung.

4.

When the chant is concluded, the Priest, facing the people, says: In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Then the Priest greets the people in the usual way, and
next he gives an introductory address, encouraging the faithful to celebrate the rite of this
feast day actively and consciously. He may use these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
forty days have passed since we celebrated the joyful feast
of the Nativity of the Lord.
Today is the blessed day
when Jesus was presented in the Temple by Mary and Joseph.
Outwardly he was fulfilling the Law,
but in reality he was coming to meet his believing people.
Prompted by the Holy Spirit,
Simeon and Anna came to the Temple.
Enlightened by the same Spirit,
they recognized the Lord
and confessed him with exultation.
So let us also, gathered together by the Holy Spirit,
proceed to the house of God to encounter Christ.
There we shall find him
and recognize him in the breaking of the bread,
until he comes again, revealed in glory.
5.	After the address the Priest blesses the candles, saying, with hands extended:

Let us pray.
O God, source and origin of all light,
who on this day showed to the just man Simeon
the Light for revelation to the Gentiles,
we humbly ask that,
in answer to your people’s prayers,
you may be pleased to sanctify with your blessing X these candles,
which we are eager to carry in praise of your name,
so that, treading the path of virtue,
we may reach that light which never fails.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or:

817

O God, true light, who create light eternal,
spreading it far and wide,
pour, we pray, into the hearts of the faithful
the brilliance of perpetual light,
so that all who are brightened in your holy temple
by the splendor of these candles
may happily reach the light of your glory.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
He sprinkles the candles with holy water without saying anything, and puts incense into
the thurible for the procession.
6.	Then the Priest receives from the Deacon or a minister the lighted candle prepared for
him and the procession begins, with the Deacon announcing (or, if there is no Deacon, the
Priest himself):

8.	As the procession enters the church, the Entrance Antiphon of the Mass is sung. When the
Priest has arrived at the altar, he venerates it and, if appropriate, incenses it. Then he goes to
the chair, where he takes off the cope, if he used it in the procession, and puts on a chasuble.
After the singing of the hymn Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest), he says the
Collect as usual. The Mass continues in the usual manner.

Second Form: The Solemn Entrance
9.

Whenever a procession cannot take place, the faithful gather in church, holding candles
in their hands. The Priest, wearing white sacred vestments as for Mass, together with the
ministers and a representative group of the faithful, goes to a suitable place, either in front
of the church door or inside the church itself, where at least a large part of the faithful can
conveniently participate in the rite.

10.

When the Priest reaches the place appointed for the blessing of the candles, candles are lit
while the antiphon Behold, our Lord (no. 3) or another appropriate chant is sung.

11.	Then, after the greeting and address, the Priest blesses the candles, as above nos. 4-5; and then
the procession to the altar takes place, with singing (nos. 6-7). For Mass, what is indicated in
no. 8 above is observed.

At the Mass
Entrance Antiphon

Cf. Ps 48 (47): 10-11

Your merciful love, O God,
we have received in the midst of your temple.
Your praise, O God, like your name,
reaches the ends of the earth;
your right hand is filled with saving justice.
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.

Collect

Almighty ever-living God,

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.
In his Precursor, Saint John the Baptist,
we praise your great glory,
for you consecrated him for a singular honor
among those born of women.
His birth brought great rejoicing;
even in the womb he leapt for joy
at the coming of human salvation.
He alone of all the prophets
pointed out the Lamb of redemption.
And to make holy the flowing waters,
he baptized the very author of Baptism
and was privileged to bear him supreme witness
by the shedding of his blood.
And so, with the Powers of heaven,
we worship you constantly on earth,
and before your majesty
without end we acclaim:

as from these Commons.
2.	In the Common of Martyrs and in the Common of Holy Men and Women, all the prayers that
are given for men may also be used for women, with the necessary change of gender.

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,

always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
you made your Only Begotten Son

High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,
and by your wondrous design were pleased to decree
that his one Priesthood should continue in the Church.
For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood
the people he has made his own,
but with a brother’s kindness he also chooses men
to become sharers in his sacred ministry
through the laying on of hands.
They are to renew in his name
the sacrifice of human redemption,
to set before your children the paschal banquet,
to lead your holy people in charity,
to nourish them with the word
and strengthen them with the Sacraments.
As they give up their lives for you
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood
the people he has made his own,
but with a brother’s kindness he also chooses men
to become sharers in his sacred ministry
through the laying on of hands.
They are to renew in his name
the sacrifice of human redemption,
to set before your children the paschal banquet,
to lead your holy people in charity,
to nourish them with your word
and strengthen them with the Sacraments.
As they give up their lives for you
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

Preface: Christ, source of all ministry in the Church.

V. The Lord be with you.
R.	And with your spirit.
V.	Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.
For by the anointing of the Holy Spirit
you made your Only Begotten Son
High Priest of the new and eternal covenant,
and by your wondrous design were pleased to decree
that many ministries be exercised in the Church.
For Christ not only adorns with a royal priesthood
the people he has made his own,
but with a brother’s kindness he also chooses men
to become sharers in his sacred ministry
through the laying on of hands.
He chooses them to lead your holy people in charity,
to nourish them with the word
and strengthen them with the Sacraments.
As they give up their lives for you
and for the salvation of their brothers and sisters,
they strive to be conformed to the image of Christ himself
and offer you a constant witness of faith and love.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

Whenever Marriage is celebrated during Mass, this Ritual Mass is used, with the color white or

Although complete Mass formularies are given here for the sake of convenience, all texts,
especially the prayers and the Nuptial Blessing, may be exchanged, if appropriate, with others.

the following formulas:
a) In Eucharistic Prayer I, the proper form of the Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray) is
said. The words in parentheses may be omitted, if the occasion so suggests:

Therefore, Lord, we pray:
graciously accept this oblation of our service,
the offering of your servants N. and N.
and of your whole family,
who entreat your majesty on their behalf;
and as you have brought them to their wedding day,
so (gladden them with your gift of the children they desire and)
bring them in your kindness
to the length of days for which they hope.
(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
b) In Eucharistic Prayer II, after the words and all the clergy, the following is added:

To our departed brothers and sisters . . .
Nuptial Blessing
After the Our Father, the prayer Deliver us is omitted. The Priest, standing and facing the
bride and bridegroom, invokes upon them God’s blessing, and this is never omitted.
In the invitation, if one or both of the spouses will not be receiving Communion, the
words in parentheses are omitted. In the prayer, the words in parentheses may be omitted
if it seems that circumstances suggest it, for example, if the bride and bridegroom are

The bride and bridegroom approach the altar or, if appropriate, they remain at their

FOR THE CELEBRATION OF MARRIAGE

The Priest, with hands joined, calls upon those present to pray, saying:

Dear brothers and sisters,
let us humbly pray to the Lord
that on these his servants, now married in Christ,
he may mercifully pour out
the blessing of his grace
and make of one heart in love
(by the Sacrament of Christ’s Body and Blood)
those he has joined by a holy covenant.
And all pray in silence for a while.
Then the Priest, with hands extended over the bride and bridegroom, continues:

O

God, who by your mighty power
created all things out of nothing,
and, when you had set in place
the beginnings of the universe,
formed man and woman in your own image,
making the woman an inseparable helpmate to the man,
that they might no longer be two, but one flesh,
and taught that what you were pleased to make one
must never be divided;
O God, who consecrated the bond of Marriage
by so great a mystery
that in the wedding covenant you foreshadowed
the Sacrament of Christ and his Church;
O God, by whom woman is joined to man
and the companionship they had in the beginning
is endowed with the one blessing
not forfeited by original sin
nor washed away by the flood.
Look now with favor on these your servants,
joined together in Marriage,
who ask to be strengthened by your blessing.
Send down on them the grace of the Holy Spirit
and pour your love into their hearts,
that they may remain faithful in the Marriage covenant.

1181

1182

May the grace of love and peace
abide in your daughter N.,
and let her always follow the example of those holy women
whose praises are sung in the Scriptures.
May her husband entrust his heart to her,
so that, acknowledging her as his equal
and his joint heir to the life of grace,
he may show her due honor
and cherish her always
with the love that Christ has for his Church.
And now, Lord, we implore you:
may these your servants
hold fast to the faith and keep your commandments;
made one in the flesh,
may they be blameless in all they do;
and with the strength that comes from the Gospel,
may they bear true witness to Christ before all;
(may they be blessed with children,
and prove themselves virtuous parents,
who live to see their children’s children).
And grant that,
reaching at last together the fullness of years
for which they hope,
they may come to the life of the blessed
in the Kingdom of Heaven.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
The prayer Lord Jesus Christ is omitted, and The peace of the Lord is said immediately.
Then the bride and bridegroom and all present offer one another a sign, in keeping with
local customs, that expresses peace, communion and charity.

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,

Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For in him you have made a new covenant with your people,
so that, as you have redeemed man and woman

so in Christ you might make them partakers of divine nature
and joint heirs with him of heavenly glory.
In the union of husband and wife
you give a sign of Christ’s loving gift of grace,

into the wondrous design of your love.
And so, with the Angels and all the Saints,
we praise you, and without end we acclaim:

In the Eucharistic Prayers there are proper intercessions (pp. 1127-1128).

Let us pray to the Lord for this bride and groom,
who come to the altar as they begin their married life,
that (partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ)
they may always be bound together by love for one another.
And all pray in silence for a while.
Then the Priest, with hands extended over the bride and bridegroom, continues:

H

oly Father,
who formed man in your own image,
male and female you created them,
so that as husband and wife, united in body and heart,
they might fulfill their calling in the world;

O God, who, to reveal the great design you formed in your love,
willed that the love of spouses for each other
should foreshadow the covenant you graciously made with
your people,
so that, by fulfillment of the sacramental sign,
the mystical marriage of Christ with his Church
might become manifest
in the union of husband and wife among your faithful;
Graciously stretch out your right hand
over these your servants (N. and N.), we pray,
and pour into their hearts the power of the Holy Spirit.
Grant, O Lord,
that, as they enter upon this sacramental union,
they may share with one another the gifts of your love
and, by being for each other a sign of your presence,
become one heart and one mind.
May they also sustain, O Lord, by their deeds
the home they are forming
(and prepare their children
to become members of your heavenly household
by raising them in the way of the Gospel).

you might bestow a true image of your love.
For those you created out of charity
you call to the law of charity without ceasing
and grant them a share in your eternal charity.

And so, the Sacrament of holy Matrimony,

place and kneel.
The Priest, with hands joined, calls upon those present to pray, saying:

Let us humbly invoke by our prayers, dear brothers and sisters,
God’s blessing upon this bride and groom,
that in his kindness he may favor with his help
those on whom he has bestowed the Sacrament of Matrimony.
All pray in silence for a while.
Then the Priest, with hands extended over the bride and bridegroom, continues:

H

oly Father, maker of the whole world,
who created man and woman in your own image
and willed that their union be crowned with your blessing,
we humbly beseech you for these your servants,
who are joined today in the Sacrament of Matrimony.

May your abundant blessing, Lord,
come down upon this bride, N.,
and upon N., her companion for life,

set their hearts aflame from on high,
so that, living out together the gift of Matrimony,
they may (adorn their family with children

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

He is the unblemished flower,
who sprang from the root of the Virgin
and declared the pure of heart blessed,
teaching by his way of life the surpassing worth of chastity.
He chose always to hold fast to what is pleasing to you
and, becoming obedient for our sake even until death,
he willingly offered himself to you
as a perfect and a fragrant sacrifice.
He consecrated to a fuller service of your majesty
those who for love of you leave all earthly things
and promised they would find treasure in heaven.
And so, with the company of Angels and Saints,
we sing the hymn of your praise,
as without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
In the Eucharistic Prayers, the oblation of the professed is appropriately commemorated
according to the following formulas:

For Men:
a) In Eucharistic Prayer I, the proper form of the Hanc igitur (Therefore, Lord, we pray)
is said.

Therefore, Lord, we pray:
graciously accept this oblation of our service,
and of these your servants,
which we make to you on their profession day;
sanctify this offering in your mercy,
so that those who by your gift
have dedicated their lives to you today
may, at the glorious coming of your Son,
be admitted to the joy of the eternal Pasch.

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Father most holy.

For you have made the whole world a temple of your glory,
that your name might everywhere be extolled,
yet you allow us to consecrate to you
apt places for the divine mysteries.
And so, we dedicate joyfully to your majesty
this house of prayer, built by human labor.
Here is foreshadowed the mystery of the true Temple,
here is prefigured the heavenly Jerusalem.
For you made the Body of your Son, born of the tender Virgin,
the Temple consecrated to you,
in which the fullness of the Godhead might dwell.
You also established the Church as a holy city,
built upon the foundation of the Apostles,
with Christ Jesus himself the chief cornerstone:
a city to be built of chosen stones,
given life by the Spirit and bonded by charity,
where for endless ages you will be all in all
and the light of Christ will shine undimmed for ever.
Through him, O Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .

FOR THE DEDICATION OF A CHURCH AND AN ALTAR

When Mass is already celebrated regularly in the church, Eucharistic Prayer I or III is said with
this Preface.

Preface: From the mystery of the Temple of God, which is the Church.

V. The Lord be with you.
R.	And with your spirit.
V.	Lift up your hearts.
R. We lift them up to the Lord.
V.	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
R.	It is right and just.

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

For in this visible house that you have let us build
and where you never cease to show favor
to the family on pilgrimage to you in this place,
you wonderfully manifest and accomplish
the mystery of your communion with us.
Here you build up for yourself the temple that we are
and cause your Church, spread throughout the world,
to grow ever more and more as the Lord’s own Body,
till she reaches her fullness in the vision of peace,
the heavenly city of Jerusalem.
And so, with the countless ranks of the blessed,
in the temple of your glory we praise you,
we bless you and proclaim your greatness, as we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
Text with music, pp. 1033-1034.

Therefore, Lord, we pray:
graciously accept this oblation of our service,
and of these your servants,
who in a spirit of faith
have offered to you this church (in honor of N.)
and built it with tireless labor.
(Through Christ our Lord. Amen.)
b) In the intercessions of Eucharistic Prayer III, after the words the entire people you have
gained for your own, the following is said:

Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,
who dedicate this church to you:
may it be for your family a house of salvation
and a place for the celebration of your heavenly Sacraments.
Here may the Gospel of peace resound
and the sacred mysteries be celebrated,
so that your faithful,
formed by the word of life and by divine grace
on their pilgrim way through the earthly city,
may merit to reach the eternal Jerusalem.
There, in your compassion, O merciful Father,
gather to yourself all your children
scattered throughout the world.
To our departed brothers and sisters
and to all . . .
Communion Antiphon

Cf. Mt 21: 13; Lk 11: 10

in that house, everyone who asks receives,
and the one who seeks finds,
and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened (E.T. alleluia).
Or:

Like shoots of the olive,
may the children of the Church be gathered

festive color. The dedication of an altar, however, is not to take place during the Paschal Triduum,
on Ash Wednesday, on the weekdays of Holy Week, or on the Commemoration of All the Faithful
Departed (All Souls’ Day). On the Nativity of the Lord, on the Epiphany, on the Ascension, on
Pentecost Sunday, as well as on the Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter, the Mass of the day is
used, except for the Prayer over the Offerings and the Preface, which are intimately connected to
the rite itself.

Entrance Antiphon

Ps 84 (83): 10-11

Turn your eyes, our God, our shield,
and look on the face of your anointed one;
one day within your courts
is better than a thousand elsewhere (E.T. alleluia).
Or:

Ps 43 (42): 4

I will come to the altar of God,
to God who restores the joy of my youth (E.T. alleluia).
The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is said.

Collect

O God, who willed to draw all things
to your Son, lifted high on the altar of the Cross,
fill your Church, we pray, with heavenly grace
as she dedicates to you this altar,
the table at which you will plentifully nourish
the faithful you gather as one
and will shape day by day,
through the outpouring of the Spirit,
a people consecrated to yourself.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
The Creed is said; the Universal Prayer is omitted.

FOR THE DEDICATION OF A CHURCH AND AN ALTAR

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

Having become both the true Priest and the true oblation,
he has taught us to celebrate for ever
the memorial of the Sacrifice
that he himself offered to you on the altar of the Cross.
Therefore, Lord, your people have raised this altar,
which we dedicate to you with joyful praise.
Truly this is an exalted place,
where the sacrifice of Christ is ever offered in mystery,
where perfect praise is rendered to you
and redemption flows forth for us.
Here is prepared the table of the Lord,
where your children, fed by the Body of Christ,
are gathered into the one, the holy Church.
Here the faithful drink of your Spirit
from the streams that flow from Christ, the spiritual rock,
through whom they, too, become a holy oblation, a living altar.
And so, Lord, with all the Angels and Saints,
we, too, give you thanks, as in exultation we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
Communion Antiphon

Cf. Ps 84 (83): 4-5

The sparrow finds a home,
and the swallow a nest for her young:
by your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are they who dwell in your house,
for ever singing your praise (E.T. alleluia).
Or:

Like shoots of the olive,
may the children of the Church be gathered
around the table of the Lord (E.T. alleluia).

Cf. Ps 128 (127): 3

MASSES AND PRAYERS
FOR VARIOUS NEEDS
AND OCCASIONS

1.	This section groups together Masses and prayers for various intentions, which may be used
in many situations, and for various needs and occasions.
	The texts found in the first two parts may be used either in a Mass with the people or in
a Mass without the people. The texts collected in the third part may, in general, be used in
Masses celebrated without the people, unless at times a pastoral reason suggests otherwise.
2.	In case of some grave need, a corresponding Mass may be said on the instructions of the local
Ordinary or with his permission, on any day except on Solemnities, the Sundays of Advent,
Lent, and Easter, days within the Octave of Easter, the Commemoration of All the Faithful
Departed (All Souls’ Day), Ash Wednesday, and on the weekdays of Holy Week.
If, however, some real necessity or pastoral advantage requires it, in the judgment of the
rector of the church or the Priest celebrant himself, an appropriate Mass or a Collect may be
used in a celebration with the people even if on that day there occurs an Obligatory Memorial
or a weekday of Advent up to and including December 16, or a weekday of Christmas Time
from January 2 or a weekday of Easter Time after the Octave of Easter.
During Easter Time, Alleluia is added to the Entrance Antiphon and Communion
Antiphon, unless this would be not in accord with the sense.
3.	In a Mass for a weekday in Ordinary Time, the Priest may always use all the prayers of this
series, or even only the Collect, observing what is indicated in no. 1.
4.	As for the Eucharistic Prayer which may be used with formularies of the Masses for Various
Needs, see Appendix to the Order of Mass, p. 755.
5.	In certain Masses, the liturgical texts given for a man may be adapted for a woman, with
the necessary change of gender; in addition, those expressed in the plural may be used for
individuals, with the necessary change to the singular.
6.	These Masses may be said with the color proper to the day or the liturgical time or with
the color violet if they have a penitential character, see e.g., nos. 31, 33, 38 (cf. the General
Instruction, no. 347).

1355

I

t is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,

always and everywhere to give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
through Christ our Lord.

In his Precursor, Saint John the Baptist,
we praise your great glory,
for you consecrated him for a singular honor
among those born of women.
His birth brought great rejoicing;
even in the womb he leapt for joy
at the coming of human salvation.
He alone of all the prophets
pointed out the Lamb of redemption.
And to make holy the flowing waters,
he baptized the very author of Baptism
and was privileged to bear him supreme witness
by the shedding of his blood.
And so, with the Powers of heaven,
we worship you constantly on earth,
and before your majesty
without end we acclaim:
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts . . .
Text with music, pp. 880-881.

Communion Antiphon
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel!
He has visited his people and redeemed them.

Prayer after Communion

May the marvelous prayer of Saint John the Baptist
accompany us who have eaten our fill
at this sacrificial feast, O Lord,
and, since Saint John proclaimed your Son
to be the Lamb who would take away our sins,
may he now implore for us your favor.
Through Christ our Lord.

FOR THE FUNERAL OF A CHILD WHO DIED BEFORE BAPTISM

1379

F. For the Funeral of a Child
Who Died before Baptism
Should a child whom the parents wished to be baptized, die before Baptism, the Diocesan
Bishop, taking into consideration pastoral circumstances, may permit the funeral to be
celebrated in the home of the deceased child, or even according to the form of funeral rites

In funerals of this kind there should ordinarily be a Liturgy of the Word, as described in
the Roman Ritual. Nevertheless, if at times the celebration of Mass is judged opportune, the

Baptism is not obscured in the minds of the faithful.

God will wipe every tear from their eyes,
and there shall be no more death
or mourning, crying or pain,
for former things have passed away.

Collect

Receive the prayers of your faithful, Lord,
and grant that those you allow to be weighed down
by their longing for the child taken from them
may be raised up by faith to hope in your compassion.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
Or:

O God, searcher of hearts and most loving consoler,
who know the faith of these parents,
grant that, as they mourn their child,
now departed from this life,
they may be assured
that he (she) has been entrusted to your divine compassion.

APPENDIX I

THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
from the Roman Martyrology

The announcement of the Solemnity of the Nativity of the Lord from the Roman Martyrology draws
upon Sacred Scripture to declare in a formal way the birth of Christ. It begins with creation and
relates the birth of the Lord to the major events and personages of sacred and secular history. The
particular events contained in the announcement help pastorally to situate the birth of Jesus in
the context of salvation history.
This text, The Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, may be chanted or recited, most appropriately
on December 24, during the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours. It may also be chanted or
recited before the beginning of Christmas Mass during the Night. It may not replace any part of
the Mass.

APPENDIX I

Text without music:

The Twenty-fifth Day of December,
when ages beyond number had run their course
from the creation of the world,
when God in the beginning created heaven and earth,
and formed man in his own likeness;
when century upon century had passed
since the Almighty set his bow in the clouds after the Great Flood,
as a sign of covenant and peace;
in the twenty-first century since Abraham, our father in faith,
came out of Ur of the Chaldees;
in the thirteenth century since the People of Israel were led
by Moses
in the Exodus from Egypt;
around the thousandth year since David was anointed King;
in the sixty-fifth week of the prophecy of Daniel;
in the one hundred and ninety-fourth Olympiad;
in the year seven hundred and fifty-two
since the foundation of the City of Rome;
in the forty-second year of the reign of Caesar Octavian Augustus,
the whole world being at peace,
JESUS CHRIST, eternal God and Son of the eternal Father,
desiring to consecrate the world by his most loving presence,
was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
and when nine months had passed since his conception,
was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem of Judah, and
was made man:
The Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh.

APPENDIX II
RITE FOR THE BLESSING
AND SPRINKLING OF WATER
1.

On Sundays, especially in Easter Time, the blessing and sprinkling of water as a memorial
of Baptism may take place from time to time in all churches and chapels, even in Masses
anticipated on Saturday evenings.
	If this rite is celebrated during Mass, it takes the place of the usual Penitential Act at the
beginning of Mass.

2.	After the greeting, the Priest stands at his chair and faces the people. With a vessel containing
the water to be blessed before him, he calls upon the people to pray in these or similar words:

Dear brethren (brothers and sisters),
let us humbly beseech the Lord our God
to bless this water he has created,
which will be sprinkled on us
as a memorial of our Baptism.
May he help us by his grace
to remain faithful to the Spirit we have received.
And after a brief pause for silence, he continues with hands joined:

Almighty ever-living God,
who willed that through water,
the fountain of life and the source of purification,
even souls should be cleansed
and receive the gift of eternal life;
be pleased, we pray, to X bless this water,
by which we seek protection on this your day, O Lord.
Renew the living spring of your grace within us
and grant that by this water we may be defended
from all ills of spirit and body,
and so approach you with hearts made clean
and worthily receive your salvation.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or:

1453

1454

APPENDIX II

Almighty Lord and God,
who are the source and origin of all life,
whether of body or soul,
we ask you to X bless this water,
which we use in confidence
to implore forgiveness for our sins
and to obtain the protection of your grace
against all illness and every snare of the enemy.
Grant, O Lord, in your mercy,
that living waters may always spring up for our salvation,
and so may we approach you with a pure heart
and avoid all danger to body and soul.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Or, during Easter Time:

Lord our God,
in your mercy be present to your people’s prayers,
and, for us who recall the wondrous work of our creation
and the still greater work of our redemption,
graciously X bless this water.
For you created water to make the fields fruitful
and to refresh and cleanse our bodies.
You also made water the instrument of your mercy:
for through water you freed your people from slavery
and quenched their thirst in the desert;
through water the Prophets proclaimed the new covenant
you were to enter upon with the human race;
and last of all,
through water, which Christ made holy in the Jordan,
you have renewed our corrupted nature
in the bath of regeneration.
Therefore, may this water be for us
a memorial of the Baptism we have received,
and grant that we may share
in the gladness of our brothers and sisters
who at Easter have received their Baptism.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.

RITE FOR THE BLESSING AND SPRINKLING OF WATER

3.

1455

Where the circumstances of the place or the custom of the people suggest that the mixing of
salt be preserved in the blessing of water, the Priest may bless salt, saying:

We humbly ask you, almighty God:
be pleased in your faithful love to bless X this salt
you have created,
for it was you who commanded the prophet Elisha
to cast salt into water,
that impure water might be purified.
Grant, O Lord, we pray,
that, wherever this mixture of salt and water is sprinkled,
every attack of the enemy may be repulsed
and your Holy Spirit may be present
to keep us safe at all times.
Through Christ our Lord.
R. Amen.
Then he pours the salt into the water, without saying anything.
4.	Afterward, taking the aspergillum, the Priest sprinkles himself and the ministers, then the
clergy and people, moving through the church, if appropriate.
Meanwhile, one of the following chants, or another appropriate chant is sung.

Outside Easter Time
Antiphon 1 	Ps 51 (50): 9
Sprinkle me with hyssop, O Lord, and I shall be cleansed;
wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

Antiphon 2 	Ez 36: 25-26
I will pour clean water upon you,
and you will be made clean of all your impurities,
and I shall give you a new spirit, says the Lord.

Hymn 		
Cf. 1 Pt 1: 3-5

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who in his great mercy has given us new birth into a living hope
through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
into an inheritance that will not perish,
preserved for us in heaven
for the salvation to be revealed in the last time!

1456

APPENDIX II

During Easter Time
Antiphon 1

Cf. Ez 47: 1-2, 9

I saw water flowing from the Temple,
from its right-hand side, alleluia:
and all to whom this water came
were saved and shall say: Alleluia, alleluia.

Antiphon 2

Cf. Wis 3: 8; Ez 36: 25

On the day of my resurrection, says the Lord, alleluia,
I will gather the nations and assemble the kingdoms
and I will pour clean water upon you, alleluia.

Antiphon 3

Cf. Dn 3: 77, 79

You springs and all that moves in the waters,
sing a hymn to God, alleluia.

Antiphon 4

1 Pt 2: 9

O chosen race, royal priesthood, holy nation,
proclaim the mighty works of him
who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light, alleluia.

Antiphon 5
From your side, O Christ,
bursts forth a spring of water,
by which the squalor of the world is washed away
and life is made new again, alleluia.
5.

When he returns to his chair and the singing is over, the Priest stands facing the people and,
with hands joined, says:

May almighty God cleanse us of our sins,
and through the celebration of this Eucharist
make us worthy to share at the table of his Kingdom.
R. Amen.
6.	Then, when it is prescribed, the hymn Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is sung
or said.

Appendix III
Rite of DEPUTING a Minister
To Distribute Holy Communion
On a Single Occasion
1.	The Diocesan Bishop has the faculty to permit individual Priests exercising sacred duties
to depute a suitable member of the faithful to distribute Holy Communion with them on a
single occasion, in cases of real necessity.
2.

When one of the faithful is deputed to distribute Communion on a single occasion in such
cases, it is fitting that a mandate to do so should be conferred according to the following rite.

3.	After the Priest Celebrant himself has received the Sacrament in the usual way, the
extraordinary minister comes to the altar and stands before the Celebrant, who blesses him
or her with these words:

May the Lord X bless you,
so that at this Mass you may minister
the Body and Blood of Christ
to your brothers and sisters.
And he or she replies:

Amen.
4.	If the extraordinary minister is to receive the Most Holy Eucharist, the Priest gives Communion
to the minister. Then the Priest gives him or her the ciborium or vessel with the hosts or the
chalice and together they go to administer Communion to the faithful.

1457

APPENDIX IV
rite of Blessing a Chalice and A Paten
WITHIN Mass
1.

Since the chalice and paten are used for the offering and consecration of the bread and wine
and for communion, they are reserved exclusively and permanently for the celebration of the
Eucharist, and so become “sacred vessels.”

2.	The intention of reserving these vessels exclusively for the celebration of the Eucharist is
made manifest before the community of the faithful by a special blessing which is appropriate
to impart during Mass.
3.	Any Priest may bless a chalice and paten, provided these vessels have been made according
to the norms indicated above in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, nos. 327-332.
4.	If only a chalice or only a paten is to be blessed, the texts should be suitably adapted.
5.	After the reading of the word of God, a homily is given in which the Priest explains both the
biblical readings and the meaning of the blessing of a chalice and paten that are used in the
celebration of the Lord’s Supper.
6.

When the Universal Prayer is concluded, the ministers, or representatives of the community
presenting the chalice and paten, place these latter on the altar. Then the Priest moves to the
altar, while there is sung this antiphon:

Antiphon
The chalice of salvation I will raise,
and I will call on the name of the Lord.
Another appropriate chant may also be sung.
7.

When the singing is over, the Priest says:

Let us pray.

1458

Rite of blessing a chalice and a paten within mass

1459

And all pray in silence for a while. Then the Priest continues:

With joy, Lord God,
we place on your altar this chalice and paten
for the celebration of the sacrifice of the new covenant:
may the Body and Blood of your Son,
offered and received by means of these vessels,
make them holy.
Grant, we pray, O Lord,
that, celebrating the unblemished sacrifice,
we may be renewed by your Sacraments on earth
and endowed with your Spirit,
until with the Saints we come to delight in your banquet
in the Kingdom of Heaven.
Glory and honor to you for ever.
All reply:

Blessed be God for ever.
8.	The ministers then place the corporal on the altar. Some of the faithful carry forward bread,
wine, and water for the celebration of the Lord’s Sacrifice. The Priest puts the offerings on
the newly blessed paten and in the newly blessed chalice and offers them in the usual way.
Meanwhile, if appropriate, this antiphon with Psalm 115 is sung:

Antiphon
The chalice of salvation I will raise,
and I will offer a sacrifice of praise (E.T. alleluia).

Psalm 116 (115)
I trusted, even when I said,
“I am sorely afflicted,”
and when I said in my alarm,
“These people are all liars.”
(The antiphon is repeated)

How can I repay the Lord
for all his goodness to me?
The cup of salvation I will raise;
I will call on the name of the Lord.
(The antiphon is repeated)

1460

APPENDIX IV

My vows to the Lord I will fulfill
before all his people.
How precious in the eyes of the Lord
is the death of his faithful.
(The antiphon is repeated)

Your servant, Lord, your servant am I,
the son of your handmaid;
you have loosened my bonds.
A thanksgiving sacrifice I make;
I will call on the name of the Lord.
(The antiphon is repeated)

My vows to the Lord I will fulfill
before all his people,
in the courts of the house of the Lord,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.
(The antiphon is repeated)
Another appropriate chant may also be sung.
9.	After the prayer With humble spirit, it is appropriate for the Priest to incense the gifts and the
altar.
10.	According to the circumstances of the celebration, it is fitting that the faithful receive the
Blood of Christ from the newly blessed chalice.

PREPARATION FOR MASS

1481

Preparation for Mass
Prayer of Saint Ambrose

I draw near, loving Lord Jesus Christ,
to the table of your most delightful banquet
in fear and trembling,
a sinner, presuming not upon my own merits,
but trusting rather in your goodness and mercy.
I have a heart and body defiled by my many offenses,
a mind and tongue
over which I have kept no good watch.
Therefore, O loving God, O awesome Majesty,
I turn in my misery, caught in snares,
to you the fountain of mercy,
hastening to you for healing,
flying to you for protection;
and while I do not look forward to having you as Judge,
I long to have you as Savior.
To you, O Lord, I display my wounds,
to you I uncover my shame.
I am aware of my many and great sins,
for which I fear,
but I hope in your mercies,
which are without number.
Look upon me, then, with eyes of mercy,
Lord Jesus Christ, eternal King,
God and Man, crucified for mankind.
Listen to me, as I place my hope in you,
have pity on me, full of miseries and sins,
you, who will never cease
to let the fountain of compassion flow.
Hail, O Saving Victim,
offered for me and for the whole human race
on the wood of the Cross.
Hail, O noble and precious Blood,
flowing from the wounds
of Jesus Christ, my crucified Lord,
and washing away the sins of all the world.

1482

PREPARATION FOR MASS

Remember, Lord, your creature,
whom you redeemed by your Blood.
I am repentant of my sins,
I desire to put right what I have done.
Take from me, therefore, most merciful Father,
all my iniquities and sins,
so that, purified in mind and body,
I may worthily taste the Holy of Holies.
And grant that this sacred foretaste
of your Body and Blood
which I, though unworthy, intend to receive,
may be the remission of my sins,
the perfect cleansing of my faults,
the banishment of shameful thoughts,
and the rebirth of right sentiments;
and may it encourage
a wholesome and effective performance
of deeds pleasing to you
and be a most firm defense of body and soul
against the snares of my enemies.
Amen.

PREPARATION FOR MASS

1483

Prayer of Saint Thomas Aquinas

Almighty eternal God,
behold, I come to the Sacrament
of your Only Begotten Son,
our Lord Jesus Christ,
as one sick to the physician of life,
as one unclean to the fountain of mercy,
as one blind to the light of eternal brightness,
as one poor and needy to the Lord of heaven and earth.
I ask, therefore, for the abundance of your immense generosity,
that you may graciously cure my sickness,
wash away my defilement,
give light to my blindness,
enrich my poverty,
clothe my nakedness,
so that I may receive the bread of Angels,
the King of kings and Lord of lords,
with such reverence and humility,
such contrition and devotion,
such purity and faith,
such purpose and intention
as are conducive to the salvation of my soul.
Grant, I pray, that I may receive
not only the Sacrament of the Lord’s Body and Blood,
but also the reality and power of that Sacrament.
O most gentle God,
grant that I may so receive
the Body of your Only Begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
which he took from the Virgin Mary,
that I may be made worthy to be incorporated into his Mystical Body
and to be counted among its members.
O most loving Father,
grant that I may at last gaze for ever
upon the unveiled face of your beloved Son,
whom I, a wayfarer,
propose to receive now veiled under these species:
Who lives and reigns with you for ever and ever.
Amen.

1484

PREPARATION FOR MASS

Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary

O most blessed Virgin Mary,
Mother of tenderness and mercy,
I, a miserable and unworthy sinner,
fly to you with all the affection of my heart
and I beseech your motherly love,
that, as you stood by your most dear Son,
while he hung on the Cross,
so, in your kindness,
you may be pleased to stand by me, a poor sinner,
and all Priests who today are offering the Sacrifice
here and throughout the entire holy Church,
so that with your gracious help
we may offer a worthy and acceptable oblation
in the sight of the most high and undivided Trinity.
Amen.
Formula of Intent

My intention is to celebrate Mass
and to consecrate the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
according to the Rite of Holy Roman Church,
to the praise of almighty God
and all the Church triumphant,
for my good
and that of all the Church militant,
for all who have commended themselves to my prayers
in general and in particular,
and for the welfare of Holy Roman Church.
Amen.
May the almighty and merciful Lord
grant us joy with peace,
amendment of life,
room for true repentance,
the grace and consolation of the Holy Spirit
and perseverance in good works.
Amen.

Thanksgiving after Mass
Prayer of Saint Thomas Aquinas

I give you thanks,
Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
who have been pleased to nourish me,
a sinner and your unworthy servant,
with the precious Body and Blood
of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ:
this through no merits of mine,
but due solely to the graciousness of your mercy.
And I pray that this Holy Communion
may not be for me an offense to be punished,
but a saving plea for forgiveness.
May it be for me the armor of faith,
and the shield of good will.
May it cancel my faults,
destroy concupiscence and carnal passion,
increase charity and patience, humility and obedience
and all the virtues,
may it be a firm defense against the snares of all my enemies,
both visible and invisible,
the complete calming of my impulses,
both of the flesh and of the spirit,
a firm adherence to you, the one true God,
and the joyful completion of my life’s course.
And I beseech you to lead me, a sinner,
to that banquet beyond all telling,
where with your Son and the Holy Spirit
you are the true light of your Saints,
fullness of satisfied desire, eternal gladness,
consummate delight and perfect happiness.
Through Christ our Lord.
Amen.

that with your Saints I may praise you
for age upon age.
Amen.
Prayer of Self-Offering

Receive, Lord, my entire freedom.
Accept the whole of my memory,

Whatever I have or possess,
it was you who gave it to me;

to the guidance of your will.
Give me only love of you
together with your grace,
and I am rich enough
and ask for nothing more.
Amen.

Prayer to Our Lord Jesus Christ Crucified

Behold, O good and loving Jesus,
that I cast myself on my knees before you
and, with the greatest fervor of spirit,
I pray and beseech you to instill into my heart
ardent sentiments of faith, hope and charity,
with true repentance for my sins
and a most firm purpose of amendment.
With deep affection and sorrow
I ponder intimately
and contemplate in my mind your five wounds,
having before my eyes what the prophet David
had already put in your mouth about yourself, O good Jesus:
They have pierced my hands and my feet;
they have numbered all my bones (Ps 21: 17-18).

I believe, O Lord, but may I believe more firmly;

I sorrow, but may I sorrow more deeply.
I adore you as my first beginning;

By your wisdom direct me,
by your righteousness restrain me,
by your indulgence console me,
by your power protect me.
I offer you, Lord, my thoughts to be directed to you,
my words, to be about you,
my deeds, to respect your will,
my trials, to be endured for you.
I will whatever you will,
I will it because you will it,
I will it in the way you will it,
I will it for as long as you will it.
Lord, enlighten my understanding, I pray:
arouse my will,
cleanse my heart,
sanctify my soul.
May I weep for past sins,
repel future temptations,
correct evil inclinations,
nurture appropriate virtues.

O Mary, Virgin and Mother most holy,
behold, I have received your most dear Son,
whom you conceived in your immaculate womb,
brought forth, nursed and embraced most tenderly.
Behold him at whose sight
you used to rejoice and be filled with all delight;
him whom, humbly and lovingly,
once again I present
and offer him to you
to be clasped in your arms,
to be loved by your heart,
and to be offered up to the Most Holy Trinity
as the supreme worship of adoration,
for your own honor and glory
and for my needs and for those of the whole world.
I ask you therefore, most loving Mother:
entreat for me the forgiveness of all my sins
and, in abundant measure, the grace
of serving him in the future more faithfully,
and at the last, final grace,
so that with you I may praise him
for all the ages of ages.
Amen.
