[8]Pope Gregory II Commends Boniface to Charles Martel, December 722

1. To the glorious Lord, our son, Duke Charles.

Having learned, beloved son in Christ, that you are a man of deeply
religious feeling, we make known to you that our brother Boniface, who
now stands before you, a man of sterling faith and character, has been
consecrated bishop by us, and after being instructed in the teachings
of the Holy Apostolic See, over which by God's grace we preside, is
being sent to preach the faith to the peoples of Germany who dwell on
the eastern bank of the Rhine, some of whom are still steeped in the
efforts of paganism, while many more are plunged in the darkness of
ignorance.

For this reason we commend him without more ado to your kindness and
goodwill, begging you to help him in all his needs and to grant him
your constant protection against any who may stand in his way. Know for
certain that any favour bestowed on him is done for God, who on sending
His holy Apostles to convert the Gentiles said that any man who
received them received Him.

Instructed by us in the teachings of these Apostles, the bishop
aforesaid is now on his way to take up the work assigned to him.
