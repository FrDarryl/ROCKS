[8]Signum Magnum - The Great Sign, by Pope Paul VI, 13 May 1967

[9]official portrait of Pope Paul VI

1. To the Catholic Bishops of The
World, Venerable brothers, health and apostolic blessings.

Introduction

The great sign which the Apostle John saw in heaven, "a woman clothed
with the sun,"^[10]1 is interpreted by the sacred Liturgy,^[11]2 not
without foundation, as referring to the most blessed Mary, the mother
of all men by the grace of Christ the Redeemer.

The memory, venerable brothers, is still vivid in our mind of the great
emotion we felt in proclaiming the august Mother of God as the
spiritual Mother of the Church, that is to say, of all the faithful and
of the sacred pastors, as the crowning of the third session of the
Second Vatican Council, after having solemnly promulgated the Dogmatic
Constitution on the Church.^[12]3 Great also was the happiness of
numerous Council Fathers, as well as of the faithful, who were present
at the sacred rite in Saint Peter's basilica and of the entire
Christian people scattered throughout the world.

The memory came spontaneously to many minds of the first grandiose
triumph achieved by the humble "handmaid of the Lord"^[13]4 when the
Fathers from East and West, gathered in an æcumenical [14]Council at
Ephesus in the year 431 greeted Mary as "Theotokos" - genitrix of God.
The Christian population of the illustrious city associated themselves
with a jubilant impulse of faith with the exultance of the Fathers and
accompanied them with torchlights to their dwellings.

Oh! with how much maternal satisfaction the Virgin Mary must have
looked on the pastors and the faithful in that glorious hour of the
history of the Church, recognizing in the hymns of praise, raised in
honor principally of the Son and then in her own, the echo of the
prophetic canticle which she herself on the impulse of the Holy Spirit
had raised to the Most High:

  "My soul magnifies the Lord,.
  and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,.
  because He has regarded the lowliness of His handmaid;.
  for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed;.
  because He who is mighty has done great things for me.
  and holy is His name."^[15]5

On the occasion of the religious ceremonies which are taking place at
this time in honor of the Virgin Mother of God in Fatima, Portugal,
where she is venerated by countless numbers of the faithful for her
motherly and compassionate heart,^[16]6 we wish to call the attention
of all sons of the Church once more to the indissoluble link between
the spiritual motherhood of Mary, so amply illustrated in the
(council's) Dogmatic Constitution on the Church^[17]7 and the duties of
redeemed men toward her, the Mother of the Church.

Once it is acknowledged, by virtue of the numerous testimonies offered
by the sacred texts and by the holy Fathers and remembered in the
constitution mentioned above, that "Mary, the Mother of God and Mother
of the Redeemer"^[18]8 has been "united to Him by a close and
indissoluble tie"^[19]9 and that she has a most singular role in "the
mystery of the Incarnate Word and of the Mystical Body,"^[20]10 that is
to say, in "the economy of salvation,"^[21]11 it appears evident that
the Virgin is "rightly honored by the Church with a special
veneration,^[22]12 particularly liturgical,"^[23]13 not only as "the
most holy Mother of God, who took part in the mysteries of
Christ,"^[24]14 but also "as the Mother of the Church."^[25]15

Nor is it to be feared that liturgical reform, if put into practice
according to the formula "the law of faith must establish the law of
prayer"^[26]16 may be detrimental to the "wholly singular"
veneration^[27]17 due to the Virgin Mary for her prerogatives, first
among these being the dignity of the Mother of God. Nor is it to be
feared that the greater veneration, liturgical as well as private,
given to her may obscure or diminish "the adoration which is offered to
the Incarnate Word, as well as to the Father and to the Holy
Spirit."^[28]18

Accordingly, without wishing to restate here, venerable brothers, the
traditional doctrine of the Church regarding the function of the Mother
of God on the plane of salvation and her relations with the Church, we
believe that, if we dwell on the consideration of two truths which are
very important for the renewal of Christian life, we would be doing
something of great utility for the souls of the faithful.

PART I

The first truth is this: Mary is the Mother of the Church not only
because she is the Mother of Christ and His most intimate associate in
"the new economy when the Son of God took a human nature from her, that
He might in the mysteries of His flesh free man from sin,"^[29]19 but
also because "she shines forth to the whole community of the elect as a
model of the virtues."^[30]20 Indeed, just as no human mother can limit
her task to the generation of a new man but must extend it to the
function of nourishing and educating her offspring, thus the blessed
Virgin Mary, after participating in the redeeming sacrifice of the Son,
and in such an intimate way as to deserve to be proclaimed by Him the
Mother not only of His disciple John but - may we be allowed to affirm
it - of mankind which he in some way represents,^[31]21 now continues
to fulfill from heaven her maternal function as the cooperator in the
birth and development of divine life in the individual souls of
redeemed men. This is a most consoling truth which, by the free consent
of God the All-Wise, is an integrating part of the mystery of human
salvation; therefore it must be held as faith by all Christians.

But in what way does Mary cooperate in the growth of the members of the
Mystical Body in the life of grace? First of all, by her unceasing
prayers inspired by a most ardent charity. The Holy Virgin, in fact,
though rejoicing in the vision of the august Trinity, does not forget
her Son's advancing, as she herself did in the "pilgrimage of the
faith".^[32]22 Indeed, contemplating them in God and clearly seeing
their necessities, in communion with Jesus Christ, "who continues
forever and is therefore able at all times to intercede for
them,"^[33]23 she makes herself their Advocate, Auxiliatrix, Adjutrix
and Mediatrix.^[34]24 Of this intercession of hers for the People of
God with the Son, the Church has been persuaded, ever since the first
centuries, as testified to by this most ancient antiphon which, with
some slight difference, forms part of the liturgical prayer in the East
as well as in the West: "We seek refuge under the protection of your
mercies, oh Mother of God; do not reject our supplication in need but
save us from perdition, O you who alone are blessed."^[35]25 Nor should
anyone believe that the maternal intervention of Mary would prejudice
the predominant and irreplaceable efficacy of Christ, our Savior. On
the contrary, it draws its strength from the mediation of Christ of
which it is the luminous proof.^[36]26

But the cooperation of the Mother of the Church in the development of
the divine life of the souls does not come to an end with the appeal to
the Son. She exercises on redeemed men another influence: that of
example. An influence which is indeed most important, according to the
well-known axiom: "Verba movent, exempla trahunt" (Words move, examples
attract). In fact, just as the teachings of the parents become far more
efficacious if they are strengthened by the example of a life
conforming with the norms of human and Christian prudence, so the
sweetness and the enchantment emanating from the sublime virtues of the
immaculate Mother of God attract souls in an irresistible way to
imitation of the divine model, Jesus Christ, of whom she was the most
faithful image. Therefore the council declared: "The Church, devotedly
meditating on her and contemplating her in the light of the Word made
man, enters more intimately into the supreme mystery of the Incarnation
and becomes ever increasingly like her Spouse"^[37]27.

Furthermore, it is well to bear in mind that Mary's eminent sanctity
was not only a singular gift of divine liberality. It was also the
fruit of the continuous and generous cooperation of her free will in
the inner motions of the Holy Spirit. It is because of the perfect
harmony between divine grace and the activity of her human nature that
the Virgin rendered supreme glory to the Most Holy Trinity and became
the illustrious ornament of the Church, which thus greets her in sacred
Liturgy: "You are the glory of Jerusalem, the joy of Israel, the honor
of our people"^[38]28.

Let us then admire in the pages of the Gospel the testimonies of such
sublime harmony. Mary, as soon as she was reassured by the voice of the
Angel Gabriel that God had chosen her as the unblemished mother of His
only-begotten Son, unhesitatingly gave her consent to a work which
would have engaged all the energies of her fragile nature and declared:
"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy
word"^[39]29. From that moment, she consecrated all of herself to the
service not only of the heavenly Father and of the Word Incarnate, who
had become her Son, but also to all mankind, having clearly understood
that Jesus, in addition to saving his people from the slavery of sin,
would become the King of a messianic Kingdom, universal and
eternal^[40]30.

Therefore, the life of Joseph's pure spouse, who remained a virgin
"during childbirth and after childbirth" - as the Catholic Church has
always believed and professed^[41]31 and as was fitting for her who was
raised to the incomparable dignity of divine motherhood^[42]32 - was a
life of such perfect union with the Son that she shared in His joys,
sorrows and triumphs. And even after Christ had ascended to heaven she
remained united to Him by a most ardent love while she faithfully
fulfilled the new mission of spiritual Mother of the most beloved of
the disciples and of the nascent Church. It can be asserted that the
whole life of the humble handmaid of the Lord, from the moment when she
was greeted by the Angel, until her assumption in body and soul to
heavenly glory, was a life of loving service.

We, therefore, associating ourselves with the Evangelists, with the
Fathers and the Doctors of the Church, recalled in the dogmatic
constitution "Lumen gentium" (Chap. VIII), full of admiration,
contemplate Mary, firm in her faith, ready in her obedience, simple in
humility, exulting in praising the Lord, ardent in charity, strong and
constant in the fulfillment of her mission to the point of sacrificing
herself, in full communion of sentiments with her Son who immolated
Himself on the Cross to give men a new life.

Before such splendor of virtue, the first duty of all those who
recognize in the Mother of Christ the model of the Church, is to unite
themselves to her in giving thanks to the Most High for working great
things in Mary for the benefit of all mankind. But this is not enough.
It is also the duty of all the faithful to pay as tribute to the most
faithful handmaid of the Lord, a veneration of praise, of gratitude and
of love because, by a wise and mild divine provision, her free consent
and her generous cooperation in the designs of God had, and still have,
a great influence in the attainment of human salvation^[43]33.
Therefore every Christian must make Saint Anselm's prayer his own: "Oh,
glorious Lady, grant that through you we may deserve to ascend to
Jesus, your Son, who through you deigned to descend among us"^[44]34.

PART II. DEVOUT IMITATION OF THE VIRTUES OF THE MOST HOLY MARY

Neither the grace of the divine Redeemer, nor the powerful intercession
of His Mother and our spiritual Mother, nor yet her sublime sanctity,
could lead us to the port of salvation if we did not respond to them by
our persevering will to honor Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin with our
devout imitation of their sublime virtue.

It is therefore the duty of all Christians to imitate in a reverent
spirit the examples of goodness left to them by their heavenly Mother.
This, venerable brothers, is the other truth to which we are pleased to
call your attention and the attention of the faithful entrusted to your
pastoral care, that they may second with docility the exhortation of
the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council: "Let the faithful remember
that true devotion consists neither in fruitless and passing emotion,
nor in a certain vain credulity. Rather, it proceeds from true faith,
by which we are led to know the excellence of the Mother of God, and
are moved to a filial love toward our mother and to the imitation of
her virtues."^[45]35

Imitation of Jesus Christ is undoubtedly the regal way to be followed
to attain sanctity and reproduce in ourselves, according to our forces,
the absolute perfection of the heavenly Father. But while the Catholic
Church has always proclaimed a truth so sacrosanct, it has also
affirmed that imitation of the Virgin Mary, far from distracting the
souls from the faithful following of Christ, makes it more pleasant and
easier for them. For, since she had always done the will of God, she
was the first to deserve the praise which Christ addressed to His
disciples: "Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven, he is my
brother and sister and mother."^[46]36

The general norm "Through Mary to Jesus" is therefore valid also for
the imitation of Christ. Nevertheless, let our faith not be perturbed,
as if the intervention of a creature in every way similar to us, except
as regards sin, offended our personal dignity and prevented the
intimacy and immediacy of our relationships of adoration and friendship
with the Son of God. Let us rather recognize the "goodness and the love
of God the Savior,"^[47]37 who, condescending to our misery, so remote
from His infinite sanctity, wished to make it easier for us to imitate
it by giving us as a model the human person of His Mother. She, in
fact, among the human beings, offered the most shining example and the
closest to us, of that perfect obedience whereby we lovingly and
readily conform with the will of the eternal Father. Christ Himself, as
we well know, made this full closeness to the approval of the Father,
the supreme ideal of His human behavior, declaring: "I do always the
things that are pleasing to Him."^[48]38

If we then contemplate the Virgin of Nazareth in the halo of her
prerogative and of her virtues, we will see her shine before our eyes
as the "New Eve,"^[49]39 the exalted daughter of Sion, the summit of
the Old Testament and the dawn of the New, in which "the fullness of
time"^[50]40 was realized, which was preordained by God for the mission
in the world of His only-begotten Son. In truth, the Virgin Mary, more
than all the patriarchs and prophets, more than the "just" and "pious"
Simeon awaited and implored "the consolation of Israel ... the Christ
of the Lord"^[51]41 and then greeted His advent with the hymn of
"Magnificat" when He descended into her most chaste womb to take on our
flesh.

It is in Mary, therefore, that the Church of Christ indicates the
example of the worthiest way of receiving in our spirits the Word of
God, in accordance with the luminous sentence of Saint Augustine: "Mary
was therefore more blessed in receiving the faith in Christ than in
conceiving the flesh of Christ. Accordingly, maternal consanguinity
would not have benefited Mary if she had not felt more fortunate in
having Christ in her heart than in her womb."^[52]42 And it is still in
her that Christians can admire the example of how to fulfill, with
humility and at the same time with magnanimity, the mission which God
entrusts to each one in this world, in relation to his own salvation
and that of his fellow beings.

"Therefore, I beg you, be imitators of me as I am of Christ."^[53]43
These words, and with greater reason than the Apostle Paul to the
Christians of Corinth, can be addressed by the Mother of the Church to
the multitudes of the faithful, who, in a symphony of faith and love
with the generations of past centuries, acclaim her as blessed.^[54]44
It is an invitation which it is a duty to heed docilely.

And then a message of supreme utility seems today to reach the faithful
from her who is the Immaculate, the holy, the cooperator of the Son in
the work of restoration of supernatural life in souls.^[55]45 In fact,
in devoutly contemplating Mary they draw from her a stimulus for
trusting prayer, a spur to the practice of penance and to the holy fear
of God. Likewise, it is in this Marian elevation that they more often
hear echoing the words with which Jesus Christ announced the advent of
the Kingdom of heaven: "Repent and believe in the Gospel"^[56]46; and
His severe admonition: "Unless you repent you will all perish in the
same manner."^[57]47

Therefore, impelled by love and by the wish to placate God for the
offenses against His sanctity and His justice and, at the same time,
moved by trust in His infinite mercy, we must bear the sufferings of
the spirit and of the body that we may expiate our sins and those of
our fellow beings and so avoid the twofold penalty of "harm" and of
"sense," that is to say, the loss of God - the supreme good - and
eternal fire.^[58]48

What must stimulate the faithful even more to follow the examples of
the most holy Virgin is the fact that Jesus Himself, by giving her to
us as our Mother, has tacitly indicated her as the model to be
followed. It is, in fact, a natural thing that the children should have
the same sentiments of their mothers and should reflect their merits
and virtues. Therefore, as each one of us can repeat with Saint Paul:
"The Son of God loved me and gave Himself up for me,"^[59]49 so in all
trust he can believe that the divine Savior has left to him also, in
spiritual heritage, His Mother, with all the treasures of grace and
virtues with which He had endowed her, that she may pour them over us
through the influence of her powerful intercession and our willing
imitation. This is why Saint Bernard rightly affirms: "Coming to her
the Holy Spirit filled her with grace for herself; when the same Spirit
pervaded her again she became superabundant and redounding in grace for
us also."^[60]50

From what we have been illustrating in the light of the holy Gospel and
of the Catholic tradition, it appears evident that the spiritual
motherhood of Mary transcends space and time and belongs to the
universal history of the Church, since she has always been present in
the Church with her maternal assistance. Likewise the meaning of the
affirmation appears clear, which is so often repeated: our era may well
be called the Marian era. In fact, if it is true that, by an exalted
grace of the Lord, the providential role of the most holy Mary in the
history of salvation has been more deeply understood by the vast strata
of the Christian people, this, however, should not lead us to believe
that in past ages we had no intuition whatever of this truth or that
future ones will ignore it. In truth, all periods of the Church's
history have benefited and will benefit from the maternal presence of
the Mother of God because she will remain always indissolubly joined to
the mystery of the Mystical Body, of whose Head it was written: "Jesus
Christ is the same, yesterday and today, yes, and forever."^[61]51

Venerable brothers, the persuasion that the thought of the Church
regarding the veneration of praise, gratitude and love due to the most
blessed Virgin is in full accord with the doctrine of the holy Gospel,
as it was more precisely understood and explained by the tradition of
the East as well as of the West, stirs in our spirit the hope that this
pastoral exhortation of ours for an ever more fervid and more fruitful
Marian piety will be received with generous acceptance not only by the
faithful entrusted to your care, but also by those who, while not
enjoying full communion with the Catholic Church, nevertheless,
together with us, admire and venerate the handmaid of the Lord, the
Virgin Mary, Mother of the Son of God.

May the Immaculate Heart of Mary shine before the eyes of all
Christians as the model of perfect love toward God and toward our
fellow beings; may it lead them toward the Holy Sacraments by virtue of
which souls are cleansed from the stains of sin and are preserved from
it. May it also stimulate them to make reparation for the innumerable
offenses against the Divine Majesty. Lastly, may it shine like a banner
of unity and a spur to perfect the bonds of brotherhood among all
Christians in the bosom of the one Church of Jesus Christ, which
"taught by the Holy Spirit, honors her with filial affection and piety
as a most beloved mother."^[62]52

Since the 25th anniversary is recalled this year of the solemn
consecration of the Church and of mankind to Mary, the Mother of God,
and to her Immaculate Heart, by our predecessor of venerated memory,
Pius XII, on 31 October 1942 on the occasion of the broadcast message
to the Portuguese nation^[63]53 - a consecration which we ourself have
renewed on Nov. 21, 1964^[64]54 - we exhort all the sons of the Church
to renew personally their consecration to the Immaculate Heart of the
Mother of the Church and to bring alive this most noble act of
veneration through a life ever more consonant with the divine
will^[65]55 and in a spirit of filial service and of devout imitation
of their heavenly Queen.

Lastly, venerable brothers, we express the trust that, thanks to your
encouragement, the clergy and the Christian people entrusted to your
pastoral ministry will respond in a generous spirit to this exhortation
of ours so as to demonstrate toward the Virgin Mother of God a more
ardent piety and a firmer confidence. Meanwhile while we are comforted
by the certainty that the glorious Queen of Heaven and our most sweet
Mother will never cease to assist all and each one of her sons and will
never withdraw from the entire Church of Christ her heavenly patronage,
to you yourselves and to your faithful, as a pledge of divine favors
and as a sign of our benevolence, we wholeheartedly impart the
apostolic blessing.

the year 1967, the fourth of our pontificate.
