BENEDICT XVI

APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION

ANGLICANORUM COETIBUS

PROVIDING FOR PERSONAL ORDINARIATES FOR ANGLICANS
ENTERING INTO FULL COMMUNION
WITH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

In recent times the Holy Spirit has moved groups of Anglicans to
petition repeatedly and insistently to be received into full Catholic
communion individually as well as corporately. The Apostolic See has
responded favourably to such petitions. Indeed, the successor of Peter,
mandated by the Lord Jesus to guarantee the unity of the episcopate and
to preside over and safeguard the universal communion of all the
Churches,[20][1] could not fail to make available the means necessary
to bring this holy desire to realization.

The Church, a people gathered into the unity of the Father, the Son and
the Holy Spirit,[21][2] was instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, as "a
sacrament - a sign and instrument, that is, of communion with God and
of unity among all people."[22][3] Every division among the baptized in
Jesus Christ wounds that which the Church is and that for which the
Church exists; in fact, "such division openly contradicts the will of
Christ, scandalizes the world, and damages that most holy cause, the
preaching the Gospel to every creature."[23][4] Precisely for this
reason, before shedding his blood for the salvation of the world, the
Lord Jesus prayed to the Father for the unity of his disciples.[24][5]

It is the Holy Spirit, the principle of unity, which establishes the
Church as a communion.[25][6] He is the principle of the unity of the
faithful in the teaching of the Apostles, in the breaking of the bread
and in prayer.[26][7] The Church, however, analogous to the mystery of
the Incarnate Word, is not only an invisible spiritual communion, but
is also visible;[27][8] in fact, "the society structured with
hierarchical organs and the Mystical Body of Christ, the visible
society and the spiritual community, the earthly Church and the Church
endowed with heavenly riches, are not to be thought of as two
realities. On the contrary, they form one complex reality formed from a
two-fold element, human and divine."[28][9] The communion of the
baptized in the teaching of the Apostles and in the breaking of the
eucharistic bread is visibly manifested in the bonds of the profession
of the faith in its entirety, of the celebration of all of the
sacraments instituted by Christ, and of the governance of the College
of Bishops united with its head, the Roman Pontiff.[29][10]

This single Church of Christ, which we profess in the Creed as one,
holy, catholic and apostolic "subsists in the Catholic Church, which is
governed by the successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with
him. Nevertheless, many elements of sanctification and of truth are
found outside her visible confines. Since these are gifts properly
belonging to the Church of Christ, they are forces impelling towards
Catholic unity."[30][11]

In the light of these ecclesiological principles, this Apostolic
Constitution provides the general normative structure for regulating
the institution and life of Personal Ordinariates for those Anglican
faithful who desire to enter into the full communion of the Catholic
Church in a corporate manner. This Constitution is completed by
Complementary Norms issued by the Apostolic See.

I. §1 Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans entering into full communion
with the Catholic Church are erected by the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith within the confines of the territorial boundaries
of a particular Conference of Bishops in consultation with that same
Conference.

§2 Within the territory of a particular Conference of Bishops, one or
more Ordinariates may be erected as needed.

§3 Each Ordinariate possesses public juridic personality by the law
itself (ipso iure); it is juridically comparable to a diocese.[31][12]

§4 The Ordinariate is composed of lay faithful, clerics and members of
Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life,
originally belonging to the Anglican Communion and now in full
communion with the Catholic Church, or those who receive the Sacraments
of Initiation within the jurisdiction of the Ordinariate.

§5 The [32]Catechism of the Catholic Church is the authoritative
expression of the Catholic faith professed by members of the
Ordinariate.

II. The Personal Ordinariate is governed according to the norms of
universal law and the present Apostolic Constitution and is subject to
the [33]Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and the other
Dicasteries of the Roman Curia in accordance with their competencies.
It is also governed by the Complementary Norms as well as any other
specific Norms given for each Ordinariate.

III. Without excluding liturgical celebrations according to the Roman
Rite, the Ordinariate has the faculty to celebrate the Holy Eucharist
and the other Sacraments, the Liturgy of the Hours and other liturgical
celebrations according to the liturgical books proper to the Anglican
tradition, which have been approved by the Holy See, so as to maintain
the liturgical, spiritual and pastoral traditions of the Anglican
Communion within the Catholic Church, as a precious gift nourishing the
faith of the members of the Ordinariate and as a treasure to be shared.

IV. A Personal Ordinariate is entrusted to the pastoral care of an
Ordinary appointed by the Roman Pontiff.

V. The power (potestas) of the Ordinary is:

a. ordinary: connected by the law itself to the office entrusted to
him by the Roman Pontiff, for both the internal forum and external
forum;

b. vicarious: exercised in the name of the Roman Pontiff;

c. personal: exercised over all who belong to the Ordinariate;

This power is to be exercised jointly with that of the local Diocesan
Bishop, in those cases provided for in the Complementary Norms.

VI. § 1. Those who ministered as Anglican deacons, priests, or bishops,
and who fulfil the requisites established by canon law[34][13] and are
not impeded by irregularities or other impediments[35][14] may be
accepted by the Ordinary as candidates for Holy Orders in the Catholic
Church. In the case of married ministers, the norms established in the
Encyclical Letter of Pope Paul VI Sacerdotalis coelibatus, n.
42[36][15] and in the Statement In June[37][16] are to be observed.
Unmarried ministers must submit to the norm of clerical celibacy of CIC
can. 277, §1.

§ 2. The Ordinary, in full observance of the discipline of celibate
clergy in the Latin Church, as a rule (pro regula) will admit only
celibate men to the order of presbyter. He may also petition the Roman
Pontiff, as a derogation from can. 277, §1, for the admission of
married men to the order of presbyter on a case by case basis,
according to objective criteria approved by the Holy See.

§ 3. Incardination of clerics will be regulated according to the norms
of canon law.

§ 4. Priests incardinated into an Ordinariate, who constitute the
presbyterate of the Ordinariate, are also to cultivate bonds of unity
with the presbyterate of the Diocese in which they exercise their
ministry. They should promote common pastoral and charitable
initiatives and activities, which can be the object of agreements
between the Ordinary and the local Diocesan Bishop.

§ 5. Candidates for Holy Orders in an Ordinariate should be prepared
alongside other seminarians, especially in the areas of doctrinal and
pastoral formation. In order to address the particular needs of
seminarians of the Ordinariate and formation in Anglican patrimony, the
Ordinary may also establish seminary programs or houses of formation
which would relate to existing Catholic faculties of theology.

VII. The Ordinary, with the approval of the Holy See, can erect new
Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, with
the right to call their members to Holy Orders, according to the norms
of canon law. Institutes of Consecrated Life originating in the
Anglican Communion and entering into full communion with the Catholic
Church may also be placed under his jurisdiction by mutual consent.

VIII. § 1. The Ordinary, according to the norm of law, after having
heard the opinion of the Diocesan Bishop of the place, may erect, with
the consent of the Holy See, personal parishes for the faithful who
belong to the Ordinariate.

§ 2. Pastors of the Ordinariate enjoy all the rights and are held to
all the obligations established in the Code of Canon Law and, in cases
established by the Complementary Norms, such rights and obligations are
to be exercised in mutual pastoral assistance together with the pastors
of the local Diocese where the personal parish of the Ordinariate has
been established.

IX. Both the lay faithful as well as members of Institutes of
Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, originally part of
the Anglican Communion, who wish to enter the Personal Ordinariate,
must manifest this desire in writing.

X. § 1. The Ordinary is aided in his governance by a Governing Council
with its own statutes approved by the Ordinary and confirmed by the
Holy See.[38][17]

§ 2. The Governing Council, presided over by the Ordinary, is composed
of at least six priests. It exercises the functions specified in the
Code of Canon Law for the Presbyteral Council and the College of
Consultors, as well as those areas specified in the Complementary
Norms.

§ 3. The Ordinary is to establish a Finance Council according to the
norms established by the Code of Canon Law which will exercise the
duties specified therein.[39][18]

§ 4. In order to provide for the consultation of the faithful, a
Pastoral Council is to be constituted in the Ordinariate.[40][19]

XI. Every five years the Ordinary is required to come to Rome for an ad
limina Apostolorum visit and present to the Roman Pontiff, through the
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and in consultation with the
Congregation for Bishops and the Congregation for the Evangelization of
Peoples, a report on the status of the Ordinariate.

XII. For judicial cases, the competent tribunal is that of the Diocese
in which one of the parties is domiciled, unless the Ordinariate has
constituted its own tribunal, in which case the tribunal of second
instance is the one designated by the Ordinariate and approved by the
Holy See. In both cases, the different titles of competence established
by the Code of Canon Law are to be taken into account.[41][20]

XIII. The Decree establishing an Ordinariate will determine the
location of the See and, if appropriate, the principal church.

We desire that our dispositions and norms be valid and effective now
and in the future, notwithstanding, should it be necessary, the
Apostolic Constitutions and ordinances issued by our predecessors, or
any other prescriptions, even those requiring special mention or
derogation.

Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, on November 4, 2009, the Memorial of St.
Charles Borromeo.
