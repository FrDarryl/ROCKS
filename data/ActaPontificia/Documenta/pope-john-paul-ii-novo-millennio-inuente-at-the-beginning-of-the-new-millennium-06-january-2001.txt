[8]Pope John Paul II - Novo Millennio Inuente - At the Beginning of the New
Millennium, 6 January 2001

[9]Pope Saint John Paul II Apostolic Letter To my Brother Bishops, To
Priests and Deacons, Men and Women Religious and all the Lay Faithful.

1. At the beginning of the new millennium, and at the close of the
Great Jubilee during which we celebrated the two thousandth anniversary
of the birth of Jesus and a new stage of the Church's journey begins,
our hearts ring out with the words of Jesus when one day, after
speaking to the crowds from Simon's boat, he invited the Apostle to
"put out into the deep" for a catch: "Duc in altum" (Lk 5:4). Peter and
his first companions trusted Christ's words, and cast the nets. "When
they had done this, they caught a great number of fish" (Lk 5:6).

Duc in altum! These words ring out for us today, and they invite us to
remember the past with gratitude, to live the present with enthusiasm
and to look forward to the future with confidence: "Jesus Christ is the
same yesterday and today and for ever" (Heb 13:8).

The Church's joy was great this year, as she devoted herself to
contemplating the face of her Bridegroom and Lord. She became more than
ever a pilgrim people, led by him who is the "the great shepherd of the
sheep" (Heb 13:20). With extraordinary energy, involving so many of her
members, the People of God here in Rome, as well as in Jerusalem and in
all the individual local churches, went through the "Holy Door" that is
Christ. To him who is the goal of history and the one Saviour of the
world, the Church and the Spirit cried out: "Marana tha -- Come, Lord
Jesus" (cf. Rev 22:17, 20; 1 Cor 16:22).

It is impossible to take the measure of this event of grace which in
the course of the year has touched people's hearts. But certainly, "a
river of living water", the water that continually flows "from the
throne of God and of the Lamb" (cf. Rev 22:1), has been poured out on
the Church. This is the water of the Spirit which quenches thirst and
brings new life (cf. Jn 4:14). This is the merciful love of the Father
which has once again been made known and given to us in Christ. At the
end of this year we can repeat with renewed jubilation the ancient
words of thanksgiving: "Give thanks to the Lord for he is good, for his
love endures for ever" (Ps 118:1).

2. For all this, I feel the need to write to you, dearly beloved, to
share this song of praise with you. From the beginning of my
Pontificate, my thoughts had been on this Holy Year 2000 as an
important appointment. I thought of its celebration as a providential
opportunity during which the Church, thirty-five years after the Second
Vatican Ecumenical Council, would examine how far she had renewed
herself, in order to be able to take up her evangelizing mission with
fresh enthusiasm.

Has the Jubilee succeeded in this aim? Our commitment, with its
generous efforts and inevitable failings, is under God's scrutiny. But
we cannot fail to give thanks for the "marvels" the Lord has worked for
us: "Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo" (Ps 89:2).

At the same time, what we have observed demands to be reconsidered, and
in a sense "deciphered", in order to hear what the Spirit has been
saying to the Church (cf. Rev 2:7,11,17, etc.) during this most intense
year.

3. Dear Brothers and Sisters, it is especially necessary for us to
direct our thoughts to the future which lies before us. Often during
these months we have looked towards the new millennium which is
beginning, as we lived this Jubilee not only as a remembrance of the
past, but also as a prophecy of the future. We now need to profit from
the grace received, by putting it into practice in resolutions and
guidelines for action. This is a task I wish to invite all the local
churches to undertake. In each of them, gathered around their Bishop,
as they listen to the word and "break bread" in brotherhood (cf. Acts
2:42), the "one holy catholic and apostolic Church of Christ is truly
present and operative".1 It is above all in the actual situation of
each local church that the mystery of the one People of God takes the
particular form that fits it to each individual context and culture.

In the final analysis, this rooting of the Church in time and space
mirrors the movement of the Incarnation itself. Now is the time for
each local Church to assess its fervour and find fresh enthusiasm for
its spiritual and pastoral responsibilities, by reflecting on what the
Spirit has been saying to the People of God in this special year of
grace, and indeed in the longer span of time from the Second Vatican
Council to the Great Jubilee. It is with this purpose in mind that I
wish to offer in this Letter, at the conclusion of the Jubilee Year,
the contribution of my Petrine ministry, so that the Church may shine
ever more brightly in the variety of her gifts and in her unity as she
journeys on.

I. MEETING CHRIST
THE LEGACY OF THE GREAT JUBILEE

4. "We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty" (Rev 11:17). In the Bull
of Indiction of the Jubilee I expressed the hope that the bimillennial
celebration of the mystery of the Incarnation would be lived as "one
unceasing hymn of praise to the Trinity"2 and also "as a journey of
reconciliation and a sign of true hope for all who look to Christ and
to his Church".3 And this Jubilee Year has been an experience of these
essential aspects, reaching moments of intensity which have made us as
it were touch with our hands the merciful presence of God, from whom
comes "every good endowment and every perfect gift" (Jas 1:17).

My thoughts turn first to the duty of praise. This is the point of
departure for every genuine response of faith to the revelation of God
in Christ. Christianity is grace, it is the wonder of a God who is not
satisfied with creating the world and man, but puts himself on the same
level as the creature he has made and, after speaking on various
occasions and in different ways through his prophets, "in these last
days ... has spoken to us by a Son" (Heb 1:1-2).

In these days! Yes, the Jubilee has made us realize that two thousand
years of history have passed without diminishing the freshness of that
"today", when the angels proclaimed to the shepherds the marvellous
event of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem: "For to you is born this day
in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord" (Lk 2:11). Two
thousand years have gone by, but Jesus' proclamation of his mission,
when he applied the prophecy of Isaiah to himself before his astonished
fellow townspeople in the Synagogue of Nazareth, is as enduring as
ever: "Today this scripture had been fulfilled in your hearing" (Lk
4:21). Two thousand years have gone by, but sinners in need of mercy --
and who is not? -- still experience the consolation of that "today" of
salvation which on the Cross opened the gates of the Kingdom of God to
the repentant thief: "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in
Paradise" (Lk 23:43).

The fullness of time

5. The coincidence of this Jubilee with the opening of a new millennium
has certainly helped people to become more aware of the mystery of
Christ within the great horizon of the history of salvation, without
any concession to millenarian fantasies. Christianity is a religion
rooted in history! It was in the soil of history that God chose to
establish a covenant with Israel and so prepare the birth of the Son
from the womb of Mary "in the fullness of time" (Gal 4:4). Understood
in his divine and human mystery, Christ is the foundation and centre of
history, he is its meaning and ultimate goal. It is in fact through
him, the Word and image of the Father, that "all things were made" (Jn
1:3; cf. Col 1:15). His incarnation, culminating in the Paschal Mystery
and the gift of the Spirit, is the pulsating heart of time, the
mysterious hour in which the Kingdom of God came to us (cf. Mk 1:15),
indeed took root in our history, as the seed destined to become a great
tree (cf. Mk 4:30-! 32).

"Glory to you, Jesus Christ, for you reign today and for ever". With
this song repeated thousands of times, we have contemplated Christ this
year as he is presented in the Book of Revelation: "the Alpha and the
Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end" (Rev 22:13).
And contemplating Christ, we have also adored the Father and the
Spirit, the one and undivided Trinity, the ineffable mystery in which
everything has its origin and its fulfilment.

The purification of memory

6. To purify our vision for the contemplation of the mystery, this
Jubilee Year has been strongly marked by the request for forgiveness.
This is true not only for individuals, who have examined their own
lives in order to ask for mercy and gain the special gift of the
indulgence, but for the entire Church, which has decided to recall the
infidelities of so many of her children in the course of history,
infidelities which have cast a shadow over her countenance as the Bride
of Christ.

For a long time we had been preparing ourselves for this examination of
conscience, aware that the Church, embracing sinners in her bosom, "is
at once holy and always in need of being purified".4 Study congresses
helped us to identify those aspects in which, during the course of the
first two millennia, the Gospel spirit did not always shine forth. How
could we forget the moving Liturgy of 12 March 2000 in Saint Peter's
Basilica, at which, looking upon our Crucified Lord, I asked
forgiveness in the name of the Church for the sins of all her children?
This "purification of memory" has strengthened our steps for the
journey towards the future and has made us more humble and vigilant in
our acceptance of the Gospel.

Witnesses to the faith

7. This lively sense of repentance, however, has not prevented us from
giving glory to the Lord for what he has done in every century, and in
particular during the century which we have just left behind, by
granting his Church a great host of saints and martyrs. For some of
them the Jubilee year has been the year of their [10]beatification or
canonization. Holiness, whether ascribed to Popes well-known to history
or to humble lay and religious figures, from one continent to another
of the globe, has emerged more clearly as the dimension which expresses
best the mystery of the Church. Holiness, a message that convinces
without the need for words, is the living reflection of the face of
Christ.

On the occasion of the Holy Year much has also been done to gather
together the precious memories of the witnesses to the faith in the
twentieth century. Together with the representatives of the other
Churches and Ecclesial Communities, we commemorated them on 7 May 2000
in the evocative setting of the Colosseum, the symbol of the ancient
persecutions. This is a heritage which must not be lost; we should
always be thankful for it and we should renew our resolve to imitate
it.

A pilgrim Church

8. As if following in the footsteps of the Saints, countless sons and
daughters of the Church have come in successive waves to Rome, to the
Tombs of the Apostles, wanting to profess their faith, confess their
sins and receive the mercy that saves. I have been impressed this year
by the crowds of people which have filled Saint Peter's Square at the
many celebrations. I have often stopped to look at the long queues of
pilgrims waiting patiently to go through the Holy Door. In each of them
I tried to imagine the story of a life, made up of joys, worries,
sufferings; the story of someone whom Christ had met and who, in
dialogue with him, was setting out again on a journey of hope.

As I observed the continuous flow of pilgrims, I saw them as a kind of
concrete image of the pilgrim Church, the Church placed, as Saint
Augustine says, "amid the persecutions of the world and the
consolations of God".5 We have only been able to observe the outer face
of this unique event. Who can measure the marvels of grace wrought in
human hearts? It is better to be silent and to adore, trusting humbly
in the mysterious workings of God and singing his love without end:
"Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo!".

Young people

9. The many Jubilee gatherings have brought together the most diverse
groups of people, and the level of participation has been truly
impressive -- at times sorely trying the commitment of organizers and
helpers, both ecclesiastical and civil. In this Letter I wish to
express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone. But apart from the numbers,
what has moved me so often was to note the intensity of prayer,
reflection and spirit of communion which these meetings have generally
showed.

And how could we fail to recall especially the joyful and inspiring
gathering of young people? If there is an image of the Jubilee of the
Year 2000 that more than any other will live on in memory, it is surely
the streams of young people with whom I was able to engage in a sort of
very special dialogue, filled with mutual affection and deep
understanding. It was like this from the moment I welcomed them in the
Square of Saint John Lateran and Saint Peter's Square. Then I saw them
swarming through the city, happy as young people should be, but also
thoughtful, eager to pray, seeking "meaning" and true friendship.
Neither for them nor for those who saw them will it be easy to forget
that week, during which Rome became "young with the young". It will not
be possible to forget the Mass at Tor Vergata.

Yet again, the young have shown themselves to be for Rome and for the
Church a special gift of the Spirit of God. Sometimes when we look at
the young, with the problems and weaknesses that characterize them in
contemporary society, we tend to be pessimistic. The Jubilee of Young
People however changed that, telling us that young people, whatever
their possible ambiguities, have a profound longing for those genuine
values which find their fullness in Christ. Is not Christ the secret of
true freedom and profound joy of heart? Is not Christ the supreme
friend and the teacher of all genuine friendship? If Christ is
presented to young people as he really is, they experience him as an
answer that is convincing and they can accept his message, even when it
is demanding and bears the mark of the Cross. For this reason, in
response to their enthusiasm, I did not hesitate to ask them to make a
radical choice of faith and life and present them with a stupendous
task: to become "morning! watchmen" (cf. Is 21:11-12) at the dawn of
the new millennium.

The variety of the pilgrims

10. Obviously I cannot go into detail about each individual Jubilee
event. Each one of them had its own character and has left its message,
not only for those who took part directly but also for those who heard
about them or took part from afar through the media. But how can we
forget the mood of celebration of the first great gathering dedicated
to children? In a way, to begin with them meant respecting Christ's
command: "Let the children come to me" (Mk 10:14). Perhaps even more it
meant doing what he did when he placed a child in the midst of the
disciples and made it the very symbol of the attitude which we should
have if we wish to enter the Kingdom of God (cf. Mt 18:2-4).

Thus, in a sense, it was in the footsteps of children that all the
different groups of adults came seeking the Jubilee grace: from old
people to the sick and handicapped, from workers in factories and
fields to sportspeople, from artists to university teachers, from
Bishops and priests to people in consecrated life, from politicians to
journalists, to the military personnel who came to confirm the meaning
of their service as a service to peace.

One of the most notable events was the gathering of workers on 1 May,
the day traditionally dedicated to the world of work. I asked them to
live a spirituality of work in imitation of Saint Joseph and of Jesus
himself. That Jubilee gathering also gave me the opportunity to voice a
strong call to correct the economic and social imbalances present in
the world of work and to make decisive efforts to ensure that the
processes of economic globalization give due attention to solidarity
and the respect owed to every human person.

Children, with their irrepressible sense of celebration, were again
present for the Jubilee of Families, when I held them up to the world
as the "springtime of the family and of society". This was a truly
significant gathering in which numberless families from different parts
of the world came to draw fresh enthusiasm from the light that Christ
sheds on God's original plan in their regard (cf. Mk 10:6-8; Mt 19:4-6)
and to commit themselves to bringing that light to bear on a culture
which, in an ever more disturbing way, is in danger of losing sight of
the very meaning of marriage and the family as an institution.

For me one of the more moving meetings was the one with the prisoners
at Regina Caeli. In their eyes I saw suffering, but also repentance and
hope. For them in a special way the Jubilee was a "year of mercy".

Finally, in the last days of the year, an enjoyable occasion was the
meeting with the world of entertainment, which exercises such a
powerful influence on people. I was able to remind all involved of
their great responsibility to use entertainment to offer a positive
message, one that is morally healthy and able to communicate confidence
and love.

The International Eucharistic Congress

11. In the spirit of this Jubilee Year the International Eucharistic
Congress was intended to have special significance. And it did! Since
the Eucharist is the sacrifice of Christ made present among us, how
could his real presence not be at the centre of the Holy Year dedicated
to the Incarnation of the Word? The year was intended, precisely for
this reason, to be "intensely Eucharistic",6 and that is how we tried
to live it. At the same time, along with the memory of the birth of the
Son, how could the memory of the Mother be missing? Mary was present in
the Jubilee celebration not only as a theme of high-level academic
gatherings, but above all in the great Act of Entrustment with which,
in the presence of a large part of the world episcopate, I entrusted to
her maternal care the lives of the men and women of the new millennium.

The ecumenical dimension

12. You will understand that I speak more readily of the Jubilee as
seen from the See of Peter. However I am not forgetting that I myself
wanted the Jubilee to be celebrated also in the particular churches,
and it is there that the majority of the faithful were able to gain its
special graces, and particularly the indulgence connected with the
Jubilee Year. Nevertheless it is significant that many Dioceses wanted
to be present, with large groups of the faithful, here in Rome too. The
Eternal City has thus once again shown its providential role as the
place where the resources and gifts of each individual church, and
indeed of each individual nation and culture, find their "catholic"
harmony, so that the one Church of Christ can show ever more clearly
her mystery as the "sacrament of unity".7

I had also asked for special attention to be given in the programme of
the Jubilee Year to the ecumenical aspect. What occasion could be more
suitable for encouraging progress on the path towards full communion
than the shared celebration of the birth of Christ? Much work was done
with this in mind, and one of the highlights was the ecumenical meeting
in Saint Paul's Basilica on 18 January 2000, when for the first time in
history a Holy Door was opened jointly by the Successor of Peter, the
[11]Anglican Primate and a Metropolitan of the Ecumenical Patriarchate
of Constantinople, in the presence of representatives of Churches and
Ecclesial Communities from all over the world. There were also other
important meetings with Orthodox Patriarchs and the heads of other
Christian denominations. I recall in particular the recent visit of His
Holiness Karekin II, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians.
In addition, very many members of other Churches and Ecclesial
Communities t! ook part in the Jubilee meetings organized for various
groups. The ecumenical journey is certainly still difficult, and will
perhaps be long, but we are encouraged by the hope that comes from
being led by the presence of the Risen One and the inexhaustible power
of his Spirit, always capable of new surprises.

Pilgrimage to the Holy Land

13. And how can I not recall my personal Jubilee along the pathways of
the Holy Land? I would have liked to begin that journey at Ur of the
Chaldeans, in order to follow, tangibly as it were, in the footsteps of
Abraham "our father in faith" (cf. Rom 4:11-16). However, I had to be
content with a pilgrimage in spirit, on the occasion of the evocative
Liturgy of the Word celebrated in the Paul VI Audience Hall on 23
February. The actual pilgrimage came almost immediately afterwards,
following the stages of salvation history. Thus I had the joy of
visiting Mount Sinai, where the gift of the Ten Commandments of the
Covenant was given. I set out again a month later, when I reached Mount
Nebo, and then went on to the very places where the Redeemer lived and
which he made holy. It is difficult to express the emotion I felt in
being able to venerate the places of his birth and life, Bethlehem and
Nazareth, to celebrate the Eucharist in the Upper Room, in the very
place of its instit! ution, to meditate again on the mystery of the
Cross at Golgotha, where he gave his life for us. In those places,
still so troubled and again recently afflicted by violence, I received
an extraordinary welcome not only from the members of the Church but
also from the Israeli and Palestinian communities. Intense emotion
surrounded my prayer at the Western Wall and my visit to the Mausoleum
of Yad Vashem, with its chilling reminder of the victims of the Nazi
death camps. My pilgrimage was a moment of brotherhood and peace, and I
like to remember it as one of the most beautiful gifts of the whole
Jubilee event. Thinking back to the mood of those days, I cannot but
express my deeply felt desire for a prompt and just solution to the
still unresolved problems of the Holy Places, cherished by Jews,
Christians and Muslims together.

International debt

14. The Jubilee was also a great event of charity -- and it could not
be otherwise. Already in the years of preparation, I had called for
greater and more incisive attention to the problems of poverty which
still beset the world. The problem of the international debt of poor
countries took on particular significance in this context. A gesture of
generosity towards these countries was in the very spirit of the
Jubilee, which in its original Biblical setting was precisely a time
when the community committed itself to re-establishing justice and
solidarity in interpersonal relations, including the return of whatever
belonged to others. I am happy to note that recently the Parliaments of
many creditor States have voted a substantial remission of the
bilateral debt of the poorest and most indebted countries. I hope that
the respective Governments will soon implement these parliamentary
decisions. The question of multilateral debt contracted by poorer
countries with international ! financial organizations has shown itself
to be a rather more problematic issue. It is to be hoped that the
member States of these organizations, especially those that have
greater decisional powers, will succeed in reaching the necessary
consensus in order to arrive at a rapid solution to this question on
which the progress of many countries depends, with grave consequences
for the economy and the living conditions of so many people.

New energies

15. These are only some of the elements of the Jubilee celebration. It
has left us with many memories. But if we ask what is the core of the
great legacy it leaves us, I would not hesitate to describe it as the
contemplation of the face of Christ: Christ considered in his
historical features and in his mystery, Christ known through his
manifold presence in the Church and in the world, and confessed as the
meaning of history and the light of life's journey.

Now we must look ahead, we must "put out into the deep", trusting in
Christ's words: Duc in altum! What we have done this year cannot
justify a sense of complacency, and still less should it lead us to
relax our commitment. On the contrary, the experiences we have had
should inspire in us new energy, and impel us to invest in concrete
initiatives the enthusiasm which we have felt. Jesus himself warns us:
"No one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for the
kingdom of God" (Lk 9:62). In the cause of the Kingdom there is no time
for looking back, even less for settling into laziness. Much awaits us,
and for this reason we must set about drawing up an effective
post-Jubilee pastoral plan.

It is important however that what we propose, with the help of God,
should be profoundly rooted in contemplation and prayer. Ours is a time
of continual movement which often leads to restlessness, with the risk
of "doing for the sake of doing". We must resist this temptation by
trying "to be" before trying "to do". In this regard we should recall
how Jesus reproved Martha: "You are anxious and troubled about many
things; one thing is needful" (Lk 10:41-42). In this spirit, before
setting out a number of practical guidelines for your consideration, I
wish to share with you some points of meditation on the mystery of
Christ, the absolute foundation of all our pastoral activity.

II. A FACE TO CONTEMPLATE

16. "We wish to see Jesus" (Jn 12:21). This request, addressed to the
Apostle Philip by some Greeks who had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem
for the Passover, echoes spiritually in our ears too during this
Jubilee Year. Like those pilgrims of two thousand years ago, the men
and women of our own day -- often perhaps unconsciously -- ask
believers not only to "speak" of Christ, but in a certain sense to
"show" him to them. And is it not the Church's task to reflect the
light of Christ in every historical period, to make his face shine also
before the generations of the new millennium?

Our witness, however, would be hopelessly inadequate if we ourselves
had not first contemplated his face. The Great Jubilee has certainly
helped us to do this more deeply. At the end of the Jubilee, as we go
back to our ordinary routine, storing in our hearts the treasures of
this very special time, our gaze is more than ever firmly set on the
face of the Lord.

The witness of the Gospels

17. The contemplation of Christ's face cannot fail to be inspired by
all that we are told about him in Sacred Scripture, which from
beginning to end is permeated by his mystery, prefigured in a veiled
way in the Old Testament and revealed fully in the New, so that Saint
Jerome can vigorously affirm: "Ignorance of the Scriptures is ignorance
of Christ".8 Remaining firmly anchored in Scripture, we open ourselves
to the action of the Spirit (cf. Jn 15:26) from whom the sacred texts
derive their origin, as well as to the witness of the Apostles (cf. Jn
15:27), who had a first-hand experience of Christ, the Word of life:
they saw him with their eyes, heard him with their ears, touched him
with their hands (cf. 1 Jn 1:1).

What we receive from them is a vision of faith based on precise
historical testimony: a true testimony which the Gospels, despite their
complex redaction and primarily catechetical purpose, pass on to us in
an entirely trustworthy way.9

18. The Gospels do not claim to be a complete biography of Jesus in
accordance with the canons of modern historical science. >From them,
nevertheless, the face of the Nazarene emerges with a solid historical
foundation. The Evangelists took pains to represent him on the basis of
trustworthy testimonies which they gathered (cf. Lk 1:3) and working
with documents which were subjected to careful ecclesial scrutiny. It
was on the basis of such first-hand testimony that, enlightened by the
Holy Spirit's action, they learnt the humanly perplexing fact of Jesus'
virginal birth from Mary, wife of Joseph. From those who had known him
during the almost thirty years spent in Nazareth (cf. Lk 3:23) they
collected facts about the life of "the carpenter's son" (Mt 13:55) who
was himself a "carpenter" and whose place within the context of his
larger family was well established (cf. Mk 6:3). They recorded his
religious fervour, which prompted him to make annual pilgrimages to the
Temple in ! Jerusalem with his family (cf. Lk 2:41), and made him a
regular visitor to the synagogue of his own town (cf. Lk 4:16).

Without being complete and detailed, the reports of his public ministry
become much fuller, starting at the moment of the young Galilean's
[12]baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan. Strengthened by the
witness from on high and aware of being the "beloved son" (Lk 3:22), he
begins his preaching of the coming of the Kingdom of God, and explains
its demands and its power by words and signs of grace and mercy. The
Gospels present him to us as one who travels through towns and
villages, accompanied by twelve Apostles whom he has chosen (cf. Mk
3:13-19), by a group of women who assist them (cf. Lk 8:2-3), by crowds
that seek him out and follow him, by the sick who cry out for his
healing power, by people who listen to him with varying degrees of
acceptance of his words.

The Gospel narrative then converges on the growing tension which
develops between Jesus and the dominant groups in the religious society
of his time, until the final crisis with its dramatic climax on
Golgotha. This is the hour of darkness, which is followed by a new,
radiant and definitive dawn. The Gospel accounts conclude, in fact, by
showing the Nazarene victorious over death. They point to the empty
tomb and follow him in the cycle of apparitions in which the disciples
-- at first perplexed and bewildered, then filled with unspeakable joy
-- experience his living and glorious presence. From him they receive
the gift of the Spirit (cf. Jn 20:22) and the command to proclaim the
Gospel to "all nations" (Mt 28:19).

The life of faith

19. "The disciples were glad when they saw the Lord" (Jn 20:20). The
face which the Apostles contemplated after the Resurrection was the
same face of the Jesus with whom they had lived for almost three years,
and who now convinced them of the astonishing truth of his new life by
showing them "his hands and his side" (ibid.). Of course it was not
easy to believe. The disciples on their way to Emmaus believed only
after a long spiritual journey (cf. Lk 24:13-35). The Apostle Thomas
believed only after verifying for himself the marvellous event (cf. Jn
20:24-29). In fact, regardless of how much his body was seen or
touched, only faith could fully enter the mystery of that face. This
was an experience which the disciples must have already had during the
historical life of Christ, in the questions which came to their minds
whenever they felt challenged by his actions and his words. One can
never really reach Jesus except by the path of faith, on a journey of
which the stages seem! to be indicated to us by the Gospel itself in
the well known scene at Caesarea Philippi (cf. Mt 16:13-20). Engaging
in a kind of first evaluation of his mission, Jesus asks his disciples
what "people" think of him, and they answer him: "Some say John the
Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets"
(Mt 16:14). A lofty response to be sure, but still a long way -- by far
-- from the truth. The crowds are able to sense a definitely
exceptional religious dimension to this rabbi who speaks in such a
spellbinding way, but they are not able to put him above those men of
God who had distinguished the history of Israel. Jesus is really far
different! It is precisely this further step of awareness, concerning
as it does the deeper level of his being, which he expects from those
who are close to him: "But who do you say that I am?" (Mt 16:15). Only
the faith proclaimed by Peter, and with him by the Church in every age,
truly goes to the heart, and touches th! e depth of the mystery: "You
are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Mt 16:16).

20. How had Peter come to this faith? And what is asked of us, if we
wish to follow in his footsteps with ever greater conviction? Matthew
gives us an enlightening insight in the words with which Jesus accepts
Peter's confession: "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but
my Father who is in heaven" (16:17). The expression "flesh and blood"
is a reference to man and the common way of understanding things. In
the case of Jesus, this common way is not enough. A grace of
"revelation" is needed, which comes from the Father (cf. ibid.). Luke
gives us an indication which points in the same direction when he notes
that this dialogue with the disciples took place when Jesus "was
praying alone" (Lk 9:18). Both indications converge to make it clear
that we cannot come to the fullness of contemplation of the Lord's face
by our own efforts alone, but by allowing grace to take us by the hand.
Only the experience of silence and prayer offers the proper setting for
the growth and d! evelopment of a true, faithful and consistent
knowledge of that mystery which finds its culminating expression in the
solemn proclamation by the Evangelist Saint John: "And the Word became
flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his
glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father" (1:14).

The depth of the mystery

21. The Word and the flesh, the divine glory and his dwelling among us!
It is in the intimate and inseparable union of these two aspects that
Christ's identity is to be found, in accordance with the classic
formula of the Council of Chalcedon (451): "one person in two natures".
The person is that, and that alone, of the Eternal Word, the Son of the
Father. The two natures, without any confusion whatsoever, but also
without any possible separation, are the divine and the human.10

We know that our concepts and our words are limited. The formula,
though always human, is nonetheless carefully measured in its doctrinal
content, and it enables us, albeit with trepidation, to gaze in some
way into the depths of the mystery. Yes, Jesus is true God and true
man! Like the Apostle Thomas, the Church is constantly invited by
Christ to touch his wounds, to recognize, that is, the fullness of his
humanity taken from Mary, given up to death, transfigured by the
Resurrection: "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your
hand, and place it in my side" (Jn 20:27). Like Thomas, the Church bows
down in adoration before the Risen One, clothed in the fullness of his
divine splendour, and never ceases to exclaim: "My Lord and my God!"
(Jn 20:28).

22. "The Word became flesh" (Jn 1:14). This striking formulation by
John of the mystery of Christ is confirmed by the entire New Testament.
The Apostle Paul takes this same approach when he affirms that the Son
of God was born "of the race of David, according to the flesh" (cf. Rom
1:3; cf. 9:5). If today, because of the rationalism found in so much of
contemporary culture, it is above all faith in the divinity of Christ
that has become problematic, in other historical and cultural contexts
there was a tendency to diminish and do away with the historical
concreteness of Jesus' humanity. But for the Church's faith it is
essential and indispensable to affirm that the Word truly "became
flesh" and took on every aspect of humanity, except sin (cf. Heb 4:15).
From this perspective, the incarnation is truly a kenosis -- a
"self-emptying" -- on the part of the Son of God of that glory which is
his from all eternity (Phil 2:6-8; cf. 1 Pt 3:18).

On the other hand, this abasement of the Son of God is not an end in
itself; it tends rather towards the full glorification of Christ, even
in his humanity: "Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on
him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every
knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every
tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father" (Phil 2:9-11).

23. "Your face, O Lord, I seek" (Ps 27:8). The ancient longing of the
Psalmist could receive no fulfilment greater and more surprising than
the contemplation of the face of Christ. God has truly blessed us in
him and has made "his face to shine upon us" (Ps 67:1). At the same
time, God and man that he is, he reveals to us also the true face of
man, "fully revealing man to man himself".11

Jesus is "the new man" (cf. Eph 4:24; Col 3:10) who calls redeemed
humanity to share in his divine life. The mystery of the Incarnation
lays the foundations for an anthropology which, reaching beyond its own
limitations and contradictions, moves towards God himself, indeed
towards the goal of "divinization". This occurs through the grafting of
the redeemed on to Christ and their admission into the intimacy of the
Trinitarian life. The Fathers have laid great stress on this
soteriological dimension of the mystery of the Incarnation: it is only
because the Son of God truly became man that man, in him and through
him, can truly become a child of God.12

The Son's face

24. This divine-human identity emerges forcefully from the Gospels,
which offer us a range of elements that make it possible for us to
enter that "frontier zone" of the mystery, represented by Christ's
self-awareness. The Church has no doubt that the Evangelists in their
accounts, and inspired from on high, have correctly understood in the
words which Jesus spoke the truth about his person and his awareness of
it. Is this not what Luke wishes to tell us when he recounts Jesus'
first recorded words, spoken in the Temple in Jerusalem when he was
barely twelve years old? Already at that time he shows that he is aware
of a unique relationship with God, a relationship which properly
belongs to a "son". When his mother tells him how anxiously she and
Joseph had been searching for him, Jesus replies without hesitation:
"How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be about my
Father's affairs?" (Lk 2:49). It is no wonder therefore that later as a
grown man his languag! e authoritatively expresses the depth of his own
mystery, as is abundantly clear both in the Synoptic Gospels (cf. Mt
11:27; Lk 10:22) and above all in the Gospel of John. In his
self-awareness, Jesus has no doubts: "The Father is in me and I am in
the Father" (Jn 10:38).

However valid it may be to maintain that, because of the human
condition which made him grow "in wisdom and in stature, and in favour
with God and man" (Lk 2:52), his human awareness of his own mystery
would also have progressed to its fullest expression in his glorified
humanity, there is no doubt that already in his historical existence
Jesus was aware of his identity as the Son of God. John emphasizes this
to the point of affirming that it was ultimately because of this
awareness that Jesus was rejected and condemned: they sought to kill
him "because he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his
Father, making himself equal with God" (Jn 5:18). In Gethsemane and on
Golgotha Jesus' human awareness will be put to the supreme test. But
not even the drama of his Passion and Death will be able to shake his
serene certainty of being the Son of the heavenly Father.

A face of sorrow

25. In contemplating Christ's face, we confront the most paradoxical
aspect of his mystery, as it emerges in his last hour, on the Cross.
The mystery within the mystery, before which we cannot but prostrate
ourselves in adoration.

The intensity of the episode of the agony in the Garden of Olives
passes before our eyes. Oppressed by foreknowledge of the trials that
await him, and alone before the Father, Jesus cries out to him in his
habitual and affectionate expression of trust: "Abba, Father". He asks
him to take away, if possible, the cup of suffering (cf. Mk 14:36). But
the Father seems not to want to heed the Son's cry. In order to bring
man back to the Father's face, Jesus not only had to take on the face
of man, but he had to burden himself with the "face" of sin. "For our
sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might
become the righteousness of God" (2 Cor 5:21).

We shall never exhaust the depths of this mystery. All the harshness of
the paradox can be heard in Jesus' seemingly desperate cry of pain on
the Cross: " `Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?' which means, `My God, my
God, why have you forsaken me?' " (Mk 15:34). Is it possible to imagine
a greater agony, a more impenetrable darkness? In reality, the
anguished "why" addressed to the Father in the opening words of the
Twenty-second Psalm expresses all the realism of unspeakable pain; but
it is also illumined by the meaning of that entire prayer, in which the
Psalmist brings together suffering and trust, in a moving blend of
emotions. In fact the Psalm continues: "In you our fathers put their
trust; they trusted and you set them free ... Do not leave me alone in
my distress, come close, there is none else to help" (Ps 22:5,12).

26. Jesus' cry on the Cross, dear Brothers and Sisters, is not the cry
of anguish of a man without hope, but the prayer of the Son who offers
his life to the Father in love, for the salvation of all. At the very
moment when he identifies with our sin, "abandoned" by the Father, he
"abandons" himself into the hands of the Father. His eyes remain fixed
on the Father. Precisely because of the knowledge and experience of the
Father which he alone has, even at this moment of darkness he sees
clearly the gravity of sin and suffers because of it. He alone, who
sees the Father and rejoices fully in him, can understand completely
what it means to resist the Father's love by sin. More than an
experience of physical pain, his Passion is an agonizing suffering of
the soul. Theological tradition has not failed to ask how Jesus could
possibly experience at one and the same time his profound unity with
the Father, by its very nature a source of joy and happiness, and an
agony that goes all! the way to his final cry of abandonment. The
simultaneous presence of these two seemingly irreconcilable aspects is
rooted in the fathomless depths of the hypostatic union.

27. Faced with this mystery, we are greatly helped not only by
theological investigation but also by that great heritage which is the
"lived theology" of the saints. The saints offer us precious insights
which enable us to understand more easily the intuition of faith,
thanks to the special enlightenment which some of them have received
from the Holy Spirit, or even through their personal experience of
those terrible states of trial which the mystical tradition describes
as the "dark night". Not infrequently the saints have undergone
something akin to Jesus' experience on the Cross in the paradoxical
blending of bliss and pain. In the Dialogue of Divine Providence, God
the Father shows Catherine of Siena how joy and suffering can be
present together in holy souls: "Thus the soul is blissful and
afflicted: afflicted on account of the sins of its neighbour, blissful
on account of the union and the affection of charity which it has
inwardly received. These souls imitate the spo! tless Lamb, my
Only-begotten Son, who on the Cross was both blissful and afflicted".13
In the same way, Thérèse of Lisieux lived her agony in communion with
the agony of Jesus, "experiencing" in herself the very paradox of
Jesus's own bliss and anguish: "In the Garden of Olives our Lord was
blessed with all the joys of the Trinity, yet his dying was no less
harsh. It is a mystery, but I assure you that, on the basis of what I
myself am feeling, I can understand something of it".14 What an
illuminating testimony! Moreover, the accounts given by the Evangelists
themselves provide a basis for this intuition on the part of the Church
of Christ's consciousness when they record that, even in the depths of
his pain, he died imploring forgiveness for his executioners (cf. Lk
23:34) and expressing to the Father his ultimate filial abandonment:
"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit" (Lk 23:46).

The face of the One who is Risen

28. As on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, the Church pauses in
contemplation of this bleeding face, which conceals the life of God and
offers salvation to the world. But her contemplation of Christ's face
cannot stop at the image of the Crucified One. He is the Risen One!
Were this not so, our preaching would be in vain and our faith empty
(cf. 1 Cor 15:14). The Resurrection was the Father's response to
Christ's obedience, as we learn from the Letter to the Hebrews: "In the
days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with
loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and
he was heard for his godly fear. Son though he was, he learned
obedience through what he suffered; and being made perfect, he became
the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him" (5:7-9).

It is the Risen Christ to whom the Church now looks. And she does so in
the footsteps of Peter, who wept for his denial and started out again
by confessing, with understandable trepidation, his love of Christ:
"You know that I love you" (Jn 21:15-17). She does so in the company of
Paul, who encountered the Lord on the road to Damascus and was
overwhelmed: "For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain" (Phil
1:21).

Two thousand years after these events, the Church relives them as if
they had happened today. Gazing on the face of Christ, the Bride
contemplates her treasure and her joy. "Dulcis Iesus memoria, dans vera
cordis gaudia": how sweet is the memory of Jesus, the source of the
heart's true joy! Heartened by this experience, the Church today sets
out once more on her journey, in order to proclaim Christ to the world
at the dawn of the Third Millennium: he "is the same yesterday and
today and for ever" (Heb 13:8).

III. STARTING AFRESH FROM CHRIST

29. "I am with you always, to the close of the age" (Mt 28:20). This
assurance, dear brothers and sisters, has accompanied the Church for
two thousand years, and has now been renewed in our hearts by the
celebration of the Jubilee. From it we must gain new impetus in
Christian living, making it the force which inspires our journey of
faith. Conscious of the Risen Lord's presence among us, we ask
ourselves today the same question put to Peter in Jerusalem immediately
after his Pentecost speech: "What must we do?" (Acts 2:37).

We put the question with trusting optimism, but without underestimating
the problems we face. We are certainly not seduced by the naive
expectation that, faced with the great challenges of our time, we shall
find some magic formula. No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by
a Person, and the assurance which he gives us: I am with you!

It is not therefore a matter of inventing a "new programme". The
programme already exists: it is the plan found in the Gospel and in the
living Tradition, it is the same as ever. Ultimately, it has its centre
in Christ himself, who is to be known, loved and imitated, so that in
him we may live the life of the Trinity, and with him transform history
until its fulfilment in the heavenly Jerusalem. This is a programme
which does not change with shifts of times and cultures, even though it
takes account of time and culture for the sake of true dialogue and
effective communication. This programme for all times is our programme
for the Third Millennium.

But it must be translated into pastoral initiatives adapted to the
circumstances of each community. The Jubilee has given us the
extraordinary opportunity to travel together for a number of years on a
journey common to the whole Church, a catechetical journey on the theme
of the Trinity, accompanied by precise pastoral undertakings designed
to ensure that the Jubilee would be a fruitful event. I am grateful for
the sincere and widespread acceptance of what I proposed in my
Apostolic Letter Tertio Millennio Adveniente. But now it is no longer
an immediate goal that we face, but the larger and more demanding
challenge of normal pastoral activity. With its universal and
indispensable provisions, the programme of the Gospel must continue to
take root, as it has always done, in the life of the Church everywhere.
It is in the local churches that the specific features of a detailed
pastoral plan can be identified -- goals and methods, formation and
enrichment of the people i! nvolved, the search for the necessary
resources -- which will enable the proclamation of Christ to reach
people, mould communities, and have a deep and incisive influence in
bringing Gospel values to bear in society and culture.

I therefore earnestly exhort the Pastors of the particular Churches,
with the help of all sectors of God's People, confidently to plan the
stages of the journey ahead, harmonizing the choices of each diocesan
community with those of neighbouring Churches and of the universal
Church.

This harmonization will certainly be facilitated by the collegial work
which Bishops now regularly undertake in Episcopal Conferences and
Synods. Was this not the point of the continental Assemblies of the
Synod of Bishops which prepared for the Jubilee, and which forged
important directives for the present-day proclamation of the Gospel in
so many different settings and cultures? This rich legacy of reflection
must not be allowed to disappear, but must be implemented in practical
ways.

What awaits us therefore is an exciting work of pastoral revitalization
-- a work involving all of us. As guidance and encouragement to
everyone, I wish to indicate certain pastoral priorities which the
experience of the Great Jubilee has, in my view, brought to light.

Holiness

30. First of all, I have no hesitation in saying that all pastoral
initiatives must be set in relation to holiness. Was this not the
ultimate meaning of the Jubilee indulgence, as a special grace offered
by Christ so that the life of every baptized person could be purified
and deeply renewed?

It is my hope that, among those who have taken part in the Jubilee,
many will have benefited from this grace, in full awareness of its
demands. Once the Jubilee is over, we resume our normal path, but
knowing that stressing holiness remains more than ever an urgent
pastoral task.

It is necessary therefore to rediscover the full practical significance
of Chapter 5 of the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium,
dedicated to the "universal call to holiness". The Council Fathers laid
such stress on this point, not just to embellish ecclesiology with a
kind of spiritual veneer, but to make the call to holiness an intrinsic
and essential aspect of their teaching on the Church. The rediscovery
of the Church as "mystery", or as a people "gathered together by the
unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit",15 was bound to bring
with it a rediscovery of the Church's "holiness", understood in the
basic sense of belonging to him who is in essence the Holy One, the
"thrice Holy" (cf. Is 6:3). To profess the Church as holy means to
point to her as the Bride of Christ, for whom he gave himself precisely
in order to make her holy (cf. Eph 5:25-26). This as it were objective
gift of holiness is offered to all the b! aptized.

But the gift in turn becomes a task, which must shape the whole of
Christian life: "This is the will of God, your sanctification" (1 Th
4:3). It is a duty which concerns not only certain Christians: "All the
Christian faithful, of whatever state or rank, are called to the
fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity".16

31. At first glance, it might seem almost impractical to recall this
elementary truth as the foundation of the pastoral planning in which we
are involved at the start of the new millennium. Can holiness ever be
"planned"? What might the word "holiness" mean in the context of a
pastoral plan?

In fact, to place pastoral planning under the heading of holiness is a
choice filled with consequences. It implies the conviction that, since
[13]Baptism is a true entry into the holiness of God through
incorporation into Christ and the indwelling of his Spirit, it would be
a contradiction to settle for a life of mediocrity, marked by a
minimalist ethic and a shallow religiosity. To ask catechumens: "Do you
wish to receive [14]Baptism?" means at the same time to ask them: "Do
you wish to become holy?" It means to set before them the radical
nature of the Sermon on the Mount: "Be perfect as your heavenly Father
is perfect" (Mt 5:48).

As the Council itself explained, this ideal of perfection must not be
misunderstood as if it involved some kind of extraordinary existence,
possible only for a few "uncommon heroes" of holiness. The ways of
holiness are many, according to the vocation of each individual. I
thank the Lord that in these years he has enabled me to beatify and
canonize a large number of Christians, and among them many lay people
who attained holiness in the most ordinary circumstances of life. The
time has come to re-propose wholeheartedly to everyone this high
standard of ordinary Christian living: the whole life of the Christian
community and of Christian families must lead in this direction. It is
also clear however that the paths to holiness are personal and call for
a genuine "training in holiness", adapted to people's needs. This
training must integrate the resources offered to everyone with both the
traditional forms of individual and group assistance, as well as the
more recent forms of ! support offered in associations and movements
recognized by the Church.

Prayer

32. This training in holiness calls for a Christian life distinguished
above all in the art of prayer. The Jubilee Year has been a year of
more intense prayer, both personal and communal. But we well know that
prayer cannot be taken for granted. We have to learn to pray: as it
were learning this art ever anew from the lips of the Divine Master
himself, like the first disciples: "Lord, teach us to pray!" (Lk 11:1).
Prayer develops that conversation with Christ which makes us his
intimate friends: "Abide in me and I in you" (Jn 15:4). This
reciprocity is the very substance and soul of the Christian life, and
the condition of all true pastoral life. Wrought in us by the Holy
Spirit, this reciprocity opens us, through Christ and in Christ, to
contemplation of the Father's face. Learning this Trinitarian shape of
Christian prayer and living it fully, above all in the liturgy, the
summit and source of the Church's life,17 but also in personal
experienc! e, is the secret of a truly vital Christianity, which has no
reason to fear the future, because it returns continually to the
sources and finds in them new life.

33. Is it not one of the "signs of the times" that in today's world,
despite widespread secularization, there is a widespread demand for
spirituality, a demand which expresses itself in large part as a
renewed need for prayer? Other religions, which are now widely present
in ancient Christian lands, offer their own responses to this need, and
sometimes they do so in appealing ways. But we who have received the
grace of believing in Christ, the revealer of the Father and the
Saviour of the world, have a duty to show to what depths the
relationship with Christ can lead.

The great mystical tradition of the Church of both East and West has
much to say in this regard. It shows how prayer can progress, as a
genuine dialogue of love, to the point of rendering the person wholly
possessed by the divine Beloved, vibrating at the Spirit's touch,
resting filially within the Father's heart. This is the lived
experience of Christ's promise: "He who loves me will be loved by my
Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him" (Jn 14:21). It
is a journey totally sustained by grace, which nonetheless demands an
intense spiritual commitment and is no stranger to painful
purifications (the "dark night"). But it leads, in various possible
ways, to the ineffable joy experienced by the mystics as "nuptial
union". How can we forget here, among the many shining examples, the
teachings of Saint John of the Cross and Saint Teresa of Avila?

Yes, dear brothers and sisters, our Christian communities must become
genuine "schools" of prayer, where the meeting with Christ is expressed
not just in imploring help but also in thanksgiving, praise, adoration,
contemplation, listening and ardent devotion, until the heart truly
"falls in love". Intense prayer, yes, but it does not distract us from
our commitment to history: by opening our heart to the love of God it
also opens it to the love of our brothers and sisters, and makes us
capable of shaping history according to God's plan.18

34. Christians who have received the gift of a vocation to the
specially consecrated life are of course called to prayer in a
particular way: of its nature, their consecration makes them more open
to the experience of contemplation, and it is important that they
should cultivate it with special care. But it would be wrong to think
that ordinary Christians can be content with a shallow prayer that is
unable to fill their whole life. Especially in the face of the many
trials to which today's world subjects faith, they would be not only
mediocre Christians but "Christians at risk". They would run the
insidious risk of seeing their faith progressively undermined, and
would perhaps end up succumbing to the allure of "substitutes",
accepting alternative religious proposals and even indulging in
far-fetched superstitions.

It is therefore essential that education in prayer should become in
some way a key-point of all pastoral planning. I myself have decided to
dedicate the forthcoming Wednesday catecheses to reflection upon the
Psalms, beginning with the Psalms of Morning Prayer with which the
public prayer of the Church invites us to consecrate and direct our
day. How helpful it would be if not only in religious communities but
also in parishes more were done to ensure an all-pervading climate of
prayer. With proper discernment, this would require that popular piety
be given its proper place, and that people be educated especially in
liturgical prayer. Perhaps it is more thinkable than we usually presume
for the average day of a Christian community to combine the many forms
of pastoral life and witness in the world with the celebration of the
Eucharist and even the recitation of Lauds and Vespers. The experience
of many committed Christian groups, also those made up largely of lay
people, is ! proof of this.

The Sunday Eucharist

35. It is therefore obvious that our principal attention must be given
to the liturgy, "the summit towards which the Church's action tends and
at the same time the source from which comes all her strength".19 In
the twentieth century, especially since the Council, there has been a
great development in the way the Christian community celebrates the
Sacraments, especially the Eucharist. It is necessary to continue in
this direction, and to stress particularly the Sunday Eucharist and
Sunday itself experienced as a special day of faith, the day of the
Risen Lord and of the gift of the Spirit, the true weekly Easter.20 For
two thousand years, Christian time has been measured by the memory of
that "first day of the week" (Mk 16:2,9; Lk 24:1; Jn 20:1), when the
Risen Christ gave the Apostles the gift of peace and of the Spirit (cf.
Jn 20:19-23). The truth of Christ's Resurrection is the original fact
upon which Christian fa! ith is based (cf. 1 Cor 15:14), an event set
at the centre of the mystery of time, prefiguring the last day when
Christ will return in glory. We do not know what the new millennium has
in store for us, but we are certain that it is safe in the hands of
Christ, the "King of kings and Lord of lords" (Rev 19:16); and
precisely by celebrating his Passover not just once a year but every
Sunday, the Church will continue to show to every generation "the true
fulcrum of history, to which the mystery of the world's origin and its
final destiny leads".21

36. Following Dies Domini, I therefore wish to insist that sharing in
the Eucharist should really be the heart of Sunday for every baptized
person. It is a fundamental duty, to be fulfilled not just in order to
observe a precept but as something felt as essential to a truly
informed and consistent Christian life. We are entering a millennium
which already shows signs of being marked by a profound interweaving of
cultures and religions, even in countries which have been Christian for
many centuries. In many regions Christians are, or are becoming, a
"little flock" (Lk 12:32). This presents them with the challenge, often
in isolated and difficult situations, to bear stronger witness to the
distinguishing elements of their own identity. The duty to take part in
the Eucharist every Sunday is one of these. The Sunday Eucharist which
every week gathers Christians together as God's family round the table
of the Word and the Bread of Life, is also the most natural antidote
to! dispersion. It is the privileged place where communion is
ceaselessly proclaimed and nurtured. Precisely through sharing in the
Eucharist, the Lord's Day also becomes the Day of the Church,22 when
she can effectively exercise her role as the sacrament of unity.

The Sacrament of Reconciliation

37. I am also asking for renewed pastoral courage in ensuring that the
day-to-day teaching of Christian communities persuasively and
effectively presents the practice of the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
As you will recall, in 1984 I dealt with this subject in the
Post-Synodal Exhortation Reconciliatio et Paenitentia, which
synthesized the results of an Assembly of the Synod of Bishops devoted
to this question. My invitation then was to make every effort to face
the crisis of "the sense of sin" apparent in today's culture.23 But I
was even more insistent in calling for a rediscovery of Christ as
mysterium pietatis, the one in whom God shows us his compassionate
heart and reconciles us fully with himself. It is this face of Christ
that must be rediscovered through the Sacrament of Penance, which for
the faithful is "the ordinary way of obtaining forgiveness and the
remission of serious sins committed after [15]Baptism".24 When the
Synod addressed the problem, the crisis of the Sacrament was there for
all to see, especially in some parts of the world. The causes of the
crisis have not disappeared in the brief span of time since then. But
the Jubilee Year, which has been particularly marked by a return to the
Sacrament of Penance, has given us an encouraging message, which should
not be ignored: if many people, and among them also many young people,
have benefited from approaching this Sacrament, it is probably
necessary that Pastors should arm themselves with more confidence,
creativity and perseverance in presenting it and leading people to
appreciate it. Dear brothers in the priesthood, we must not give in to
passing crises! The Lord's gifts -- and the Sacraments are among the
most precious -- come from the One who well knows the human heart and
is the Lord of history.

The primacy of grace

38. If in the planning that awaits us we commit ourselves more
confidently to a pastoral activity that gives personal and communal
prayer its proper place, we shall be observing an essential principle
of the Christian view of life: the primacy of grace. There is a
temptation which perennially besets every spiritual journey and
pastoral work: that of thinking that the results depend on our ability
to act and to plan. God of course asks us really to cooperate with his
grace, and therefore invites us to invest all our resources of
intelligence and energy in serving the cause of the Kingdom. But it is
fatal to forget that "without Christ we can do nothing" (cf. Jn 15:5).

It is prayer which roots us in this truth. It constantly reminds us of
the primacy of Christ and, in union with him, the primacy of the
interior life and of holiness. When this principle is not respected, is
it any wonder that pastoral plans come to nothing and leave us with a
disheartening sense of frustration? We then share the experience of the
disciples in the Gospel story of the miraculous catch of fish: "We have
toiled all night and caught nothing" (Lk 5:5). This is the moment of
faith, of prayer, of conversation with God, in order to open our hearts
to the tide of grace and allow the word of Christ to pass through us in
all its power: Duc in altum! On that occasion, it was Peter who spoke
the word of faith: "At your word I will let down the nets" (ibid.). As
this millennium begins, allow the Successor of Peter to invite the
whole Church to make this act of faith, which expresses itself in a
renewed commitment to prayer.

Listening to the Word

39. There is no doubt that this primacy of holiness and prayer is
inconceivable without a renewed listening to the word of God. Ever
since the Second Vatican Council underlined the pre-eminent role of the
word of God in the life of the Church, great progress has certainly
been made in devout listening to Sacred Scripture and attentive study
of it. Scripture has its rightful place of honour in the public prayer
of the Church. Individuals and communities now make extensive use of
the Bible, and among lay people there are many who devote themselves to
Scripture with the valuable help of theological and biblical studies.
But it is above all the work of evangelization and catechesis which is
drawing new life from attentiveness to the word of God. Dear brothers
and sisters, this development needs to be consolidated and deepened,
also by making sure that every family has a Bible. It is especially
necessary that listening to the word of God should become a life-giving
encounter, in ! the ancient and ever valid tradition of lectio divina,
which draws from the biblical text the living word which questions,
directs and shapes our lives.

Proclaiming the Word

40. To nourish ourselves with the word in order to be "servants of the
word" in the work of evangelization: this is surely a priority for the
Church at the dawn of the new millennium. Even in countries evangelized
many centuries ago, the reality of a "Christian society" which, amid
all the frailties which have always marked human life, measured itself
explicitly on Gospel values, is now gone. Today we must courageously
face a situation which is becoming increasingly diversified and
demanding, in the context of "globalization" and of the consequent new
and uncertain mingling of peoples and cultures. Over the years, I have
often repeated the summons to the new evangelization. I do so again
now, especially in order to insist that we must rekindle in ourselves
the impetus of the beginnings and allow ourselves to be filled with the
ardour of the apostolic preaching which followed Pentecost. We must
revive in ourselves the burning conviction of Paul, who cried out: "Woe
to me if I! do not preach the Gospel" (1 Cor 9:16).

This passion will not fail to stir in the Church a new sense of
mission, which cannot be left to a group of "specialists" but must
involve the responsibility of all the members of the People of God.
Those who have come into genuine contact with Christ cannot keep him
for themselves, they must proclaim him. A new apostolic outreach is
needed, which will be lived as the everyday commitment of Christian
communities and groups. This should be done however with the respect
due to the different paths of different people and with sensitivity to
the diversity of cultures in which the Christian message must be
planted, in such a way that the particular values of each people will
not be rejected but purified and brought to their fullness.

In the Third Millennium, Christianity will have to respond ever more
effectively to this need for inculturation. Christianity, while
remaining completely true to itself, with unswerving fidelity to the
proclamation of the Gospel and the tradition of the Church, will also
reflect the different faces of the cultures and peoples in which it is
received and takes root. In this Jubilee Year, we have rejoiced in a
special way in the beauty of the Church's varied face. This is perhaps
only a beginning, a barely sketched image of the future which the
Spirit of God is preparing for us.

Christ must be presented to all people with confidence. We shall
address adults, families, young people, children, without ever hiding
the most radical demands of the Gospel message, but taking into account
each person's needs in regard to their sensitivity and language, after
the example of Paul who declared: "I have become all things to all men,
that I might by all means save some" (1 Cor 9:22). In making these
recommendations, I am thinking especially of the pastoral care of young
people. Precisely in regard to young people, as I said earlier, the
Jubilee has given us an encouraging testimony of their generous
availability. We must learn to interpret that heartening response, by
investing that enthusiasm like a new talent (cf. Mt 25:15) which the
Lord has put into our hands so that we can make it yield a rich return.

41. May the shining example of the many witnesses to the faith whom we
have remembered during the Jubilee sustain and guide us in this
confident, enterprising and creative sense of mission. For the Church,
the martyrs have always been a seed of life. Sanguis martyrum semen
christianorum:25 this famous "law" formulated by Tertullian has proved
true in all the trials of history. Will this not also be the case of
the century and millennium now beginning? Perhaps we were too used to
thinking of the martyrs in rather distant terms, as though they were a
category of the past, associated especially with the first centuries of
the Christian era. The Jubilee remembrance has presented us with a
surprising vista, showing us that our own time is particularly prolific
in witnesses, who in different ways were able to live the Gospel in the
midst of hostility and persecution, often to the point of the supreme
test of shedding their blood. In them the wor! d of God, sown in good
soil, yielded a hundred fold (cf. Mt 13:8, 23). By their example they
have shown us, and made smooth for us, so to speak, the path to the
future. All that remains for us is, with God's grace, to follow in
their footsteps.

IV. WITNESSES TO LOVE

42. "By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love
for one another" (Jn 13:35). If we have truly contemplated the face of
Christ, dear Brothers and Sisters, our pastoral planning will
necessarily be inspired by the "new commandment" which he gave us:
"Love one another, as I have loved you" (Jn 13:34).

This is the other important area in which there has to be commitment
and planning on the part of the universal Church and the particular
Churches: the domain of communion (koinonia), which embodies and
reveals the very essence of the mystery of the Church. Communion is the
fruit and demonstration of that love which springs from the heart of
the Eternal Father and is poured out upon us through the Spirit which
Jesus gives us (cf. Rom 5:5), to make us all "one heart and one soul"
(Acts 4:32). It is in building this communion of love that the Church
appears as "sacrament", as the "sign and instrument of intimate union
with God and of the unity of the human race".26

The Lord's words on this point are too precise for us to diminish their
import. Many things are necessary for the Church's journey through
history, not least in this new century; but without charity (agape),
all will be in vain. It is again the Apostle Paul who in the hymn to
love reminds us: even if we speak the tongues of men and of angels, and
if we have faith "to move mountains", but are without love, all will
come to "nothing" (cf. 1 Cor 13:2). Love is truly the "heart" of the
Church, as was well understood by Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, whom I
proclaimed a [16]Doctor of the Church precisely because she is an
expert in the scientia amoris: "I understood that the Church had a
Heart and that this Heart was aflame with Love. I understood that Love
alone stirred the members of the Church to act... I understood that
Love encompassed all vocations, that Love was everything".27

A spirituality of communion

43. To make the Church the home and the school of communion: that is
the great challenge facing us in the millennium which is now beginning,
if we wish to be faithful to God's plan and respond to the world's
deepest yearnings.

But what does this mean in practice? Here too, our thoughts could run
immediately to the action to be undertaken, but that would not be the
right impulse to follow. Before making practical plans, we need to
promote a spirituality of communion, making it the guiding principle of
education wherever individuals and Christians are formed, wherever
ministers of the altar, consecrated persons, and pastoral workers are
trained, wherever families and communities are being built up. A
spirituality of communion indicates above all the heart's contemplation
of the mystery of the Trinity dwelling in us, and whose light we must
also be able to see shining on the face of the brothers and sisters
around us. A spirituality of communion also means an ability to think
of our brothers and sisters in faith within the profound unity of the
Mystical Body, and therefore as "those who are a part of me". This
makes us able to share their joys and sufferings, to sense their
desires and attend to thei! r needs, to offer them deep and genuine
friendship. A spirituality of communion implies also the ability to see
what is positive in others, to welcome it and prize it as a gift from
God: not only as a gift for the brother or sister who has received it
directly, but also as a "gift for me". A spirituality of communion
means, finally, to know how to "make room" for our brothers and
sisters, bearing "each other's burdens" (Gal 6:2) and resisting the
selfish temptations which constantly beset us and provoke competition,
careerism, distrust and jealousy. Let us have no illusions: unless we
follow this spiritual path, external structures of communion will serve
very little purpose. They would become mechanisms without a soul,
"masks" of communion rather than its means of expression and growth.

44. Consequently, the new century will have to see us more than ever
intent on valuing and developing the forums and structures which, in
accordance with the Second Vatican Council's major directives, serve to
ensure and safeguard communion. How can we forget in the first place
those specific services to communion which are the Petrine ministry
and, closely related to it, episcopal collegiality? These are realities
which have their foundation and substance in Christ's own plan for the
Church,28 but which need to be examined constantly in order to ensure
that they follow their genuinely evangelical inspiration.

Much has also been done since the Second Vatican Council for the reform
of the Roman Curia, the organization of Synods and the functioning of
Episcopal Conferences. But there is certainly much more to be done, in
order to realize all the potential of these instruments of communion,
which are especially appropriate today in view of the need to respond
promptly and effectively to the issues which the Church must face in
these rapidly changing times.

45. Communion must be cultivated and extended day by day and at every
level in the structures of each Church's life. There, relations between
Bishops, priests and deacons, between Pastors and the entire People of
God, between clergy and Religious, between associations and ecclesial
movements must all be clearly characterized by communion. To this end,
the structures of participation envisaged by Canon Law, such as the
Council of Priests and the Pastoral Council, must be ever more highly
valued. These of course are not governed by the rules of parliamentary
democracy, because they are consultative rather than deliberative;29
yet this does not mean that they are less meaningful and relevant. The
theology and spirituality of communion encourage a fruitful dialogue
between Pastors and faithful: on the one hand uniting them a priori in
all that is essential, and on the other leading them to pondered
agreement in matters open to discussion.

To this end, we need to make our own the ancient pastoral wisdom which,
without prejudice to their authority, encouraged Pastors to listen more
widely to the entire People of God. Significant is Saint Benedict's
reminder to the Abbot of a monastery, inviting him to consult even the
youngest members of the community: "By the Lord's inspiration, it is
often a younger person who knows what is best".30 And Saint Paulinus of
Nola urges: "Let us listen to what all the faithful say, because in
every one of them the Spirit of God breathes".31

While the wisdom of the law, by providing precise rules for
participation, attests to the hierarchical structure of the Church and
averts any temptation to arbitrariness or unjustified claims, the
spirituality of communion, by prompting a trust and openness wholly in
accord with the dignity and responsibility of every member of the
People of God, supplies institutional reality with a soul.

The diversity of vocations

46. Such a vision of communion is closely linked to the Christian
community's ability to make room for all the gifts of the Spirit. The
unity of the Church is not uniformity, but an organic blending of
legitimate diversities. It is the reality of many members joined in a
single body, the one Body of Christ (cf. 1 Cor 12:12). Therefore the
Church of the Third Millennium will need to encourage all the baptized
and confirmed to be aware of the their active responsibility in the
Church's life. Together with the ordained ministry, other ministries,
whether formally instituted or simply recognized, can flourish for the
good of the whole community, sustaining it in all its many needs: from
catechesis to liturgy, from the education of the young to the widest
array of charitable works.

Certainly, a generous commitment is needed -- above all through
insistent prayer to the Lord of the harvest (cf. Mt 9:38) -- in
promoting vocations to the priesthood and consecrated life. This is a
question of great relevance for the life of the Church in every part of
the world. In some traditionally Christian countries, the situation has
become dramatic, due to changed social circumstances and a religious
disinterest resulting from the consumer and secularist mentality. There
is a pressing need to implement an extensive plan of vocational
promotion, based on personal contact and involving parishes, schools
and families in the effort to foster a more attentive reflection on
life's essential values. These reach their fulfilment in the response
which each person is invited to give to God's call, particularly when
the call implies a total giving of self and of one's energies to the
cause of the Kingdom.

It is in this perspective that we see the value of all other vocations,
rooted as they are in the new life received in the Sacrament of
[17]Baptism. In a special way it will be necessary to discover ever
more fully the specific vocation of the laity, called "to seek the
kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and by ordering them
according to the plan of God";32 they "have their own role to play in
the mission of the whole people of God in the Church and in the world
... by their work for the evangelization and the sanctification of
people".33

Along these same lines, another important aspect of communion is the
promotion of forms of association, whether of the more traditional kind
or the newer ecclesial movements, which continue to give the Church a
vitality that is God's gift and a true "springtime of the Spirit".
Obviously, associations and movements need to work in full harmony
within both the universal Church and the particular Churches, and in
obedience to the authoritative directives of the Pastors. But the
Apostle's exacting and decisive warning applies to all: "Do not quench
the Spirit, do not despise prophesying, but test everything and hold
fast what is good" (1 Th 5:19-21).

47. At a time in history like the present, special attention must also
be given to the pastoral care of the family, particularly when this
fundamental institution is experiencing a radical and widespread
crisis. In the Christian view of marriage, the relationship between a
man and a woman -- a mutual and total bond, unique and indissoluble --
is part of God's original plan, obscured throughout history by our
"hardness of heart", but which Christ came to restore to its pristine
splendour, disclosing what had been God's will "from the beginning" (Mt
19:8). Raised to the dignity of a Sacrament, marriage expresses the
"great mystery" of Christ's nuptial love for his Church (cf. Eph 5:32).

On this point the Church cannot yield to cultural pressures, no matter
how widespread and even militant they may be. Instead, it is necessary
to ensure that through an ever more complete Gospel formation Christian
families show convincingly that it is possible to live marriage fully
in keeping with God's plan and with the true good of the human person
-- of the spouses, and of the children who are more fragile. Families
themselves must become increasingly conscious of the care due to
children, and play an active role in the Church and in society in
safeguarding their rights.

Ecumenical commitment

48. And what should we say of the urgent task of fostering communion in
the delicate area of ecumenism? Unhappily, as we cross the threshold of
the new millennium, we take with us the sad heritage of the past. The
Jubilee has offered some truly moving and prophetic signs, but there is
still a long way to go.

By fixing our gaze on Christ, the Great Jubilee has given us a more
vivid sense of the Church as a mystery of unity. "I believe in the one
Church": what we profess in the Creed has its ultimate foundation in
Christ, in whom the Church is undivided (cf. 1 Cor 1:11-13). As his
Body, in the unity which is the gift of the Spirit, she is indivisible.
The reality of division among the Church's children appears at the
level of history, as the result of human weakness in the way we accept
the gift which flows endlessly from Christ the Head to his Mystical
Body. The prayer of Jesus in the Upper Room -- "as you, Father, are in
me and I in you, that they also may be one in us" (Jn 17:21) -- is both
revelation and invocation. It reveals to us the unity of Christ with
the Father as the wellspring of the Church's unity and as the gift
which in him she will constantly receive until its mysterious
fulfilment the end of time. This unity is concretely embodied in the
Catholic Church, despite ! the human limitations of her members, and it
is at work in varying degrees in all the elements of holiness and truth
to be found in the other Churches and Ecclesial Communities. As gifts
properly belonging to the Church of Christ, these elements lead them
continuously towards full unity.34

Christ's prayer reminds us that this gift needs to be received and
developed ever more profoundly. The invocation "ut unum sint" is, at
one and the same time, a binding imperative, the strength that sustains
us, and a salutary rebuke for our slowness and closed-heartedness. It
is on Jesus's prayer and not on our own strength that we base the hope
that even within history we shall be able to reach full and visible
communion with all Christians.

In the perspective of our renewed post-Jubilee pilgrimage, I look with
great hope to the Eastern Churches, and I pray for a full return to
that exchange of gifts which enriched the Church of the first
millennium. May the memory of the time when the Church breathed with
"both lungs" spur Christians of East and West to walk together in unity
of faith and with respect for legitimate diversity, accepting and
sustaining each other as members of the one Body of Christ.

A similar commitment should lead to the fostering of ecumenical
dialogue with our brothers and sisters belonging to the [18]Anglican
Communion and the Ecclesial Communities born of the Reformation.
Theological discussion on essential points of faith and Christian
morality, cooperation in works of charity, and above all the great
ecumenism of holiness will not fail, with God's help, to bring results.
In the meantime we confidently continue our pilgrimage, longing for the
time when, together with each and every one of Christ's followers, we
shall be able to join wholeheartedly in singing: "How good and how
pleasant it is, when brothers live in unity!" (Ps 133:1).

Stake everything on charity

49. Beginning with intra-ecclesial communion, charity of its nature
opens out into a service that is universal; it inspires in us a
commitment to practical and concrete love for every human being. This
too is an aspect which must clearly mark the Christian life, the
Church's whole activity and her pastoral planning. The century and the
millennium now beginning will need to see, and hopefully with still
greater clarity, to what length of dedication the Christian community
can go in charity towards the poorest. If we have truly started out
anew from the contemplation of Christ, we must learn to see him
especially in the faces of those with whom he himself wished to be
identified: "I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you
gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and
you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you
came to me" (Mt 25:35-37). This Gospel text is not a simple invitation
to charity: it is a page of Chris! tology which sheds a ray of light on
the mystery of Christ. By these words, no less than by the orthodoxy of
her doctrine, the Church measures her fidelity as the Bride of Christ.

Certainly we need to remember that no one can be excluded from our
love, since "through his Incarnation the Son of God has united himself
in some fashion with every person".35 Yet, as the unequivocal words of
the Gospel remind us, there is a special presence of Christ in the
poor, and this requires the Church to make a preferential option for
them. This option is a testimony to the nature of God's love, to his
providence and mercy; and in some way history is still filled with the
seeds of the Kingdom of God which Jesus himself sowed during his
earthly life whenever he responded to those who came to him with their
spiritual and material needs.

50. In our own time, there are so many needs which demand a
compassionate response from Christians. Our world is entering the new
millennium burdened by the contradictions of an economic, cultural and
technological progress which offers immense possibilities to a
fortunate few, while leaving millions of others not only on the margins
of progress but in living conditions far below the minimum demanded by
human dignity. How can it be that even today there are still people
dying of hunger? Condemned to illiteracy? Lacking the most basic
medical care? Without a roof over their heads?

The scenario of poverty can extend indefinitely, if in addition to its
traditional forms we think of its newer patterns. These latter often
affect financially affluent sectors and groups which are nevertheless
threatened by despair at the lack of meaning in their lives, by drug
addiction, by fear of abandonment in old age or sickness, by
marginalization or social discrimination. In this context Christians
must learn to make their act of faith in Christ by discerning his voice
in the cry for help that rises from this world of poverty. This means
carrying on the tradition of charity which has expressed itself in so
many different ways in the past two millennia, but which today calls
for even greater resourcefulness. Now is the time for a new
"creativity" in charity, not only by ensuring that help is effective
but also by "getting close" to those who suffer, so that the hand that
helps is seen not as a humiliating handout but as a sharing between
brothers and sisters.

We must therefore ensure that in every Christian community the poor
feel at home. Would not this approach be the greatest and most
effective presentation of the good news of the Kingdom? Without this
form of evangelization through charity and without the witness of
Christian poverty the proclamation of the Gospel, which is itself the
prime form of charity, risks being misunderstood or submerged by the
ocean of words which daily engulfs us in today's society of mass
communications. The charity of works ensures an unmistakable efficacy
to the charity of words.

Today's challenges

51. And how can we remain indifferent to the prospect of an ecological
crisis which is making vast areas of our planet uninhabitable and
hostile to humanity? Or by the problems of peace, so often threatened
by the spectre of catastrophic wars? Or by contempt for the fundamental
human rights of so many people, especially children? Countless are the
emergencies to which every Christian heart must be sensitive.

A special commitment is needed with regard to certain aspects of the
Gospel's radical message which are often less well understood, even to
the point of making the Church's presence unpopular, but which
nevertheless must be a part of her mission of charity. I am speaking of
the duty to be committed to respect for the life of every human being,
from conception until natural death. Likewise, the service of humanity
leads us to insist, in season and out of season, that those using the
latest advances of science, especially in the field of biotechnology,
must never disregard fundamental ethical requirements by invoking a
questionable solidarity which eventually leads to discriminating
between one life and another and ignoring the dignity which belongs to
every human being.

For Christian witness to be effective, especially in these delicate and
controversial areas, it is important that special efforts be made to
explain properly the reasons for the Church's position, stressing that
it is not a case of imposing on non-believers a vision based on faith,
but of interpreting and defending the values rooted in the very nature
of the human person. In this way charity will necessarily become
service to culture, politics, the economy and the family, so that the
fundamental principles upon which depend the destiny of human beings
and the future of civilization will be everywhere respected.

52. Clearly, all this must be done in a specifically Christian way: the
laity especially must be present in these areas in fulfilment of their
lay vocation, without ever yielding to the temptation to turn Christian
communities into mere social agencies. In particular, the Church's
relationship with civil society should respect the latter's autonomy
and areas of competence, in accordance with the teachings of the
Church's social doctrine.

Well known are the efforts made by the Church's teaching authority,
especially in the twentieth century, to interpret social realities in
the light of the Gospel and to offer in a timely and systematic way its
contribution to the social question, which has now assumed a global
dimension.

The ethical and social aspect of the question is an essential element
of Christian witness: we must reject the temptation to offer a
privatized and individualistic spirituality which ill accords with the
demands of charity, to say nothing of the implications of the
Incarnation and, in the last analysis, of Christianity's eschatological
tension. While that tension makes us aware of the relative character of
history, it in no way implies that we withdraw from "building" history.
Here the teaching of the Second Vatican Council is more timely than
ever: "The Christian message does not inhibit men and women from
building up the world, or make them disinterested in the welfare of
their fellow human beings: on the contrary it obliges them more fully
to do these very things".36

A practical sign

53. In order to give a sign of this commitment to charity and human
promotion, rooted in the most basic demands of the Gospel, I have
resolved that the Jubilee year, in addition to the great harvest of
charity which it has already yielded -- here I am thinking in
particular of the help given to so many of our poorer brothers and
sisters to enable them to take part in the Jubilee -- should leave an
endowment which would in some way be the fruit and seal of the love
sparked by the Jubilee. Many pilgrims have made an offering and many
leaders in the financial sector have joined in providing generous
assistance which has helped to ensure a fitting celebration of the
Jubilee. Once the expenses of this year have been covered, the money
saved will be dedicated to charitable purposes. It is important that
such a major religious event should be completely dissociated from any
semblance of financial gain. Whatever money remains will be used to
continue the experience so often repeated! since the very beginning of
the Church, when the Jerusalem community offered non-Christians the
moving sight of a spontaneous exchange of gifts, even to the point of
holding all things in common, for the sake of the poor (cf. Acts
2:44-45).

The endowment to be established will be but a small stream flowing into
the great river of Christian charity that courses through history. A
small but significant stream: because of the Jubilee the world has
looked to Rome, the Church "which presides in charity"37 and has
brought its gifts to Peter. Now the charity displayed at the centre of
Catholicism will in some way flow back to the world through this sign,
which is meant to be an enduring legacy and remembrance of the
communion experienced during the Jubilee.

Dialogue and mission

54. A new century, a new millennium are opening in the light of Christ.
But not everyone can see this light. Ours is the wonderful and
demanding task of becoming its "reflection". This is the mysterium
lunae, which was so much a part of the contemplation of the Fathers of
the Church, who employed this image to show the Church's dependence on
Christ, the Sun whose light she reflects.38 It was a way of expressing
what Christ himself said when he called himself the "light of the
world" (Jn 8:12) and asked his disciples to be "the light of the world"
(Mt 5:14).

This is a daunting task if we consider our human weakness, which so
often renders us opaque and full of shadows. But it is a task which we
can accomplish if we turn to the light of Christ and open ourselves to
the grace which makes us a new creation.

55. It is in this context also that we should consider the great
challenge of inter-religious dialogue to which we shall still be
committed in the new millennium, in fidelity to the teachings of the
Second Vatican Council.39 In the years of preparation for the Great
Jubilee the Church has sought to build, not least through a series of
highly symbolic meetings, a relationship of openness and dialogue with
the followers of other religions. This dialogue must continue. In the
climate of increased cultural and religious pluralism which is expected
to mark the society of the new millennium, it is obvious that this
dialogue will be especially important in establishing a sure basis for
peace and warding off the dread spectre of those wars of religion which
have so often bloodied human history. The name of the one God must
become increasingly what it is: a name of peace and a summons to peace.

56. Dialogue, however, cannot be based on religious indifferentism, and
we Christians are in duty bound, while engaging in dialogue, to bear
clear witness to the hope that is within us (cf. 1 Pt 3:15). We should
not fear that it will be considered an offence to the identity of
others what is rather the joyful proclamation of a gift meant for all,
and to be offered to all with the greatest respect for the freedom of
each one: the gift of the revelation of the God who is Love, the God
who "so loved the world that he gave his only Son" (Jn 3:16). As the
recent Declaration Dominus Iesus stressed, this cannot be the subject
of a dialogue understood as negotiation, as if we considered it a
matter of mere opinion: rather, it is a grace which fills us with joy,
a message which we have a duty to proclaim.

The Church therefore cannot forgo her missionary activity among the
peoples of the world. It is the primary task of the missio ad gentes to
announce that it is in Christ, "the Way, and the Truth, and the Life"
(Jn 14:6), that people find salvation. Interreligious dialogue "cannot
simply replace proclamation, but remains oriented towards
proclamation".40 This missionary duty, moreover, does not prevent us
from approaching dialogue with an attitude of profound willingness to
listen. We know in fact that, in the presence of the mystery of grace,
infinitely full of possibilities and implications for human life and
history, the Church herself will never cease putting questions,
trusting in the help of the Paraclete, the Spirit of truth (cf. Jn
14:17), whose task it is to guide her "into all the truth" (Jn 16:13).

This is a fundamental principle not only for the endless theological
investigation of Christian truth, but also for Christian dialogue with
other philosophies, cultures and religions. In the common experience of
humanity, for all its contradictions, the Spirit of God, who "blows
where he wills" (Jn 3:8), not infrequently reveals signs of his
presence which help Christ's followers to understand more deeply the
message which they bear. Was it not with this humble and trust-filled
openness that the Second Vatican Council sought to read "the signs of
the times"?41 Even as she engages in an active and watchful discernment
aimed at understanding the "genuine signs of the presence or the
purpose of God",42 the Church acknowledges that she has not only given,
but has also "received from the history and from the development of the
human race".43 This attitude of openness, combined with careful disc!
ernment, was adopted by the Council also in relation to other
religions. It is our task to follow with great fidelity the Council's
teaching and the path which it has traced.

In the light of the Council

57. What a treasure there is, dear brothers and sisters, in the
guidelines offerred to us by the Second Vatican Council! For this
reason I asked the Church, as a way of preparing for the Great Jubilee,
to examine herself on the reception given to the Council.44 Has this
been done? The Congress held here in the Vatican was such a moment of
reflection, and I hope that similar efforts have been made in various
ways in all the particular Churches. With the passing of the years, the
Council documents have lost nothing of their value or brilliance. They
need to be read correctly, to be widely known and taken to heart as
important and normative texts of the Magisterium, within the Church's
Tradition. Now that the Jubilee has ended, I feel more than ever in
duty bound to point to the Council as the great grace bestowed on the
Church in the twentieth century: there we find a sure compass by which
to take our bearings in the century now beginning.

CONCLUSION
DUC IN ALTUM!

58. Let us go forward in hope! A new millennium is opening before the
Church like a vast ocean upon which we shall venture, relying on the
help of Christ. The Son of God, who became incarnate two thousand years
ago out of love for humanity, is at work even today: we need discerning
eyes to see this and, above all, a generous heart to become the
instruments of his work. Did we not celebrate the Jubilee Year in order
to refresh our contact with this living source of our hope? Now, the
Christ whom we have contemplated and loved bids us to set out once more
on our journey: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit" (Mt 28:19). The missionary mandate accompanies us into the
Third Millennium and urges us to share the enthusiasm of the very first
Christians: we can count on the power of the same Spirit who was poured
out at Pentecost and who impels us still today to start out anew,
sustained by t! he hope "which does not disappoint" (Rom 5:5).

At the beginning of this new century, our steps must quicken as we
travel the highways of the world. Many are the paths on which each one
of us and each of our Churches must travel, but there is no distance
between those who are united in the same communion, the communion which
is daily nourished at the table of the Eucharistic Bread and the Word
of Life. Every Sunday, the Risen Christ asks us to meet him as it were
once more in the Upper Room where, on the evening of "the first day of
the week" (Jn 20:19) he appeared to his disciples in order to "breathe"
on them his life-giving Spirit and launch them on the great adventure
of proclaiming the Gospel.

On this journey we are accompanied by the Blessed Virgin Mary to whom,
a few months ago, in the presence of a great number of Bishops
assembled in Rome from all parts of the world, I entrusted the Third
Millennium. During this year I have often invoked her as the "Star of
the New Evangelization". Now I point to Mary once again as the radiant
dawn and sure guide for our steps. Once more, echoing the words of
Jesus himself and giving voice to the filial affection of the whole
Church, I say to her: "Woman, behold your children"(cf. Jn 19:26).

59. Dear brothers and sisters! The symbol of the Holy Door now closes
behind us, but only in order to leave more fully open the living door
which is Christ. After the enthusiasm of the Jubilee, it is not to a
dull everyday routine that we return. On the contrary, if ours has been
a genuine pilgrimage, it will have as it were stretched our legs for
the journey still ahead. We need to imitate the zeal of the Apostle
Paul: "Straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on towards the
goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil
3:13-14). Together, we must all imitate the contemplation of Mary, who
returned home to Nazareth from her pilgrimage to the Holy City of
Jerusalem, treasuring in her heart the mystery of her Son (cf. Lk
2:51).

The Risen Jesus accompanies us on our way and enables us to recognize
him, as the disciples of Emmaus did, "in the breaking of the bread" (Lk
24:35). May he find us watchful, ready to recognize his face and run to
our brothers and sisters with the good news: "We have seen the Lord!"
(Jn 20:25).

This will be the much desired fruit of the Jubilee of the Year 2000,
the Jubilee which has vividly set before our eyes once more the mystery
of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God and the Redeemer of man.

As the Jubilee now comes to a close and points us to a future of hope,
may the praise and thanksgiving of the whole Church rise to the Father,
through Christ, in the Holy Spirit.

In pledge of this, I impart to all of you my heartfelt Blessing.

From the Vatican, on 6 January, the Solemnity of the Epiphany, in the
year 2001, the twenty-third of my Pontificate.
