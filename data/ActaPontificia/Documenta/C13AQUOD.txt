A QUO DIE (On Unity Among Christians)
Pope Clement XIII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Clement XIII promulgated on 13 September 1758.

Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Blessing.

Since that day when the unbelievable and unexpected happened, when God
took Our unworthiness and placed it in the Holy See of St. Peter, the
summit of all the churches, We have been troubled by a bitter and
constant concern. A much heavier burden of sorrow has been placed on Us
than We are able to bear. We would certainly have given Ourselves over
to weeping if something had not deterred Us from this excessive sadness
- something similar to what happened to the most holy prophet, the
dynamic leader of Israel. Moses exclaimed to the Lord: "Why do you
treat your servant so badly? And why have you placed the weight of all
this people on me? I am not able to carry this nation by myself; the
weight is too much for me."[1] In order that Moses might not fail in
spirit and that he might bear the burden he had assumed, God commanded
him to gather seventy men from the elders of Israel. He granted the
spirit of Moses to them so that they could be teachers of the people
and share the burden with Moses. That same consolation alone sustains
Us now, Venerable Brothers. God himself chose you much sooner from
among the multitude of the faithful to care for souls. He gave you to
Us as Our helpers and assistants. When you were ordained to the
episcopacy, He abundantly filled you with His own spirit so that We
might be confident in the aid and excellence of God and supported by
your singular wisdom. You are on fire to fulfill your duties, and We
conclude that much of Our sorrow and concern has been removed.
Therefore, in order to find encouragement in our mutual faith[2] and to
arouse your sincere mind to remembrance,[3] We write this letter to
you. We know that you are ardent and upright against the foul enemy of
the human race and have organized yourselves as in a battle line.
Nevertheless We exhort you to meet the enemy more quickly and
courageously, to wage the war well. Standing in battle, may you fight
for the house of Israel.[4]

2. In so many and such dangerous battles, the hope of victory is that
much better and that much more certain if we preserve unity in the
close bond of peace.[5] Therefore, Venerable Brothers, may your love in
all its strength remove from the hearts of the faithful the seeds of
any kind of dissension. It is your responsibility that everybody seeks
peace,[6] that everybody searches for the elements of peace.[7] The
Lord Jesus, a short time before He gave himself up to die, said to His
apostles, "Peace I give you; my own peace I give you."[8] He does not
leave the inheritance of peace only to the apostles, but also to us. He
says "Not only for these but for those also who through their words
will believe in me. May they all be one, Father, may they be one in us
as you are in me and I am in you."[9] Venerable Brothers, see to it
that by eliminating spiritual dissensions, we constantly and
continually preserve so great and so precious an inheritance which the
Lord Jesus transmitted to us. The apostle says that the Holy Spirit is
a pledge of this inheritance. When we place ourselves before Him and
beseech Him to make holy the sacrifice of the Church, we ask nothing
more than that the bond of love be preserved unbroken in the Church by
spiritual grace. It is good for us all to remember that when the Lord
asked "who do men say the Son of Man is" and whom the disciples
believed He was, they answered that there were various opinions about
Him. But St. Peter confessed that He was the son of the living God, not
revealed by flesh and blood but by the Father.[10]

3. From this, you can easily see that there is a difference between the
sons of light and the sons of the world. The latter disagree among
themselves with various and diverse opinions, while the former,
initiated into the mysteries of unity, profess the one faith of all by
the mouth of one, through the head of all. Therefore, concentrate all
your attention on increasing peace among the faithful. Uproars,
contentions, rivalries, animosities, and dissensions should be
silenced.[11] In this way those who go by the name of Catholic can all
be perfect in the same sense, in the same opinion,[12] saying the same
thing together,[13] knowing the same thing and understanding it
thoroughly. They should understand that if they want to be members of
Christ, they cannot have concord with the head if they want to be in
disagreement with the members. Nor can those who have not lived in
fraternal love be counted as brothers by the Almighty Father.

4. The apostle shows us remarkable signs of love and reliable pointers,
so that nobody strays in a matter which contains the salvation of the
human race. He says: "Love is patient and kind; it is never jealous;
love is never boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it
does not take offense and is not resentful."[14] From this, we should
clearly understand that where love is absent, there reigns that malice
which we men have brought about from the beginning of the human race.
Arrogance and proud contempt, stubbornness and avarice, intolerance and
ambition, envy and the inordinate desire for glory-these and other
depravities of the spirit flare up from this like the torches of our
soul. All of these things are produced by the corruption of lust in the
world.[15]

5. Let swelling of the spirit and stubborn customs depart from
episcopal government. We who say we dwell in Christ should walk just as
He walked.[16] We should not seek an example anywhere else than from
the Lord Jesus, whom we should imitate. For when the disagreement among
the disciples arose about who should be reckoned the greatest, He said:
"Among pagans it is the kings who lord it over them. This must not
happen with you. No; the greatest among you must behave as the least;
the leader as if he were the one who serves. Here I am among you as one
who serves."[17] Therefore, just as the Lord Jesus Christ forbade the
apostles to rule, we believe that we have come not to rule the Church
but to serve it. May we concentrate all our thoughts, labors, and
counsels to that purpose, so that we might preserve safe and sound in
the Church those sheep entrusted to us by the Lord. We should desire
nothing more than their welfare.

6. Therefore, elders, We speak to you in the words of the prince of the
apostles: "I am an elder myself and a witness to the sufferings of
Christ, and with you I have a share in the glory that is to be
revealed. Be shepherds of the flock of God."[18] Watch over the sheep,
not like the hired hand who sees the wolf coming, abandons them, and
runs away,[19] but gladly, because God wants it.[20] Be like the
shepherd who gives his life for his sheep,[21] not for sordid money but
freely.[22] Do not lord over the clergy, but become examples for the
flock. There is no more offensive or dangerous poison than the desire
to rule. If a bishop is corrupted by this, it is inevitable that the
church entrusted to him will be shaken, if not destroyed. Therefore, a
bishop should not want to be powerful, but rather to be useful. Having
made himself an example for the flock, he should like a torch radiate
blameless conduct, moral integrity, piety, and religion. When the
people see this, they will walk happily and quickly in the way of the
Lord, for they will see that they have been given a leader and not a
master.

7. It is especially characteristic of love to be lifted up with joy
when someone in the Church of God flourishes in piety and learning,
someone who longs to save souls and fulfills his priestly duty with
industry, labor and diligence. We have often thought that such a man is
exposed to the envy of his neighbor.[23]. Every sane man sees that he
is being destroyed by the disparagement of the envious, and it is not
fitting that this happen. When Eldad and Medad were prophesying in the
camp,[24] Joshua, son of Nun, warned Moses that he should prohibit
them. Moses responded that he very much wanted everybody to prophesy.
He said: "are you jealous on my account? If only the whole people would
prophesy and the Lord gave his Spirit to them all!"[25] The love of the
bishop considers it a crime to burn with anger. It does not consider
the man led astray by harmful desires as an enemy but rather lays hold
of him as a brother, coaxing him, encouraging him, and warning him.[26]
It calls him back from error and leads him back to the path of
righteousness. If something should happen which requires a more serious
verbal castigation, beware lest the words cut too harshly. Let severity
abstain from every affront.

8. We cannot be silent concerning the useless desire for glory which a
certain bishop correctly called hidden destruction. Once it has shown
itself, there is perhaps nothing more hostile to love. Servility creeps
up on whatever bishop this deadly plague gets hold of and infects; it
attacks his most noble part, the soul. It captures him with its
poisonous flatteries and constantly besieges him. It drives the wretch
to the point that he no longer seeks the glory of God but only his own,
increasing enormously that distorted and excessive self-esteem by which
each of us is greatly deceived. Even the Lord Jesus denied that He
sought this.[27] Detraction and lying follow flattery as destructive
attendants and ministers, so that nothing is left safe and sound for
the eminent and virtuous men in the company of the bishop. For this
reason, Solomon in his wisdom warns that it is better to be seized by
wisdom than deceived by the flattery of fools.[25] He also says: "Turn
your back on the mouth that misleads; keep your distance from lips that
deceive."[29] Bishops should always keep this in mind: "When a ruler
listens to false reports, all his ministers will be scoundrels."[30] We
must stop being envious of glory.[31] Thus, glory will be the downfall
of those who think earthly things are important.[32] Let us look
higher-let us look upon that heavenly home of eternal glory. Let us not
think that our true, solid, and serious glory comes from the lips of
men.[33] We have all sinned, and we all need the glory of God. Having
died to our sins,[34] we should not glory in ourselves. The Father
should be glorified in the Son,[35] so that we might be filled with the
fruit of justice through Jesus Christ for the glory of God,[36] to whom
alone belong all glory, majesty, authority, and power.[37]

9. Among the fruits of justice, mercy to the poor should certainly be
considered the most important. That justice which comes from faith
belongs to Jesus Christ.[38] It is true that "if one of the brothers or
one of the sisters is in need of clothes and has not enough food to
live on, and one of you says to them, 'I wish you well; keep yourself
warm and eat plenty' without giving them these bare necessities of
life, then what good is that?"[39] Thus, the apostle James questions
all Christians. Every faithful person, especially everyone who is a
little more wealthy than the others, should out of mercy come to the
assistance of the poor. They require our generosity as their principal
right, for we hold the goods of the Church, which are the prayers of
the faithful, the price of sins, and the inheritance of the poor, not
as our own but as if in trust. It is not justifiable to use it for
ourselves in such a way that nothing remains for those who could
rightfully cry out, "What you spend is ours!" Where does such a great
abundance of things come to us from, if not from the gifts of the
Church? Like a bride, we should be content[40] with the good things we
receive, that is, food and shelter,[41] considering piety with
sufficiency as a great profit. It is certainly a special gift when it
replenishes more abundantly those things which we need to protect,
nourish, and embellish the bride. It is certainly everybody's great
gain, because we obtain grace from God by almsgiving. Our blind mind is
illuminated by it and we who are broken and fallen with a natural
weakness are raised up and supported. When we pour forth our souls in
desire and replenish our afflicted spirit, our light will rise in the
darkness and our shadows will become like noon, for the Lord will fill
our souls with his splendors.[42]

10. Actually to obtain light for the mind from God and to obtain the
grace and devotion without which the episcopal duties would languish,
almsgiving has great power. But it is no more efficacious than prayer
and the most holy sacrifice of the Mass. The apostle orders us to pray
without interruption and to give thanks to God in everything because it
is the will of God that we not extinguish the spirit of faith and
love.[43] This spirit helps us in our weakness and expresses our plea
through groans that could never be put into words.[44] If a certain
bishop needs wisdom, he should ask God for it and God will give it to
him.[45] Let him not hesitate to seek anything in faith. He should ask
that God arouse in his soul as great a faith as Moses had when he saw
the invisible God.[46] It is necessary to have humility to attain that
faith. David cried: "I am poor and needy. God help me."[47] These words
of the Lord show us how great is the power of perseverance and
persistence in prayer: "It is necessary to pray always without
ceasing."[48] In that constancy and perseverance, let us wait for the
majesty of God if there is a delay: it will appear and will not deceive
us because it comes gradually.[49] We should not be concerned only
about our weaknesses, but we should also consider that the problems of
others afflict us and are on the same level as our own. Our prayers
should be addressed more ardently and more perseveringly to God. It is
through this prayer that we obtain from the Lord, as a decisive
intermediary of the Church's faithful, the faith, hope, and love of
all-virtues which are necessary for each and every one of us and for
all the faithful in the world. The holy sacrifice of the Eucharist will
build the road for us to beseech God and will open the way to obtain
anything we want. For this reason, entangled in the great
preoccupations of our office, we shall not refuse to offer the holy
body and blood of Jesus Christ frequently to God. We do not think that
we have been given any greater task than to offer repeatedly a
sacrifice of appeasement to God the Father for our sins and those of
the faithful.

11. As We are in a certain manner intermediaries between God and
mankind, We offer to God the prayers of the people, and in the same way
We communicate the will of God to them. This is the will of God: Our
sanctification.[50] Thus it is Our duty to proclaim and reveal the
mystery of Christ,[51] just as it is fitting for Us to speak. It is
necessary, first of all to teach this to the people: The body of Christ
was similar to ours, with the exception of sin. It is not only but also
sanctifying, capable of suffering, exposed to death, and able to stand
in the stead of all of us. Christ offered his body, and us at the same
time, to satisfy divine justice.[52] He handed himself--and us at the
same time--to all the torments which our crimes merited. He was
condemned to the sorrows of death and suffered the curse given to
sinners by the law: death under the harshest tortures. He satisfied the
law, for the death and burial of Jesus Christ abolished all sin. The
Lord Jesus rose from the grave with the same flesh but it was stripped
of its mortality and adorned with glory of eternity. In order that they
may be justified, it is necessary for sinners to die with Christ, who
died in their place and in their name. Then they must enter the grave
with Christ, in order to leave behind the flesh defiled by sin. They
must hand over the old man to the wrath of God and to the death of the
sinner, so that by baptism a new man might return to life in us and
live again with Christ in immortality and eternal glory. Therefore all
Christians should think about that eternal life and not this brief one.
They should remove from their hearts the desire for pleasures and
riches which are the instruments of pleasure. Cast off pride, in which
all harmful desires are contained. The world is passing away, as well
as what it craves for; however, he who keeps the will of God will
endure forever.[53]

12. You can easily see, Venerable Brothers, how important it is for you
yourselves to teach the people these and all other things which pertain
to God's mysteries. Therefore, you should carefully consider that those
whom you choose to exercise the priestly ministry and to teach the
people the fundamentals of Christianity should possess great purity of
life, moral integrity, chastity, justice, piety, and devotion. How
serious it would be if something bad, if something vicious, if
something perverse were to infect their character with bad habits.
Cautiously and prudently remove this danger from the pastors. Help and
instruct each of your neighbors with salutary advice. Give the soul of
the faithful wings with which to fly from the earth to contemplate
heavenly matters; once it is snatched away from the world, give that
soul to God and recall the divine image in it to its original purity.
On the other hand, it should not be said that pastors who ask to give
an account of their lives cannot themselves bear this scrutiny. Nor
should they reproach the character of another, so that they themselves
must be contradicted. The learning which is perceived as worthy of a
clergyman should attain pure and holy habits. They should have a
knowledge of the Scriptures: "All Scripture is inspired by God and can
profitably be used for teaching, for refuting error, for guiding
people's lives and teaching them to be holy that the man of God may be
complete, equipped for every good work."[54] They should go to both
testaments of the Bible, to the traditions of the Church, and to the
writings of the holy fathers, as if they were going to springs from
which pours forth a pure and undefiled teaching of faith and character.
They should read often and reflect upon the Roman Catechism, the
summation of Catholic teaching, which provides holy sermons to give to
the faithful.

13. In considering someone's suitability for the ministry, do not rely
only on individual enthusiasm or on someone's recommendation. You
should consider as best suited to be a faithful minister and to receive
a part of the Lord's flock the man whose timid virtue shirks the
ministry. "Do not be too quick to lay hands on any man"[55] which
happens if we do not consider and test the men over and over again.
Lest we pay the price to God for imprudent rashness and share in
another's sin,[56] let him be tested carefully and accurately and
judged severely. It should not weary you if We dwell a little longer on
this matter which requires great attention. In whatever manner the
priests behave, the majority of the people will behave in the same way.
Everyone looks upon them--especially if they are parish priests--as if
in a mirror. For this reason, nobody deserves anything more destructive
from the Church than evil priests, who infect the people with their
vices and so corrupt the Church that they seem to harm it more by their
example than by their sin.

14. Associate with distinguished men in the sacred ministry, not
because we consider ourselves inadequate in the duty of preaching the
gospel, but rather so that we might seem to leave in the hands of
others the nets which the Lord gave to us to become fishers of men.[57]
The principal duty of the bishop is to preach the word of God, for the
apostle cried: "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. It is a duty
which has been laid on me."[58] The Lord Jesus Christ did not send him
primarily to baptize- -even though this is a holy action--but
especially to preach the gospel.[59] We know that the ministry of the
word held first place in the minds of the apostles and that these holy
men did not neglect this duty.[60] For this reason they thought it
fitting to entrust to deacons the rest of the charitable works toward
their neighbors. St. Paul writes to Timothy: "Make use of the time
until I arrive by reading to the people, preaching, and teaching."[61]
If someone feels that he lacks the ability to preach or says that his
talents do not measure up to the responsibility, do not allow him to
neglect his duty in other matters which pertain to the word of God.
Therefore, if the bishop commands the priests to teach the basics of
Christian doctrine to the children, he should also give his assistance
in that work. He should join himself as an assistant to the pastors in
teaching the faithful, so that his duty of preaching the word might be
preserved on all sides. This should make everybody hasten to fulfill
his duty. Thus, he should not feel it burdensome to administer the
sacraments to the faithful occasionally with his brother priests, to
enter the choir in the meantime and sing the psalms with the canons,
and to preside over the meetings which he has convened. From this the
priests will receive a great share in the spirit of his holy ministry,
just as the seventy men received the Spirit in the time of Moses. The
people who witness this will be filled with the greatest esteem for
divine worship, and the tainted men will be frightened away from the
sacred ministry by the same venerable spectacle, so that they will not
dare in the least to aspire to it.

15. Because the bishop cannot manage the Church and supervise his flock
if he is away, you should not be absent from your churches for any
length of time. This was solemnly ratified by natural law and by the
holy canons, especially by the decrees of the Council of Trent. The
bishop should visit all the places in his diocese to protect the power
of their laws when they begin to fail, either through the laziness of
the ministers or through the stubbornness of the faithful. If there is
a serious and necessary reason for you to leave your diocese and if it
is necessary to be absent for any length of time, We ask you not to
allow the Church to be weakened by the desire of her pastor. Whenever
you are absent, this danger is present.

16. In addition, example should accompany words. We should show
ourselves in all things as an example of good works[62] so that our
opponents will respect us and not have anything bad to say about
us.[63] Deeds should not be silent without words, nor should the lack
of deeds shame the words. In addition, we believe in our heart that the
perfect leader of the Church has been furnished with the perfect goods
of the greatest virtue, so that his life might be adorned by what he
says and his teaching by what he lives. The home of modesty should be
our own, as well as the teacher of modesty. The ecclesiastical
discipline which we follow should be full of dignity and harmony. If we
are not committed to anybody's will and pleasure, we will not indulge
in the softness and weakness of our spirit and we will not single out
anyone for special treatment. This often creates great turmoil in the
administration of the Church and gives serious offense, providing
contempt and envy for the bishop.

17. As for what concerns Us, We have already taken care[64] that We
establish as bishops in the various countries those who bring to the
episcopacy a sound doctrine, a life beyond reproach, and a mind
prepared for all things for the sake of Jesus Christ. We believe that
the responsibility should go to him who presides over it; let him not
swell up with the greatness of the honor but diminish in humility. In
scrutinizing and testing men whom We want to place over such a great
responsibility, We shall use you as witnesses and authorities, trusting
in the holy devotion of your testimony and in your faith. We do not
doubt in the least that you will not use any human rationale, but only
thoughts for Him who has called you to the work of the ministry for
building up the body of Christ.[65]

18. It remains, Venerable Brothers, that We advise you concerning the
fortitude and strength of spirit needed to oppose those things which
are against the orthodox faith, which harm piety or which damage the
integrity of moral living. Let us be strong in the spirit of the Lord,
in good judgment, and in courage.[66] We should not be like dumb
watchdogs unable to bark,[67] allowing our flocks to fall prey to
looting and our sheep to be devoured by every wild animal in the
field.[68] Nor should anything deter us from throwing ourselves into
battle for the glory of God and for the salvation of souls: "Think of
the way he endured such opposition from sinners."[69] If we are afraid
of the audacity of worthless men, it affects the strength of the
episcopacy and its sublime and divine power to govern the Church. Nor
can we Christians endure or exist any longer-if it has come to that-if
we become overly frightened by the snares or threats of the damned.
Therefore, trusting not in ourselves but in the God who raises the dead
to life,[70] we despise human affairs and cry out to the Lord: You are
my hope in the day of disaster.[71] Let us never be exhausted in body
or in spirit, for we are fellow workers with God.[72] The Lord Jesus is
with us always even to the end of time.[73] Therefore let us not be
weakened by scandal or persecution, lest we seem ungrateful for God's
favor, since his assistance is as strong as His promises are true.

19. In the Last Judgment We shall be called to give account on behalf
of everybody and before everybody who is reckoned in the name of
Christ. Therefore We beseech you that if some scandal or disagreement
arises which you are unable to put down, to refer it to this See of the
blessed Prince of the apostles. As from the head and apex of the
episcopacy, that very episcopacy and every authority which bears the
same name comes from here. All waters flow from here as if from their
very source, and they flow uncorrupted from a pure head through the
various regions of the whole world. From here all the churches take
what the water worthy of clean bodies avoids teaching and the people
whom, as though fouled in unpurged filth, the water avoids washing. We
trust first of all in the strength of God, then in the protection of
St. Peter, whose care holds all present. We shall help you with advice,
resources, and authority, for We are ready to be very near you,[74] to
keep the churches and the brothers safe and sound. As for the rest, We
trust in God under the weight of this burden we have received;[75]
since He is the originator of this burden, He will also help us. In
order that human weakness does not falter under the greatness of His
grace, He who gave the dignity will also give the strength. Meanwhile
in humble entreaty, beseech God in His merciful goodness to subdue now
those who fight against Us, to strengthen your faith, and to increase
devotion and peace. May He produce in Us, His humble servant, whom He
wanted to oversee the government of His Church and to show the riches
of His grace, enough strength in such a labor. May He make Us useful
for your protection, and may He strive to extend to Our Papacy what was
given to the age, for the profit of devotion. The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ be with you; We bless you and We greet you with a holy
kiss. We lovingly impart to all of you, brother priests, and to all the
faithful of your churches Our apostolic blessing. Given in Rome at St.
Mary Major on September 14, in the year 1758 in the first year of Our
pontificate.
