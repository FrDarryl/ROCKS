QUOD VOTIS (On the Proposed Catholic University)
Pope Leo XIII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII promulgated on 30 April 1902

To Our Beloved Sons Anthony Joseph Cardinal Gruscha, Archbishop of
Vienna; George Cardinal Kopp, Bishop of Wrodaw; Leo Cardinal De
Skrbensky, Archbishop of Prague; John Cardinal Puzyna, Bishop of
Cracow; and the Other Venerable Brother Archbishops and Bishops of
Austria.

Beloved Sons and Venerable Brothers, Greetings and the Apostolic
Blessing.

1. With great joy you now announce that the object of the wishes of
your predecessors, which has been worked on for many years, is speeding
to its happy conclusion. For whatever is required for founding a
Catholic University is all but at hand; it is your consensus that the
finishing touches can now be applied to setting up this great
Institution of learning. We have had to wait for it longer than We
might have hoped, but its completion has come about at a proper and
fitting time. Accordingly, We freely and with full approbation assent
to your plans, which in themselves are commendable. We wish to point
out explicitly in writing our great joy at this news, since We
encourage holy sets of learning to be established and enlarged
everywhere. Moreover, We declare this also to add an incentive to your
faithful to hasten the conclusion of so great an enterprise. As for the
details, We confide them to you; We have no doubts of the generosity
and approval of those for whose advantage the desired University will
come into existence. As soon as the details that pertain to this
Institution are ready, the Sacred Congregation of Studies should
communicate them to us: for their task is to inform Us of these affairs
and to use their mandated power of setting standards for Catholic
Institutions of learning according to the norms of the Sacred Canons.

2. Meanwhile We testify to each one of You Our happy and benevolent
sentiments, and We beseech divine favor on the work undertaken, and
bestow the Apostolic blessing on all of you.

Given in Rome at St. Peter's, 30 April 1902, in the 25th year of Our
Pontificate.
