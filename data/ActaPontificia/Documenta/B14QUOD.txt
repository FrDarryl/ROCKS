QUOD PROVINCIALE (On Christians Using Mohammedan Names)
Pope Benedict XIV
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Benedict XIV promulgated on 1 August 1754.

To Our Venerable Brothers the Archbishops and Bishops as well as Our
Beloved Sons, the Parish Priests and Missionaries of the Province of
Albania.

Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons, We give you Greeting and Our
Apostolic Blessing.

Forbidding Use of Mohammedan Names

The Provincial Council of your province of Albania, Venerable Brothers
and Beloved Sons, was held in the year 1703 during the pontificate of
Our predecessor Pope Clement XI. It decreed most solemnly in its third
canon, among other matters, as you know, that Turkish or Mohammedan
names should not be given either to children or adults in baptism. It
also decreed that the faithful of Christ should not allow themselves to
be called by Turkish or Mohammedan names which they had never received,
for the purpose of either exemption or immunity from taxes, or the
advantage of free trading, or avoiding penalties. We have confirmed and
commanded the observance of this decree in Our encyclical letter Inter
omnigenas, addressed to the kingdom of Serbia and its neighbouring
regions. This encyclical letter, covering many subjects of religion and
discipline, was published on the 2nd of February 1744 in the fourth
year of Our pontificate. This prudent and saving statute was
established by your predecessors with great wisdom and devotion as a
shining example of your Catholic faith and sincere Christian piety; in
our 1744 encyclical, We strictly ordered it to be imitated and fully
observed by other churches. Just as adhering to it clearly results in
the greater fame and reputation of your province and in greater
benefits for securing the eternal salvation of souls, so if it should
be neglected, it would greatly dishonor your province and openly
endanger these souls.

In Our letter mentioned above, We designated that abuse as a cowardly
concealment of the Christian profession, approaching infidelity. Since
then, We have learned with great mental anguish that many people in
that province continue to take Turkish or Mohammedan names despite the
consideration of their eternal salvation. They do so not only in order
to be immune and free from those taxes and burdens which have often
been and continue to be imposed on the faithful of Christ, but also in
order that neither they themselves nor their parents may be thought to
have abandoned the Mohammedan sect, thereby avoiding the requisite
penalties. For all this cannot take place without a pretense of the
errors of Mohammed, even if the faith of Christ is adhered to in the
heart, and this is at variance with Christian sincerity. It involves a
lie in a most serious matter and includes a virtual denial of the
Faith, most insulting to God and scandalous to their neighbors. It even
gives the Turks themselves a suitable opportunity to rate all Christ's
faithful as hypocrites and deceivers, and accordingly to persecute them
justly and deservedly.

2. Our sorrow and anguish is further increased by the fact that some of
you yourselves, venerable brothers, and of you also, beloved sons,
parish priests and missionaries, take no measures against so vile and
hateful a pretense. In fact, some of you even connive at it; by being
impressed by empty motives to find excuses for sins, you do not
hesitate to allow those who take common Turkish or Mohammedan names and
desire to be addressed by them, to partake of the Sacraments with no
pang of conscience at all, to the public offense of the obedient
faithful.

3. We who are entrusted with the care of all the churches and the
supreme administration of the sacred Apostolate; in this capacity, We
are obliged to lead all Christians back to the way of salvation and to
present them to God pure and sincere, walking in the spirit and in
truth without stain. We have heard Our Venerable Brothers, the
Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, who are general Inquisitors for
evil heresy on this subject. In accordance with their advice, We first
renew and confirm by Our Apostolic authority in this letter the
praiseworthy canon of the council of your province of Albania, and We
command that it be strictly observed. Also We extend the decrees of Our
church by the same authority and uniformity to include your province;
We equally strictly prohibit any of Christ's faithful from daring to
take Turkish or Mohammedan names in order to be considered Mohammedans,
in any case, under any pretext, or in any conceivable circumstances.

4. Furthermore, venerable brothers and beloved sons, We ask and urge
you in the Lord to think seriously about your ministry and the strict
account you will have to give to the Eternal Judge Jesus Christ, the
Supreme Prince of Pastors, for the sheep entrusted to each one of you;
to this end, We urge you to take personal care by your good works that
your election will be assured. Since it would be very careless and
negligent on your part not to, do not fail to patiently convince,
implore, and exhort the faithful of Christ in your Province to lead a
good life among the nations. Urge them in all affairs to conduct
themselves so as to be an example of good works in order that those who
oppose them may be chagrined since they have nothing evil to say of
them, and they cannot accuse them of being evildoers who for the sake
of base gain profess one thing with their lips while believing
differently in their hearts. But if they do not accept your warnings
and Our commands, they must be compelled by the rod to follow the norm
of Apostolic discipline. The sanctions and penalties provided for by
your Albanian council and by Our letter mentioned above must be fully
applied in their case: that is, they must be declared unfit to receive
the Sacraments in their lifetime, and if they die unrepentant, to
benefit from prayers after death. Insofar as it is necessary, We renew
and reapply these penalties; We enjoin you to ensure their due
execution. This should not be hard for any one of you, venerable
brothers and beloved sons, for none of the schismatics and heretics has
been rash enough to take a Mohammedan name, and unless your justice
abounds more than theirs, you shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven.

5. Finally, gravely advise those who have converted from Mohammedanism
or the children of such converts, if they lack confidence in their
constancy in the Faith, fearing punishment by their rulers if they
abandon their Turkish names, to emigrate secretly from those
territories and come for refuge to Christian lands. There they shall in
no way lack the help of God who gives food to all flesh, or the charity
of the faithful, especially if their Bishops provide them with letters
of recommendation. In the meantime, We lovingly grant you Our Apostolic
Blessing, venerable brothers and beloved sons, and We desire each
Venerable Brother Bishop to extend it in Our name to all the orthodox
faithful of Christ in his own diocese.

Given at Rome in St. Mary Major on the first day of August, 1754, in
the fourteenth year of Our Pontificate.
