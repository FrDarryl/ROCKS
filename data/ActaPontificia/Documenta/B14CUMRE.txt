CUM RELIGIOSI (On Catechesis)
Pope Benedict XIV
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Benedict XIV promulgated on 26 June 1754.

To the Patriarchs, Archbishops, and Bishops of Italy.

Venerable Brothers, We give you Greeting and the Apostolic Blessing.

Removal of Impediments to Marriage

Religious men, devoted to the improvement of divine worship, have
informed Us that it would be best to appoint special ministers in Our
patriarchal basilicas, St. John Lateran, St. Peter's on the Vatican,
and St. Mary Major's; their purpose would be to instruct those sent to
these basilicas by the Apostolic Chancery to perform there the required
servile works. These works are required before they are granted the
object of their journey to Rome, which is the removal of an impediment
to marriage. The aim of this instruction is to enable these people to
be duly and beneficially cleansed by the Sacrament of Penance and to
partake of the Sacrament of the Altar in a worthy manner. The Chancery
demands that they receive both of these sacraments in addition to
making the sacred pilgrimage to the seven churches and to ascending the
holy stairway. We have issued timely orders on this subject before, as
may be seen from Our encyclical letter of last January 16th to the
Cardinals who are archpriests of the said basilicas. We have
subsequently been reliably informed of the great zeal shown in this
important work by some of the canons and other clergy of the said
basilicas; they constantly and eagerly press on with the careful
carrying out of Our commands. Because of these reports, We have
experienced a specially deep joy, and with all Our heart, have rendered
due thanks to the Most High God Who is the source of all good things.

Many Ignorant of the Mysteries of the Faith

We could not rejoice, however, when it was subsequently reported to Us
that in the course of religious instruction preparatory to Confession
and Holy Communion, it was very often found that these people were
ignorant of the mysteries of the faith, even of those matters which
must be known by necessity of means; consequently, they were ineligible
to partake of the Sacraments. Although the ministers mentioned continue
unceasing instruction to eradicate this great evil, yet this evil
greatly distresses the people requesting and waiting for their
dispensation. For oppressed by poverty and begging for their food with
their own hands, they wish to leave the city as quickly as possible, to
return to their homelands and marry; this is the purpose of their
journey, and they are undeterred by the discomforts of public and heavy
penance.

Bishops Not at Fault

2. At the start of Our pontificate, We wrote an encyclical letter to
increase the zeal of Our Venerable Brothers to ensure that in every
diocese the elements and precepts of Christian doctrine be explained
and learned. We have read both the old and new reports of their
diocesan synods; We know they are filled with instructions and
exhortations, and that they include everything helpful for transmitting
Christian doctrine. Therefore We heartily assert Our conviction that in
this matter none of the bishops can be found lacking in the Apostolic
office entrusted to him; the fact that some members of their dioceses
are ignorant is not due to their fault or negligence. It must clearly
be attributed either to the obstinacy of their subjects who, despite
the commands of their superiors, have avoided instruction in their
Christian doctrine; they have, in fact, seldom if ever gathered to hear
the word of God explained in preaching. Or it could be attributed to
the slowness of some for learning what is taught. Or perhaps it is
because that although they learned the elements of Christian teaching
in their earliest years, when they were older, they ceased learning and
building upon the foundation of their youth. Because of this, they are
gradually reduced to a state like that of people who were not taught in
their early years or who never received instruction in Christian
doctrine. Although these setbacks have continued in spite of every
measure taken by Our Venerable Brothers, We must nonetheless stir up
their zeal again by this encyclical letter. And they are obligated anew
to take every step and care possible in this matter on which the
eternal salvation of the souls entrusted to them depends.

Work of St. Charles Borromeo

3. Each one of you, Venerable Brothers, has thoroughly understood the
measures taken by St. Charles Borromeo, both in his own large diocese
of Milan and in the entire province of which he was Metropolitan. He
took these measures in order to establish a fruitful method of
transmitting Christian doctrine, and he labored greatly in order to
strongly sustain this religious education. And when he observed that
his toil had not borne the fruit he desired, he did not despair, but
instead increased his cares and concerns as is seen in the fifth synod
of Milan: "We have hitherto shown great care in looking after the
instruction of individual Christians in the fundamental doctrines in
the Christian faith; but since we realize that we have profited little
so far, we are led by the importance of the matter to make these
additional decisions." For it was enough for that holy prelate to see
that the need still existed, and thus to address himself to the work a
second time; in this endeavor, he added cares to cares and minimized
the many measures he had employed up till then. In like manner, it was
enough for the Assyrian king to be informed that the nations did not
know the commands of God: "and it was announced to the king of the
Assyrians, and said: the nation which you transferred and sent to dwell
in the cities of Samaria do not know the laws of God's land." He at
once sent a priest to teach those nations the commands of God: "And the
King of the Assyrians gave commands, saying: bring there one of the
priests which you led off as prisoners and let him go and dwell with
them and teach them the laws of God's land" (4 Kings 17).

Teach the Fundamentals of the Faith

4. Therefore with the example of St. Charles Borromeo before Us, We
encourage you and implore you by the mercy of Jesus Christ not to
despair in this important work of handing on the fundamentals of the
Christian faith, even if hitherto you have devoted all your zeal and
care to it. See to it that every minister performs carefully the
measures laid down by the holy Council of Trent and by the statutes of
your synods: that on fixed days school-masters and mistresses should
teach Christian doctrine; that confessors should perform this part of
their duty whenever anyone stands at their tribunal who does not know
what he must by necessity of means know to be saved; that priests
should also provide this instruction before uniting spouses in
marriage; that fathers of families and lords of houses should be
gravely advised of the duty imposed on them of being themselves
instructed and of seeing to the instruction in the commandments of
Christian doctrine of their sons and of the members of their household;
that the practice of reciting aloud properly-composed acts of Faith,
Hope and Charity by the priest and people before or after the parish
mass should be preserved in the dioceses in which it is customary and
be carefully introduced where it is not. Parish priests should not
avoid their duty of at least on feast days, explaining the Gospel to
the people from the altar when there is no sermon. In addition, they
are obliged to teach them the chief mysteries of our holy religion, the
commandments of God and the Church, and everything which is necessary
for their worthy partaking of the Sacraments. Preachers should also
follow this path, recalling the salutary advice that they should join
instruction to exhortation whenever their hearers stand in need of
both. Finally, the best method for instructing ignorant men in
Christian doctrine is indicated by St. Augustine who says (de Cath.
Rud., 10) that the most fruitful procedure is to ask questions in a
friendly fashion after the explanation; from this questioning one can
learn whether each one understood what he heard or whether the
explanation needs repeating. In order that the learner grasp the
matter, "we must ascertain by questioning whether the one being
catechised has understood, and in accordance with his response, we must
either explain more clearly and fully or not dwell further on what is
known to them, etc. But if a man is very slow, he must be mercifully
helped and the most necessary doctrines especially should be briefly
imparted to him." We are assured that you yourselves will pursue many
more paths than We point out to you in this encyclical letter. In the
meantime, Venerable Brothers, We lovingly impart to you and to the
flock entrusted to your care Our Apostolic Blessing.

Given at Castelgandolfo on the 26th of June 1754 in the fourteenth year
of Our Pontificate.
