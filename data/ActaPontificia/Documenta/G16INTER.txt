Encyclical of Pope Gregory XVI on Biblical Societies on 8 May 1844

To the Venerable Brothers, Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops and
Bishops.

Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Benediction.

Among the special schemes with which non-Catholics plot against the
adherents of Catholic truth to turn their minds away from the faith,
the biblical societies are prominent. They were first established in
England and have spread far and wide so that We now see them as an army
on the march, conspiring to publish in great numbers copies of the
books of divine Scripture. These are translated into all kinds of
vernacular languages for dissemination without discrimination among
both Christians and infidels. Then the biblical societies invite
everyone to read them unguided. Therefore it is just as Jerome
complained in his day:^1 they make the art of understanding the
Scriptures without a teacher "common to babbling old women and crazy
old men and verbose sophists," and to anyone who can read, no matter
what his status. Indeed, what is even more absurd and almost unheard
of, they do not exclude the common people of the infidels from sharing
this kind of a knowledge.

2. But you know the aim of these societies. In his sacred writings,
Peter, after praising the letters of Paul, warns that in these epistles
"certain things are difficult to understand, which the unlearned and
the unstable distort just as they do the rest of the Scriptures, which
also leads to their destruction." He adds at once, "Since you know this
beforehand, be on your guard lest, carried away by the error of the
foolish, you fall away from your own steadfastness."^2 Hence it is
clear to you that even from the first ages of Christianity this was a
skill appropriate for heretics. Having repudiated the given word of God
and rejected the authority of the Catholic Church, they either
interpolate "by artifice" into the Scriptures or pervert "its meaning
through interpretation."^3 Nor finally are you ignorant of the
diligence and knowledge required to faithfully translate into another
language the words of the Lord. In the many translations from the
biblical societies, serious errors are easily inserted by the great
number of translators, either through ignorance or deception. These
errors, because of the very number and variety of translations, are
long hidden and hence lead the faithful astray. It is of little concern
to these societies if men reading their vernacular Bibles fall into
error. They are concerned primarily that the reader becomes accustomed
to judging for himself the meaning of the books of Scripture, to
scorning divine tradition preserved by the Catholic Church in the
teaching of the Fathers, and to repudiating the very authority of the
Church.

3. For this end the same biblical societies never cease to slander the
Church and this Chair of Peter as if We have tried to keep the
knowledge of sacred Scripture from the faithful. However, We have
documents clearly detailing the singular zeal which the Supreme
Pontiffs and bishops in recent times have used to instruct the Catholic
people more thoroughly in the word of God, both as it exists in writing
and in tradition. The decrees of the Council of Trent even commanded
the bishops to see to it that "the sacred Scriptures and the divine
law" are preached more frequently in the dioceses.^4 In expanding the
provisions of the Lateran Council,^5 they order that in each church,
either cathedral or collegiate in the cities and better known towns,
individuals able to explain and interpret sacred Scripture must be
obtained.^6 Later action was taken in many provincial synods^7
concerning the establishment of an ecclesiastical benefice according to
the norms of articles sanctioned by the Council of Trent,^8 and about
readings to be given publicly to the clergy and also to the people by a
canonical theologian. Also, in the Roman Council of 1725, Benedict XIII
assembled not only the sacred bishops of the Roman province but also
many of the archbishops, bishops and other ordinaries of places in no
way subject to this Holy See to deal with this same matter.^9 In
addition, for the same purpose he proposed several measures in
apostolic letters which he wrote expressly for Italy and the adjacent
islands.^10 You customarily report on the condition of diocesan affairs
at stated times to the Apostolic See.^11 It is clear from the answers
of our Congregation of the Council, sent repeatedly to your
predecessors or to you yourselves, how this same Holy See congratulates
bishops if they have beneficed theologians who give public readings of
the sacred Scriptures. The Holy See never fails to admonish and aid the
pastoral care of those bishops, if anywhere this matter has not
succeeded according to plan.

4. Moreover, regarding the translation of the Bible into the
vernacular, even many centuries ago bishops in various places have at
times had to exercise greater vigilance when they became aware that
such translations were being read in secret gatherings or were being
distributed by heretics. Innocent III issued warnings concerning the
secret gatherings of laymen and women, under the pretext of piety, for
the reading of Scripture in the diocese of Metz.^12 There was also a
special prohibition of Scripture translations promulgated either in
Gaul a little later^13 or in Spain before the sixteenth century.^14 But
later even more care was required when the Lutherans and Calvinists
dared to oppose the changeless doctrine of the faith with an almost
incredible variety of errors. They left no means untried to deceive the
faithful with perverse explanations of the sacred books, which were
published by their adherents with new interpretations in the
vernacular.^15 They were aided in multiplying copies and quickly
spreading them by the newly invented art of printing. Therefore in the
rules written by the fathers chosen by the Council of Trent, approved
by Pius IV,'s and placed in the Index of forbidden books, we read the
statute declaring that vernacular Bibles are forbidden except to those
for whom it is judged that the reading will contribute "to the increase
of faith and piety."^16 Because of the continued deceptions of
heretics, this rule was further restricted and supplemented by a
declaration of Benedict XIV: for the future the only vernacular
translations which may be read are those which "are approved by the
Apostolic See" or at least were published "with annotations taken from
the holy Fathers of the Church, or from learned and Catholic
authors."^17

5. Meanwhile there was no dearth of new sect members in the school of
Jansenius. Borrowing the tactics of the Lutherans and Calvinists, they
rebuked the Apostolic See on the grounds that because the reading of
the Scriptures for all the faithful, at all times and places, was
useful and necessary, it therefore could not be forbidden anyone by any
authority. But this audacity of the Jansenists we find reprehended by
the grave censures of two recent supreme pontiffs, namely Clement XI in
the Constitution Unigenitus in 1713^[18] and Pius VI in the
Constitution Auctorem Fidei in 1794.^[19]

6. So before the biblical societies were founded, the faithful had
already been alerted by the aforementioned decrees against the
deception of the heretics, which works in their specious zeal to spread
the divine writings for the common use. However Pius VII, who
understood that these societies founded in his time were flourishing,
opposed their efforts by means of his apostolic nuncio, by his letters,
by published decrees,^20 by various Congregations of Cardinals of the
Holy Roman Church, and by two of his pontifical letters which he
addressed to the archbishops of Gniezno^21 and Mohilev.^22 Immediately
thereafter Leo XII continued the battle against the biblical societies
with an encyclical letter addressed to all the bishops of the Catholic
world, published on May 5, 1824, and Pius VIII did the same in an
encyclical letter published May 24, 1829. And lastly, We who, though
unworthy, have succeeded to his place have taken great pains to remind
the faithful of the ancient laws concerning vernacular translations of
the Scriptures.^23

7. However We have reason to congratulate you, since, moved by piety
and prudence and strengthened by these letters of Our predecessors, you
warned Catholics to be on their guard against the snares which the
biblical societies were spreading for them. Thus, by the efforts of God
and His Church, it has come to pass that some incautious Catholic men
who imprudently favored the biblical societies have understood how they
were deceived. They have left the societies, and the remaining faithful
have continued almost immune from the contagion which threatened them
from this source.

8. In the meantime, the biblical societies did not doubt that they
would obtain high praise for leading infidels in some manner or other
to the profession of the Christian name by the reading of the sacred
books published in their own language. They strove to distribute these
in immense numbers by their missionaries and scouts, who even forced
them upon the unwilling. But for the men striving to propagate the
Christian name outside of the rules established by Christ himself,
almost nothing happened according to plan. They were able at times to
create new impediments for Catholic priests who set out to these
peoples with a commission from this Holy See. These priests spared no
labor to bring forth new sons of the Church by preaching the word of
God and administering the Sacraments; they even prepared to shed their
blood under all kinds of intense tortures for their salvation and for
the defense of the faith.

9. Now, however, these sect members are deprived of their expectations
and regret the immense outlay of money spent in publishing their Bibles
and spreading them without success. Some have now been found who have
directed their efforts toward Italians, especially the citizens of Rome
herself, after the manner of a new first assault. Actually We learned
from reports and documents just received that a number of men of
various sects met in the city of New York last year on June 12 and
founded a new society called Christian League. Their common purpose is
to spread religious liberty, or rather an insane desire for
indifference concerning religion, among Romans and Italians. They
assert that the institutions of the Roman and Italian peoples have been
so influential that anything of any consequence that has happened in
the world had its origin in Rome. They arrive at this conclusion not
because the Supreme See of Peter is here according to the plan of the
Lord, but because there has been a certain residue of ancient Roman
domination, usurped by Our predecessors, as they often repeat, but
still active. Therefore they are determined to give everyone the gift
of liberty of conscience, or rather of error; they liken it to a
fountain from which political liberty and increased public prosperity
may spring forth. But they feel that they can accomplish nothing unless
they make some progress with Roman and Italian citizens, thereafter
using their authority and efforts to influence other nations. And they
are confident that they will achieve this easily, since there are so
many Italians everywhere on earth, many of whom will return to their
fatherland. Of these, some are attracted to new things, some have
corrupt morals, and some are oppressed with poverty and may thus be
lured to join the society voluntarily or to join for a price. Therefore
the societies have concentrated on these people so that they will bring
corrupt, vernacular Bibles here and secretly spread them among the
faithful. They will also distribute other evil books and pamphlets
composed with the aid of some Italians or translated into Italian in
order to alienate the minds of the readers from the Holy Church and
from obedience to it. Among these they designate particularly the
Histoire de la reformation by Merle d'Aubigne and Fostes de la Reforme
en Italie by John Cric. The nature of these books and of their future
publications can be understood from the fact that no two members on the
committee selecting books may ever be of the same religious sect.

10. When these things were first brought to Our attention, We were
greatly saddened by the dangers to religion not only in places far from
Rome, but in the very center of Catholic unity. We need fear little
that the See of Peter may ever fall because the impregnable foundation
of his Church was laid by Christ the Lord; however We must not cease to
defend its authority. Besides the divine Leader of pastors will demand
of Us a severe reckoning for the growth of weeds in the field of the
Lord if they have been sown by an enemy while We were asleep, and for
the blood of the sheep who have perished here through Our fault.

11. Therefore, taking counsel with a number of Cardinals, and weighing
the whole matter seriously and in good time, We have decided to send
this letter to all of you. We again condemn all the above-mentioned
biblical societies of which our predecessors disapproved. We
specifically condemn the new one called Christian League founded last
year in New York and other societies of the same kind, if they have
already joined with it or do so in the future. Therefore let it be
known to all that anyone who joins one of these societies, or aids it,
or favors it in any way will be guilty of a grievous crime. Besides We
confirm and renew by Our apostolic authority the prescriptions listed
and published long ago concerning the publication, dissemination,
reading, and possession of vernacular translations of sacred
Scriptures. Concerning other works of any writer We repeat that all
must abide by the general rules and decrees of Our predecessors which
are found in the Index of forbidden books, and indeed not only for
those books specifically listed, but also for others to which the
aforementioned prohibitions apply.

12. Thus, We emphatically exhort you to announce these Our commands to
the people accredited to your pastoral care; explain them in the proper
place and time, and strive mightily to keep the faithful sheep away
from the Christian League and other biblical societies, as well as away
from their followers. Also take from the faithful both the vernacular
Bibles which have been published contrary to the sanctions of the Roman
Pontiffs and all other books which are proscribed and condemned. In
this way see that the faithful themselves by your warnings and
authority "are taught that they ought to consider what kind of food is
healthful for them, and what is noxious and deadly."^24 Meanwhile be
more zealous each day to preach the word of God, both through
yourselves and through the individual pastors in each diocese, and
through other ecclesiastical men fit for the task. In particular, watch
more carefully over those who are assigned to give public readings of
holy scripture, so that they function diligently in their office within
the comprehension of the audience; under no pretext whatsoever should
they dare to explain and interpret the divine writings contrary to the
tradition of the Fathers or the interpretation of the Catholic Church.
Finally it is proper for a good pastor not only to safeguard and
nourish his sheep, but also to seek and recall to the sheepfold those
who have gone to a distant place. So it will also be your duty and Ours
to direct Our fullest zeal to this end, that all who have been seduced
by such sect members and the distributers of evil books recognize the
gravity of their sin and strive to expiate it with penance. Nor indeed
are the seducers to be deprived of the same priestly solicitude,
especially the teachers of impiety themselves; although their sin is
greater, We should not shrink from their salvation, which We may be
able to procure by some means.

13. We ask those of you who rule churches in Italy, or in other places
where Italians live in great numbers, or where there are trading
centers and ports from which passage into Italy is frequent, that
special and intense vigilance be exercised against the deceits and
labors of the members of the Christian League. Since it is there that
the sect members have determined to bring their plans to fruition, it
follows that the bishops in those places especially must collaborate
with Us in ready and constant zeal to dissipate their machinations. We
earnestly desire the help of the Lord in this task.

14. We have no doubt that these cares of Ours and yours will be
seconded with the aid of the civil powers, especially by the more
influential princes of Italy. This is because of their exceptional zeal
for preserving the Catholic religion and because they realize that the
state would benefit if the efforts of the above-mentioned sect members
should fail. Experience shows that there is no more direct way of
alienating the populace from fidelity and obedience to their leaders
than through that indifference to religion propagated by the sect
members under the name of religious liberty. And this not even the
members of the Christian League conceal: although they profess
themselves strangers to inciting sedition, they advocate allowing every
man of the masses to interpret the Bible as he likes. As complete
liberty of conscience, as they call it, spreads among the Italian
people, political liberty will result of its own accord.

15. But what is truly first and foremost, let Us raise Our hands
together to God and let Us commend to him, with the humility of prayer
as fervent as We can make it, Our cause and that of the whole flock and
of the Church; let Us also invoke with pious petitions Peter the prince
of the apostles, the other saints, and especially the Blessed Virgin
Mary, who has the power to end all the heresies in the whole world.

16. Finally, as a pledge of Our ardent love, We grant the Apostolic
Benediction with an outpouring of affection to all of you, venerable
brothers, and to the clergy and faithful laity committed to your care.

Given at Rome at St. Peter's, May 8, 1844, in the fourteenth year of
Our Pontificate.
