APPETENTE SACRO (On the Spiritual Advantages of Fasting)
Pope Clement XIII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Clement XIII promulgated on 20 December 1759.

To the Venerable Brothers the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and
Bishops. Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Blessing.

The holy season of Lent approaches, which is full of mysteries but not
without mystery. It precedes that great celebration of Easter, by which
alone the dignity of all other religious occasions is consecrated.
Venerable Brothers, you should see that the faithful religiously
observe this holy fast, which was recommended by the testimony of the
laws and the prophets, consecrated by the Lord Jesus Christ, and handed
on by the apostles. The Catholic Church has always preserved it so that
by the mortification of the flesh and the humiliation of the spirit, we
might be better prepared to approach the mysteries of the Lord's
passion and the paschal sacraments. Likewise through fasting we might
rise again in the resurrection of Him whose passion and death we joined
after we put off the old man. Our predecessor Benedict XIV aroused you
with two earlier briefs, that you might zealously preserve such a holy
and salutary institution. Your work and zeal should recall the
discipline of the Lenten fast, now weakened by many corruptions, to its
original observance. For this reason, Pope Benedict XIV removed from
your midst many quibblings which impaired fasting. However, as there
are many persistent threats to the Lord's flock from the foul and
dangerous enemy of the human race, we should be wary lest the sly old
fox add new calculations and perverse customs to the minds of the
weaker faithful. These things will weaken the strength of the fast and
make it sink back to that point from which it was recently recalled. We
think it is necessary to send you this letter to show your brotherhood
how fearful We are that the old corruption might remain, or that a new
stain might come upon ecclesiastic discipline in this matter, with the
resulting destruction of the souls of the faithful.

2. We understand that it is just as necessary to lessen this fear of
Ours as it is to increase your pastoral vigilance by it. After Our
predecessor's letters, it perhaps remains for you to eradicate with
God's help anything pertaining to the old or new corruption for
breaking the laws of the fast, or the fabrications of opinions, or the
customs which shy away from the true power and nature of the fast.
Among these We number that abuse which rumor has brought to Us: while
many people were permitted by dispensation to eat meat for just and
legitimate reasons, they thought it was also permitted to consume
drinks mixed with milk, contrary to what Our predecessor thought was
right. He was of the opinion that those who were permitted by
dispensation to have meat, as well as those who were fasting in any
way, with one mixture excepted, were comparable to those who had no
dispensation. Accordingly they can have meat, or whatever originates
from meat, in only one mixture.

3. You will begin most appropriately, and with hope of the greatest
profit, to recall men to the observance of the holy law of fasting, if
you teach the people this: penance for the Christian man is not
satisfied by withdrawing from sin, by detesting a past life badly
lived, or by the sacramental confession of these same sins. Rather,
penance also demands that we satisfy divine justice with fasting,
almsgiving, prayer, and other works of the spiritual life. Every
wrongdoing--be it large or small--is fittingly punished, either by the
penitent or by a vengeful God. Therefore we cannot avoid God's
punishment in any other way than by punishing ourselves. If this
teaching is constantly implanted in the minds of the faithful, and if
they drink deeply of it, there will be very little cause to fear that
those who have discarded their degraded habits and washed their sins
clean through sacramental confession would not want to expiate the same
sins through fasting, to eliminate the concupiscence of the flesh.
Besides, consider the man who is convinced that he repents of his sins
more firmly when he toes not allow himself to go unpunished. That man,
already consumed with the love of penance, will rejoice during the
season of Lent and on certain other days, when the Church declares that
the faithful should fast and gives them the opportunity to bring forth
worthy fruits of penance. After all, it is always necessary to subdue
concupiscence, for it is written, "Do not follow behind your desires,
and do not turn away from your will." Let the faithful easily turn
their attention during this most holy time of year to lessening the
intemperance of the body by fasting. In this way the soul might
understand how it should prepare itself to recall the holy mysteries of
the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Therefore, those
who are spurred on by penance do not seek the delicacies of the table,
which seem indistinguishable from forbidden foods, even with
abstinence. However, one can rightfully say that whoever sets them on
his table does not so much put aside his customary delicacies as give
his appetites over to unusual enticements. Finally, those spurred on by
penance do not seek escapes by which they might withdraw from fasting,
nor do they seek various subtleties to break ecclesiastical law.

4. It is your duty, Venerable Brothers, to in spire enthusiasm and love
of penance in the faithful by word and example. Thus, they will
approach the fast more quickly, observe it according to the laws
prescribed by the Catholic Church, and sanctify it through almsgiving
and prayer. Finally--and this matter greatly concerns the Church--they
should understand that they have died and been buried with Christ. They
have been called to the new life of the new man in the paschal feast so
that they can come to the risen Lord Jesus Christ in full confidence.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you, to whom We most
lovingly impart the apostolic blessing as a pledge of Our love and good
will toward you.

Given in Rome, at St. Mary Major, on the 20th day of December in the
year 1759, in the second year of Our pontificate.
