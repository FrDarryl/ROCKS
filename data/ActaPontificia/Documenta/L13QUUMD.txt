QUUM DIUTURNUM (On the Latin American Bishops' Plenary Council)
Pope Leo XIII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII promulgated on 25 December 1898

To the Bishops of Latin America.

1. As We remember the long course of Our pontificate, We are conscious
that We have always endeavored to strengthen and extend Christ's
kingdom among your peoples. You still remember with gratitude what We
have already done for you with the help of God, venerable brothers.
Your zealous efforts have ensured that Our deeds and planning were not
in vain.

2. But now We want to give you a new proof of Our regard for you,
something We have wanted to do for a long time. Since the time of the
solemn celebration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America,
We have diligently sought a way to provide for the common interests of
Latin America which comprises more than half of the New World. And We
foresaw that this could best be done if all you bishops from these
regions came together for consultation at Our invitation and under Our
authority. We knew that by comparing ideas and sharing the wisdom which
each of you has derived from experience, you will be perfectly able to
ensure that the unity of Church discipline is preserved among your
peoples who are united by racial affinity; that morals worthy of the
profession of the Catholic faith flourish; and that thus, by the
concerted efforts of good citizens, the Church publicly prospers.

3. What greatly contributed to the realization of Our plan was that on
being asked for your opinion, you welcomed Our proposal with great
approval. As the time approached to make the idea a reality, We gave
you the choice of location for this meeting. Most of you indicated that
you would prefer to meet in Rome, especially since it would be easier
for the majority of you to come here than to go to some distant
American city on account of the difficulties of travel in your own
country. We could only give our complete approval to this declaration
of your opinions which was no light indication of your love for the
Apostolic See. However, We are bothered that Our present circumstances
do not allow Us to treat you with all the liberality and honor We would
like when you stay in Rome.

4. Consequently, We have already given orders to the Sacred
Congregation, which is in charge of interpreting the decrees of the
Council of Trent, to convoke an assembly of all the bishops of Latin
American countries next year in Rome and to prescribe in due time, the
rules which will govern this meeting.

5. In the meantime, venerable brothers, We give you very affectionately
Our apostolic blessing as a pledge of heavenly favors and as a witness
of Our good will to you, to the clergy, and to the people entrusted to
your care.

Given at Rome, at St. Peter's on the very day of the birth of Our Lord
Jesus Christ, 1898, in the twenty-first year of Our Pontificate.
