MESSAGE OF HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS
FOR THE 53rd WORLD COMMUNICATIONS DAY


« "We are members one of another" (Eph 4,25).
From social network communities to the human community »


Dear Brothers and Sisters,

Ever since the internet first became available, the Church has always
sought to promote its use in the service of the encounter between
persons, and of solidarity among all. With this Message I would like to
invite you once again to reflect on the foundation and importance of
our being-in-relation and to rediscover, in the vast array of
challenges of the current communications context, the desire of the
human person who does not want to be left isolated and alone.

The metaphors of the net and community

Today's media environment is so pervasive as to be indistinguishable
from the sphere of everyday life. The Net is a resource of our time. It
is a source of knowledge and relationships that were once unthinkable.
However, in terms of the profound transformations technology has
brought to bear on the process of production, distribution and use of
content, many experts also highlight the risks that threaten the search
for, and sharing of, authentic information on a global scale. If the
Internet represents an extraordinary possibility of access to
knowledge, it is also true that it has proven to be one of the areas
most exposed to disinformation and to the conscious and targeted
distortion of facts and interpersonal relationships, which are often
used to discredit.

We need to recognize how social networks, on the one hand, help us to
better connect, rediscover, and assist one another, but on the other,
lend themselves to the manipulation of personal data, aimed at
obtaining political or economic advantages, without due respect for the
person and his or her rights. Statistics show that among young people
one in four is involved in episodes of cyberbullying.[24][1]

In this complex scenario, it may be useful to reflect again on the
metaphor of the net, which was the basis of the Internet to begin with,
to rediscover its positive potential. The image of the net invites us
to reflect on the multiplicity of lines and intersections that ensure
its stability in the absence of a centre, a hierarchical structure, a
form of vertical organization. The net works because all its elements
share responsibility.

From an anthropological point of view, the metaphor of the net recalls
another meaningful image: the community. A community is that much
stronger if it is cohesive and supportive, if it is animated by
feelings of trust, and pursues common objectives. The community as a
network of solidarity requires mutual listening and dialogue, based on
the responsible use of language.

Everyone can see how, in the present scenario, social network
communities are not automatically synonymous with community. In the
best cases, these virtual communities are able to demonstrate cohesion
and solidarity, but often they remain simply groups of individuals who
recognize one another through common interests or concerns
characterized by weak bonds. Moreover, in the social web identity is
too often based on opposition to the other, the person outside the
group: we define ourselves starting with what divides us rather than
with what unites us, giving rise to suspicion and to the venting of
every kind of prejudice (ethnic, sexual, religious and other). This
tendency encourages groups that exclude diversity, that even in the
digital environment nourish unbridled individualism which sometimes
ends up fomenting spirals of hatred. In this way, what ought to be a
window on the world becomes a showcase for exhibiting personal
narcissism.

The Net is an opportunity to promote encounter with others, but it can
also increase our self-isolation, like a web that can entrap us. Young
people are the ones most exposed to the illusion that the social web
can completely satisfy them on a relational level. There is the
dangerous phenomenon of young people becoming "social hermits" who risk
alienating themselves completely from society. This dramatic situation
reveals a serious rupture in the relational fabric of society, one we
cannot ignore.

This multiform and dangerous reality raises various questions of an
ethical, social, juridical, political and economic nature, and
challenges the Church as well. While governments seek legal ways to
regulate the web and to protect the original vision of a free, open and
secure network, we all have the possibility and the responsibility to
promote its positive use.

Clearly, it is not enough to multiply connections in order to increase
mutual understanding. How, then, can we find our true communitarian
identity, aware of the responsibility we have towards one another in
the online network as well?

We are members one of another

A possible answer can be drawn from a third metaphor: that of the body
and the members, which Saint Paul uses to describe the reciprocal
relationship among people, based on the organism that unites them.
"Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak the truth, each to his
neighbour, for we are members one of another" (Eph 4:25). Being members
one of another is the profound motivation with which the Apostle
invites us to put away falsehood and speak the truth: the duty to guard
the truth springs from the need not to belie the mutual relationship of
communion. Truth is revealed in communion. Lies, on the other hand, are
a selfish refusal to recognize that we are members of one body; they
are a refusal to give ourselves to others, thus losing the only way to
find ourselves.

The metaphor of the body and the members leads us to reflect on our
identity, which is based on communion and on "otherness". As
Christians, we all recognize ourselves as members of the one body whose
head is Christ. This helps us not to see people as potential
competitors, but to consider even our enemies as persons. We no longer
need an adversary in order to define ourselves, because the
all-encompassing gaze we learn from Christ leads us to discover
otherness in a new way, as an integral part and condition of
relationship and closeness.

Such a capacity for understanding and communication among human persons
is based on the communion of love among the divine Persons. God is not
Solitude, but Communion; he is Love, and therefore communication,
because love always communicates; indeed, it communicates itself in
order to encounter the other. In order to communicate with us and to
communicate himself to us, God adapts himself to our language,
establishing a real dialogue with humanity throughout history (cf.
[25]Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Dogmatic Constitution [26]Dei
Verbum, 2).

By virtue of our being created in the image and likeness of God who is
communion and communication-of-Self, we carry forever in our hearts the
longing for living in communion, for belonging to a community.
"Nothing, in fact, is as specific to our nature as entering into a
relationship one with another, having need of one another," says Saint
Basil.[27][2]

The present context calls on all of us to invest in relationships, and
to affirm the interpersonal nature of our humanity, including in and
through the network. All the more so, we Christians are called to
manifest that communion which marks our identity as believers. Faith
itself, in fact, is a relationship, an encounter; and under the impetus
of God's love, we can communicate, welcome and understand the gift of
the other and respond to it.

Communion in the image of the Trinity is precisely what distinguishes
the person from the individual. From faith in God who is Trinity, it
follows that in order to be myself I need others. I am truly human,
truly personal, only if I relate to others. In fact, the word "person"
signifies the human being as a "face", whose face is turned towards the
other, who is engaged with others. Our life becomes more human insofar
as its nature becomes less individual and more personal; we see this
authentic path of becoming more human in one who moves from being an
individual who perceives the other as a rival, to a person who
recognizes others as travelling companions.

From a "like" to an "amen"

The image of the body and the members reminds us that the use of the
social web is complementary to an encounter in the flesh that comes
alive through the body, heart, eyes, gaze, breath of the other. If the
Net is used as an extension or expectation of such an encounter, then
the network concept is not betrayed and remains a resource for
communion. If a family uses the Net to be more connected, to then meet
at table and look into each other's eyes, then it is a resource. If a
Church community coordinates its activity through the network, and then
celebrates the Eucharist together, then it is a resource. If the Net
becomes an opportunity to share stories and experiences of beauty or
suffering that are physically distant from us, in order to pray
together and together seek out the good to rediscover what unites us,
then it is a resource.

We can, in this way, move from diagnosis to treatment: opening the way
for dialogue, for encounter, for "smiles" and expressions of
tenderness... This is the network we want, a network created not to
entrap, but to liberate, to protect a communion of people who are free.
The Church herself is a network woven together by Eucharistic
communion, where unity is based not on "likes", but on the truth, on
the "Amen", by which each one clings to the Body of Christ, and
welcomes others.
