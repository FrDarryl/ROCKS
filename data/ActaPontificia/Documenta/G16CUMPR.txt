CUM PRIMUM (On Civil Obedience)
Pope Gregory XVI
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Gregory XVI on Civil Obedience on 9 June 1832

To All Archbishops and Bishops Dwelling in the Kingdom of Poland.

Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Benediction.

When the first report of the calamities, which so seriously devastated
your flourishing kingdom reached our ears, We learned simultaneously
that they had been caused by some fabricators of deceit and lies. Under
the pretext of religion, and revolting against the legitimate authority
of the princes, they filled their fatherland, which they loosed from
due obedience to authority, with mourning. We shed abundant tears at
the feet of God, grieving over the harsh evil with which some of our
flock was afflicted. Afterward We humbly prayed that God would enable
your provinces, agitated by so many and so serious dissensions, to be
restored to peace and to the rule of legitimate authority.

2. We were immediately eager to send an encyclical letter to you that
you might understand that We too were oppressed by the weight of your
troubles. We hoped to add some solace and strength to your pastoral
solicitude by which you might apply yourselves with new and more ardent
zeal to propagating sounder doctrines and to persuading your precious
followers, both in the clergy and among the laity. That letter never
reached you because of the troubles of the times; therefore, now that
God has restored quiet and tranquility, We again open our heart to you.
We hope to kindle your zeal and solicitude as much as We can with the
help of God, so that you may diligently protect your flock from the
true causes of your past troubles. Watch earnestly lest deceitful men
and the promoters of novelties continue to spread erroneous doctrines
and false dogmas in your flock. Using the pretext of the common good,
as is their custom, they take advantage of the credulity of those who
are naive and rash, so that they may have them as blind servants and
supporters in disturbing the peace of the kingdom and in overturning
the order of society.

3. Surely the fraud of these would-be teachers must be uncovered in
clear words for the good and the instruction of the faithful. The
fallacy of their thought must be refuted courageously everywhere with
the words of divine scripture and the testimony of Church tradition.
From these most pure fountains (from which the Catholic clergy ought to
draw the plan of their lives and the material for their sermons to the
people) We are taught most clearly that the obedience which men are
obliged to render to the authorities established by God is an absolute
precept which no one can violate, except if by chance something is
commanded which runs counter to the laws of God or of the Church. "Let
everyone" says the Apostle, "be subject to higher authorities, for
there exists no authority except from God, and those who exist have
been appointed by God. Therefore he who resists the authority resists
the ordination of God . . . wherefore you must needs be subject not
only because of the wrath, but also for conscience sake" (Rom
13:1,2,5). Similarly St. Peter (1 Pt 2:13) teaches all the faithful:
"Be subject to every human creature for God's sake, whether to the king
as supreme, or to the governors sent through him ..." for (he says)
such is the will of God, that by doing good you would silence the
ignorance of foolish men." By observing these admonitions the first
Christians, even during the persecutions, deserved well of the Roman
emperors themselves and of the security of the state. "Christian
soldiers," says St. Augustine, "served an infidel emperor: when it came
to the subject of Christ, they recognized no one except Him who is in
heaven. They distinguished between the eternal Lord and the temporal
lord, but also were subject to the temporal lord because of the eternal
Lord" (St. Aug. On Ps 124).

4. The holy Fathers have always taught this doctrine. The Catholic
Church has taught it and continues to teach it. Having been taught it,
the first Christians lived and acted in such a manner that, although
the crime of cowardice and desertion had contaminated the pagan army,
it never contaminated the Christians. On this point Tertullian reports:
"Concerning the majesty of the emperor, we Christians are brought into
ill repute. Nevertheless, no Christians will be found among men like
Albinus or Niger or Cassius. But among these very peoples, who recently
had sworn by their gods, who had offered sacrifices for the safety of
emperor and state, and who frequently condemned the Christians, enemies
of the state have been found. No Christian is an enemy, certainly not
of the emperor. Since we know that the emperor is appointed by God, it
is necessary that he be loved and reverenced, and that we wish him
well." We understand that you know these things. We do not intend to
say them as if we might be afraid that you would not propagate and
disseminate sounder doctrine concerning the obedience which subjects
must have for their legitimate prince. Nonetheless We have said them so
that you may easily understand that We desire all clerics of your
kingdom to shine forth in purity of doctrine, in splendor of knowledge,
and in sanctity of life, that they may appear in the eyes and the
judgment of all without blemish. In this manner, We hope everything
will proceed more happily. Your emperor will act kindly toward you; at
no time will he deny his patronage for the good of the Catholic
religion and he will always listen patiently to your requests. Those
who are wise will follow you with richly deserved praise, and those who
are opposed will fear you, but will have nothing evil to say of Us.
Meanwhile raising our hands to heaven, We pray God for you that he may
enrich and fill each one of you more and more every day with an
abundance of heavenly virtues. Having you always in our heart, We
exhort you to complete our joy. Sharing the same love, may you also
think alike, unanimously perceiving the same things. May all of you
proclaim, as is fitting, sound doctrine and sound words; preserve that
which was entrusted to you and stand as one, united in the spirit,
working together for the faith. Finally pray to God for us without
ceasing. We impart most lovingly the Apostolic Benediction to you and
to the flock committed to you as a pledge of paternal charity.

Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, 9 June 1832, the second year of Our
Pontificate.
