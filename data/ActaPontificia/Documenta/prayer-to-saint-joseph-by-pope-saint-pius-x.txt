[9]Prayer to Saint Joseph, by Pope Saint Pius X

Glorious Saint Joseph, model of all who are devoted to labor, obtain
for me the grace to work in the spirit of penance in expiation of my
many sins; to work conscientiously by placing love of duty above my
inclinations; to gratefully and joyously deem it an honor to employ and
to develop by labor the gifts I have received from God, to work
methodically, peacefully, and in moderation and patience, without ever
shrinking from it through weariness or difficulty to work; above all,
with purity of intention and unselfishness, having unceasingly before
my eyes death and the account I have to render of time lost, talents
unused, good not done, and vain complacency in success, so baneful to
the work of God. All for Jesus, all for Mary, all to imitate thee, O
patriarch Saint Joseph! This shall be my motto for life and eternity.

- [10]Pope Saint Pius X
