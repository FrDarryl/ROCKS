GRAVISSIMAS (On Religious Orders in Portugal)
Pope Leo XIII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII promulgated on 16 May 1901

To Cardinal Netto, Patriarch of Lisbon and to the Bishops of Portugal.

1. In the midst of the serious concerns which distress Us more daily on
account of the war declared on religious orders in many areas, the
joint letter, eminent and full of dignity, which, in fulfillment of
your pastoral duty and your reverence for your Ruler, you recently sent
to your Faithful King, was an extraordinary consolation to Us. For
nothing could be more pleasing to Us than to see you promptly unite
both to defend religious congregations and to support their needs and
usefulness. Therefore nothing pleases Us more than to approve your zeal
and to honor your efforts with the praise they deserve.

2. Indeed, there is little wonder if you, both as those who preside
over the Church and also as citizens of Portugal, find fault with the
recent decrees against religious societies. For it is clear that they
are contrary to the rights of the Church and to the rights of the
faithful to choose a state of life; they deprive the state of not a few
outstanding benefits which flow to it from religious institutes, as the
authors of these decrees themselves admit in no uncertain manner.

3. What must be thought of the conditions imposed by the government of
Portugal on religious families if they are to survive, you have already
eminently declared. This must be kept in mind throughout, however, that
in accord with the discipline of the Catholic Church, no religious
order can exist or prosper if its novitiate and vows are removed.
Therefore the laws proper to each Institute, if perhaps necessary, are
to be brought into conformity with civil prescriptions; but this must
only be done in such a way that the dignity of the individual religious
be preserved and, most importantly, that the nature of their holy state
be kept entire and intact.

4. With joined forces, you must decide how to meet the losses and
dangers which oppress religious societies and in what fashion you may
more aptly provide for their preservation in your midst. Indeed it is
proper that the Holy See hand over to the joint judgment of those who
can weigh more closely, by being present as you are, the mind and
intentions of the civil authorities and the circumstances of situations
and places. For the rest, the Apostolic See itself will not fail to
take care to draw up a suitable way of life according to proper norms
and dispensation for religious forcefully removed from their domiciles.

5. Continue therefore to strenuously defend the cause of religion and
civil society, which will only have a favorable outcome if you indicate
to your faithful a clear and proper method of acting in public.
Continue also to exert every effort to unite and increase Catholic
forces and to foster publications and organizations which defend the
Church's rights. Diligently foster that harmony of wills which puts
aside private opinions and partisan political rivalries. These We most
earnestly request of you.

6. Finally, as a token of divine assistance and in testimony of our
benevolence we lovingly bestow on you, Venerable Brothers, and all the
faithful of Portugal and especially on members of religious orders, the
Apostolic Blessing.

Given in Rome at St. Peter's, 16 May 1901, in the 24th year of Our
Pontificate.
