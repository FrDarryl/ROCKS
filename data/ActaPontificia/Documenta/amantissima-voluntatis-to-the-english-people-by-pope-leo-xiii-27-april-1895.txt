[8]Amantissima Voluntatis - To The English People, by Pope Leo XIII, 27 April
1895

[9]Pope Leo XIII

Some time since, in an apostolic letter to princes and peoples, We
addressed the English in common with other nations, but We have greatly
desired to do this by a special letter, and thus give to the
illustrious English race a token of Our sincere affection. This wish
has been kept alive by the hearty good-will We have always felt towards
your people, whose great deeds in olden times the history of the Church
declares. We were yet more moved by not infrequent conversations with
your countrymen, who testified to the kindly feeling of the English
towards Us personally, and above all to their anxiety for peace and
eternal salvation through unity of faith. God is Our witness how keen
is Our wish that some effort of Ours might tend to assist and further
the great work of obtaining the reunion of Christendom; and We render
thanks to God, who has so far prolonged Our life, that We may make an
endeavor in this direction. But since, as is but right. We place Our
confidence of a happy issue principally and above all in the wonderful
power of God's grace. We have with full consideration determined to
invite all Englishmen who glory in the Christian name to this same
work, and We exhort them to lift up their hearts to God with Us, to fix
their trust in Him, and to seek from Him the help necessary in such a
matter by assiduous diligence in holy prayer. The love and care of the
Roman Pontiffs for England has been traditional from the days of Our
holy predecessor.

Gregory the Great. Religion and humanity generally, and especially the
English nation, owe him a deep debt of gratitude. Although prevented,
by the divine call to yet higher duty, from himself undertaking the
apostolic labor "of converting the Anglo-Saxons, as he had proposed to
do whilst still a monk, his mind remained intent upon this great and
salutary design," nor did he rest until it was accomplished. For from
that monastic family which he had formed in learning and holiness of
life in his own house he sent a chosen band under the leadership of
Augustine to be the messengers of grace, wisdom and civilization to
those who were still buried in paganism. And relying as he did on
divine help his hope grew stronger under difficulty, until at length he
saw his work crowned with success. He himself writes of this in tones
of triumphant joy in reply to Saint Augustine, who had sent him the
news of the happy result: "Glory be to God on high and on earth peace
to men of good will. To Christ be the glory in whose death we live; by
whose weakness we are strong, in the love of whom We seek in Britain
those brethren whom We knew not; by whose mercy We have found those
whom knowing not We sought. Who can tell what gladness filled the
hearts of all here to know that the English race, by the workings of
the grace of God Almighty, and by your labors, my brother, has been
illuminated by the light of our holy faith, which expels the darkness
of error, and has with free mind trodden under foot those idols to
which aforetime they were subject in foolish fear." And congratulating
Ethelbert, King of Kent, and Bertha his Queen, in a letter full of
affection, in that they imitated "Helen, of illustrious memory, and
Constantine, the devout Emperor,"* he strengthens them and their people
with salutary admonitions. Nor did he cease for the rest of his life to
foster and develop their faith in instructions dictated by holy
prudence. Thus Christianity, which the Church had conveyed to Britain,
and spread and defended there against rising heresy,* after having been
blotted out by the invasion of heathen races, was now by the care of
Gregory happily restored.

Having resolved to address this letter to the English people, We recall
at once these great and glorious events in the annals of the Church,
which must surely be remembered by them in gratitude. Moreover, it is
noteworthy that this love and solitude of Gregory was inherited by the
Pontiffs who succeeded him. This is shown by their constant
interposition in providing worthy pastors and capable teachers in
learning, both human and divine, by their helpful counsels, and by
their affording in abundant measure whatever was necessary for
establishing and developing that rising Church. And very soon was such
care rewarded, for in no other case perhaps did the faith take root so
quickly nor was so keen and intense a love manifested towards the See
of Peter. That the English race was in those days devoted to this
centre of Christian unity divinely constituted in the Roman Bishops,
and that in the course of ages men of all ranks were bound to them by
ties of loyalty, are facts too abundantly and plainly testified by the
pages of history to admit of doubt or question. But, in the storms
which devastated Catholicity throughout Europe in the sixteenth
century, England, too, received a grievous wound; for it was first
unhappily

The action of Saint Celestine I. was most efficacious against the
Pelagian heresy which had infected Britain, as Saint Prosper of
Aquitaine, a writer of that time, and afterwards secretary to Saint Leo
the Great, records in his chronicle: "Agricola the Pelagian, son of the
Pelagian Bishop Severianus, tainted the Churches of Britain with the
insinuations of his teaching. But at the instance of the deacon,
Palladius, Pope Celestine sent Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, as his
vicar (vice sua), and led back the British people to the Catholic
faith, having driven out the heretics." (Migne, Bibl. P. P. S. Prosp.
Aquit. opp. vol. un: p. 594) wrenched from communication with the
Apostolic See, and then was bereft of that holy faith in which for long
centuries it had rejoiced and found liberty. It was a sad defection;
and Our predecessors, while lamenting it in their earnest love, made
every prudent effort to put an end to it, and to mitigate the many
evils consequent upon it. It would take long, and it is not necessary,
to detail the sedulous and increasing care taken by Our predecessors in
those circumstances. But by far the most valuable and effective
assistance they afforded lies in their having so repeatedly urged on
the faithful the practice of special prayer to God that He would look
with compassion on England. In the number of those who devoted
themselves to this special work of charity there were some venerable
and saintly men, especially Saint Charles Borromeo and Saint Philip
Neri, and, in the last century, Paul, the founder of the Society of the
Passion of Christ, who, not without a certain divine impulse, it is
said, was instant in supplication "at the throne of divine grace" ; and
this all the more earnestly that the times seemed less favorable to the
realization of his hopes. We, indeed, long before being raised to the
Supreme Pontificate, were deeply sensible also of the importance of
holy prayer offered for this cause, and heartily approved of it. For,
as We gladly recall, at the time when We were Nuncio in Belgium,
becoming acquainted with an English- man, Ignatius Spencer, himself a
devout son of the same Saint Paul of the Cross, he laid before Us the
project he had already initiated for extending a society of pious
people, to pray for the return of the English nation to the Church.

`For this purpose he specially recommended the "Hail Mary," and
obtained from the General Chapter of his Order, held in Rome in 1857, a
special injunction upon its members.

We can hardly say how cordially We entered into this design, wholly
inspired by faith and charity, and how We helped forward this cause,
anticipating that the English Church would obtain abundant assistance
there- by. Although the fruits of divine grace obtained by- prayer had
previously manifested themselves, yet as that holy league spread they
became notorious. Very many were led to follow the divine call, and
among them not a few men of distinguished eminence, and many, too, who
in doing so had to make personal and heroic sacrifices. Moreover, there
was a wonderful drawing of hearts and minds towards Catholic faith and
practice, which rose in public respect and esteem, and many a long-
cherished prejudice yielded to the force of truth.

Looking at all this. We do not doubt that the united and humble
supplications of so many to God are hastening the time of further
manifestations of His merciful designs towards the English people when
the Word of the Lord may run and be glorified} Our confidence is
strengthened by observing the legislative and other measures which, if
they do not perhaps directly, still do indirectly help forward the end
We have in view by ameliorating the condition of the people at large,
and by giving effect to the laws of justice and charity.

We have heard with singular joy of the great attention which is being
given in England to the solution of the social question, of which We
have treated with much care in Our encyclicals, and of the
establishment of benefit and similar societies, whereby on a legal
basis the condition of the working classes is improved. And We have
heard of the vigorous and persevering efforts made to preserve for the
people at large an education based on religious teaching, than which
there is no firmer foundation for the instruction of youth and the
maintenance of domestic life and civil polity ; of the zeal and energy
with which so many engage in forwarding opportune measures for the
repression of the degrading vice of intemperance; of societies formed
among the young men of the upper classes for the promotion of purity of
morals and for sustaining the honor due to womanhood. For, alas, in
regard to the Christian virtue of continence pernicious views are
subtly creeping in, as though it were believed that a man was not so
strictly bound by the precept as a woman. Moreover, reflecting men are
deeply concerned at the spread of rationalism and materialism, and We
Ourselves have often lifted up Our voice to denounce these evils, which
weaken and paralyze not religion only, but the very springs of thought
and action. The highest credit is due to those who fearlessly and
unceasingly proclaim the rights of God and of Our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the laws and teachings given by Him for the establishment of the
divine kingdom here upon earth; in the which teachings alone strength,
wisdom and safety are to be found. The various and abundant
manifestations of care for the aged, for orphans, for incurables, for
the destitute, the refuges, reformatories, and other forms of charity,
all which the Church as a tender mother inaugurated and from the
earliest times has ever inculcated as a special duty, are evidences of
the spirit which animates you. Nor can We omit to mention specially the
strict public observance of Sunday and the general spirit of respect
for the Holy Scriptures. Every one knows the power and resources of the
British nation and the civilizing influence which, with the spread of
liberty, accompanies its commercial prosperity even to the most remote
regions. But, worthy and noble in themselves as are all these varied
manifestations of activity, Our soul is raised to the origin of all
power and the perennial source of all good things, to God our Heavenly
Father, most beneficent. For the labors of man, whether public or
private, will not attain to their full efficacy without appeal to God
in prayer and without the divine blessing. For happy is that people
whose God is the Lord} For the mind of the Christian should be so
turned and fixed that he places and rests the chief hope of his
undertakings in the divine help obtained by prayer, whereby human
effort is super- naturalized and the desire of doing good, as though
quickened by a heavenly fire, manifests itself in vigorous and
serviceable actions. In this power of prayer God has not merely
dignified man, but with infinite mercy has given him a protector and
help in the time of need, ready at hand to all, easy and void of effect
to no one who has resolute recourse to it. "Prayer is our powerful
weapon, our great protection, our storehouse, our port of refuge, our
place of safety."

But if the prayer of the righteous man rightly avail so much with God
even in earthly concerns, how much more will it not avail one who is
destined to an eternal existence for obtaining those spiritual
blessings which Christ has procured for mankind by "the sacrament of
His mercy." For He who of God is made unto us wisdom and justice and
sanctification and redemption," in addition to what He taught,
instituted and effected, gave also for this purpose the salutary
precept of prayer and in His great goodness confirmed it by His
example.

These simple truths are indeed known to every Christian, but still by
many they are neither remembered nor valued as they should be. It is
for this reason that We insist the more strenuously on the confidence
which should be placed in prayer, and recall the words and example of
the Fatherly love of the same Christ our Lord; words of deepest import
and highest encouragement; words also which show forth how in the
counsels of God prayer is at the same time the expression of our
helplessness and the sure hope of obtaining the strength we need. "And
I say to you, Ask and it shall be given you; seek and you shall find;
knock and it shall he opened to you; for every one that asketh,
receiveth, and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh it
shall be opened. And the Son of God Himself shows us that if our
prayers are to be acceptable to the divine Majesty they must be united
with His name and merits. Amen, amen, I say to you if you ask the
Father anything in My name, He will give it you. Hitherto you have not
asked anything in My name. Ask and you shall receive, that your joy may
be full. And He enforces this by reference to the tender love of
parents for their own children. If you, then, being evil, He says, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father
from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask Him.

And how abundant are not the choice gifts contained in that good
Spirit. The greatest of them all is that hidden power of which Christ
spoke when He said: No man can come to Me except the Father, who hath
sent Me, draw him."

It is impossible that men grounded in this teaching should not feel
drawn and even impelled to the habit of faithful prayer. With what
steady perseverance will they not practice it; with what fervor pursue
it, having before them the very example of Christ Himself, who, having
nothing to fear for Himself and needing nothing, for He was God, yet
passed the whole night in prayer,* and with a strong cry and tears
offered up prayers and supplications, and doing this "He wished to
stand pleading before His Father as if remembering at that time that He
was our teacher," as Venerable Bede, that ornament of your nation,
wisely considers. But nothing proves so clearly and forcibly both the
precept and the example of our divine Lord in regard to prayer as His
last discourse to the apostles during those sad moments that preceded
His passion, when, raising His eyes to heaven. He again and again
entreated His Holy Father, praying and beseeching Him for the most
intimate union of His disciples and followers in the truth, as the most
convincing evidence to the world of the divine mission on which He was
about to send them.

And here no thought is more welcome to Our soul than that happy unity
of faith and wills for which our Redeemer and divine Master prayed in
that earnest supplication for a unity which, if useful at all times
even for temporal interests, both at home and abroad, is shown by the
very divisions and confusions of these days to be more than ever
needful. We on Our part, watching the signs of the times, exhorting and
taking thought for the future, urged thereto by the example of Christ
and the duty of Our apostolic office, have not ceased to pray, and
still humbly pray, for the return of Christian nations now divided from
Us to the unity of former days. We have more than once of late years
given expression to this object of Our desires, and have devoted
sedulous care to its realization. The time cannot be far distant when
We must appear to render an account of Our stewardship to the Prince of
pastors, and how happy, how blessed should We be if We could bring to
Him some fruit - some realization of these Our wishes which He has
inspired and sustained. In these days Our thoughts turn with love and
hope to the English people, observing as We do the frequent and
manifest works of divine grace in their midst; how, to some, it is
plain, the confusion of religious dissensions which divide them is a
cause of deep concern; how others see clearly the need of some sure
defense against the inroad of modem errors which only too readily humor
the washes of fallen nature and depraved reason; how the number of
those religious and discreet men, who sincerely labor much for reunion
with the Catholic Church, is increasing. We can hardly say how strongly
these and other signs quicken the charity of Christ in Us, and
redoubling Our prayers from Our inmost soul We call down a fuller
measure of divine grace, which, poured out on minds so well disposed,
may issue in the ardently desired fruit, the fruit, namely, that We may
all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, one
body and one Spirit; as you are called in one hope of your calling the
one Lord, one faith, one baptism.

With loving heart, then, We turn to you all in England, to whatever
community or institution you may belong, desiring to recall you to this
holy unity. We beseech you, as you value your eternal salvation, to
offer up humble and continuous prayer to God, our Heavenly Father, the
giver of all light, who v/ith gentle power impels us to the good and
the right; and without ceasing to implore light to know the truth in
all its fullness, and to embrace the designs of His mercy with single
and entire faithfulness, calling upon the glorious name and merits of
Jesus Christ, who is the author and finisher of our faith, who loved
the Church and delivered Himself for it, that He might sanctify it and
might present it to Himself a glorious Church. Difficulties there may
be for us to face, but they are not of a nature which should delay Our
apostolic zeal or stay your energy. Ah, no doubt the many changes that
have come about, and time itself, have caused the existing divisions to
take deeper root. But is that a reason to give up all hope of remedy,
reconciliation and peace? By no means if God is with us. For we must
not judge of such great issues from a human standpoint only, but rather
must we look to the power and mercy of God. In great and arduous
enterprises, provided they are undertaken with an earnest and right
intent, God stands by man's side, and it is precisely in these
difficulties that the action of His providence shines forth with
greatest splendor. The time is not far distant when thirteen centuries
will have been completed since the English race welcomed those
apostolic men sent, as We have said, from this very city of Rome, and,
casting aside the pagan deities, dedicated the first fruits of its
faith to Christ our Lord and God. This encourages Our hope. It is,
indeed, an event worthy to be remembered with public thanksgiving;
would that this occasion might bring to all reflecting minds the memory
of the faith then preached to your ancestors, the same which is now
preached - Jesus Christ yesterday, to-day, and the same forever. As the
apostle says, who also most opportunely exhorts you, as He does all, to
remember those first preachers who have spoken the word of God to you,
whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.

In such a cause We, first of all, call to Our assistance as Our allies
the Catholics of England, whose faith and piety We know by experience.
There can be no doubt that, weighing earnestly the value and effects of
holy prayer, the virtue of which We have truly declared, they will
strive by every means to succor their fellow country-men and brethren
by invoking in their behalf the divine clemency. To pray for oneself is
a need, to pray for others is a counsel of brotherly love; and it is
plain that it is not prayer dictated by necessity so much as that
inspired by fraternal charity which will find most favor in the sight
of God. The first Christians undoubtedly adopted this practice.
Especially in all that pertains to the gift of faith the early ages set
us a striking example. Thus it was the custom to pray to God with ardor
that relations, friends, rulers, and fellow-citizens might be blessed
by a mind obedient to the Christian faith.

And in regard to this there is another matter which gives Us anxiety.
We have heard that in England there are some who, being Catholics in
name, do not show themselves so in practice; and that in your great
towns there are vast number of people who know not the elements of the
Christian faith, who never pray to God, and live in ignorance of His
justice and of His mercy. We must pray to God, and pray yet more
earnestly in this sad condition of things, since He alone can effect a
remedy. May He show the measures proper to be taken; may He sustain the
courage and strength of those who labor at this arduous task; may He
deign to send laborers into His harvest.

Whilst We so earnestly press upon Our children the duty of prayer, We
desire at the same time to warn them that they should not suffer
themselves to be wanting in anything that pertains to the grace and the
fruit of prayer, and that they should have ever before their minds the
precept of the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians: Be with- out offence to
the Jews and to the Gentiles, and to the Church of God} For besides
those interior dispositions of soul necessary' for rightly offering
prayer to God, it is also needful that they should be accompanied by
actions and by words befitting the Christian profession ‚EUR" first of
all, and chiefly, the exemplary observance of uprightness and justice,
of pitifulness for the poor, of penance, of peace and concord in your
own houses, of respect for the law ‚EUR" these are what will give force
and efficacy to your prayers. Mercy favors the petition of those who in
all justice study and carry out the precepts of Christ, according to
His promise: "you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall ask
whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you." And therefore do We
exhort you that, uniting your prayer with Ours, your great desire may
now be that God will grant you to welcome your fellow-citizens and
brethren in the bond of perfect charity. Moreover, it is profitable to
implore the help of the saints of God, the efficacy of whose prayers,
specially in such a cause as this, is shown in that pregnant remark of
Saint Augustine as to Saint Stephen: " If holy Stephen had not prayed,
the Church to-day would have had no Paul."

We therefore humbly call on Saint Gregory, whom the English have ever
rejoiced to greet as the apostle of their race, on Augustine his
disciple and his messenger, and on those other saints of God, through
whose wonderful virtues and no less wonderful deeds England has merited
the title of " Island of the Saints " ; on Saint Peter and Saint
George, those special patrons, and above all on Mary, the Holy Mother
of God, whom Christ Himself from the Cross left to be the mother of
mankind, to whom your kingdom was dedicated by your forefathers under
that glorious title "The Dowry of Mary." All these with full confidence
We call upon to be Our pleaders before the throne of God that, renewing
the glory of ancient days, He may fill you with all joy and peace in
believing: that you may abound in hope and in the power of the Holy
Ghost} Care should be taken that the prayers for unity already
established amongst you Catholics on certain fixed days should be made
more popular and recited with greater devotion. Especially that the
pious practice of the Holy Rosary, which We Ourselves have so strongly
recommended, should flourish, for it contains as it were a summary of
the Gospel teaching, and has always been a most salutary institution
for the people at large. Moreover, We are pleased of Our own will and
authority to add still another to the sacred Indulgences which have
been granted from time to time by Our predecessors. We grant, that is,
to all those who piously recite the prayer appended to this letter, to
whatever nation they may belong, an indulgence of three hundred days;
moreover, a plenary indulgence once a month on the observance of the
usual conditions to those who have recited it daily. Finally, may the
divine prayer of Christ Himself for unity fill up the full measure of
Our desires, a prayer which on this day, through the mystery of His
most holy resurrection, We repeat with the utmost confidence: Holy
Father, keep them in Thy name whom Thou hast given Me: that they may be
one as We also are one. . . . Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is
truth. . . . And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who
through their word shall believe in Me: that all they be one, as Thou,
Father, in Me, and I in Thee; that they also may be one in Us. . . . I
in them and Thou in Me: that they may be made perfect in one: and the
world may know that Thou hast sent Me and hast loved them, as Thou hast
also loved Me."-

Finally, We desire all manner of blessings from God for the whole of
the British people, and with all Our heart We pray that those who seek
the kingdom of Christ and salvation in the unity of faith may enter on
the full realization of their desires.

To The Blessed Virgin. Prayer for England.

O Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our most gentle Queen and
Mother, look down in mercy upon England thy "Dowry" and upon us all who
greatly hope and trust in thee. By thee it was that Jesus our Saviour
and our hope was given unto the world; and He has given thee to us that
we might hope still more. Plead for us thy children, whom thou didst
receive and accept at the foot of the cross. O sorrowful Mother!
intercede for our separated brethren, that with us in the one true fold
they may be united to the supreme Shepherd, the Vicar of thy Son. Pray
for us all, dear Mother, that by faith fruitful in good works we may
all deserve to see and praise God, together with thee, in our heavenly
home. Amen.
