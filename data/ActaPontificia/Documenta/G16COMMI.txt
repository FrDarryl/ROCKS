COMMISSUM DIVINITUS (On Church and State)
Pope Gregory XVI
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical Of Pope Gregory promulgated on 17 May 1835.

To the Clergy of Switzerland.

Venerable Brothers and Dearly Beloved Sons, Greetings and Apostolic
Benediction.

The duty of the apostolic office which God entrusted to Us demands that
We continually watch over the Lord's flock. We especially direct all
Our zeal and thoughts to provide as much assistance as We can whenever
the eternal salvation of the sheep and the Catholic religion seem to be
in danger.. We are aware of and deplore the fact that Our enemies
cunningly try many things, and not without success. Their works are an
open blow against the Christian flock and an injury to the Catholic
cause. This sorrow is aggravated because those who want to deceive the
unwary claim that they do not intend to subtract anything from the
integrity of the faith. They pretend to have as their only purpose the
protection of the rights of the laity. They attempt, by a false
pretense of public interest, to introduce, widely disseminate,
establish, and somehow sanction the erroneous and wicked teachings
which they follow.

2. Hence they dared to call together an assembly to deliberate, and to
fabricate a rule whereby aspects of the temporal power in
ecclesiastical affairs were revealed and defined. You already know that
We are speaking about those things which were nefariously accomplished
during January of last year in Baden in the canton of Aargau. Because
of them you experienced sharp sorrow and even now they make you anxious
and concerned. We cannot keep secret the fact that in the beginning We
were influenced to do nothing. We believed that the laymen gathered in
the appointed place with no other intention than to study those matters
which concern religion. We further believed they wanted to proceed so
that they might not only discuss the many aspects of the ecclesiastical
power, but also so that they might offer plans to those who wield high
civil authority; those persons might then confirm and sanction the
plans by force of law.

3. The acts of that meeting were recently published by Gynopedius at
Frauenfeld. These acts contain the names of the men who were present at
the meeting, the speeches given by some of them in the sessions, and
the articles passed there. We were horrified in reading those speeches
and articles and the principles contained in them. We knew then that
novelties were being introduced in the Catholic Church which are
contrary to its teaching and discipline and which lead to the
destruction of souls. We cannot allow this in any way.

4. He who made everything and who governs by a prudent arrangement
wanted order to flourish in His Church. He wanted some people to be in
charge and govern and others to be subject and obey. Therefore, the
Church has, by its divine institution, the power of the magisterium to
teach and define matters of faith and morals and to interpret the Holy
Scriptures without danger of error. It also has the power of governance
to preserve and strengthen in the true doctrine those whom it welcomes
as children and to make laws concerning all things which pertain to the
salvation of souls, the exercise of the sacred ministry, and divine
worship. Whoever opposes these laws makes himself guilty of a very
serious crime.

5. This power of teaching and governing in matters of religion, given
by Christ to His Spouse, belongs to the priests and bishops. Christ
established this system not only so that the Church would in no way
belong to the civil government of the state, but also so that it could
be totally free and not subject in the least to any earthly domination.
Jesus Christ did not commit the sacred trust of the revealed doctrine
to the worldly leaders, but to the apostles and their successors. He
said to them only: "Whoever hears you, hears Me; whoever rejects you,
rejects Me." These same apostles preached the Gospel, spread the
Church, and established its discipline not in accordance with the
pleasure of lay authority, but even in spite of it. Moreover, when the
leaders of the synagogue dared command them to silence, Peter and John,
who had used the evangelical freedom, responded: "You be the judge of
whether it is right in the eyes of God to listen to you rather than to
God." Thus, if any secular power dominates the Church, controls its
doctrine, or interferes so that it cannot promulgate laws concerning
the holy ministry, divine worship, and the spiritual welfare of the
faithful, it does so to the injury of the faith and the overturning of
the divine ordinance of the Church and the nature of government.

6. These principles are firm, unchangeable, and supported by the
authority and tradition of the ancient Fathers. Bishop Ossius of
Cordoba wrote to Emperor Constantius: "Do not become involved in
ecclesiastical matters nor give us orders concerning these affairs. But
rather learn this from us: God gives you the empire; He entrusts
ecclesiastical power to us. Whoever secretly tries to snatch the empire
away from you opposes God. By the same token, take care that you do not
draw ecclesiastical power to yourself and become guilty of a great
crime." The Christian leaders were aware of this and they considered it
a glorious thing to acknowledge publicly. Among them was the great
leader Basil who said in the eighth synod: "What more can I say about
you lay people? I have nothing else to say except that it is not
permitted for you to speak concerning ecclesiastical matters. It is the
duty of patriarchs, popes, and priests, to whom the duty of governing
has been entrusted, to investigate and study these matters. They have
the power of binding and loosing and of sanctifying. They are the ones
who have the ecclesiastical and heavenly keys, not those who must be
fed, sanctified, bound, and loosed."

7. However, in the Baden meeting the matter was discussed differently.
The articles which came forth from it attack the sound doctrine of
ecclesiastical power and lead the Church itself into a scandalous and
unjust slavery. It is even subject to the judgment of lay authority in
the promulgation of decrees concerning dogma, and its disciplinary laws
are declared to lack force and effect unless they are promulgated by
the agreement of secular authority with an added proposition concerning
the penalties against those who disobey. What then? Power is given to
that same civil authority either to approve or to oppose the
celebration of the diocesan synods, to inspect the synods, to oversee
seminaries, and to confirm the system of their internal governance
established by bishops, to remove clerics from ecclesiastical duties,
to govern the religious and moral instruction of the people, and
finally to regulate everything which, they claim, pertains to the
external discipline of the Church, although these things may be of a
spiritual nature or character and may concern the worship of God and
the salvation of souls.

8. There is nothing which belongs more to the Church and there is
nothing Jesus Christ wanted more closely reserved for its shepherds
than the dispensation of the sacraments He instituted. The power to
judge concerning their dispensation belongs only to those whom He
established as ministers of His work on earth. It is wicked if the
civil authority appropriates for itself anything in this holy office!
It is wicked if the civil authority prescribes anything at all
concerning it or gives orders to the ministers of the sacraments! It is
wicked if it tries with its laws to oppose the rules handed down to Us
in writing or by oral tradition from the early Church concerning the
distribution of the sacraments to the Christian people. Our predecessor
St. Gelasius said in his letter to Emperor Anastasius: "You know, most
merciful son, that you are allowed to rule over the human race.
Nevertheless, submit yourself to the bishops and seek from them the
means of your salvation. In receiving the heavenly sacraments and in
distributing them appropriately, you know that you should be subject
rather than govern. You know therefore that in these things you depend
on their judgment and that they do not want to be subjected to your
power." What seems to be incredible and portentous is that the meeting
at Baden progressed to the point that even the right and office of
dispensing the sacraments was attributed to secular authority. The
articles which were rashly written concerning the sacrament of marriage
in Christ and the Church certainly incline in this direction as does
the support given for contracting mixed marriages. The requirement that
Catholic priests bless these marriages while ignoring the religious
differences between the spouses and the threats of punishment for those
who refuse to do this illustrate this tendency.

9. These things ought to be condemned because the civil authority makes
laws concerning the celebration of a divinely established sacrament and
dares to order the priests in such a serious matter. But they ought to
be reproached even more so because they foster an absurd and impious
idea which they call "indifferentism;" indeed they depend on it as
necessary. Moreover, they oppose Catholic truth and Church doctrine
which forbids mixed marriages as disgraceful because of the communion
in holy things and because of the serious danger of the perversion of
the Catholic spouse and the perverted education of the future children.
Nor did the Church ever grant the free power to contract such a
marriage unless conditions were added which prevented the causes of
danger and deformity.

10. Jesus Christ conferred on His Church the supreme power of
administering religion and governing Christian society. This is not
subject to the civil authority. In his letter to the Ephesians the
apostle teaches that Christ established this ecclesiastical power for
the benefit of unity. And what is this unity unless one person is
placed in charge of the whole Church who protects it and joins all its
members in the one profession of faith and unites them in the one bond
of love and communion? The wisdom of the Divine Lawgiver ordered that a
visible head be placed over a visible body so that "once so
established, the opportunity for division might be removed." Wherefore,
although for all the bishops whom the Holy Spirit placed as governors
of the Church of God there is a common dignity and in matters of rank
there is nevertheless equal power, there is not the same rank in the
hierarchy for all and they do not all have the same extent of
jurisdiction.

Using the words of St. Leo the Great; "Among the holy apostles there
was a similarity of honor but a distinction of power: while the
election of all was equal, it was given only to one to have preeminence
among the others ... because the Lord wanted the sacrament of
evangelical duty to belong to the office of the apostles; thus He
placed it principally in St. Peter, the head of all the apostles." He
granted this to Peter alone out of all the apostles when He promised
him the keys of the kingdom of heaven and entrusted to him the
obligation of feeding the Lord's sheep and lambs and the duty of
strengthening his brothers. He wanted this to extend to Peter's
successors whom He placed over the Church with equal right. This has
always been the firm and united opinion of all Catholics. It is Church
dogma that the pope, the successor of St. Peter, possesses not only
primacy of honor but also primacy of authority and jurisdiction over
the whole Church. Accordingly the bishops are subject to him.

11. In the words of St. Leo, who continues speaking about the Holy See
of Peter: "It is necessary that the Church throughout the world be
united and cleave to the center of Catholic unity and ecclesiastical
communion, so that whoever dares to depart from the unity of Peter
might understand that he no longer shares in the divine mystery." St.
Jerome adds: "Whoever eats the lamb outside of this house is unholy.
Those who were not in the ark of Noah perished in the flood." Just as
he who does not gather with Christ, so he who does not gather with
Christ's Vicar on earth, clearly scatters. How can someone who destroys
the holy authority of the Vicar of Christ and who infringes on his
rights gather with him? It is through these rights that the pope is the
center of unity, that he has the primacy of order and jurisdiction, and
that he has the full power of nurturing, ruling, and governing the
universal Church.

12. We tearfully admit that this was attempted at the meeting in Baden.
The pope alone and no bishop has the right to transfer the days fixed
by the Church for celebrating feasts and observing fasts and to annul
the precept of attending Mass. This was clearly established in the
constitution Auctorem fidei published by Our predecessor Pius VI on
August 28, 1794, against the Pistoians.

13. The items contained in the Baden articles are contrary to this and
are much more harmful because on the issue of discipline they reserve
the right for the civil authority. The special privilege of removing
religious congregations which live under a rule from the jurisdiction
of the bishops and subjecting these congregations directly to himself
belongs to the pope- -a right popes have used from the earliest times.
The articles of the Baden convention abridge this right. They make no
mention of the necessity of asking and obtaining the permission of the
Holy See. Thus plans may be undertaken by a secular authority through
which, after the exemption of the monastic orders is abolished in
Switzerland, regular congregations can be made subject to the authority
of the ordinary bishops.

14. To these, We should add those things which they indicate have been
authorized concerning the rights of bishops. If these things are
examined mote deeply and referred back to the principles from which the
articles made in the Baden conference proceed, they seem to confirm
that the jurisdiction of the bishops neither can nor should be swayed
by the supreme authority of the pope. Nor should they be circumscribed
by any limitations. Neither should We omit those things which were
proposed concerning either the erection of a metropolitan see or the
unification of some of those dioceses to another cathedral church
located beyond the boundaries of Switzerland. The rights of the Holy
See in this matter were ignored. Thus civil authority acted as if it
were totally free in these serious issues to establish by its own right
those things which it considered to be advantageous for the spiritual
needs of the people. We pass over many other things which would be too
tiresome to enumerate individually. However, they inflict great harm on
this Holy See of Peter and threaten, violate, and despise its dignity
and authority.

15. Since this is the situation and the Church is confronted by so
great and open a disturbance of sound doctrine and ecclesiastical
rights and by so great and serious a danger to the Catholic cause in
these regions, it behooved Us to raise Our voice from this holy
mountain soon after the meeting of Baden was held and to openly
criticize, reprove, and condemn those articles to everyone who
participated in the conference. We delayed Our decision on their
wickedness up until now because We hoped that those who administer
civil affairs would totally reject and disapprove of them. The matter
did not, for the most part, come to pass according to Our expectation.
On the contrary, We, greatly sorrowing, learned that laws were enacted
which confirmed those articles and protected them by public decree.

16. We, in Our role as teacher and universal doctor, ought diligently
to beware lest anyone be led into error by Our action and conclude that
the articles of the Baden meeting are not inconsistent with the
teaching and discipline of the Church. We know that We cannot hesitate
or be silent any longer. As this is a matter of very serious
importance, We subjected these articles to a careful examination. We
have heard the advice and received the opinions of the cardinals of the
Holy Roman Church and have considered the entire matter carefully by
Our own will and with sure knowledge. With the fullness of the
apostolic power, We reprove and condemn the aforementioned articles of
the meeting of Baden as containing false, rash, and erroneous
assertions; as detracting from the rights of the Holy See, overthrowing
the government of the Church and its divine constitution, and
subjecting the ecclesiastical ministry to secular domination; and as
proceeding from condemned premises. We decree that they should forever
be considered condemned.

17. While We intend to point these things out openly because of Our
apostolic duty, it remains for Us to speak with paternal affection to
you who have taken on a part of His governance, the fullness of which
the Prince of Shepherds entrusted to Us. Among so many evils which
besiege the Catholic Church in these evil times, what great trials
press upon Our heart! We have experienced great sadness, especially
from those things which were daringly attempted recently. It should be
enough to direct your attention to it, and it should not be necessary
to explain the details.

18. In Our sorrow We must not neglect to mention that what you did in
guarding the Catholic cause and caring for the salvation of the flock
entrusted to your care brought Us great solace. Therefore, We give
thanks to the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation who
comforted Us with you while We were oppressed by such tribulation. We
must arouse your devotion. We exhort you to fight for the cause of God
and the Church with greater zeal as the attacks of the enemy become
more severe. It is your duty to stand as a wall so that no other
foundation can be placed other than the one which has already been
laid. It is also your duty to keep the faith undefiled. There is
another sacred trust which you should firmly defend, namely, the holy
laws by which the Church establishes its discipline, and the rights of
this Apostolic See. Therefore, act according to the position which you
hold, according to the dignity with which you are vested, according to
the authority which you received, according to the sacrament by which
you bound yourselves in solemn consecration. Unsheathe the sword of the
spirit which is the word of God. Denounce, beseech, rebuke in all
patience and teaching. Labor and struggle for the Catholic religion,
for the divine authority and laws of the Church, for the See of Peter
and its dignity and rights "so that not only those who are upright may
remain safe but also so that those who were deceived by seduction may
be called back from error."

19. Moreover, so that the desired outcome may result from these cares
and labors under taken by Our venerable brothers, We also address those
of you who are ministers of the sacraments, shepherds of souls, and
preachers of the divine word. It is your duty to be totally united with
them in will, to be inflamed with the same zeal, and to be in harmony
with them in this work so that the people might be protected from all
danger of error and contamination. Exert yourselves so that everyone
thinks the same thing and no one allows himself to be led astray by
strange teachings. Let everyone avoid profane novelties, cling to the
Catholic faith, and submit himself to the power and authority of the
Church. Each person should bind himself ever more firmly to this See
which the strong Redeemer of Jacob placed as an iron pillar and as a
bronze wall against the enemies of religion. You should receive these
enemies as people who ought to be educated in the law of Christ and of
the Church.

20. It should be obvious that the secular power and those laws enacted
by it concerning the welfare of civil society ought to be obeyed, not
only because of the fear of wrath but also because of conscience. It is
never permitted, however, to shamefully abandon the faith because of
it. Since the spirits of the people are trained in this way, consider
your labors to be both for the tranquility of the citizens and the
welfare of the Church; these two things cannot be separated from one
another.

21. May the most merciful God, from whom comes every perfect gift,
accomplish these Our wishes. May Our apostolic blessing which We
lovingly impart to you, venerable brothers, to Our brothers in the
Lord, and to the faithful be a sign of good things which We ardently
desire for this part of the Catholic flock.

Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, on the 17th day of May in the year 1835,
the fifth year of Our Pontificate.
