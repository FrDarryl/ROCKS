SINGULARI NOS (On the Errors of Lammenais)
Pope Gregory XVI
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Gregory XVI promulgated on 25 June 1834

To All the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops.

Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Blessing.

The illustrious examples of faith, obedience, and devotion conveyed by
the enthusiastic reception given everywhere to Our encyclical letter of
August 15, 1832, gave Us great joy. We declared in it the only sound
doctrine to be followed concerning the main points in the fulfillment
of the duties of Our office for the whole Catholic flock. The
statements made by many who had approved those counsels and opinions
which so grieved Us have increased Our joy, for they have acted as
prompt defenders and supporters of Our decrees. We recognized that that
evil which is still inflamed against both sacred and civil matters is
not yet removed. Widely disseminated but very shameless pamphlets and
certain gloomy machinations openly denoted those things which We
condemned in a letter sent to Our venerable brother, the bishop of
Rennes, in the month of October. Moreover, his response to those things
which cause Us so much concern and anxiety has been gratefully
received. His statement sent to Us on December 11 of last year
distinctly confirmed that he would follow solely and absolutely the
teaching transmitted in Our encyclical letter and that he would not
write or approve anything which differs from it. In that matter We
opened Our heart in paternal love to the son who was moved by Our
warnings. We should also have trusted that he would produce more
brilliant writings in time to confirm his compliance in word and deed
with Our decision.

2. It hardly seemed believable that he whom We welcomed with such good
will and affection would so quickly forget Our kindness and desert Our
resolution. We can hardly believe that the good hope which occupied Us
with the fruit of Our teaching has died. However, We have learned of
the pamphlet written in French under the title Paroles d'un croyant,
for it has been printed by this man and disseminated everywhere. It was
written under a pseudonym, but matters of public record make clear the
author's identity. Though small in size, it is enormous in wickedness.

3. We were very much amazed, venerable brothers, when at first We
understood the blindness of this wretched author, for in him knowledge
does not come from Cod, but from the elements of the world; this
"knowledge" bursts forth. Against the oath solemnly given in his
declaration, he cloaked Catholic teaching in enticing verbal artifice,
in order ultimately to oppose it and overthrow it. We expressed this in
Our letter mentioned above concerning both the dutiful submission
toward authorities and the prevention of the fatal contamination of the
people by indifferentism. It also concerned measures to use against the
spreading license of ideas and speeches. Finally, it concerned that
freedom of conscience which should be thoroughly condemned and the
repulsive conspiracy of societies enkindling destruction of sacred and
state affairs, even from the followers of false religions, as We have
made clear by the authority handed down to Us.

4. The mind shrinks from reading through those things in which the
author tries to break the bond of loyalty and submission toward
leaders. Once the torch of treason is ignited everywhere, it ruins
public order, fosters contempt of government, and stimulates
lawlessness. It overthrows every element of sacred and civil power.
From this, the writer transposes the power of princes, through a new
and wicked idea, to the power of Satan and an omen of subterfuge, as if
it were dangerous to divine law, even a work of sin. He brands the same
marks of wickedness on the priests and rulers because of the conspiracy
of crimes and labors in which he dreams they are joined against the
rights of the people. Not content with such temerity, he thrusts forth
every kind of opinion, speech, and freedom of conscience. He prays that
everything will be favorable and happy for the soldiers who will fight
to free liberty from tyranny, and he encourages groups and associations
in the furious combat which engulfs everything. He stands so firm in
such heinous thoughts that We feel him trample right from the beginning
Our advice and orders.

5. It is annoying to recount here everything which throws all human and
divine affairs into confusion with the wicked fruit of impiety and
daring. But these things especially arouse Our indignation and should
clearly not be tolerated by religion. Especially dangerous is the fact
that holy Scriptures that have been tainted with the errors of this
author are disseminated to the unwary. Acting as if he were sent and
inspired by God, he speaks in the name of the Trinity and then uses
Scripture as a pretext for releasing the people from the law of
obedience. He twists the words of holy Scripture in a bold and cunning
manner in order to firmly establish his depraved ravings. He does this
in order that, as St. Bernard used to say, "He might spread clouds for
light or give poison for honey, or rather in the honey, creating a new
Gospel for the people and laying a different foundation from the one
which is already laid."

6. He who placed Us as scouts in Israel for bids Us to hide in silence
the great harm brought to sound doctrine. So We must warn about the
error those whom Jesus, the author and perfector of the faith,
entrusted to Our care. Therefore, We consulted many of Our venerable
brothers, the cardinals of the Holy Roman Church. We have studied the
book entitled Paroles d'un croyant. By Our apostolic power, We condemn
the book: furthermore, We decree that it be perpetually condemned. It
corrupts the people by a wicked abuse of the word of God, to dissolve
the bonds of all public order and to weaken all authority. It arouses,
fosters, and strengthens seditions, riots, and rebellions in the
empires. We condemn the book because it contains false, calumnious, and
rash propositions which lead to anarchy; which are contrary to the word
of God; which are impious, scandalous, and erroneous; and which the
Church already condemned, especially in regard to the Waldensians,
Wycliffites, Hussites, and other heretics of this kind.

7. Venerable brothers, it will now be your duty to strongly support Our
orders which We urgently demand as necessary for the safety and welfare
of both sacred and civil affairs. Let us see that no writing of this
kind comes out of hiding into the light, since it would be that much
more harmful if it were to set sail through the passion of insane
reform and creep far and wide like a crab among the people. It should
be your duty to encourage sound doctrine through this whole affair and
to make known the craftiness of the innovators. Watch more keenly over
the care of the Christian flock, so that zeal for religion, piety of
actions, and public peace might happily flourish and increase. We wait
for this, trusting in your faith and commitment to the common good so
that, with the help of God who is the Father of lights, We might give
thanks (with St. Cyprian) that the error has been understood and
weakened and then laid low, because it was recognized and discovered.

8. As for the rest, We greatly deplore the fact that, where the ravings
of human reason extend, there is somebody who studies new things and
strives to know more than is necessary, against the advice of the
apostle. There you will find someone who is overconfident in seeking
the truth outside the Catholic Church, in which it can be found without
even a light tarnish of error. Therefore, the Church is called, and is
indeed, a pillar and foundation of truth. You correctly understand,
venerable brothers, that We speak here also of that erroneous
philosophical system which was recently brought in and is clearly to be
condemned. This system, which comes from the contemptible and
unrestrained desire for innovation, does not seek truth where it stands
in the received and holy apostolic inheritance. Rather, other empty
doctrines, futile and uncertain doctrines not approved by the Church,
are adopted. Only the most conceited men wrongly think that these
teachings can sustain and support that truth.

9. While We write these things to understand and preserve the sound
doctrine divinely delegated to Us, We sign over the harsh wound
inflicted to Our heart by the error of Our son. In the great sadness We
suffer, there is no hope of consolation, unless We can recall him to
the way of righteousness. Therefore, at the same time, let Us raise Our
eyes and hands to Him who is the leader of wisdom and the corrector of
the wise. Let Us beseech Him with repeated prayer to give this man a
docile heart and a great spirit to hear the voice of the most loving
and most sorrowful Father. May he hasten the joy of the Church, the joy
of your order, the joy of this Holy See, and the joy of Our
unworthiness. Certainly We shall provide an auspicious and happy
occasion to take hold of him and embrace him as a son returning to the
bosom of his Father. We are and We shall be very optimistic from his
example that others will come to their senses, others who might have
been led into error by the same author. May there be an agreement of
teaching, one course of thinking, one harmony of action and study,
among all for the good of sacred and public matters. We need you and We
expect you to beseech the Lord with Us in your pastoral concern for
this great gift. We pray for divine assistance in this work and We
lovingly impart Our apostolic blessing on you and on your flock as a
sign of this.

Given in Rome, at St. Peter's, on June 25, 1834, in the fourth year of
Our pontificate.
