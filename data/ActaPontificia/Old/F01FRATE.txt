                              ENCYCLICAL LETTER
                               FRATELLI TUTTI
                             OF THE HOLY FATHER
                                   FRANCIS
                   ON THE FRATERNITY AND SOCIAL FRIENDSHIP


   1. "FRATELLI TUTTI".[20][1] With these words, Saint Francis of Assisi
   addressed his brothers and sisters and proposed to them a way of life
   marked by the flavour of the Gospel. Of the counsels Francis offered, I
   would like to select the one in which he calls for a love that
   transcends the barriers of geography and distance, and declares blessed
   all those who love their brother "as much when he is far away from him
   as when he is with him".[21][2] In his simple and direct way, Saint
   Francis expressed the essence of a fraternal openness that allows us to
   acknowledge, appreciate and love each person, regardless of physical
   proximity, regardless of where he or she was born or lives.

   2. This saint of fraternal love, simplicity and joy, who inspired me to
   write the Encyclical [22]Laudato Si', prompts me once more to devote
   this new Encyclical to fraternity and social friendship. Francis felt
   himself a brother to the sun, the sea and the wind, yet he knew that he
   was even closer to those of his own flesh. Wherever he went, he sowed
   seeds of peace and walked alongside the poor, the abandoned, the infirm
   and the outcast, the least of his brothers and sisters.

   WITHOUT BORDERS

   3. There is an episode in the life of Saint Francis that shows his
   openness of heart, which knew no bounds and transcended differences of
   origin, nationality, colour or religion. It was his visit to Sultan
   Malik-el-Kamil, in Egypt, which entailed considerable hardship, given
   Francis' poverty, his scarce resources, the great distances to be
   traveled and their differences of language, culture and religion. That
   journey, undertaken at the time of the Crusades, further demonstrated
   the breadth and grandeur of his love, which sought to embrace everyone.
   Francis' fidelity to his Lord was commensurate with his love for his
   brothers and sisters. Unconcerned for the hardships and dangers
   involved, Francis went to meet the Sultan with the same attitude that
   he instilled in his disciples: if they found themselves "among the
   Saracens and other nonbelievers", without renouncing their own identity
   they were not to "engage in arguments or disputes, but to be subject to
   every human creature for God's sake".[23][3] In the context of the
   times, this was an extraordinary recommendation. We are impressed that
   some eight hundred years ago Saint Francis urged that all forms of
   hostility or conflict be avoided and that a humble and fraternal
   "subjection" be shown to those who did not share his faith.

   4. Francis did not wage a war of words aimed at imposing doctrines; he
   simply spread the love of God. He understood that "God is love and
   those who abide in love abide in God" (1 Jn 4:16). In this way, he
   became a father to all and inspired the vision of a fraternal society.
   Indeed, "only the man who approaches others, not to draw them into his
   own life, but to help them become ever more fully themselves, can truly
   be called a father".[24][4] In the world of that time, bristling with
   watchtowers and defensive walls, cities were a theatre of brutal wars
   between powerful families, even as poverty was spreading through the
   countryside. Yet there Francis was able to welcome true peace into his
   heart and free himself of the desire to wield power over others. He
   became one of the poor and sought to live in harmony with all. Francis
   has inspired these pages.

   5. Issues of human fraternity and social friendship have always been a
   concern of mine. In recent years, I have spoken of them repeatedly and
   in different settings. In this Encyclical, I have sought to bring
   together many of those statements and to situate them in a broader
   context of reflection. In the preparation of [25]Laudato Si', I had a
   source of inspiration in my brother Bartholomew, the Orthodox
   Patriarch, who has spoken forcefully of our need to care for creation.
   In this case, I have felt particularly encouraged by the Grand Imam
   Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, with whom I met in Abu Dhabi, where we declared that
   "God has created all human beings equal in rights, duties and dignity,
   and has called them to live together as brothers and sisters".[26][5]
   This was no mere diplomatic gesture, but a reflection born of dialogue
   and common commitment. The present Encyclical takes up and develops
   some of the great themes raised in the Document that we both signed. I
   have also incorporated, along with my own thoughts, a number of
   letters, documents and considerations that I have received from many
   individuals and groups throughout the world.

   6. The following pages do not claim to offer a complete teaching on
   fraternal love, but rather to consider its universal scope, its
   openness to every man and woman. I offer this social Encyclical as a
   modest contribution to continued reflection, in the hope that in the
   face of present-day attempts to eliminate or ignore others, we may
   prove capable of responding with a new vision of fraternity and social
   friendship that will not remain at the level of words. Although I have
   written it from the Christian convictions that inspire and sustain me,
   I have sought to make this reflection an invitation to dialogue among
   all people of good will.

   7. As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly
   erupted, exposing our false securities. Aside from the different ways
   that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work
   together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we
   witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve
   problems that affect us all. Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to
   be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to
   refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.

   8. It is my desire that, in this our time, by acknowledging the dignity
   of each human person, we can contribute to the rebirth of a universal
   aspiration to fraternity. Fraternity between all men and women. "Here
   we have a splendid secret that shows us how to dream and to turn our
   life into a wonderful adventure. No one can face life in isolation...
   We need a community that supports and helps us, in which we can help
   one another to keep looking ahead. How important it is to dream
   together... By ourselves, we risk seeing mirages, things that are not
   there. Dreams, on the other hand, are built together".[27][6] Let us
   dream, then, as a single human family, as fellow travelers sharing the
   same flesh, as children of the same earth which is our common home,
   each of us bringing the richness of his or her beliefs and convictions,
   each of us with his or her own voice, brothers and sisters all.

                                 CHAPTER ONE

                       DARK CLOUDS OVER A CLOSED WORLD

   9. Without claiming to carry out an exhaustive analysis or to study
   every aspect of our present-day experience, I intend simply to consider
   certain trends in our world that hinder the development of universal
   fraternity.

   SHATTERED DREAMS

   10. For decades, it seemed that the world had learned a lesson from its
   many wars and disasters, and was slowly moving towards various forms of
   integration. For example, there was the dream of a united Europe,
   capable of acknowledging its shared roots and rejoicing in its rich
   diversity. We think of "the firm conviction of the founders of the
   European Union, who envisioned a future based on the capacity to work
   together in bridging divisions and in fostering peace and fellowship
   between all the peoples of this continent".[28][7] There was also a
   growing desire for integration in Latin America, and several steps were
   taken in this direction. In some countries and regions, attempts at
   reconciliation and rapprochement proved fruitful, while others showed
   great promise.

   11. Our own days, however, seem to be showing signs of a certain
   regression. Ancient conflicts thought long buried are breaking out
   anew, while instances of a myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive
   nationalism are on the rise. In some countries, a concept of popular
   and national unity influenced by various ideologies is creating new
   forms of selfishness and a loss of the social sense under the guise of
   defending national interests. Once more we are being reminded that
   "each new generation must take up the struggles and attainments of past
   generations, while setting its sights even higher. This is the path.
   Goodness, together with love, justice and solidarity, are not achieved
   once and for all; they have to be realized each day. It is not possible
   to settle for what was achieved in the past and complacently enjoy it,
   as if we could somehow disregard the fact that many of our brothers and
   sisters still endure situations that cry out for our attention".[29][8]

   12. "Opening up to the world" is an expression that has been co-opted
   by the economic and financial sector and is now used exclusively of
   openness to foreign interests or to the freedom of economic powers to
   invest without obstacles or complications in all countries. Local
   conflicts and disregard for the common good are exploited by the global
   economy in order to impose a single cultural model. This culture
   unifies the world, but divides persons and nations, for "as society
   becomes ever more globalized, it makes us neighbours, but does not make
   us brothers".[30][9] We are more alone than ever in an increasingly
   massified world that promotes individual interests and weakens the
   communitarian dimension of life. Indeed, there are markets where
   individuals become mere consumers or bystanders. As a rule, the advance
   of this kind of globalism strengthens the identity of the more
   powerful, who can protect themselves, but it tends to diminish the
   identity of the weaker and poorer regions, making them more vulnerable
   and dependent. In this way, political life becomes increasingly fragile
   in the face of transnational economic powers that operate with the
   principle of "divide and conquer".

   The end of historical consciousness

   13. As a result, there is a growing loss of the sense of history, which
   leads to even further breakup. A kind of "deconstructionism", whereby
   human freedom claims to create everything starting from zero, is making
   headway in today's culture. The one thing it leaves in its wake is the
   drive to limitless consumption and expressions of empty individualism.
   Concern about this led me to offer the young some advice. "If someone
   tells young people to ignore their history, to reject the experiences
   of their elders, to look down on the past and to look forward to a
   future that he himself holds out, doesn't it then become easy to draw
   them along so that they only do what he tells them? He needs the young
   to be shallow, uprooted and distrustful, so that they can trust only in
   his promises and act according to his plans. That is how various
   ideologies operate: they destroy (or deconstruct) all differences so
   that they can reign unopposed. To do so, however, they need young
   people who have no use for history, who spurn the spiritual and human
   riches inherited from past generations, and are ignorant of everything
   that came before them".[31][10]

   14. These are the new forms of cultural colonization. Let us not forget
   that "peoples that abandon their tradition and, either from a craze to
   mimic others or to foment violence, or from unpardonable negligence or
   apathy, allow others to rob their very soul, end up losing not only
   their spiritual identity but also their moral consistency and, in the
   end, their intellectual, economic and political independence".[32][11]
   One effective way to weaken historical consciousness, critical
   thinking, the struggle for justice and the processes of integration is
   to empty great words of their meaning or to manipulate them. Nowadays,
   what do certain words like democracy, freedom, justice or unity really
   mean? They have been bent and shaped to serve as tools for domination,
   as meaningless tags that can be used to justify any action.

   LACKING A PLAN FOR EVERYONE

   15. The best way to dominate and gain control over people is to spread
   despair and discouragement, even under the guise of defending certain
   values. Today, in many countries, hyperbole, extremism and polarization
   have become political tools. Employing a strategy of ridicule,
   suspicion and relentless criticism, in a variety of ways one denies the
   right of others to exist or to have an opinion. Their share of the
   truth and their values are rejected and, as a result, the life of
   society is impoverished and subjected to the hubris of the powerful.
   Political life no longer has to do with healthy debates about long-term
   plans to improve people's lives and to advance the common good, but
   only with slick marketing techniques primarily aimed at discrediting
   others. In this craven exchange of charges and counter-charges, debate
   degenerates into a permanent state of disagreement and confrontation.

   16. Amid the fray of conflicting interests, where victory consists in
   eliminating one's opponents, how is it possible to raise our sights to
   recognize our neighbours or to help those who have fallen along the
   way? A plan that would set great goals for the development of our
   entire human family nowadays sounds like madness. We are growing ever
   more distant from one another, while the slow and demanding march
   towards an increasingly united and just world is suffering a new and
   dramatic setback.

   17. To care for the world in which we live means to care for ourselves.
   Yet we need to think of ourselves more and more as a single family
   dwelling in a common home. Such care does not interest those economic
   powers that demand quick profits. Often the voices raised in defence of
   the environment are silenced or ridiculed, using apparently reasonable
   arguments that are merely a screen for special interests. In this
   shallow, short-sighted culture that we have created, bereft of a shared
   vision, "it is foreseeable that, once certain resources have been
   depleted, the scene will be set for new wars, albeit under the guise of
   noble claims".[33][12]

   A "throwaway" world

   18. Some parts of our human family, it appears, can be readily
   sacrificed for the sake of others considered worthy of a carefree
   existence. Ultimately, "persons are no longer seen as a paramount value
   to be cared for and respected, especially when they are poor and
   disabled, `not yet useful' - like the unborn, or `no longer needed' -
   like the elderly. We have grown indifferent to all kinds of
   wastefulness, starting with the waste of food, which is deplorable in
   the extreme".[34][13]

   19. A decline in the birthrate, which leads to the aging of the
   population, together with the relegation of the elderly to a sad and
   lonely existence, is a subtle way of stating that it is all about us,
   that our individual concerns are the only thing that matters. In this
   way, "what is thrown away are not only food and dispensable objects,
   but often human beings themselves".[35][14] We have seen what happened
   with the elderly in certain places in our world as a result of the
   coronavirus. They did not have to die that way. Yet something similar
   had long been occurring during heat waves and in other situations:
   older people found themselves cruelly abandoned. We fail to realize
   that, by isolating the elderly and leaving them in the care of others
   without the closeness and concern of family members, we disfigure and
   impoverish the family itself. We also end up depriving young people of
   a necessary connection to their roots and a wisdom that the young
   cannot achieve on their own.

   20. This way of discarding others can take a variety of forms, such as
   an obsession with reducing labour costs with no concern for its grave
   consequences, since the unemployment that it directly generates leads
   to the expansion of poverty.[36][15] In addition, a readiness to
   discard others finds expression in vicious attitudes that we thought
   long past, such as racism, which retreats underground only to keep
   reemerging. Instances of racism continue to shame us, for they show
   that our supposed social progress is not as real or definitive as we
   think.

   21. Some economic rules have proved effective for growth, but not for
   integral human development.[37][16] Wealth has increased, but together
   with inequality, with the result that "new forms of poverty are
   emerging".[38][17] The claim that the modern world has reduced poverty
   is made by measuring poverty with criteria from the past that do not
   correspond to present-day realities. In other times, for example, lack
   of access to electric energy was not considered a sign of poverty, nor
   was it a source of hardship. Poverty must always be understood and
   gauged in the context of the actual opportunities available in each
   concrete historical period.

   Insufficiently universal human rights

   22. It frequently becomes clear that, in practice, human rights are not
   equal for all. Respect for those rights "is the preliminary condition
   for a country's social and economic development. When the dignity of
   the human person is respected, and his or her rights recognized and
   guaranteed, creativity and interdependence thrive, and the creativity
   of the human personality is released through actions that further the
   common good".[39][18] Yet, "by closely observing our contemporary
   societies, we see numerous contradictions that lead us to wonder
   whether the equal dignity of all human beings, solemnly proclaimed
   seventy years ago, is truly recognized, respected, protected and
   promoted in every situation. In today's world, many forms of injustice
   persist, fed by reductive anthropological visions and by a profit-based
   economic model that does not hesitate to exploit, discard and even kill
   human beings. While one part of humanity lives in opulence, another
   part sees its own dignity denied, scorned or trampled upon, and its
   fundamental rights discarded or violated".[40][19] What does this tell
   us about the equality of rights grounded in innate human dignity?

   23. Similarly, the organization of societies worldwide is still far
   from reflecting clearly that women possess the same dignity and
   identical rights as men. We say one thing with words, but our decisions
   and reality tell another story. Indeed, "doubly poor are those women
   who endure situations of exclusion, mistreatment and violence, since
   they are frequently less able to defend their rights".[41][20]

   24. We should also recognize that "even though the international
   community has adopted numerous agreements aimed at ending slavery in
   all its forms, and has launched various strategies to combat this
   phenomenon, millions of people today - children, women and men of all
   ages - are deprived of freedom and forced to live in conditions akin to
   slavery... Today, as in the past, slavery is rooted in a notion of the
   human person that allows him or her to be treated as an object...
   Whether by coercion, or deception, or by physical or psychological
   duress, human persons created in the image and likeness of God are
   deprived of their freedom, sold and reduced to being the property of
   others. They are treated as means to an end... [Criminal networks] are
   skilled in using modern means of communication as a way of luring young
   men and women in various parts of the world".[42][21] A perversion that
   exceeds all limits when it subjugates women and then forces them to
   abort. An abomination that goes to the length of kidnapping persons for
   the sake of selling their organs. Trafficking in persons and other
   contemporary forms of enslavement are a worldwide problem that needs to
   be taken seriously by humanity as a whole: "since criminal
   organizations employ global networks to achieve their goals, efforts to
   eliminate this phenomenon also demand a common and, indeed, a global
   effort on the part of various sectors of society".[43][22]

   Conflict and fear

   25. War, terrorist attacks, racial or religious persecution, and many
   other affronts to human dignity are judged differently, depending on
   how convenient it proves for certain, primarily economic, interests.
   What is true as long as it is convenient for someone in power stops
   being true once it becomes inconvenient. These situations of violence,
   sad to say, "have become so common as to constitute a real `third world
   war' fought piecemeal".[44][23]

   26. This should not be surprising, if we realize that we no longer have
   common horizons that unite us; indeed, the first victim of every war is
   "the human family's innate vocation to fraternity". As a result, "every
   threatening situation breeds mistrust and leads people to withdraw into
   their own safety zone".[45][24] Our world is trapped in a strange
   contradiction: we believe that we can "ensure stability and peace
   through a false sense of security sustained by a mentality of fear and
   mistrust".[46][25]

   27. Paradoxically, we have certain ancestral fears that technological
   development has not succeeded in eliminating; indeed, those fears have
   been able to hide and spread behind new technologies. Today too,
   outside the ancient town walls lies the abyss, the territory of the
   unknown, the wilderness. Whatever comes from there cannot be trusted,
   for it is unknown, unfamiliar, not part of the village. It is the
   territory of the "barbarian", from whom we must defend ourselves at all
   costs. As a result, new walls are erected for self-preservation, the
   outside world ceases to exist and leaves only "my" world, to the point
   that others, no longer considered human beings possessed of an
   inalienable dignity, become only "them". Once more, we encounter "the
   temptation to build a culture of walls, to raise walls, walls in the
   heart, walls on the land, in order to prevent this encounter with other
   cultures, with other people. And those who raise walls will end up as
   slaves within the very walls they have built. They are left without
   horizons, for they lack this interchange with others".[47][26]

   28. The loneliness, fear and insecurity experienced by those who feel
   abandoned by the system creates a fertile terrain for various "mafias".
   These flourish because they claim to be defenders of the forgotten,
   often by providing various forms of assistance even as they pursue
   their criminal interests. There also exists a typically "mafioso"
   pedagogy that, by appealing to a false communitarian mystique, creates
   bonds of dependency and fealty from which it is very difficult to break
   free.

   GLOBALIZATION AND PROGRESS WITHOUT A SHARED ROADMAP

   29. With the Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, we do not ignore the positive
   advances made in the areas of science, technology, medicine, industry
   and welfare, above all in developed countries. Nonetheless, "we wish to
   emphasize that, together with these historical advances, great and
   valued as they are, there exists a moral deterioration that influences
   international action and a weakening of spiritual values and
   responsibility. This contributes to a general feeling of frustration,
   isolation and desperation". We see "outbreaks of tension and a buildup
   of arms and ammunition in a global context dominated by uncertainty,
   disillusionment, fear of the future, and controlled by narrow economic
   interests". We can also point to "major political crises, situations of
   injustice and the lack of an equitable distribution of natural
   resources... In the face of such crises that result in the deaths of
   millions of children - emaciated from poverty and hunger - there is an
   unacceptable silence on the international level".[48][27] This
   panorama, for all its undeniable advances, does not appear to lead to a
   more humane future.

   30. In today's world, the sense of belonging to a single human family
   is fading, and the dream of working together for justice and peace
   seems an outdated utopia. What reigns instead is a cool, comfortable
   and globalized indifference, born of deep disillusionment concealed
   behind a deceptive illusion: thinking that we are all-powerful, while
   failing to realize that we are all in the same boat. This illusion,
   unmindful of the great fraternal values, leads to "a sort of cynicism.
   For that is the temptation we face if we go down the road of
   disenchantment and disappointment... Isolation and withdrawal into
   one's own interests are never the way to restore hope and bring about
   renewal. Rather, it is closeness; it is the culture of encounter.
   Isolation, no; closeness, yes. Culture clash, no; culture of encounter,
   yes".[49][28]

   31. In this world that races ahead, yet lacks a shared roadmap, we
   increasingly sense that "the gap between concern for one's personal
   well-being and the prosperity of the larger human family seems to be
   stretching to the point of complete division between individuals and
   human community... It is one thing to feel forced to live together, but
   something entirely different to value the richness and beauty of those
   seeds of common life that need to be sought out and
   cultivated".[50][29] Technology is constantly advancing, yet "how
   wonderful it would be if the growth of scientific and technological
   innovation could come with more equality and social inclusion. How
   wonderful would it be, even as we discover faraway planets, to
   rediscover the needs of the brothers and sisters who orbit around
   us".[51][30]

   PANDEMICS AND OTHER CALAMITIES IN HISTORY

   32. True, a worldwide tragedy like the Covid-19 pandemic momentarily
   revived the sense that we are a global community, all in the same boat,
   where one person's problems are the problems of all. Once more we
   realized that no one is saved alone; we can only be saved together. As
   I said in those days, "the storm has exposed our vulnerability and
   uncovered those false and superfluous certainties around which we
   constructed our daily schedules, our projects, our habits and
   priorities... Amid this storm, the façade of those stereotypes with
   which we camouflaged our egos, always worrying about appearances, has
   fallen away, revealing once more the ineluctable and blessed awareness
   that we are part of one another, that we are brothers and sisters of
   one another".[52][31]

   33. The world was relentlessly moving towards an economy that, thanks
   to technological progress, sought to reduce "human costs"; there were
   those who would have had us believe that freedom of the market was
   sufficient to keep everything secure. Yet the brutal and unforeseen
   blow of this uncontrolled pandemic forced us to recover our concern for
   human beings, for everyone, rather than for the benefit of a few. Today
   we can recognize that "we fed ourselves on dreams of splendour and
   grandeur, and ended up consuming distraction, insularity and solitude.
   We gorged ourselves on networking, and lost the taste of fraternity. We
   looked for quick and safe results, only to find ourselves overwhelmed
   by impatience and anxiety. Prisoners of a virtual reality, we lost the
   taste and flavour of the truly real".[53][32] The pain, uncertainty and
   fear, and the realization of our own limitations, brought on by the
   pandemic have only made it all the more urgent that we rethink our
   styles of life, our relationships, the organization of our societies
   and, above all, the meaning of our existence.

   34. If everything is connected, it is hard to imagine that this global
   disaster is unrelated to our way of approaching reality, our claim to
   be absolute masters of our own lives and of all that exists. I do not
   want to speak of divine retribution, nor would it be sufficient to say
   that the harm we do to nature is itself the punishment for our
   offences. The world is itself crying out in rebellion. We are reminded
   of the well-known verse of the poet Virgil that evokes the "tears of
   things", the misfortunes of life and history.[54][33]

   35. All too quickly, however, we forget the lessons of history, "the
   teacher of life".[55][34] Once this health crisis passes, our worst
   response would be to plunge even more deeply into feverish consumerism
   and new forms of egotistic self-preservation. God willing, after all
   this, we will think no longer in terms of "them" and "those", but only
   "us". If only this may prove not to be just another tragedy of history
   from which we learned nothing. If only we might keep in mind all those
   elderly persons who died for lack of respirators, partly as a result of
   the dismantling, year after year, of healthcare systems. If only this
   immense sorrow may not prove useless, but enable us to take a step
   forward towards a new style of life. If only we might rediscover once
   for all that we need one another, and that in this way our human family
   can experience a rebirth, with all its faces, all its hands and all its
   voices, beyond the walls that we have erected.

   36. Unless we recover the shared passion to create a community of
   belonging and solidarity worthy of our time, our energy and our
   resources, the global illusion that misled us will collapse and leave
   many in the grip of anguish and emptiness. Nor should we naively refuse
   to recognize that "obsession with a consumerist lifestyle, above all
   when few people are capable of maintaining it, can only lead to
   violence and mutual destruction".[56][35] The notion of "every man for
   himself" will rapidly degenerate into a free-for-all that would prove
   worse than any pandemic.

   AN ABSENCE OF HUMAN DIGNITY ON THE BORDERS

   37. Certain populist political regimes, as well as certain liberal
   economic approaches, maintain that an influx of migrants is to be
   prevented at all costs. Arguments are also made for the propriety of
   limiting aid to poor countries, so that they can hit rock bottom and
   find themselves forced to take austerity measures. One fails to realize
   that behind such statements, abstract and hard to support, great
   numbers of lives are at stake. Many migrants have fled from war,
   persecution and natural catastrophes. Others, rightly, "are seeking
   opportunities for themselves and their families. They dream of a better
   future and they want to create the conditions for achieving
   it".[57][36]

   38. Sadly, some "are attracted by Western culture, sometimes with
   unrealistic expectations that expose them to grave disappointments.
   Unscrupulous traffickers, frequently linked to drug cartels or arms
   cartels, exploit the weakness of migrants, who too often experience
   violence, trafficking, psychological and physical abuse and untold
   sufferings on their journey".[58][37] Those who emigrate "experience
   separation from their place of origin, and often a cultural and
   religious uprooting as well. Fragmentation is also felt by the
   communities they leave behind, which lose their most vigorous and
   enterprising elements, and by families, especially when one or both of
   the parents migrates, leaving the children in the country of
   origin".[59][38] For this reason, "there is also a need to reaffirm the
   right not to emigrate, that is, to remain in one's homeland".[60][39]

   39. Then too, "in some host countries, migration causes fear and alarm,
   often fomented and exploited for political purposes. This can lead to a
   xenophobic mentality, as people close in on themselves, and it needs to
   be addressed decisively".[61][40] Migrants are not seen as entitled
   like others to participate in the life of society, and it is forgotten
   that they possess the same intrinsic dignity as any person. Hence they
   ought to be "agents in their own redemption".[62][41] No one will ever
   openly deny that they are human beings, yet in practice, by our
   decisions and the way we treat them, we can show that we consider them
   less worthy, less important, less human. For Christians, this way of
   thinking and acting is unacceptable, since it sets certain political
   preferences above deep convictions of our faith: the inalienable
   dignity of each human person regardless of origin, race or religion,
   and the supreme law of fraternal love.

   40. "Migrations, more than ever before, will play a pivotal role in the
   future of our world".[63][42] At present, however, migration is
   affected by the "loss of that sense of responsibility for our brothers
   and sisters on which every civil society is based".[64][43] Europe, for
   example, seriously risks taking this path. Nonetheless, "aided by its
   great cultural and religious heritage, it has the means to defend the
   centrality of the human person and to find the right balance between
   its twofold moral responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens
   and to assure assistance and acceptance to migrants".[65][44]

   41. I realize that some people are hesitant and fearful with regard to
   migrants. I consider this part of our natural instinct of self-defence.
   Yet it is also true that an individual and a people are only fruitful
   and productive if they are able to develop a creative openness to
   others. I ask everyone to move beyond those primal reactions because
   "there is a problem when doubts and fears condition our way of thinking
   and acting to the point of making us intolerant, closed and perhaps
   even - without realizing it - racist. In this way, fear deprives us of
   the desire and the ability to encounter the other".[66][45]

   THE ILLUSION OF COMMUNICATION

   42. Oddly enough, while closed and intolerant attitudes towards others
   are on the rise, distances are otherwise shrinking or disappearing to
   the point that the right to privacy scarcely exists. Everything has
   become a kind of spectacle to be examined and inspected, and people's
   lives are now under constant surveillance. Digital communication wants
   to bring everything out into the open; people's lives are combed over,
   laid bare and bandied about, often anonymously. Respect for others
   disintegrates, and even as we dismiss, ignore or keep others distant,
   we can shamelessly peer into every detail of their lives.

   42. Digital campaigns of hatred and destruction, for their part, are
   not - as some would have us believe - a positive form of mutual
   support, but simply an association of individuals united against a
   perceived common enemy. "Digital media can also expose people to the
   risk of addiction, isolation and a gradual loss of contact with
   concrete reality, blocking the development of authentic interpersonal
   relationships".[67][46] They lack the physical gestures, facial
   expressions, moments of silence, body language and even the smells, the
   trembling of hands, the blushes and perspiration that speak to us and
   are a part of human communication. Digital relationships, which do not
   demand the slow and gradual cultivation of friendships, stable
   interaction or the building of a consensus that matures over time, have
   the appearance of sociability. Yet they do not really build community;
   instead, they tend to disguise and expand the very individualism that
   finds expression in xenophobia and in contempt for the vulnerable.
   Digital connectivity is not enough to build bridges. It is not capable
   of uniting humanity.

   Shameless aggression

   44. Even as individuals maintain their comfortable consumerist
   isolation, they can choose a form of constant and febrile bonding that
   encourages remarkable hostility, insults, abuse, defamation and verbal
   violence destructive of others, and this with a lack of restraint that
   could not exist in physical contact without tearing us all apart.
   Social aggression has found unparalleled room for expansion through
   computers and mobile devices.

   45. This has now given free rein to ideologies. Things that until a few
   years ago could not be said by anyone without risking the loss of
   universal respect can now be said with impunity, and in the crudest of
   terms, even by some political figures. Nor should we forget that "there
   are huge economic interests operating in the digital world, capable of
   exercising forms of control as subtle as they are invasive, creating
   mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic
   process. The way many platforms work often ends up favouring encounter
   between persons who think alike, shielding them from debate. These
   closed circuits facilitate the spread of fake news and false
   information, fomenting prejudice and hate".[68][47]

   46. We should also recognize that destructive forms of fanaticism are
   at times found among religious believers, including Christians; they
   too "can be caught up in networks of verbal violence through the
   internet and the various forums of digital communication. Even in
   Catholic media, limits can be overstepped, defamation and slander can
   become commonplace, and all ethical standards and respect for the good
   name of others can be abandoned".[69][48] How can this contribute to
   the fraternity that our common Father asks of us?

   Information without wisdom

   47. True wisdom demands an encounter with reality. Today, however,
   everything can be created, disguised and altered. A direct encounter
   even with the fringes of reality can thus prove intolerable. A
   mechanism of selection then comes into play, whereby I can immediately
   separate likes from dislikes, what I consider attractive from what I
   deem distasteful. In the same way, we can choose the people with whom
   we wish to share our world. Persons or situations we find unpleasant or
   disagreeable are simply deleted in today's virtual networks; a virtual
   circle is then created, isolating us from the real world in which we
   are living.

   48. The ability to sit down and listen to others, typical of
   interpersonal encounters, is paradigmatic of the welcoming attitude
   shown by those who transcend narcissism and accept others, caring for
   them and welcoming them into their lives. Yet "today's world is largely
   a deaf world... At times, the frantic pace of the modern world prevents
   us from listening attentively to what another person is saying. Halfway
   through, we interrupt him and want to contradict what he has not even
   finished saying. We must not lose our ability to listen". Saint Francis
   "heard the voice of God, he heard the voice of the poor, he heard the
   voice of the infirm and he heard the voice of nature. He made of them a
   way of life. My desire is that the seed that Saint Francis planted may
   grow in the hearts of many".[70][49]

   49. As silence and careful listening disappear, replaced by a frenzy of
   texting, this basic structure of sage human communication is at risk. A
   new lifestyle is emerging, where we create only what we want and
   exclude all that we cannot control or know instantly and superficially.
   This process, by its intrinsic logic, blocks the kind of serene
   reflection that could lead us to a shared wisdom.

   50. Together, we can seek the truth in dialogue, in relaxed
   conversation or in passionate debate. To do so calls for perseverance;
   it entails moments of silence and suffering, yet it can patiently
   embrace the broader experience of individuals and peoples. The flood of
   information at our fingertips does not make for greater wisdom. Wisdom
   is not born of quick searches on the internet nor is it a mass of
   unverified data. That is not the way to mature in the encounter with
   truth. Conversations revolve only around the latest data; they become
   merely horizontal and cumulative. We fail to keep our attention
   focused, to penetrate to the heart of matters, and to recognize what is
   essential to give meaning to our lives. Freedom thus becomes an
   illusion that we are peddled, easily confused with the ability to
   navigate the internet. The process of building fraternity, be it local
   or universal, can only be undertaken by spirits that are free and open
   to authentic encounters.

   FORMS OF SUBJECTION AND OF SELF-CONTEMPT

   51. Certain economically prosperous countries tend to be proposed as
   cultural models for less developed countries; instead, each of those
   countries should be helped to grow in its own distinct way and to
   develop its capacity for innovation while respecting the values of its
   proper culture. A shallow and pathetic desire to imitate others leads
   to copying and consuming in place of creating, and fosters low national
   self-esteem. In the affluent sectors of many poor countries, and at
   times in those who have recently emerged from poverty, there is a
   resistance to native ways of thinking and acting, and a tendency to
   look down on one's own cultural identity, as if it were the sole cause
   of every ill.

   52. Destroying self-esteem is an easy way to dominate others. Behind
   these trends that tend to level our world, there flourish powerful
   interests that take advantage of such low self-esteem, while
   attempting, through the media and networks, to create a new culture in
   the service of the elite. This plays into the opportunism of financial
   speculators and raiders, and the poor always end up the losers. Then
   too, ignoring the culture of their people has led to the inability of
   many political leaders to devise an effective development plan that
   could be freely accepted and sustained over time.

   53. We forget that "there is no worse form of alienation than to feel
   uprooted, belonging to no one. A land will be fruitful, and its people
   bear fruit and give birth to the future, only to the extent that it can
   foster a sense of belonging among its members, create bonds of
   integration between generations and different communities, and avoid
   all that makes us insensitive to others and leads to further
   alienation".[71][50]

   HOPE

   54. Despite these dark clouds, which may not be ignored, I would like
   in the following pages to take up and discuss many new paths of hope.
   For God continues to sow abundant seeds of goodness in our human
   family. The recent pandemic enabled us to recognize and appreciate once
   more all those around us who, in the midst of fear, responded by
   putting their lives on the line. We began to realize that our lives are
   interwoven with and sustained by ordinary people valiantly shaping the
   decisive events of our shared history: doctors, nurses, pharmacists,
   storekeepers and supermarket workers, cleaning personnel, caretakers,
   transport workers, men and women working to provide essential services
   and public safety, volunteers, priests and religious... They understood
   that no one is saved alone.[72][51]

   55. I invite everyone to renewed hope, for hope "speaks to us of
   something deeply rooted in every human heart, independently of our
   circumstances and historical conditioning. Hope speaks to us of a
   thirst, an aspiration, a longing for a life of fulfillment, a desire to
   achieve great things, things that fill our heart and lift our spirit to
   lofty realities like truth, goodness and beauty, justice and love...
   Hope is bold; it can look beyond personal convenience, the petty
   securities and compensations which limit our horizon, and it can open
   us up to grand ideals that make life more beautiful and
   worthwhile".[73][52] Let us continue, then, to advance along the paths
   of hope.

                                 CHAPTER TWO

                           A STRANGER ON THE ROAD

   56. The previous chapter should not be read as a cool and detached
   description of today's problems, for "the joys and hopes, the grief and
   anguish of the people of our time, especially of those who are poor or
   afflicted, are the joys and hopes, the grief and anguish of the
   followers of Christ as well. Nothing that is genuinely human fails to
   find an echo in their hearts".[74][53] In the attempt to search for a
   ray of light in the midst of what we are experiencing, and before
   proposing a few lines of action, I now wish to devote a chapter to a
   parable told by Jesus Christ two thousand years ago. Although this
   Letter is addressed to all people of good will, regardless of their
   religious convictions, the parable is one that any of us can relate to
   and find challenging.

   "Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. `Teacher,' he said, `what
   must I do to inherit eternal life?' He said to him, `What is written in
   the law? What do you read there?' He answered, `You shall love the Lord
   your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your
   strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself.' And
   he said to him, `You have given the right answer; do this, and you will
   live.' But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, `And who is my
   neighbour?' Jesus replied, `A man was going down from Jerusalem to
   Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat
   him, and went away, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was
   going down that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other
   side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him,
   passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while traveling came near
   him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity. He went to him and
   bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put
   him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The
   next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said,
   `Take care of him; and when I come back, I will repay you whatever more
   you spend.' Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbour to the
   man who fell into the hands of the robbers?" He said, `The one who
   showed him mercy.' Jesus said to him, `Go and do likewise.'"(Lk
   10:25-37).

   The context

   57. This parable has to do with an age-old problem. Shortly after its
   account of the creation of the world and of man, the Bible takes up the
   issue of human relationships. Cain kills his brother Abel and then
   hears God ask: "Where is your brother Abel?" (Gen 4:9). His answer is
   one that we ourselves all too often give: "Am I my brother's keeper?"
   (ibid.). By the very question he asks, God leaves no room for an appeal
   to determinism or fatalism as a justification for our own indifference.
   Instead, he encourages us to create a different culture, in which we
   resolve our conflicts and care for one another.

   58. The Book of Job sees our origin in the one Creator as the basis of
   certain common rights: "Did not he who made me in the womb also make
   him? And did not the same one fashion us in the womb?" (Job 31:15).
   Many centuries later, Saint Irenaeus would use the image of a melody to
   make the same point: "One who seeks the truth should not concentrate on
   the differences between one note and another, thinking as if each was
   created separately and apart from the others; instead, he should
   realize that one and the same person composed the entire
   melody".[75][54]

   59. In earlier Jewish traditions, the imperative to love and care for
   others appears to have been limited to relationships between members of
   the same nation. The ancient commandment to "love your neighbour as
   yourself" (Lev 19:18) was usually understood as referring to one's
   fellow citizens, yet the boundaries gradually expanded, especially in
   the Judaism that developed outside of the land of Israel. We encounter
   the command not to do to others what you would not want them to do to
   you (cf. Tob 4:15). In the first century before Christ, Rabbi Hillel
   stated: "This is the entire Torah. Everything else is
   commentary".[76][55] The desire to imitate God's own way of acting
   gradually replaced the tendency to think only of those nearest us: "The
   compassion of man is for his neighbour, but the compassion of the Lord
   is for all living beings" (Sir 18:13).

   60. In the New Testament, Hillel's precept was expressed in positive
   terms: "In everything, do to others as you would have them do to you;
   for this is the law and the prophets" (Mt 7:12). This command is
   universal in scope, embracing everyone on the basis of our shared
   humanity, since the heavenly Father "makes his sun rise on the evil and
   on the good" (Mt 5:45). Hence the summons to "be merciful, just as your
   Father is merciful" (Lk 6:36).

   61. In the oldest texts of the Bible, we find a reason why our hearts
   should expand to embrace the foreigner. It derives from the enduring
   memory of the Jewish people that they themselves had once lived as
   foreigners in Egypt:

   "You shall not wrong or oppress a stranger, for you were strangers in
   the land of Egypt" (Ex 22:21).

   "You shall not oppress a stranger; you know the heart of a stranger,
   for you were strangers in the land of Egypt" (Ex 23:9).

   "When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not do him
   wrong. The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen
   among you; you shall love the stranger as yourself, for you were
   strangers in the land of Egypt" (Lev 19:33-34).

   "When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not glean what is
   left; it shall be for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow.
   Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt" (Deut 24:21-22).

   The call to fraternal love echoes throughout the New Testament:

   "For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, `You shall
   love your neighbour as yourself'" (Gal 5:14).

   "Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light, and in such a
   person there is no cause for stumbling. But whoever hates another
   believer is in the darkness" (1 Jn 2:10-11).

   "We know that we have passed from death to life because we love one
   another. Whoever does not love abides in death" (1 Jn 3:14).

   "Those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot
   love God whom they have not seen" (1 Jn 4:20).

   62. Yet this call to love could be misunderstood. Saint Paul,
   recognizing the temptation of the earliest Christian communities to
   form closed and isolated groups, urged his disciples to abound in love
   "for one another and for all" (1 Thess 3:12). In the Johannine
   community, fellow Christians were to be welcomed, "even though they are
   strangers to you" (3 Jn 5). In this context, we can better understand
   the significance of the parable of the Good Samaritan: love does not
   care if a brother or sister in need comes from one place or another.
   For "love shatters the chains that keep us isolated and separate; in
   their place, it builds bridges. Love enables us to create one great
   family, where all of us can feel at home... Love exudes compassion and
   dignity".[77][56]

   Abandoned on the wayside

   63. Jesus tells the story of a man assaulted by thieves and lying
   injured on the wayside. Several persons passed him by, but failed to
   stop. These were people holding important social positions, yet lacking
   in real concern for the common good. They would not waste a couple of
   minutes caring for the injured man, or even in calling for help. Only
   one person stopped, approached the man and cared for him personally,
   even spending his own money to provide for his needs. He also gave him
   something that in our frenetic world we cling to tightly: he gave him
   his time. Certainly, he had his own plans for that day, his own needs,
   commitments and desires. Yet he was able to put all that aside when
   confronted with someone in need. Without even knowing the injured man,
   he saw him as deserving of his time and attention.

   64. Which of these persons do you identify with? This question, blunt
   as it is, is direct and incisive. Which of these characters do you
   resemble? We need to acknowledge that we are constantly tempted to
   ignore others, especially the weak. Let us admit that, for all the
   progress we have made, we are still "illiterate" when it comes to
   accompanying, caring for and supporting the most frail and vulnerable
   members of our developed societies. We have become accustomed to
   looking the other way, passing by, ignoring situations until they
   affect us directly.

   65. Someone is assaulted on our streets, and many hurry off as if they
   did not notice. People hit someone with their car and then flee the
   scene. Their only desire is to avoid problems; it does not matter that,
   through their fault, another person could die. All these are signs of
   an approach to life that is spreading in various and subtle ways. What
   is more, caught up as we are with our own needs, the sight of a person
   who is suffering disturbs us. It makes us uneasy, since we have no time
   to waste on other people's problems. These are symptoms of an unhealthy
   society. A society that seeks prosperity but turns its back on
   suffering.

   66. May we not sink to such depths! Let us look to the example of the
   Good Samaritan. Jesus' parable summons us to rediscover our vocation as
   citizens of our respective nations and of the entire world, builders of
   a new social bond. This summons is ever new, yet it is grounded in a
   fundamental law of our being: we are called to direct society to the
   pursuit of the common good and, with this purpose in mind, to persevere
   in consolidating its political and social order, its fabric of
   relations, its human goals. By his actions, the Good Samaritan showed
   that "the existence of each and every individual is deeply tied to that
   of others: life is not simply time that passes; life is a time for
   interactions".[78][57]

   67. The parable eloquently presents the basic decision we need to make
   in order to rebuild our wounded world. In the face of so much pain and
   suffering, our only course is to imitate the Good Samaritan. Any other
   decision would make us either one of the robbers or one of those who
   walked by without showing compassion for the sufferings of the man on
   the roadside. The parable shows us how a community can be rebuilt by
   men and women who identify with the vulnerability of others, who reject
   the creation of a society of exclusion, and act instead as neighbours,
   lifting up and rehabilitating the fallen for the sake of the common
   good. At the same time, it warns us about the attitude of those who
   think only of themselves and fail to shoulder the inevitable
   responsibilities of life as it is.

   68. The parable clearly does not indulge in abstract moralizing, nor is
   its message merely social and ethical. It speaks to us of an essential
   and often forgotten aspect of our common humanity: we were created for
   a fulfilment that can only be found in love. We cannot be indifferent
   to suffering; we cannot allow anyone to go through life as an outcast.
   Instead, we should feel indignant, challenged to emerge from our
   comfortable isolation and to be changed by our contact with human
   suffering. That is the meaning of dignity.

   A story constantly retold

   69. The parable is clear and straightforward, yet it also evokes the
   interior struggle that each of us experiences as we gradually come to
   know ourselves through our relationships with our brothers and sisters.
   Sooner or later, we will all encounter a person who is suffering. Today
   there are more and more of them. The decision to include or exclude
   those lying wounded along the roadside can serve as a criterion for
   judging every economic, political, social and religious project. Each
   day we have to decide whether to be Good Samaritans or indifferent
   bystanders. And if we extend our gaze to the history of our own lives
   and that of the entire world, all of us are, or have been, like each of
   the characters in the parable. All of us have in ourselves something of
   the wounded man, something of the robber, something of the passers-by,
   and something of the Good Samaritan.

   70. It is remarkable how the various characters in the story change,
   once confronted by the painful sight of the poor man on the roadside.
   The distinctions between Judean and Samaritan, priest and merchant,
   fade into insignificance. Now there are only two kinds of people: those
   who care for someone who is hurting and those who pass by; those who
   bend down to help and those who look the other way and hurry off. Here,
   all our distinctions, labels and masks fall away: it is the moment of
   truth. Will we bend down to touch and heal the wounds of others? Will
   we bend down and help another to get up? This is today's challenge, and
   we should not be afraid to face it. In moments of crisis, decisions
   become urgent. It could be said that, here and now, anyone who is
   neither a robber nor a passer-by is either injured himself or bearing
   an injured person on his shoulders.

   71. The story of the Good Samaritan is constantly being repeated. We
   can see this clearly as social and political inertia is turning many
   parts of our world into a desolate byway, even as domestic and
   international disputes and the robbing of opportunities are leaving
   great numbers of the marginalized stranded on the roadside. In his
   parable, Jesus does not offer alternatives; he does not ask what might
   have happened had the injured man or the one who helped him yielded to
   anger or a thirst for revenge. Jesus trusts in the best of the human
   spirit; with this parable, he encourages us to persevere in love, to
   restore dignity to the suffering and to build a society worthy of the
   name.

   The characters of the story

   72. The parable begins with the robbers. Jesus chose to start when the
   robbery has already taken place, lest we dwell on the crime itself or
   the thieves who committed it. Yet we know them well. We have seen,
   descending on our world, the dark shadows of neglect and violence in
   the service of petty interests of power, gain and division. The real
   question is this: will we abandon the injured man and run to take
   refuge from the violence, or will we pursue the thieves? Will the
   wounded man end up being the justification for our irreconcilable
   divisions, our cruel indifference, our intestine conflicts?

   73. The parable then asks us to take a closer look at the passers-by.
   The nervous indifference that makes them pass to the other side of the
   road - whether innocently or not, whether the result of disdain or mere
   distraction - makes the priest and the Levite a sad reflection of the
   growing gulf between ourselves and the world around us. There are many
   ways to pass by at a safe distance: we can retreat inwards, ignore
   others, or be indifferent to their plight. Or simply look elsewhere, as
   in some countries, or certain sectors of them, where contempt is shown
   for the poor and their culture, and one looks the other way, as if a
   development plan imported from without could edge them out. This is how
   some justify their indifference: the poor, whose pleas for help might
   touch their hearts, simply do not exist. The poor are beyond the scope
   of their interest.

   74. One detail about the passers-by does stand out: they were
   religious, devoted to the worship of God: a priest and a Levite. This
   detail should not be overlooked. It shows that belief in God and the
   worship of God are not enough to ensure that we are actually living in
   a way pleasing to God. A believer may be untrue to everything that his
   faith demands of him, and yet think he is close to God and better than
   others. The guarantee of an authentic openness to God, on the other
   hand, is a way of practising the faith that helps open our hearts to
   our brothers and sisters. Saint John Chrysostom expressed this
   pointedly when he challenged his Christian hearers: "Do you wish to
   honour the body of the Saviour? Do not despise it when it is naked. Do
   not honour it in church with silk vestments while outside it is naked
   and numb with cold".[79][58] Paradoxically, those who claim to be
   unbelievers can sometimes put God's will into practice better than
   believers.

   75. "Robbers" usually find secret allies in those who "pass by and look
   the other way". There is a certain interplay between those who
   manipulate and cheat society, and those who, while claiming to be
   detached and impartial critics, live off that system and its benefits.
   There is a sad hypocrisy when the impunity of crime, the use of
   institutions for personal or corporate gain, and other evils apparently
   impossible to eradicate, are accompanied by a relentless criticism of
   everything, a constant sowing of suspicion that results in distrust and
   confusion. The complaint that "everything is broken" is answered by the
   claim that "it can't be fixed", or "what can I do?" This feeds into
   disillusionment and despair, and hardly encourages a spirit of
   solidarity and generosity. Plunging people into despair closes a
   perfectly perverse circle: such is the agenda of the invisible
   dictatorship of hidden interests that have gained mastery over both
   resources and the possibility of thinking and expressing opinions.

   76. Let us turn at last to the injured man. There are times when we
   feel like him, badly hurt and left on side of the road. We can also
   feel helpless because our institutions are neglected and lack
   resources, or simply serve the interests of a few, without and within.
   Indeed, "globalized society often has an elegant way of shifting its
   gaze. Under the guise of being politically correct or ideologically
   fashionable, we look at those who suffer without touching them. We
   televise live pictures of them, even speaking about them with
   euphemisms and with apparent tolerance".[80][59]

   Starting anew

   77. Each day offers us a new opportunity, a new possibility. We should
   not expect everything from those who govern us, for that would be
   childish. We have the space we need for co-responsibility in creating
   and putting into place new processes and changes. Let us take an active
   part in renewing and supporting our troubled societies. Today we have a
   great opportunity to express our innate sense of fraternity, to be Good
   Samaritans who bear the pain of other people's troubles rather than
   fomenting greater hatred and resentment. Like the chance traveller in
   the parable, we need only have a pure and simple desire to be a people,
   a community, constant and tireless in the effort to include, integrate
   and lift up the fallen. We may often find ourselves succumbing to the
   mentality of the violent, the blindly ambitious, those who spread
   mistrust and lies. Others may continue to view politics or the economy
   as an arena for their own power plays. For our part, let us foster what
   is good and place ourselves at its service.

   78. We can start from below and, case by case, act at the most concrete
   and local levels, and then expand to the farthest reaches of our
   countries and our world, with the same care and concern that the
   Samaritan showed for each of the wounded man's injuries. Let us seek
   out others and embrace the world as it is, without fear of pain or a
   sense of inadequacy, because there we will discover all the goodness
   that God has planted in human hearts. Difficulties that seem
   overwhelming are opportunities for growth, not excuses for a glum
   resignation that can lead only to acquiescence. Yet let us not do this
   alone, as individuals. The Samaritan discovered an innkeeper who would
   care for the man; we too are called to unite as a family that is
   stronger than the sum of small individual members. For "the whole is
   greater than the part, but it is also greater than the sum of its
   parts".[81][60] Let us renounce the pettiness and resentment of useless
   in-fighting and constant confrontation. Let us stop feeling sorry for
   ourselves and acknowledge our crimes, our apathy, our lies. Reparation
   and reconciliation will give us new life and set us all free from fear.

   79. The Samaritan who stopped along the way departed without expecting
   any recognition or gratitude. His effort to assist another person gave
   him great satisfaction in life and before his God, and thus became a
   duty. All of us have a responsibility for the wounded, those of our own
   people and all the peoples of the earth. Let us care for the needs of
   every man and woman, young and old, with the same fraternal spirit of
   care and closeness that marked the Good Samaritan.

   Neighbours without borders

   80. Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan in answer to the
   question: Who is my neighbour? The word "neighbour", in the society of
   Jesus' time, usually meant those nearest us. It was felt that help
   should be given primarily to those of one's own group and race. For
   some Jews of that time, Samaritans were looked down upon, considered
   impure. They were not among those to be helped. Jesus, himself a Jew,
   completely transforms this approach. He asks us not to decide who is
   close enough to be our neighbour, but rather that we ourselves become
   neighbours to all.

   81. Jesus asks us to be present to those in need of help, regardless of
   whether or not they belong to our social group. In this case, the
   Samaritan became a neighbour to the wounded Judean. By approaching and
   making himself present, he crossed all cultural and historical
   barriers. Jesus concludes the parable by saying: "Go and do likewise"
   (Lk 10:37). In other words, he challenges us to put aside all
   differences and, in the face of suffering, to draw near to others with
   no questions asked. I should no longer say that I have neighbours to
   help, but that I must myself be a neighbour to others.

   82. The parable, though, is troubling, for Jesus says that that the
   wounded man was a Judean, while the one who stopped and helped him was
   a Samaritan. This detail is quite significant for our reflection on a
   love that includes everyone. The Samaritans lived in a region where
   pagan rites were practised. For the Jews, this made them impure,
   detestable, dangerous. In fact, one ancient Jewish text referring to
   nations that were hated, speaks of Samaria as "not even a people" (Sir
   50:25); it also refers to "the foolish people that live in Shechem"
   (50:26).

   83. This explains why a Samaritan woman, when asked by Jesus for a
   drink, answered curtly: "How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me,
   a woman of Samaria?" (Jn 4:9). The most offensive charge that those who
   sought to discredit Jesus could bring was that he was "possessed" and
   "a Samaritan" (Jn 8:48). So this encounter of mercy between a Samaritan
   and a Jew is highly provocative; it leaves no room for ideological
   manipulation and challenges us to expand our frontiers. It gives a
   universal dimension to our call to love, one that transcends all
   prejudices, all historical and cultural barriers, all petty interests.

   The plea of the stranger

   84. Finally, I would note that in another passage of the Gospel Jesus
   says: "I was a stranger and you welcomed me" (Mt 25:35). Jesus could
   speak those words because he had an open heart, sensitive to the
   difficulties of others. Saint Paul urges us to "rejoice with those who
   rejoice, weep with those who weep" (Rom 12:15). When our hearts do
   this, they are capable of identifying with others without worrying
   about where they were born or come from. In the process, we come to
   experience others as our "own flesh" (Is 58:7).

   85. For Christians, the words of Jesus have an even deeper meaning.
   They compel us to recognize Christ himself in each of our abandoned or
   excluded brothers and sisters (cf. Mt 25:40.45). Faith has untold power
   to inspire and sustain our respect for others, for believers come to
   know that God loves every man and woman with infinite love and "thereby
   confers infinite dignity" upon all humanity.[82][61] We likewise
   believe that Christ shed his blood for each of us and that no one is
   beyond the scope of his universal love. If we go to the ultimate source
   of that love which is the very life of the triune God, we encounter in
   the community of the three divine Persons the origin and perfect model
   of all life in society. Theology continues to be enriched by its
   reflection on this great truth.

   86. I sometimes wonder why, in light of this, it took so long for the
   Church unequivocally to condemn slavery and various forms of violence.
   Today, with our developed spirituality and theology, we have no
   excuses. Still, there are those who appear to feel encouraged or at
   least permitted by their faith to support varieties of narrow and
   violent nationalism, xenophobia and contempt, and even the mistreatment
   of those who are different. Faith, and the humanism it inspires, must
   maintain a critical sense in the face of these tendencies, and prompt
   an immediate response whenever they rear their head. For this reason,
   it is important that catechesis and preaching speak more directly and
   clearly about the social meaning of existence, the fraternal dimension
   of spirituality, our conviction of the inalienable dignity of each
   person, and our reasons for loving and accepting all our brothers and
   sisters.

                                CHAPTER THREE

                  ENVISAGING AND ENGENDERING AN OPEN WORLD

   87. Human beings are so made that they cannot live, develop and find
   fulfilment except "in the sincere gift of self to others".[83][62] Nor
   can they fully know themselves apart from an encounter with other
   persons: "I communicate effectively with myself only insofar as I
   communicate with others".[84][63] No one can experience the true beauty
   of life without relating to others, without having real faces to love.
   This is part of the mystery of authentic human existence. "Life exists
   where there is bonding, communion, fraternity; and life is stronger
   than death when it is built on true relationships and bonds of
   fidelity. On the contrary, there is no life when we claim to be
   self-sufficient and live as islands: in these attitudes, death
   prevails".[85][64]

   MOVING BEYOND OURSELVES

   88. In the depths of every heart, love creates bonds and expands
   existence, for it draws people out of themselves and towards
   others.[86][65] Since we were made for love, in each one of us "a law
   of ekstasis" seems to operate: "the lover `goes outside' the self to
   find a fuller existence in another".[87][66] For this reason, "man
   always has to take up the challenge of moving beyond himself".[88][67]

   89. Nor can I reduce my life to relationships with a small group, even
   my own family; I cannot know myself apart from a broader network of
   relationships, including those that have preceded me and shaped my
   entire life. My relationship with those whom I respect has to take
   account of the fact that they do not live only for me, nor do I live
   only for them. Our relationships, if healthy and authentic, open us to
   others who expand and enrich us. Nowadays, our noblest social instincts
   can easily be thwarted by self-centred chats that give the impression
   of being deep relationships. On the contrary, authentic and mature love
   and true friendship can only take root in hearts open to growth through
   relationships with others. As couples or friends, we find that our
   hearts expand as we step out of ourselves and embrace others. Closed
   groups and self-absorbed couples that define themselves in opposition
   to others tend to be expressions of selfishness and mere
   self-preservation.

   90. Significantly, many small communities living in desert areas
   developed a remarkable system of welcoming pilgrims as an exercise of
   the sacred duty of hospitality. The medieval monastic communities did
   likewise, as we see from the Rule of Saint Benedict. While
   acknowledging that it might detract from the discipline and silence of
   monasteries, Benedict nonetheless insisted that "the poor and pilgrims
   be treated with the utmost care and attention".[89][68] Hospitality was
   one specific way of rising to the challenge and the gift present in an
   encounter with those outside one's own circle. The monks realized that
   the values they sought to cultivate had to be accompanied by a
   readiness to move beyond themselves in openness to others.

   The unique value of love

   91. People can develop certain habits that might appear as moral
   values: fortitude, sobriety, hard work and similar virtues. Yet if the
   acts of the various moral virtues are to be rightly directed, one needs
   to take into account the extent to which they foster openness and union
   with others. That is made possible by the charity that God infuses.
   Without charity, we may perhaps possess only apparent virtues,
   incapable of sustaining life in common. Thus, Saint Thomas Aquinas
   could say - quoting Saint Augustine - that the temperance of a greedy
   person is in no way virtuous.[90][69] Saint Bonaventure, for his part,
   explained that the other virtues, without charity, strictly speaking do
   not fulfil the commandments "the way God wants them to be
   fulfilled".[91][70]

   92. The spiritual stature of a person's life is measured by love, which
   in the end remains "the criterion for the definitive decision about a
   human life's worth or lack thereof".[92][71] Yet some believers think
   that it consists in the imposition of their own ideologies upon
   everyone else, or in a violent defence of the truth, or in impressive
   demonstrations of strength. All of us, as believers, need to recognize
   that love takes first place: love must never be put at risk, and the
   greatest danger lies in failing to love (cf. 1 Cor 13:1-13).

   93. Saint Thomas Aquinas sought to describe the love made possible by
   God's grace as a movement outwards towards another, whereby we consider
   "the beloved as somehow united to ourselves".[93][72] Our affection for
   others makes us freely desire to seek their good. All this originates
   in a sense of esteem, an appreciation of the value of the other. This
   is ultimately the idea behind the word "charity": those who are loved
   are "dear" to me; "they are considered of great value".[94][73] And
   "the love whereby someone becomes pleasing (grata) to another is the
   reason why the latter bestows something on him freely
   (gratis)".[95][74]

   94. Love, then, is more than just a series of benevolent actions. Those
   actions have their source in a union increasingly directed towards
   others, considering them of value, worthy, pleasing and beautiful apart
   from their physical or moral appearances. Our love for others, for who
   they are, moves us to seek the best for their lives. Only by
   cultivating this way of relating to one another will we make possible a
   social friendship that excludes no one and a fraternity that is open to
   all.

   A LOVE EVER MORE OPEN

   95. Love also impels us towards universal communion. No one can mature
   or find fulfilment by withdrawing from others. By its very nature, love
   calls for growth in openness and the ability to accept others as part
   of a continuing adventure that makes every periphery converge in a
   greater sense of mutual belonging. As Jesus told us: "You are all
   brothers" (Mt 23:8).

   96. This need to transcend our own limitations also applies to
   different regions and countries. Indeed, "the ever-increasing number of
   interconnections and communications in today's world makes us
   powerfully aware of the unity and common destiny of the nations. In the
   dynamics of history, and in the diversity of ethnic groups, societies
   and cultures, we see the seeds of a vocation to form a community
   composed of brothers and sisters who accept and care for one
   another".[96][75]

   Open societies that integrate everyone

   97. Some peripheries are close to us, in city centres or within our
   families. Hence there is an aspect of universal openness in love that
   is existential rather than geographical. It has to do with our daily
   efforts to expand our circle of friends, to reach those who, even
   though they are close to me, I do not naturally consider a part of my
   circle of interests. Every brother or sister in need, when abandoned or
   ignored by the society in which I live, becomes an existential
   foreigner, even though born in the same country. They may be citizens
   with full rights, yet they are treated like foreigners in their own
   country. Racism is a virus that quickly mutates and, instead of
   disappearing, goes into hiding, and lurks in waiting.

   98. I would like to mention some of those "hidden exiles" who are
   treated as foreign bodies in society.[97][76] Many persons with
   disabilities "feel that they exist without belonging and without
   participating". Much still prevents them from being fully enfranchised.
   Our concern should be not only to care for them but to ensure their
   "active participation in the civil and ecclesial community. That is a
   demanding and even tiring process, yet one that will gradually
   contribute to the formation of consciences capable of acknowledging
   each individual as a unique and unrepeatable person". I think, too, of
   "the elderly who, also due to their disability, are sometimes
   considered a burden". Yet each of them is able to offer "a unique
   contribution to the common good through their remarkable life stories".
   Let me repeat: we need to have "the courage to give a voice to those
   who are discriminated against due to their disability, because sadly,
   in some countries even today, people find it hard to acknowledge them
   as persons of equal dignity".[98][77]

   Inadequate understandings of universal love

   99. A love capable of transcending borders is the basis of what in
   every city and country can be called "social friendship". Genuine
   social friendship within a society makes true universal openness
   possible. This is a far cry from the false universalism of those who
   constantly travel abroad because they cannot tolerate or love their own
   people. Those who look down on their own people tend to create within
   society categories of first and second class, people of greater or
   lesser dignity, people enjoying greater or fewer rights. In this way,
   they deny that there is room for everybody.

   100. I am certainly not proposing an authoritarian and abstract
   universalism, devised or planned by a small group and presented as an
   ideal for the sake of levelling, dominating and plundering. One model
   of globalization in fact "consciously aims at a one-dimensional
   uniformity and seeks to eliminate all differences and traditions in a
   superficial quest for unity... If a certain kind of globalization
   claims to make everyone uniform, to level everyone out, that
   globalization destroys the rich gifts and uniqueness of each person and
   each people".[99][78] This false universalism ends up depriving the
   world of its various colours, its beauty and, ultimately, its humanity.
   For "the future is not monochrome; if we are courageous, we can
   contemplate it in all the variety and diversity of what each individual
   person has to offer. How much our human family needs to learn to live
   together in harmony and peace, without all of us having to be the
   same!"[100][79]

   BEYOND A WORLD OF "ASSOCIATES"

   101. Let us now return to the parable of the Good Samaritan, for it
   still has much to say to us. An injured man lay on the roadside. The
   people walking by him did not heed their interior summons to act as
   neighbours; they were concerned with their duties, their social status,
   their professional position within society. They considered themselves
   important for the society of the time, and were anxious to play their
   proper part. The man on the roadside, bruised and abandoned, was a
   distraction, an interruption from all that; in any event, he was hardly
   important. He was a "nobody", undistinguished, irrelevant to their
   plans for the future. The Good Samaritan transcended these narrow
   classifications. He himself did not fit into any of those categories;
   he was simply a foreigner without a place in society. Free of every
   label and position, he was able to interrupt his journey, change his
   plans, and unexpectedly come to the aid of an injured person who needed
   his help.

   102. What would be the reaction to that same story nowadays, in a world
   that constantly witnesses the emergence and growth of social groups
   clinging to an identity that separates them from others? How would it
   affect those who organize themselves in a way that prevents any foreign
   presence that might threaten their identity and their closed and
   self-referential structures? There, even the possibility of acting as a
   neighbour is excluded; one is a neighbour only to those who serve their
   purpose. The word "neighbour" loses all meaning; there can only be
   "associates", partners in the pursuit of particular interests.[101][80]

   Liberty, equality and fraternity

   103. Fraternity is born not only of a climate of respect for individual
   liberties, or even of a certain administratively guaranteed equality.
   Fraternity necessarily calls for something greater, which in turn
   enhances freedom and equality. What happens when fraternity is not
   consciously cultivated, when there is a lack of political will to
   promote it through education in fraternity, through dialogue and
   through the recognition of the values of reciprocity and mutual
   enrichment? Liberty becomes nothing more than a condition for living as
   we will, completely free to choose to whom or what we will belong, or
   simply to possess or exploit. This shallow understanding has little to
   do with the richness of a liberty directed above all to love.

   104. Nor is equality achieved by an abstract proclamation that "all men
   and women are equal". Instead, it is the result of the conscious and
   careful cultivation of fraternity. Those capable only of being
   "associates" create closed worlds. Within that framework, what place is
   there for those who are not part of one's group of associates, yet long
   for a better life for themselves and their families?

   105. Individualism does not make us more free, more equal, more
   fraternal. The mere sum of individual interests is not capable of
   generating a better world for the whole human family. Nor can it save
   us from the many ills that are now increasingly globalized. Radical
   individualism is a virus that is extremely difficult to eliminate, for
   it is clever. It makes us believe that everything consists in giving
   free rein to our own ambitions, as if by pursuing ever greater
   ambitions and creating safety nets we would somehow be serving the
   common good.

   A UNIVERSAL LOVE THAT PROMOTES PERSONS

   106. Social friendship and universal fraternity necessarily call for an
   acknowledgement of the worth of every human person, always and
   everywhere. If each individual is of such great worth, it must be
   stated clearly and firmly that "the mere fact that some people are born
   in places with fewer resources or less development does not justify the
   fact that they are living with less dignity".[102][81] This is a basic
   principle of social life that tends to be ignored in a variety of ways
   by those who sense that it does not fit into their worldview or serve
   their purposes.

   107. Every human being has the right to live with dignity and to
   develop integrally; this fundamental right cannot be denied by any
   country. People have this right even if they are unproductive, or were
   born with or developed limitations. This does not detract from their
   great dignity as human persons, a dignity based not on circumstances
   but on the intrinsic worth of their being. Unless this basic principle
   is upheld, there will be no future either for fraternity or for the
   survival of humanity.

   108. Some societies accept this principle in part. They agree that
   opportunities should be available to everyone, but then go on to say
   that everything depends on the individual. From this skewed
   perspective, it would be pointless "to favour an investment in efforts
   to help the slow, the weak or the less talented to find opportunities
   in life".[103][82] Investments in assistance to the vulnerable could
   prove unprofitable; they might make things less efficient. No. What we
   need in fact are states and civil institutions that are present and
   active, that look beyond the free and efficient working of certain
   economic, political or ideological systems, and are primarily concerned
   with individuals and the common good.

   109. Some people are born into economically stable families, receive a
   fine education, grow up well nourished, or naturally possess great
   talent. They will certainly not need a proactive state; they need only
   claim their freedom. Yet the same rule clearly does not apply to a
   disabled person, to someone born in dire poverty, to those lacking a
   good education and with little access to adequate health care. If a
   society is governed primarily by the criteria of market freedom and
   efficiency, there is no place for such persons, and fraternity will
   remain just another vague ideal.

   110. Indeed, "to claim economic freedom while real conditions bar many
   people from actual access to it, and while possibilities for employment
   continue to shrink, is to practise doublespeak".[104][83] Words like
   freedom, democracy or fraternity prove meaningless, for the fact is
   that "only when our economic and social system no longer produces even
   a single victim, a single person cast aside, will we be able to
   celebrate the feast of universal fraternity".[105][84] A truly human
   and fraternal society will be capable of ensuring in an efficient and
   stable way that each of its members is accompanied at every stage of
   life. Not only by providing for their basic needs, but by enabling them
   to give the best of themselves, even though their performance may be
   less than optimum, their pace slow or their efficiency limited.

   111. The human person, with his or her inalienable rights, is by nature
   open to relationship. Implanted deep within us is the call to transcend
   ourselves through an encounter with others. For this reason, "care must
   be taken not to fall into certain errors which can arise from a
   misunderstanding of the concept of human rights and from its misuse.
   Today there is a tendency to claim ever broader individual - I am
   tempted to say individualistic - rights. Underlying this is a
   conception of the human person as detached from all social and
   anthropological contexts, as if the person were a "monad" (monás),
   increasingly unconcerned with others... Unless the rights of each
   individual are harmoniously ordered to the greater good, those rights
   will end up being considered limitless and consequently will become a
   source of conflicts and violence".[106][85]

   PROMOTING THE MORAL GOOD

   112. Nor can we fail to mention that seeking and pursuing the good of
   others and of the entire human family also implies helping individuals
   and societies to mature in the moral values that foster integral human
   development. The New Testament describes one fruit of the Holy Spirit
   (cf. Gal 5:22) as agathosyne; the Greek word expresses attachment to
   the good, pursuit of the good. Even more, it suggests a striving for
   excellence and what is best for others, their growth in maturity and
   health, the cultivation of values and not simply material wellbeing. A
   similar expression exists in Latin: benevolentia. This is an attitude
   that "wills the good" of others; it bespeaks a yearning for goodness,
   an inclination towards all that is fine and excellent, a desire to fill
   the lives of others with what is beautiful, sublime and edifying.

   113. Here, regrettably, I feel bound to reiterate that "we have had
   enough of immorality and the mockery of ethics, goodness, faith and
   honesty. It is time to acknowledge that light-hearted superficiality
   has done us no good. Once the foundations of social life are corroded,
   what ensues are battles over conflicting interests".[107][86] Let us
   return to promoting the good, for ourselves and for the whole human
   family, and thus advance together towards an authentic and integral
   growth. Every society needs to ensure that values are passed on;
   otherwise, what is handed down are selfishness, violence, corruption in
   its various forms, indifference and, ultimately, a life closed to
   transcendence and entrenched in individual interests.

   The value of solidarity

   114. I would like especially to mention solidarity, which, "as a moral
   virtue and social attitude born of personal conversion, calls for
   commitment on the part of those responsible for education and
   formation. I think first of families, called to a primary and vital
   mission of education. Families are the first place where the values of
   love and fraternity, togetherness and sharing, concern and care for
   others are lived out and handed on. They are also the privileged milieu
   for transmitting the faith, beginning with those first simple gestures
   of devotion which mothers teach their children. Teachers, who have the
   challenging task of training children and youth in schools or other
   settings, should be conscious that their responsibility extends also to
   the moral, spiritual and social aspects of life. The values of freedom,
   mutual respect and solidarity can be handed on from a tender age...
   Communicators also have a responsibility for education and formation,
   especially nowadays, when the means of information and communication
   are so widespread".[108][87]

   115. At a time when everything seems to disintegrate and lose
   consistency, it is good for us to appeal to the "solidity"[109][88]
   born of the consciousness that we are responsible for the fragility of
   others as we strive to build a common future. Solidarity finds concrete
   expression in service, which can take a variety of forms in an effort
   to care for others. And service in great part means "caring for
   vulnerability, for the vulnerable members of our families, our society,
   our people". In offering such service, individuals learn to "set aside
   their own wishes and desires, their pursuit of power, before the
   concrete gaze of those who are most vulnerable... Service always looks
   to their faces, touches their flesh, senses their closeness and even,
   in some cases, `suffers' that closeness and tries to help them. Service
   is never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve
   people".[110][89]

   116. The needy generally "practise the special solidarity that exists
   among those who are poor and suffering, and which our civilization
   seems to have forgotten or would prefer in fact to forget. Solidarity
   is a word that is not always well received; in certain situations, it
   has become a dirty word, a word that dare not be said. Solidarity means
   much more than engaging in sporadic acts of generosity. It means
   thinking and acting in terms of community. It means that the lives of
   all are prior to the appropriation of goods by a few. It also means
   combatting the structural causes of poverty, inequality, the lack of
   work, land and housing, the denial of social and labour rights. It
   means confronting the destructive effects of the empire of money...
   Solidarity, understood in its most profound meaning, is a way of making
   history, and this is what popular movements are doing".[111][90]

   117. When we speak of the need to care for our common home, our planet,
   we appeal to that spark of universal consciousness and mutual concern
   that may still be present in people's hearts. Those who enjoy a surplus
   of water yet choose to conserve it for the sake of the greater human
   family have attained a moral stature that allows them to look beyond
   themselves and the group to which they belong. How marvellously human!
   The same attitude is demanded if we are to recognize the rights of all
   people, even those born beyond our own borders.

   RE-ENVISAGING THE SOCIAL ROLE OF PROPERTY

   118. The world exists for everyone, because all of us were born with
   the same dignity. Differences of colour, religion, talent, place of
   birth or residence, and so many others, cannot be used to justify the
   privileges of some over the rights of all. As a community, we have an
   obligation to ensure that every person lives with dignity and has
   sufficient opportunities for his or her integral development.

   119. In the first Christian centuries, a number of thinkers developed a
   universal vision in their reflections on the common destination of
   created goods.[112][91] This led them to realize that if one person
   lacks what is necessary to live with dignity, it is because another
   person is detaining it. Saint John Chrysostom summarizes it in this
   way: "Not to share our wealth with the poor is to rob them and take
   away their livelihood. The riches we possess are not our own, but
   theirs as well".[113][92] In the words of Saint Gregory the Great,
   "When we provide the needy with their basic needs, we are giving them
   what belongs to them, not to us".[114][93]

   120. Once more, I would like to echo a statement of Saint John Paul II
   whose forcefulness has perhaps been insufficiently recognized: "God
   gave the earth to the whole human race for the sustenance of all its
   members, without excluding or favouring anyone".[115][94] For my part,
   I would observe that "the Christian tradition has never recognized the
   right to private property as absolute or inviolable, and has stressed
   the social purpose of all forms of private property".[116][95] The
   principle of the common use of created goods is the "first principle of
   the whole ethical and social order";[117][96] it is a natural and
   inherent right that takes priority over others.[118][97] All other
   rights having to do with the goods necessary for the integral
   fulfilment of persons, including that of private property or any other
   type of property, should - in the words of Saint Paul VI - "in no way
   hinder [this right], but should actively facilitate its
   implementation".[119][98] The right to private property can only be
   considered a secondary natural right, derived from the principle of the
   universal destination of created goods. This has concrete consequences
   that ought to be reflected in the workings of society. Yet it often
   happens that secondary rights displace primary and overriding rights,
   in practice making them irrelevant.

   Rights without borders

   121. No one, then, can remain excluded because of his or her place of
   birth, much less because of privileges enjoyed by others who were born
   in lands of greater opportunity. The limits and borders of individual
   states cannot stand in the way of this. As it is unacceptable that some
   have fewer rights by virtue of being women, it is likewise unacceptable
   that the mere place of one's birth or residence should result in his or
   her possessing fewer opportunities for a developed and dignified life.

   122. Development must not aim at the amassing of wealth by a few, but
   must ensure "human rights - personal and social, economic and
   political, including the rights of nations and of peoples".[120][99]
   The right of some to free enterprise or market freedom cannot supersede
   the rights of peoples and the dignity of the poor, or, for that matter,
   respect for the natural environment, for "if we make something our own,
   it is only to administer it for the good of all".[121][100]

   123. Business activity is essentially "a noble vocation, directed to
   producing wealth and improving our world".[122][101] God encourages us
   to develop the talents he gave us, and he has made our universe one of
   immense potential. In God's plan, each individual is called to promote
   his or her own development,[123][102] and this includes finding the
   best economic and technological means of multiplying goods and
   increasing wealth. Business abilities, which are a gift from God,
   should always be clearly directed to the development of others and to
   eliminating poverty, especially through the creation of diversified
   work opportunities. The right to private property is always accompanied
   by the primary and prior principle of the subordination of all private
   property to the universal destination of the earth's goods, and thus
   the right of all to their use.[124][103]

   The rights of peoples

   124. Nowadays, a firm belief in the common destination of the earth's
   goods requires that this principle also be applied to nations, their
   territories and their resources. Seen from the standpoint not only of
   the legitimacy of private property and the rights of its citizens, but
   also of the first principle of the common destination of goods, we can
   then say that each country also belongs to the foreigner, inasmuch as a
   territory's goods must not be denied to a needy person coming from
   elsewhere. As the Bishops of the United States have taught, there are
   fundamental rights that "precede any society because they flow from the
   dignity granted to each person as created by God".[125][104]

   125. This presupposes a different way of understanding relations and
   exchanges between countries. If every human being possesses an
   inalienable dignity, if all people are my brothers and sisters, and if
   the world truly belongs to everyone, then it matters little whether my
   neighbour was born in my country or elsewhere. My own country also
   shares responsibility for his or her development, although it can
   fulfil that responsibility in a variety of ways. It can offer a
   generous welcome to those in urgent need, or work to improve living
   conditions in their native lands by refusing to exploit those countries
   or to drain them of natural resources, backing corrupt systems that
   hinder the dignified development of their peoples. What applies to
   nations is true also for different regions within each country, since
   there too great inequalities often exist. At times, the inability to
   recognize equal human dignity leads the more developed regions in some
   countries to think that they can jettison the "dead weight" of poorer
   regions and so increase their level of consumption.

   126. We are really speaking about a new network of international
   relations, since there is no way to resolve the serious problems of our
   world if we continue to think only in terms of mutual assistance
   between individuals or small groups. Nor should we forget that
   "inequity affects not only individuals but entire countries; it compels
   us to consider an ethics of international relations".[126][105] Indeed,
   justice requires recognizing and respecting not only the rights of
   individuals, but also social rights and the rights of
   peoples.[127][106] This means finding a way to ensure "the fundamental
   right of peoples to subsistence and progress",[128][107] a right which
   is at times severely restricted by the pressure created by foreign
   debt. In many instances, debt repayment not only fails to promote
   development but gravely limits and conditions it. While respecting the
   principle that all legitimately acquired debt must be repaid, the way
   in which many poor countries fulfil this obligation should not end up
   compromising their very existence and growth.

   127. Certainly, all this calls for an alternative way of thinking.
   Without an attempt to enter into that way of thinking, what I am saying
   here will sound wildly unrealistic. On the other hand, if we accept the
   great principle that there are rights born of our inalienable human
   dignity, we can rise to the challenge of envisaging a new humanity. We
   can aspire to a world that provides land, housing and work for all.
   This is the true path of peace, not the senseless and myopic strategy
   of sowing fear and mistrust in the face of outside threats. For a real
   and lasting peace will only be possible "on the basis of a global ethic
   of solidarity and cooperation in the service of a future shaped by
   interdependence and shared responsibility in the whole human
   family".[129][108]

                                CHAPTER FOUR

                       A HEART OPEN TO THE WHOLE WORLD

   128. If the conviction that all human beings are brothers and sisters
   is not to remain an abstract idea but to find concrete embodiment, then
   numerous related issues emerge, forcing us to see things in a new light
   and to develop new responses.

   BORDERS AND THEIR LIMITS

   129. Complex challenges arise when our neighbour happens to be an
   immigrant.[130][109] Ideally, unnecessary migration ought to be
   avoided; this entails creating in countries of origin the conditions
   needed for a dignified life and integral development. Yet until
   substantial progress is made in achieving this goal, we are obliged to
   respect the right of all individuals to find a place that meets their
   basic needs and those of their families, and where they can find
   personal fulfilment. Our response to the arrival of migrating persons
   can be summarized by four words: welcome, protect, promote and
   integrate. For "it is not a case of implementing welfare programmes
   from the top down, but rather of undertaking a journey together,
   through these four actions, in order to build cities and countries
   that, while preserving their respective cultural and religious
   identity, are open to differences and know how to promote them in the
   spirit of human fraternity".[131][110]

   130. This implies taking certain indispensable steps, especially in
   response to those who are fleeing grave humanitarian crises. As
   examples, we may cite: increasing and simplifying the granting of
   visas; adopting programmes of individual and community sponsorship;
   opening humanitarian corridors for the most vulnerable refugees;
   providing suitable and dignified housing; guaranteeing personal
   security and access to basic services; ensuring adequate consular
   assistance and the right to retain personal identity documents;
   equitable access to the justice system; the possibility of opening bank
   accounts and the guarantee of the minimum needed to survive; freedom of
   movement and the possibility of employment; protecting minors and
   ensuring their regular access to education; providing for programmes of
   temporary guardianship or shelter; guaranteeing religious freedom;
   promoting integration into society; supporting the reuniting of
   families; and preparing local communities for the process of
   integration.[132][111]

   131. For those who are not recent arrivals and already participate in
   the fabric of society, it is important to apply the concept of
   "citizenship", which "is based on the equality of rights and duties,
   under which all enjoy justice. It is therefore crucial to establish in
   our societies the concept of full citizenship and to reject the
   discriminatory use of the term minorities, which engenders feelings of
   isolation and inferiority. Its misuse paves the way for hostility and
   discord; it undoes any successes and takes away the religious and civil
   rights of some citizens who are thus discriminated against".[133][112]

   132. Even when they take such essential steps, states are not able, on
   their own, to implement adequate solutions, "since the consequences of
   the decisions made by each inevitably have repercussions on the entire
   international community". As a result, "our response can only be the
   fruit of a common effort"[134][113] to develop a form of global
   governance with regard to movements of migration. Thus, there is "a
   need for mid-term and long-term planning which is not limited to
   emergency responses. Such planning should include effective assistance
   for integrating migrants in their receiving countries, while also
   promoting the development of their countries of origin through policies
   inspired by solidarity, yet not linking assistance to ideological
   strategies and practices alien or contrary to the cultures of the
   peoples being assisted".[135][114]

   RECIPROCAL GIFTS

   133. The arrival of those who are different, coming from other ways of
   life and cultures, can be a gift, for "the stories of migrants are
   always stories of an encounter between individuals and between
   cultures. For the communities and societies to which they come,
   migrants bring an opportunity for enrichment and the integral human
   development of all".[136][115] For this reason, "I especially urge
   young people not to play into the hands of those who would set them
   against other young people, newly arrived in their countries, and who
   would encourage them to view the latter as a threat, and not possessed
   of the same inalienable dignity as every other human being".[137][116]

   134. Indeed, when we open our hearts to those who are different, this
   enables them, while continuing to be themselves, to develop in new
   ways. The different cultures that have flourished over the centuries
   need to be preserved, lest our world be impoverished. At the same time,
   those cultures should be encouraged to be open to new experiences
   through their encounter with other realities, for the risk of
   succumbing to cultural sclerosis is always present. That is why "we
   need to communicate with each other, to discover the gifts of each
   person, to promote that which unites us, and to regard our differences
   as an opportunity to grow in mutual respect. Patience and trust are
   called for in such dialogue, permitting individuals, families and
   communities to hand on the values of their own culture and welcome the
   good that comes from others' experiences".[138][117]

   135. Here I would mention some examples that I have used in the past.
   Latino culture is "a ferment of values and possibilities that can
   greatly enrich the United States", for "intense immigration always ends
   up influencing and transforming the culture of a place... In Argentina,
   intense immigration from Italy has left a mark on the culture of the
   society, and the presence of some 200,000 Jews has a great effect on
   the cultural `style' of Buenos Aires. Immigrants, if they are helped to
   integrate, are a blessing, a source of enrichment and new gift that
   encourages a society to grow".[139][118]

   136. On an even broader scale, Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb and I have
   observed that "good relations between East and West are indisputably
   necessary for both. They must not be neglected, so that each can be
   enriched by the other's culture through fruitful exchange and dialogue.
   The West can discover in the East remedies for those spiritual and
   religious maladies that are caused by a prevailing materialism. And the
   East can find in the West many elements that can help free it from
   weakness, division, conflict and scientific, technical and cultural
   decline. It is important to pay attention to religious, cultural and
   historical differences that are a vital component in shaping the
   character, culture and civilization of the East. It is likewise
   important to reinforce the bond of fundamental human rights in order to
   help ensure a dignified life for all the men and women of East and
   West, avoiding the politics of double standards".[140][119]

   A fruitful exchange

   137. Mutual assistance between countries proves enriching for each. A
   country that moves forward while remaining solidly grounded in its
   original cultural substratum is a treasure for the whole of humanity.
   We need to develop the awareness that nowadays we are either all saved
   together or no one is saved. Poverty, decadence and suffering in one
   part of the earth are a silent breeding ground for problems that will
   end up affecting the entire planet. If we are troubled by the
   extinction of certain species, we should be all the more troubled that
   in some parts of our world individuals or peoples are prevented from
   developing their potential and beauty by poverty or other structural
   limitations. In the end, this will impoverish us all.

   138. Although this has always been true, never has it been more evident
   than in our own day, when the world is interconnected by globalization.
   We need to attain a global juridical, political and economic order
   "which can increase and give direction to international cooperation for
   the development of all peoples in solidarity".[141][120] Ultimately,
   this will benefit the entire world, since "development aid for poor
   countries" implies "creating wealth for all".[142][121] From the
   standpoint of integral development, this presupposes "giving poorer
   nations an effective voice in shared decision-making"[143][122] and the
   capacity to "facilitate access to the international market on the part
   of countries suffering from poverty and underdevelopment".[144][123]

   A gratuitousness open to others

   139. Even so, I do not wish to limit this presentation to a kind of
   utilitarian approach. There is always the factor of "gratuitousness":
   the ability to do some things simply because they are good in
   themselves, without concern for personal gain or recompense.
   Gratuitousness makes it possible for us to welcome the stranger, even
   though this brings us no immediate tangible benefit. Some countries,
   though, presume to accept only scientists or investors.

   140. Life without fraternal gratuitousness becomes a form of frenetic
   commerce, in which we are constantly weighing up what we give and what
   we get back in return. God, on the other hand, gives freely, to the
   point of helping even those who are unfaithful; he "makes his sun rise
   on the evil and on the good" (Mt 5:45). There is a reason why Jesus
   told us: "When you give alms, do not let your right hand know what your
   left hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret" (Mt 6:3-4). We
   received life freely; we paid nothing for it. Consequently, all of us
   are able to give without expecting anything in return, to do good to
   others without demanding that they treat us well in return. As Jesus
   told his disciples: "Without cost you have received, without cost you
   are to give" (Mt 10:8).

   141. The true worth of the different countries of our world is measured
   by their ability to think not simply as a country but also as part of
   the larger human family. This is seen especially in times of crisis.
   Narrow forms of nationalism are an extreme expression of an inability
   to grasp the meaning of this gratuitousness. They err in thinking that
   they can develop on their own, heedless of the ruin of others, that by
   closing their doors to others they will be better protected. Immigrants
   are seen as usurpers who have nothing to offer. This leads to the
   simplistic belief that the poor are dangerous and useless, while the
   powerful are generous benefactors. Only a social and political culture
   that readily and "gratuitously" welcomes others will have a future.

   LOCAL AND UNIVERSAL

   142. It should be kept in mind that "an innate tension exists between
   globalization and localization. We need to pay attention to the global
   so as to avoid narrowness and banality. Yet we also need to look to the
   local, which keeps our feet on the ground. Together, the two prevent us
   from falling into one of two extremes. In the first, people get caught
   up in an abstract, globalized universe... In the other, they turn into
   a museum of local folklore, a world apart, doomed to doing the same
   things over and over, incapable of being challenged by novelty or
   appreciating the beauty which God bestows beyond their
   borders".[145][124] We need to have a global outlook to save ourselves
   from petty provincialism. When our house stops being a home and starts
   to become an enclosure, a cell, then the global comes to our rescue,
   like a "final cause" that draws us towards our fulfilment. At the same
   time, though, the local has to be eagerly embraced, for it possesses
   something that the global does not: it is capable of being a leaven, of
   bringing enrichment, of sparking mechanisms of subsidiarity. Universal
   fraternity and social friendship are thus two inseparable and equally
   vital poles in every society. To separate them would be to disfigure
   each and to create a dangerous polarization.

   Local flavour

   143. The solution is not an openness that spurns its own richness. Just
   as there can be no dialogue with "others" without a sense of our own
   identity, so there can be no openness between peoples except on the
   basis of love for one's own land, one's own people, one's own cultural
   roots. I cannot truly encounter another unless I stand on firm
   foundations, for it is on the basis of these that I can accept the gift
   the other brings and in turn offer an authentic gift of my own. I can
   welcome others who are different, and value the unique contribution
   they have to make, only if I am firmly rooted in my own people and
   culture. Everyone loves and cares for his or her native land and
   village, just as they love and care for their home and are personally
   responsible for its upkeep. The common good likewise requires that we
   protect and love our native land. Otherwise, the consequences of a
   disaster in one country will end up affecting the entire planet. All
   this brings out the positive meaning of the right to property: I care
   for and cultivate something that I possess, in such a way that it can
   contribute to the good of all.

   144. It also gives rise to healthy and enriching exchanges. The
   experience of being raised in a particular place and sharing in a
   particular culture gives us insight into aspects of reality that others
   cannot so easily perceive. Universal does not necessarily mean bland,
   uniform and standardized, based on a single prevailing cultural model,
   for this will ultimately lead to the loss of a rich palette of shades
   and colours, and result in utter monotony. Such was the temptation
   referred to in the ancient account of the Tower of Babel. The attempt
   to build a tower that would reach to heaven was not an expression of
   unity between various peoples speaking to one another from their
   diversity. Instead, it was a misguided attempt, born of pride and
   ambition, to create a unity other than that willed by God in his
   providential plan for the nations (cf. Gen 11:1-9).

   145. There can be a false openness to the universal, born of the
   shallowness of those lacking insight into the genius of their native
   land or harbouring unresolved resentment towards their own people.
   Whatever the case, "we constantly have to broaden our horizons and see
   the greater good which will benefit us all. But this has to be done
   without evasion or uprooting. We need to sink our roots deeper into the
   fertile soil and history of our native place, which is a gift of God.
   We can work on a small scale, in our own neighbourhood, but with a
   larger perspective... The global need not stifle, nor the particular
   prove barren";[146][125] our model must be that of a polyhedron, in
   which the value of each individual is respected, where "the whole is
   greater than the part, but it is also greater than the sum of its
   parts".[147][126]

   A universal horizon

   146. There is a kind of "local" narcissism unrelated to a healthy love
   of one's own people and culture. It is born of a certain insecurity and
   fear of the other that leads to rejection and the desire to erect walls
   for self-defence. Yet it is impossible to be "local" in a healthy way
   without being sincerely open to the universal, without feeling
   challenged by what is happening in other places, without openness to
   enrichment by other cultures, and without solidarity and concern for
   the tragedies affecting other peoples. A "local narcissism" instead
   frets over a limited number of ideas, customs and forms of security;
   incapable of admiring the vast potential and beauty offered by the
   larger world, it lacks an authentic and generous spirit of solidarity.
   Life on the local level thus becomes less and less welcoming, people
   less open to complementarity. Its possibilities for development narrow;
   it grows weary and infirm. A healthy culture, on the other hand, is
   open and welcoming by its very nature; indeed, "a culture without
   universal values is not truly a culture".[148][127]

   147. Let us realize that as our minds and hearts narrow, the less
   capable we become of understanding the world around us. Without
   encountering and relating to differences, it is hard to achieve a clear
   and complete understanding even of ourselves and of our native land.
   Other cultures are not "enemies" from which we need to protect
   ourselves, but differing reflections of the inexhaustible richness of
   human life. Seeing ourselves from the perspective of another, of one
   who is different, we can better recognize our own unique features and
   those of our culture: its richness, its possibilities and its
   limitations. Our local experience needs to develop "in contrast to" and
   "in harmony with" the experiences of others living in diverse cultural
   contexts.[149][128]

   148. In fact, a healthy openness never threatens one's own identity. A
   living culture, enriched by elements from other places, does not import
   a mere carbon copy of those new elements, but integrates them in its
   own unique way. The result is a new synthesis that is ultimately
   beneficial to all, since the original culture itself ends up being
   nourished. That is why I have urged indigenous peoples to cherish their
   roots and their ancestral cultures. At the same time, though, I have
   wanted to stress that I have no intention of proposing "a completely
   enclosed, a-historic, static `indigenism' that would reject any kind of
   blending (mestizaje)". For "our own cultural identity is strengthened
   and enriched as a result of dialogue with those unlike ourselves. Nor
   is our authentic identity preserved by an impoverished
   isolation".[150][129] The world grows and is filled with new beauty,
   thanks to the successive syntheses produced between cultures that are
   open and free of any form of cultural imposition.

   149. For a healthy relationship between love of one's native land and a
   sound sense of belonging to our larger human family, it is helpful to
   keep in mind that global society is not the sum total of different
   countries, but rather the communion that exists among them. The mutual
   sense of belonging is prior to the emergence of individual groups. Each
   particular group becomes part of the fabric of universal communion and
   there discovers its own beauty. All individuals, whatever their origin,
   know that they are part of the greater human family, without which they
   will not be able to understand themselves fully.

   150. To see things in this way brings the joyful realization that no
   one people, culture or individual can achieve everything on its own: to
   attain fulfilment in life we need others. An awareness of our own
   limitations and incompleteness, far from being a threat, becomes the
   key to envisaging and pursuing a common project. For "man is a limited
   being who is himself limitless".[151][130]

   Starting with our own region

   151. Thanks to regional exchanges, by which poorer countries become
   open to the wider world, universality does not necessarily water down
   their distinct features. An appropriate and authentic openness to the
   world presupposes the capacity to be open to one's neighbour within a
   family of nations. Cultural, economic and political integration with
   neighbouring peoples should therefore be accompanied by a process of
   education that promotes the value of love for one's neighbour, the
   first indispensable step towards attaining a healthy universal
   integration.

   152. In some areas of our cities, there is still a lively sense of
   neighbourhood. Each person quite spontaneously perceives a duty to
   accompany and help his or her neighbour. In places where these
   community values are maintained, people experience a closeness marked
   by gratitude, solidarity and reciprocity. The neighbourhood gives them
   a sense of shared identity.[152][131] Would that neighbouring countries
   were able to encourage a similar neighbourly spirit between their
   peoples! Yet the spirit of individualism also affects relations between
   countries. The danger of thinking that we have to protect ourselves
   from one another, of viewing others as competitors or dangerous
   enemies, also affects relations between peoples in the same region.
   Perhaps we were trained in this kind of fear and mistrust.

   153. There are powerful countries and large businesses that profit from
   this isolation and prefer to negotiate with each country separately. On
   the other hand, small or poor countries can sign agreements with their
   regional neighbours that will allow them to negotiate as a bloc and
   thus avoid being cut off, isolated and dependent on the great powers.
   Today, no state can ensure the common good of its population if it
   remains isolated.

                                CHAPTER FIVE

                          A BETTER KIND OF POLITICS

   154. The development of a global community of fraternity based on the
   practice of social friendship on the part of peoples and nations calls
   for a better kind of politics, one truly at the service of the common
   good. Sadly, politics today often takes forms that hinder progress
   towards a different world.

   FORMS OF POPULISM AND LIBERALISM

   155. Lack of concern for the vulnerable can hide behind a populism that
   exploits them demagogically for its own purposes, or a liberalism that
   serves the economic interests of the powerful. In both cases, it
   becomes difficult to envisage an open world that makes room for
   everyone, including the most vulnerable, and shows respect for
   different cultures.

   Popular vs. populist

   156. In recent years, the words "populism" and "populist" have invaded
   the communications media and everyday conversation. As a result, they
   have lost whatever value they might have had, and have become another
   source of polarization in an already divided society. Efforts are made
   to classify entire peoples, groups, societies and governments as
   "populist" or not. Nowadays it has become impossible for someone to
   express a view on any subject without being categorized one way or the
   other, either to be unfairly discredited or to be praised to the skies.

   157. The attempt to see populism as a key for interpreting social
   reality is problematic in another way: it disregards the legitimate
   meaning of the word "people". Any effort to remove this concept from
   common parlance could lead to the elimination of the very notion of
   democracy as "government by the people". If we wish to maintain that
   society is more than a mere aggregate of individuals, the term "people"
   proves necessary. There are social phenomena that create majorities, as
   well as megatrends and communitarian aspirations. Men and women are
   capable of coming up with shared goals that transcend their differences
   and can thus engage in a common endeavour. Then too, it is extremely
   difficult to carry out a long-term project unless it becomes a
   collective aspiration. All these factors lie behind our use of the
   words "people" and "popular". Unless they are taken into account -
   together with a sound critique of demagoguery - a fundamental aspect of
   social reality would be overlooked.

   158. Here, there can be a misunderstanding. "`People' is not a logical
   category, nor is it a mystical category, if by that we mean that
   everything the people does is good, or that the people is an `angelic'
   reality. Rather, it is a mythic category... When you have to explain
   what you mean by people, you use logical categories for the sake of
   explanation, and necessarily so. Yet in that way you cannot explain
   what it means to belong to a people. The word `people' has a deeper
   meaning that cannot be set forth in purely logical terms. To be part of
   a people is to be part of a shared identity arising from social and
   cultural bonds. And that is not something automatic, but rather a slow,
   difficult process... of advancing towards a common project".[153][132]

   159. "Popular" leaders, those capable of interpreting the feelings and
   cultural dynamics of a people, and significant trends in society, do
   exist. The service they provide by their efforts to unite and lead can
   become the basis of an enduring vision of transformation and growth
   that would also include making room for others in the pursuit of the
   common good. But this can degenerate into an unhealthy "populism" when
   individuals are able to exploit politically a people's culture, under
   whatever ideological banner, for their own personal advantage or
   continuing grip on power. Or when, at other times, they seek popularity
   by appealing to the basest and most selfish inclinations of certain
   sectors of the population. This becomes all the more serious when,
   whether in cruder or more subtle forms, it leads to the usurpation of
   institutions and laws.

   160. Closed populist groups distort the word "people", since they are
   not talking about a true people. The concept of "people" is in fact
   open-ended. A living and dynamic people, a people with a future, is one
   constantly open to a new synthesis through its ability to welcome
   differences. In this way, it does not deny its proper identity, but is
   open to being mobilized, challenged, broadened and enriched by others,
   and thus to further growth and development.

   161. Another sign of the decline of popular leadership is concern for
   short-term advantage. One meets popular demands for the sake of gaining
   votes or support, but without advancing in an arduous and constant
   effort to generate the resources people need to develop and earn a
   living by their own efforts and creativity. In this regard, I have made
   it clear that "I have no intention of proposing an irresponsible
   populism".[154][133] Eliminating inequality requires an economic growth
   that can help to tap each region's potential and thus guarantee a
   sustainable equality.[155][134] At the same time, it follows that
   "welfare projects, which meet certain urgent needs, should be
   considered merely temporary responses".[156][135]

   162. The biggest issue is employment. The truly "popular" thing - since
   it promotes the good of the people - is to provide everyone with the
   opportunity to nurture the seeds that God has planted in each of us:
   our talents, our initiative and our innate resources. This is the
   finest help we can give to the poor, the best path to a life of
   dignity. Hence my insistence that, "helping the poor financially must
   always be a provisional solution in the face of pressing needs. The
   broader objective should always be to allow them a dignified life
   through work".[157][136] Since production systems may change, political
   systems must keep working to structure society in such a way that
   everyone has a chance to contribute his or her own talents and efforts.
   For "there is no poverty worse than that which takes away work and the
   dignity of work".[158][137] In a genuinely developed society, work is
   an essential dimension of social life, for it is not only a means of
   earning one's daily bread, but also of personal growth, the building of
   healthy relationships, self-expression and the exchange of gifts. Work
   gives us a sense of shared responsibility for the development of the
   world, and ultimately, for our life as a people.

   The benefits and limits of liberal approaches

   163. The concept of a "people", which naturally entails a positive view
   of community and cultural bonds, is usually rejected by individualistic
   liberal approaches, which view society as merely the sum of coexisting
   interests. One speaks of respect for freedom, but without roots in a
   shared narrative; in certain contexts, those who defend the rights of
   the most vulnerable members of society tend to be criticized as
   populists. The notion of a people is considered an abstract construct,
   something that does not really exist. But this is to create a needless
   dichotomy. Neither the notion of "people" nor that of "neighbour" can
   be considered purely abstract or romantic, in such a way that social
   organization, science and civic institutions can be rejected or treated
   with contempt.[159][138]

   164. Charity, on the other hand, unites both dimensions - the abstract
   and the institutional - since it calls for an effective process of
   historical change that embraces everything: institutions, law,
   technology, experience, professional expertise, scientific analysis,
   administrative procedures, and so forth. For that matter, "private life
   cannot exist unless it is protected by public order. A domestic hearth
   has no real warmth unless it is safeguarded by law, by a state of
   tranquillity founded on law, and enjoys a minimum of wellbeing ensured
   by the division of labour, commercial exchange, social justice and
   political citizenship".[160][139]

   165. True charity is capable of incorporating all these elements in its
   concern for others. In the case of personal encounters, including those
   involving a distant or forgotten brother or sister, it can do so by
   employing all the resources that the institutions of an organized, free
   and creative society are capable of generating. Even the Good
   Samaritan, for example, needed to have a nearby inn that could provide
   the help that he was personally unable to offer. Love of neighbour is
   concrete and squanders none of the resources needed to bring about
   historical change that can benefit the poor and disadvantaged. At
   times, however, leftist ideologies or social doctrines linked to
   individualistic ways of acting and ineffective procedures affect only a
   few, while the majority of those left behind remain dependent on the
   goodwill of others. This demonstrates the need for a greater spirit of
   fraternity, but also a more efficient worldwide organization to help
   resolve the problems plaguing the abandoned who are suffering and dying
   in poor countries. It also shows that there is no one solution, no
   single acceptable methodology, no economic recipe that can be applied
   indiscriminately to all. Even the most rigorous scientific studies can
   propose different courses of action.

   166. Everything, then, depends on our ability to see the need for a
   change of heart, attitudes and lifestyles. Otherwise, political
   propaganda, the media and the shapers of public opinion will continue
   to promote an individualistic and uncritical culture subservient to
   unregulated economic interests and societal institutions at the service
   of those who already enjoy too much power. My criticism of the
   technocratic paradigm involves more than simply thinking that if we
   control its excesses everything will be fine. The bigger risk does not
   come from specific objects, material realities or institutions, but
   from the way that they are used. It has to do with human weakness, the
   proclivity to selfishness that is part of what the Christian tradition
   refers to as "concupiscence": the human inclination to be concerned
   only with myself, my group, my own petty interests. Concupiscence is
   not a flaw limited to our own day. It has been present from the
   beginning of humanity, and has simply changed and taken on different
   forms down the ages, using whatever means each moment of history can
   provide. Concupiscence, however, can be overcome with the help of God.

   167. Education and upbringing, concern for others, a well-integrated
   view of life and spiritual growth: all these are essential for quality
   human relationships and for enabling society itself to react against
   injustices, aberrations and abuses of economic, technological,
   political and media power. Some liberal approaches ignore this factor
   of human weakness; they envisage a world that follows a determined
   order and is capable by itself of ensuring a bright future and
   providing solutions for every problem.

   168. The marketplace, by itself, cannot resolve every problem, however
   much we are asked to believe this dogma of neoliberal faith. Whatever
   the challenge, this impoverished and repetitive school of thought
   always offers the same recipes. Neoliberalism simply reproduces itself
   by resorting to the magic theories of "spillover" or "trickle" -
   without using the name - as the only solution to societal problems.
   There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged "spillover"
   does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of
   violence threatening the fabric of society. It is imperative to have a
   proactive economic policy directed at "promoting an economy that
   favours productive diversity and business creativity"[161][140] and
   makes it possible for jobs to be created and not cut. Financial
   speculation fundamentally aimed at quick profit continues to wreak
   havoc. Indeed, "without internal forms of solidarity and mutual trust,
   the market cannot completely fulfil its proper economic function. And
   today this trust has ceased to exist".[162][141] The story did not end
   the way it was meant to, and the dogmatic formulae of prevailing
   economic theory proved not to be infallible. The fragility of world
   systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not
   everything can be resolved by market freedom. It has also shown that,
   in addition to recovering a sound political life that is not subject to
   the dictates of finance, "we must put human dignity back at the centre
   and on that pillar build the alternative social structures we
   need".[163][142]

   169. In some closed and monochrome economic approaches, for example,
   there seems to be no place for popular movements that unite the
   unemployed, temporary and informal workers and many others who do not
   easily find a place in existing structures. Yet those movements manage
   various forms of popular economy and of community production. What is
   needed is a model of social, political and economic participation "that
   can include popular movements and invigorate local, national and
   international governing structures with that torrent of moral energy
   that springs from including the excluded in the building of a common
   destiny", while also ensuring that "these experiences of solidarity
   which grow up from below, from the subsoil of the planet - can come
   together, be more coordinated, keep on meeting one another".[164][143]
   This, however, must happen in a way that will not betray their
   distinctive way of acting as "sowers of change, promoters of a process
   involving millions of actions, great and small, creatively intertwined
   like words in a poem".[165][144] In that sense, such movements are
   "social poets" that, in their own way, work, propose, promote and
   liberate. They help make possible an integral human development that
   goes beyond "the idea of social policies being a policy for the poor,
   but never with the poor and never of the poor, much less part of a
   project that reunites peoples".[166][145] They may be troublesome, and
   certain "theorists" may find it hard to classify them, yet we must find
   the courage to acknowledge that, without them, "democracy atrophies,
   turns into a mere word, a formality; it loses its representative
   character and becomes disembodied, since it leaves out the people in
   their daily struggle for dignity, in the building of their
   future".[167][146]

   INTERNATIONAL POWER

   170. I would once more observe that "the financial crisis of 2007-08
   provided an opportunity to develop a new economy, more attentive to
   ethical principles, and new ways of regulating speculative financial
   practices and virtual wealth. But the response to the crisis did not
   include rethinking the outdated criteria which continue to rule the
   world".[168][147] Indeed, it appears that the actual strategies
   developed worldwide in the wake of the crisis fostered greater
   individualism, less integration and increased freedom for the truly
   powerful, who always find a way to escape unscathed.

   171. I would also insist that "to give to each his own - to cite the
   classic definition of justice - means that no human individual or group
   can consider itself absolute, entitled to bypass the dignity and the
   rights of other individuals or their social groupings. The effective
   distribution of power (especially political, economic, defence-related
   and technological power) among a plurality of subjects, and the
   creation of a juridical system for regulating claims and interests, are
   one concrete way of limiting power. Yet today's world presents us with
   many false rights and - at the same time - broad sectors which are
   vulnerable, victims of power badly exercised".[169][148]

   172. The twenty-first century "is witnessing a weakening of the power
   of nation states, chiefly because the economic and financial sectors,
   being transnational, tend to prevail over the political. Given this
   situation, it is essential to devise stronger and more efficiently
   organized international institutions, with functionaries who are
   appointed fairly by agreement among national governments, and empowered
   to impose sanctions".[170][149] When we talk about the possibility of
   some form of world authority regulated by law,[171][150] we need not
   necessarily think of a personal authority. Still, such an authority
   ought at least to promote more effective world organizations, equipped
   with the power to provide for the global common good, the elimination
   of hunger and poverty and the sure defence of fundamental human rights.

   173. In this regard, I would also note the need for a reform of "the
   United Nations Organization, and likewise of economic institutions and
   international finance, so that the concept of the family of nations can
   acquire real teeth".[172][151] Needless to say, this calls for clear
   legal limits to avoid power being co-opted only by a few countries and
   to prevent cultural impositions or a restriction of the basic freedoms
   of weaker nations on the basis of ideological differences. For "the
   international community is a juridical community founded on the
   sovereignty of each member state, without bonds of subordination that
   deny or limit its independence".[173][152] At the same time, "the work
   of the United Nations, according to the principles set forth in the
   Preamble and the first Articles of its founding Charter, can be seen as
   the development and promotion of the rule of law, based on the
   realization that justice is an essential condition for achieving the
   ideal of universal fraternity... There is a need to ensure the
   uncontested rule of law and tireless recourse to negotiation, mediation
   and arbitration, as proposed by the Charter of the United Nations,
   which constitutes truly a fundamental juridical norm".[174][153] There
   is need to prevent this Organization from being delegitimized, since
   its problems and shortcomings are capable of being jointly addressed
   and resolved.

   174. Courage and generosity are needed in order freely to establish
   shared goals and to ensure the worldwide observance of certain
   essential norms. For this to be truly useful, it is essential to uphold
   "the need to be faithful to agreements undertaken (pacta sunt
   servanda)",[175][154] and to avoid the "temptation to appeal to the law
   of force rather than to the force of law".[176][155] This means
   reinforcing the "normative instruments for the peaceful resolution of
   controversies... so as to strengthen their scope and binding
   force".[177][156] Among these normative instruments, preference should
   be given to multilateral agreements between states, because, more than
   bilateral agreements, they guarantee the promotion of a truly universal
   common good and the protection of weaker states.

   175. Providentially, many groups and organizations within civil society
   help to compensate for the shortcomings of the international community,
   its lack of coordination in complex situations, its lack of attention
   to fundamental human rights and to the critical needs of certain
   groups. Here we can see a concrete application of the principle of
   subsidiarity, which justifies the participation and activity of
   communities and organizations on lower levels as a means of integrating
   and complementing the activity of the state. These groups and
   organizations often carry out commendable efforts in the service of the
   common good and their members at times show true heroism, revealing
   something of the grandeur of which our humanity is still capable.

   SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHARITY

   176. For many people today, politics is a distasteful word, often due
   to the mistakes, corruption and inefficiency of some politicians. There
   are also attempts to discredit politics, to replace it with economics
   or to twist it to one ideology or another. Yet can our world function
   without politics? Can there be an effective process of growth towards
   universal fraternity and social peace without a sound political
   life?[178][157]

   The politics we need

   177. Here I would once more observe that "politics must not be subject
   to the economy, nor should the economy be subject to the dictates of an
   efficiency-driven paradigm of technocracy".[179][158] Although misuse
   of power, corruption, disregard for law and inefficiency must clearly
   be rejected, "economics without politics cannot be justified, since
   this would make it impossible to favour other ways of handling the
   various aspects of the present crisis".[180][159] Instead, "what is
   needed is a politics which is far-sighted and capable of a new,
   integral and interdisciplinary approach to handling the different
   aspects of the crisis".[181][160] In other words, a "healthy
   politics... capable of reforming and coordinating institutions,
   promoting best practices and overcoming undue pressure and bureaucratic
   inertia".[182][161] We cannot expect economics to do this, nor can we
   allow economics to take over the real power of the state.

   178. In the face of many petty forms of politics focused on immediate
   interests, I would repeat that "true statecraft is manifest when, in
   difficult times, we uphold high principles and think of the long-term
   common good. Political powers do not find it easy to assume this duty
   in the work of nation-building",[183][162] much less in forging a
   common project for the human family, now and in the future. Thinking of
   those who will come after us does not serve electoral purposes, yet it
   is what authentic justice demands. As the Bishops of Portugal have
   taught, the earth "is lent to each generation, to be handed on to the
   generation that follows".[184][163]

   179. Global society is suffering from grave structural deficiencies
   that cannot be resolved by piecemeal solutions or quick fixes. Much
   needs to change, through fundamental reform and major renewal. Only a
   healthy politics, involving the most diverse sectors and skills, is
   capable of overseeing this process. An economy that is an integral part
   of a political, social, cultural and popular programme directed to the
   common good could pave the way for "different possibilities which do
   not involve stifling human creativity and its ideals of progress, but
   rather directing that energy along new channels".[185][164]

   Political love

   180. Recognizing that all people are our brothers and sisters, and
   seeking forms of social friendship that include everyone, is not merely
   utopian. It demands a decisive commitment to devising effective means
   to this end. Any effort along these lines becomes a noble exercise of
   charity. For whereas individuals can help others in need, when they
   join together in initiating social processes of fraternity and justice
   for all, they enter the "field of charity at its most vast, namely
   political charity".[186][165] This entails working for a social and
   political order whose soul is social charity.[187][166] Once more, I
   appeal for a renewed appreciation of politics as "a lofty vocation and
   one of the highest forms of charity, inasmuch as it seeks the common
   good".[188][167]

   181. Every commitment inspired by the Church's social doctrine is
   "derived from charity, which according to the teaching of Jesus is the
   synthesis of the entire Law (cf. Mt 22:36-40)".[189][168] This means
   acknowledging that "love, overflowing with small gestures of mutual
   care, is also civic and political, and it makes itself felt in every
   action that seeks to build a better world".[190][169] For this reason,
   charity finds expression not only in close and intimate relationships
   but also in "macro-relationships: social, economic and
   political".[191][170]

   182. This political charity is born of a social awareness that
   transcends every individualistic mindset: "`Social charity makes us
   love the common good', it makes us effectively seek the good of all
   people, considered not only as individuals or private persons, but also
   in the social dimension that unites them".[192][171] Each of us is
   fully a person when we are part of a people; at the same time, there
   are no peoples without respect for the individuality of each person.
   "People" and "person" are correlative terms. Nonetheless, there are
   attempts nowadays to reduce persons to isolated individuals easily
   manipulated by powers pursuing spurious interests. Good politics will
   seek ways of building communities at every level of social life, in
   order to recalibrate and reorient globalization and thus avoid its
   disruptive effects.

   Effective love

   183. "Social love"[193][172] makes it possible to advance towards a
   civilization of love, to which all of us can feel called. Charity, with
   its impulse to universality, is capable of building a new
   world.[194][173] No mere sentiment, it is the best means of discovering
   effective paths of development for everyone. Social love is a "force
   capable of inspiring new ways of approaching the problems of today's
   world, of profoundly renewing structures, social organizations and
   legal systems from within".[195][174]

   184. Charity is at the heart of every healthy and open society, yet
   today "it is easily dismissed as irrelevant for interpreting and giving
   direction to moral responsibility".[196][175] Charity, when accompanied
   by a commitment to the truth, is much more than personal feeling, and
   consequently need not "fall prey to contingent subjective emotions and
   opinions".[197][176] Indeed its close relation to truth fosters its
   universality and preserves it from being "confined to a narrow field
   devoid of relationships".[198][177] Otherwise, it would be "excluded
   from the plans and processes of promoting human development of
   universal range, in dialogue between knowledge and praxis".[199][178]
   Without truth, emotion lacks relational and social content. Charity's
   openness to truth thus protects it from "a fideism that deprives it of
   its human and universal breadth".[200][179]

   185. Charity needs the light of the truth that we constantly seek.
   "That light is both the light of reason and the light of
   faith",[201][180] and does not admit any form of relativism. Yet it
   also respects the development of the sciences and their essential
   contribution to finding the surest and most practical means of
   achieving the desired results. For when the good of others is at stake,
   good intentions are not enough. Concrete efforts must be made to bring
   about whatever they and their nations need for the sake of their
   development.

   THE EXERCISE OF POLITICAL LOVE

   186. There is a kind of love that is "elicited": its acts proceed
   directly from the virtue of charity and are directed to individuals and
   peoples. There is also a "commanded" love, expressed in those acts of
   charity that spur people to create more sound institutions, more just
   regulations, more supportive structures.[202][181] It follows that "it
   is an equally indispensable act of love to strive to organize and
   structure society so that one's neighbour will not find himself in
   poverty".[203][182] It is an act of charity to assist someone
   suffering, but it is also an act of charity, even if we do not know
   that person, to work to change the social conditions that caused his or
   her suffering. If someone helps an elderly person cross a river, that
   is a fine act of charity. The politician, on the other hand, builds a
   bridge, and that too is an act of charity. While one person can help
   another by providing something to eat, the politician creates a job for
   that other person, and thus practices a lofty form of charity that
   ennobles his or her political activity.

   Sacrifices born of love

   187. This charity, which is the spiritual heart of politics, is always
   a preferential love shown to those in greatest need; it undergirds
   everything we do on their behalf.[204][183] Only a gaze transformed by
   charity can enable the dignity of others to be recognized and, as a
   consequence, the poor to be acknowledged and valued in their dignity,
   respected in their identity and culture, and thus truly integrated into
   society. That gaze is at the heart of the authentic spirit of politics.
   It sees paths open up that are different from those of a soulless
   pragmatism. It makes us realize that "the scandal of poverty cannot be
   addressed by promoting strategies of containment that only tranquilize
   the poor and render them tame and inoffensive. How sad it is when we
   find, behind allegedly altruistic works, the other being reduced to
   passivity".[205][184] What are needed are new pathways of
   self-expression and participation in society. Education serves these by
   making it possible for each human being to shape his or her own future.
   Here too we see the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, which
   is inseparable from the principle of solidarity.

   188. These considerations help us recognize the urgent need to combat
   all that threatens or violates fundamental human rights. Politicians
   are called to "tend to the needs of individuals and peoples. To tend
   those in need takes strength and tenderness, effort and generosity in
   the midst of a functionalistic and privatized mindset that inexorably
   leads to a `throwaway culture'... It involves taking responsibility for
   the present with its situations of utter marginalization and anguish,
   and being capable of bestowing dignity upon it".[206][185] It will
   likewise inspire intense efforts to ensure that "everything be done to
   protect the status and dignity of the human person".[207][186]
   Politicians are doers, builders with ambitious goals, possessed of a
   broad, realistic and pragmatic gaze that looks beyond their own
   borders. Their biggest concern should not be about a drop in the polls,
   but about finding effective solutions to "the phenomenon of social and
   economic exclusion, with its baneful consequences: human trafficking,
   the marketing of human organs and tissues, the sexual exploitation of
   boys and girls, slave labour, including prostitution, the drug and
   weapons trade, terrorism and international organized crime. Such is the
   magnitude of these situations, and their toll in innocent lives, that
   we must avoid every temptation to fall into a declarationist nominalism
   that would assuage our consciences. We need to ensure that our
   institutions are truly effective in the struggle against all these
   scourges".[208][187] This includes taking intelligent advantage of the
   immense resources offered by technological development.

   189. We are still far from a globalization of the most basic of human
   rights. That is why world politics needs to make the effective
   elimination of hunger one of its foremost and imperative goals. Indeed,
   "when financial speculation manipulates the price of food, treating it
   as just another commodity, millions of people suffer and die from
   hunger. At the same time, tons of food are thrown away. This
   constitutes a genuine scandal. Hunger is criminal; food is an
   inalienable right".[209][188] Often, as we carry on our semantic or
   ideological disputes, we allow our brothers and sisters to die of
   hunger and thirst, without shelter or access to health care. Alongside
   these basic needs that remain unmet, trafficking in persons represents
   another source of shame for humanity, one that international politics,
   moving beyond fine speeches and good intentions, must no longer
   tolerate. These things are essential; they can no longer be deferred.

   A love that integrates and unites

   190. Political charity is also expressed in a spirit of openness to
   everyone. Government leaders should be the first to make the sacrifices
   that foster encounter and to seek convergence on at least some issues.
   They should be ready to listen to other points of view and to make room
   for everyone. Through sacrifice and patience, they can help to create a
   beautiful polyhedral reality in which everyone has a place. Here,
   economic negotiations do not work. Something else is required: an
   exchange of gifts for the common good. It may seem naïve and utopian,
   yet we cannot renounce this lofty aim.

   191. At a time when various forms of fundamentalist intolerance are
   damaging relationships between individuals, groups and peoples, let us
   be committed to living and teaching the value of respect for others, a
   love capable of welcoming differences, and the priority of the dignity
   of every human being over his or her ideas, opinions, practices and
   even sins. Even as forms of fanaticism, closedmindedness and social and
   cultural fragmentation proliferate in present-day society, a good
   politician will take the first step and insist that different voices be
   heard. Disagreements may well give rise to conflicts, but uniformity
   proves stifling and leads to cultural decay. May we not be content with
   being enclosed in one fragment of reality.

   192. In this regard, Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb and I have called upon
   "the architects of international policy and world economy to work
   strenuously to spread the culture of tolerance and of living together
   in peace; to intervene at the earliest opportunity to stop the shedding
   of innocent blood".[210][189] When a specific policy sows hatred and
   fear towards other nations in the name of its own country's welfare,
   there is need to be concerned, to react in time and immediately to
   correct the course.

   FRUITFULNESS OVER RESULTS

   193. Apart from their tireless activity, politicians are also men and
   women. They are called to practice love in their daily interpersonal
   relationships. As persons, they need to consider that "the modern
   world, with its technical advances, tends increasingly to functionalize
   the satisfaction of human desires, now classified and subdivided among
   different services. Less and less will people be called by name, less
   and less will this unique being be treated as a person with his or her
   own feelings, sufferings, problems, joys and family. Their illnesses
   will be known only in order to cure them, their financial needs only to
   provide for them, their lack of a home only to give them lodging, their
   desires for recreation and entertainment only to satisfy them". Yet it
   must never be forgotten that "loving the most insignificant of human
   beings as a brother, as if there were no one else in the world but him,
   cannot be considered a waste of time".[211][190]

   194. Politics too must make room for a tender love of others. "What is
   tenderness? It is love that draws near and becomes real. A movement
   that starts from our heart and reaches the eyes, the ears and the
   hands... Tenderness is the path of choice for the strongest, most
   courageous men and women".[212][191] Amid the daily concerns of
   political life, "the smallest, the weakest, the poorest should touch
   our hearts: indeed, they have a `right' to appeal to our heart and
   soul. They are our brothers and sisters, and as such we must love and
   care for them".[213][192]

   195. All this can help us realize that what is important is not
   constantly achieving great results, since these are not always
   possible. In political activity, we should remember that, "appearances
   notwithstanding, every person is immensely holy and deserves our love.
   Consequently, if I can help at least one person to have a better life,
   that already justifies the offering of my life. It is a wonderful thing
   to be God's faithful people. We achieve fulfilment when we break down
   walls and our hearts are filled with faces and names!"[214][193] The
   great goals of our dreams and plans may only be achieved in part. Yet
   beyond this, those who love, and who no longer view politics merely as
   a quest for power, "may be sure that none of our acts of love will be
   lost, nor any of our acts of sincere concern for others. No single act
   of love for God will be lost, no generous effort is meaningless, no
   painful endurance is wasted. All of these encircle our world like a
   vital force".[215][194]

   196. For this reason, it is truly noble to place our hope in the hidden
   power of the seeds of goodness we sow, and thus to initiate processes
   whose fruits will be reaped by others. Good politics combines love with
   hope and with confidence in the reserves of goodness present in human
   hearts. Indeed, "authentic political life, built upon respect for law
   and frank dialogue between individuals, is constantly renewed whenever
   there is a realization that every woman and man, and every new
   generation, brings the promise of new relational, intellectual,
   cultural and spiritual energies".[216][195]

   197. Viewed in this way, politics is something more noble than
   posturing, marketing and media spin. These sow nothing but division,
   conflict and a bleak cynicism incapable of mobilizing people to pursue
   a common goal. At times, in thinking of the future, we do well to ask
   ourselves, "Why I am doing this?", "What is my real aim?" For as time
   goes on, reflecting on the past, the questions will not be: "How many
   people endorsed me?", "How many voted for me?", "How many had a
   positive image of me?" The real, and potentially painful, questions
   will be, "How much love did I put into my work?" "What did I do for the
   progress of our people?" "What mark did I leave on the life of
   society?" "What real bonds did I create?" "What positive forces did I
   unleash?" "How much social peace did I sow?" "What good did I achieve
   in the position that was entrusted to me?"

                                 CHAPTER SIX

                     DIALOGUE AND FRIENDSHIP IN SOCIETY

   198. Approaching, speaking, listening, looking at, coming to know and
   understand one another, and to find common ground: all these things are
   summed up in the one word "dialogue". If we want to encounter and help
   one another, we have to dialogue. There is no need for me to stress the
   benefits of dialogue. I have only to think of what our world would be
   like without the patient dialogue of the many generous persons who keep
   families and communities together. Unlike disagreement and conflict,
   persistent and courageous dialogue does not make headlines, but quietly
   helps the world to live much better than we imagine.

   SOCIAL DIALOGUE FOR A NEW CULTURE

   199. Some people attempt to flee from reality, taking refuge in their
   own little world; others react to it with destructive violence. Yet
   "between selfish indifference and violent protest there is always
   another possible option: that of dialogue. Dialogue between
   generations; dialogue among our people, for we are that people;
   readiness to give and receive, while remaining open to the truth. A
   country flourishes when constructive dialogue occurs between its many
   rich cultural components: popular culture, university culture, youth
   culture, artistic culture, technological culture, economic culture,
   family culture and media culture".[217][196]

   200. Dialogue is often confused with something quite different: the
   feverish exchange of opinions on social networks, frequently based on
   media information that is not always reliable. These exchanges are
   merely parallel monologues. They may attract some attention by their
   sharp and aggressive tone. But monologues engage no one, and their
   content is frequently self-serving and contradictory.

   201. Indeed, the media's noisy potpourri of facts and opinions is often
   an obstacle to dialogue, since it lets everyone cling stubbornly to his
   or her own ideas, interests and choices, with the excuse that everyone
   else is wrong. It becomes easier to discredit and insult opponents from
   the outset than to open a respectful dialogue aimed at achieving
   agreement on a deeper level. Worse, this kind of language, usually
   drawn from media coverage of political campaigns, has become so
   widespread as to be part of daily conversation. Discussion is often
   manipulated by powerful special interests that seek to tilt public
   opinion unfairly in their favour. This kind of manipulation can be
   exercised not only by governments, but also in economics, politics,
   communications, religion and in other spheres. Attempts can be made to
   justify or excuse it when it tends to serve one's own economic or
   ideological interests, but sooner or later it turns against those very
   interests.

   202. Lack of dialogue means that in these individual sectors people are
   concerned not for the common good, but for the benefits of power or, at
   best, for ways to impose their own ideas. Round tables thus become mere
   negotiating sessions, in which individuals attempt to seize every
   possible advantage, rather than cooperating in the pursuit of the
   common good. The heroes of the future will be those who can break with
   this unhealthy mindset and determine respectfully to promote
   truthfulness, aside from personal interest. God willing, such heroes
   are quietly emerging, even now, in the midst of our society.

   Building together

   203. Authentic social dialogue involves the ability to respect the
   other's point of view and to admit that it may include legitimate
   convictions and concerns. Based on their identity and experience,
   others have a contribution to make, and it is desirable that they
   should articulate their positions for the sake of a more fruitful
   public debate. When individuals or groups are consistent in their
   thinking, defend their values and convictions, and develop their
   arguments, this surely benefits society. Yet, this can only occur to
   the extent that there is genuine dialogue and openness to others.
   Indeed, "in a true spirit of dialogue, we grow in our ability to grasp
   the significance of what others say and do, even if we cannot accept it
   as our own conviction. In this way, it becomes possible to be frank and
   open about our beliefs, while continuing to discuss, to seek points of
   contact, and above all, to work and struggle together".[218][197]
   Public discussion, if it truly makes room for everyone and does not
   manipulate or conceal information, is a constant stimulus to a better
   grasp of the truth, or at least its more effective expression. It keeps
   different sectors from becoming complacent and self-centred in their
   outlook and their limited concerns. Let us not forget that "differences
   are creative; they create tension and in the resolution of tension lies
   humanity's progress".[219][198]

   204. There is a growing conviction that, together with specialized
   scientific advances, we are in need of greater interdisciplinary
   communication. Although reality is one, it can be approached from
   various angles and with different methodologies. There is a risk that a
   single scientific advance will be seen as the only possible lens for
   viewing a particular aspect of life, society and the world. Researchers
   who are expert in their own field, yet also familiar with the findings
   of other sciences and disciplines, are in a position to discern other
   aspects of the object of their study and thus to become open to a more
   comprehensive and integral knowledge of reality.

   205. In today's globalized world, "the media can help us to feel closer
   to one another, creating a sense of the unity of the human family which
   in turn can inspire solidarity and serious efforts to ensure a more
   dignified life for all... The media can help us greatly in this,
   especially nowadays, when the networks of human communication have made
   unprecedented advances. The internet, in particular, offers immense
   possibilities for encounter and solidarity. This is something truly
   good, a gift from God".[220][199] We need constantly to ensure that
   present-day forms of communication are in fact guiding us to generous
   encounter with others, to honest pursuit of the whole truth, to
   service, to closeness to the underprivileged and to the promotion of
   the common good. As the Bishops of Australia have pointed out, we
   cannot accept "a digital world designed to exploit our weaknesses and
   bring out the worst in people".[221][200]

   The BASIS of Consensus

   206. The solution is not relativism. Under the guise of tolerance,
   relativism ultimately leaves the interpretation of moral values to
   those in power, to be defined as they see fit. "In the absence of
   objective truths or sound principles other than the satisfaction of our
   own desires and immediate needs... we should not think that political
   efforts or the force of law will be sufficient... When the culture
   itself is corrupt, and objective truth and universally valid principles
   are no longer upheld, then laws can only be seen as arbitrary
   impositions or obstacles to be avoided".[222][201]

   207. Is it possible to be concerned for truth, to seek the truth that
   responds to life's deepest meaning? What is law without the conviction,
   born of age-old reflection and great wisdom, that each human being is
   sacred and inviolable? If society is to have a future, it must respect
   the truth of our human dignity and submit to that truth. Murder is not
   wrong simply because it is socially unacceptable and punished by law,
   but because of a deeper conviction. This is a non-negotiable truth
   attained by the use of reason and accepted in conscience. A society is
   noble and decent not least for its support of the pursuit of truth and
   its adherence to the most basic of truths.

   208. We need to learn how to unmask the various ways that the truth is
   manipulated, distorted and concealed in public and private discourse.
   What we call "truth" is not only the reporting of facts and events,
   such as we find in the daily papers. It is primarily the search for the
   solid foundations sustaining our decisions and our laws. This calls for
   acknowledging that the human mind is capable of transcending immediate
   concerns and grasping certain truths that are unchanging, as true now
   as in the past. As it peers into human nature, reason discovers
   universal values derived from that same nature.

   209. Otherwise, is it not conceivable that those fundamental human
   rights which we now consider unassailable will be denied by those in
   power, once they have gained the "consensus" of an apathetic or
   intimidated population? Nor would a mere consensus between different
   nations, itself equally open to manipulation, suffice to protect them.
   We have ample evidence of the great good of which we are capable, yet
   we also have to acknowledge our inherent destructiveness. Is not the
   indifference and the heartless individualism into which we have fallen
   also a result of our sloth in pursuing higher values, values that
   transcend our immediate needs? Relativism always brings the risk that
   some or other alleged truth will be imposed by the powerful or the
   clever. Yet, "when it is a matter of the moral norms prohibiting
   intrinsic evil, there are no privileges or exceptions for anyone. It
   makes no difference whether one is the master of the world or the
   `poorest of the poor' on the face of the earth. Before the demands of
   morality we are all absolutely equal".[223][202]

   210. What is now happening, and drawing us into a perverse and barren
   way of thinking, is the reduction of ethics and politics to physics.
   Good and evil no longer exist in themselves; there is only a calculus
   of benefits and burdens. As a result of the displacement of moral
   reasoning, the law is no longer seen as reflecting a fundamental notion
   of justice but as mirroring notions currently in vogue. Breakdown
   ensues: everything is "leveled down" by a superficial bartered
   consensus. In the end, the law of the strongest prevails.

   Consensus and truth

   211. In a pluralistic society, dialogue is the best way to realize what
   ought always to be affirmed and respected apart from any ephemeral
   consensus. Such dialogue needs to be enriched and illumined by clear
   thinking, rational arguments, a variety of perspectives and the
   contribution of different fields of knowledge and points of view. Nor
   can it exclude the conviction that it is possible to arrive at certain
   fundamental truths always to be upheld. Acknowledging the existence of
   certain enduring values, however demanding it may be to discern them,
   makes for a robust and solid social ethics. Once those fundamental
   values are acknowledged and adopted through dialogue and consensus, we
   realize that they rise above consensus; they transcend our concrete
   situations and remain non-negotiable. Our understanding of their
   meaning and scope can increase - and in that respect, consensus is a
   dynamic reality - but in themselves, they are held to be enduring by
   virtue of their inherent meaning.

   212. If something always serves the good functioning of society, is it
   not because, lying beyond it, there is an enduring truth accessible to
   the intellect? Inherent in the nature of human beings and society there
   exist certain basic structures to support our development and survival.
   Certain requirements thus ensue, and these can be discovered through
   dialogue, even though, strictly speaking, they are not created by
   consensus. The fact that certain rules are indispensable for the very
   life of society is a sign that they are good in and of themselves.
   There is no need, then, to oppose the interests of society, consensus
   and the reality of objective truth. These three realities can be
   harmonized whenever, through dialogue, people are unafraid to get to
   the heart of an issue.

   213. The dignity of others is to be respected in all circumstances, not
   because that dignity is something we have invented or imagined, but
   because human beings possess an intrinsic worth superior to that of
   material objects and contingent situations. This requires that they be
   treated differently. That every human being possesses an inalienable
   dignity is a truth that corresponds to human nature apart from all
   cultural change. For this reason, human beings have the same inviolable
   dignity in every age of history and no one can consider himself or
   herself authorized by particular situations to deny this conviction or
   to act against it. The intellect can investigate the reality of things
   through reflection, experience and dialogue, and come to recognize in
   that reality, which transcends it, the basis of certain universal moral
   demands.

   214. To agnostics, this foundation could prove sufficient to confer a
   solid and stable universal validity on basic and non-negotiable ethical
   principles that could serve to prevent further catastrophes. As
   believers, we are convinced that human nature, as the source of ethical
   principles, was created by God, and that ultimately it is he who gives
   those principles their solid foundation.[224][203] This does not result
   in an ethical rigidity nor does it lead to the imposition of any one
   moral system, since fundamental and universally valid moral principles
   can be embodied in different practical rules. Thus, room for dialogue
   will always exist.

   A NEW CULTURE

   215. "Life, for all its confrontations, is the art of
   encounter".[225][204] I have frequently called for the growth of a
   culture of encounter capable of transcending our differences and
   divisions. This means working to create a many-faceted polyhedron whose
   different sides form a variegated unity, in which "the whole is greater
   than the part".[226][205] The image of a polyhedron can represent a
   society where differences coexist, complementing, enriching and
   reciprocally illuminating one another, even amid disagreements and
   reservations. Each of us can learn something from others. No one is
   useless and no one is expendable. This also means finding ways to
   include those on the peripheries of life. For they have another way of
   looking at things; they see aspects of reality that are invisible to
   the centres of power where weighty decisions are made.

   Encounter that becomes culture

   216. The word "culture" points to something deeply embedded within a
   people, its most cherished convictions and its way of life. A people's
   "culture" is more than an abstract idea. It has to do with their
   desires, their interests and ultimately the way they live their lives.
   To speak of a "culture of encounter" means that we, as a people, should
   be passionate about meeting others, seeking points of contact, building
   bridges, planning a project that includes everyone. This becomes an
   aspiration and a style of life. The subject of this culture is the
   people, not simply one part of society that would pacify the rest with
   the help of professional and media resources.

   217. Social peace demands hard work, craftsmanship. It would be easier
   to keep freedoms and differences in check with cleverness and a few
   resources. But such a peace would be superficial and fragile, not the
   fruit of a culture of encounter that brings enduring stability.
   Integrating differences is a much more difficult and slow process, yet
   it is the guarantee of a genuine and lasting peace. That peace is not
   achieved by recourse only to those who are pure and untainted, since
   "even people who can be considered questionable on account of their
   errors have something to offer which must not be overlooked".[227][206]
   Nor does it come from ignoring social demands or quelling disturbances,
   since it is not "a consensus on paper or a transient peace for a
   contented minority".[228][207] What is important is to create processes
   of encounter, processes that build a people that can accept
   differences. Let us arm our children with the weapons of dialogue! Let
   us teach them to fight the good fight of the culture of encounter!

   The joy of acknowledging others

   218. All this calls for the ability to recognize other people's right
   to be themselves and to be different. This recognition, as it becomes a
   culture, makes possible the creation of a social covenant. Without it,
   subtle ways can be found to make others insignificant, irrelevant, of
   no value to society. While rejecting certain visible forms of violence,
   another more insidious kind of violence can take root: the violence of
   those who despise people who are different, especially when their
   demands in any way compromise their own particular interests.

   219. When one part of society exploits all that the world has to offer,
   acting as if the poor did not exist, there will eventually be
   consequences. Sooner or later, ignoring the existence and rights of
   others will erupt in some form of violence, often when least expected.
   Liberty, equality and fraternity can remain lofty ideals unless they
   apply to everyone. Encounter cannot take place only between the holders
   of economic, political or academic power. Genuine social encounter
   calls for a dialogue that engages the culture shared by the majority of
   the population. It often happens that good ideas are not accepted by
   the poorer sectors of society because they are presented in a cultural
   garb that is not their own and with which they cannot identify. A
   realistic and inclusive social covenant must also be a "cultural
   covenant", one that respects and acknowledges the different worldviews,
   cultures and lifestyles that coexist in society.

   220. Indigenous peoples, for example, are not opposed to progress, yet
   theirs is a different notion of progress, often more humanistic than
   the modern culture of developed peoples. Theirs is not a culture meant
   to benefit the powerful, those driven to create for themselves a kind
   of earthly paradise. Intolerance and lack of respect for indigenous
   popular cultures is a form of violence grounded in a cold and
   judgmental way of viewing them. No authentic, profound and enduring
   change is possible unless it starts from the different cultures,
   particularly those of the poor. A cultural covenant eschews a
   monolithic understanding of the identity of a particular place; it
   entails respect for diversity by offering opportunities for advancement
   and social integration to all.

   221. Such a covenant also demands the realization that some things may
   have to be renounced for the common good. No one can possess the whole
   truth or satisfy his or her every desire, since that pretension would
   lead to nullifying others by denying their rights. A false notion of
   tolerance has to give way to a dialogic realism on the part of men and
   women who remain faithful to their own principles while recognizing
   that others also have the right to do likewise. This is the genuine
   acknowledgment of the other that is made possible by love alone. We
   have to stand in the place of others, if we are to discover what is
   genuine, or at least understandable, in their motivations and concerns.

   RECOVERING KINDNESS

   222. Consumerist individualism has led to great injustice. Other
   persons come to be viewed simply as obstacles to our own serene
   existence; we end up treating them as annoyances and we become
   increasingly aggressive. This is even more the case in times of crisis,
   catastrophe and hardship, when we are tempted to think in terms of the
   old saying, "every man for himself". Yet even then, we can choose to
   cultivate kindness. Those who do so become stars shining in the midst
   of darkness.

   223. Saint Paul describes kindness as a fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal
   5:22). He uses the Greek word chrestótes, which describes an attitude
   that is gentle, pleasant and supportive, not rude or coarse.
   Individuals who possess this quality help make other people's lives
   more bearable, especially by sharing the weight of their problems,
   needs and fears. This way of treating others can take different forms:
   an act of kindness, a concern not to offend by word or deed, a
   readiness to alleviate their burdens. It involves "speaking words of
   comfort, strength, consolation and encouragement" and not "words that
   demean, sadden, anger or show scorn".[229][208]

   224. Kindness frees us from the cruelty that at times infects human
   relationships, from the anxiety that prevents us from thinking of
   others, from the frantic flurry of activity that forgets that others
   also have a right to be happy. Often nowadays we find neither the time
   nor the energy to stop and be kind to others, to say "excuse me",
   "pardon me", "thank you". Yet every now and then, miraculously, a kind
   person appears and is willing to set everything else aside in order to
   show interest, to give the gift of a smile, to speak a word of
   encouragement, to listen amid general indifference. If we make a daily
   effort to do exactly this, we can create a healthy social atmosphere in
   which misunderstandings can be overcome and conflict forestalled.
   Kindness ought to be cultivated; it is no superficial bourgeois virtue.
   Precisely because it entails esteem and respect for others, once
   kindness becomes a culture within society it transforms lifestyles,
   relationships and the ways ideas are discussed and compared. Kindness
   facilitates the quest for consensus; it opens new paths where hostility
   and conflict would burn all bridges.

                                CHAPTER SEVEN

                         PATHS OF RENEWED ENCOUNTER

   225. In many parts of the world, there is a need for paths of peace to
   heal open wounds. There is also a need for peacemakers, men and women
   prepared to work boldly and creatively to initiate processes of healing
   and renewed encounter.

   STARTING ANEW FROM THE TRUTH

   226. Renewed encounter does not mean returning to a time prior to
   conflicts. All of us change over time. Pain and conflict transform us.
   We no longer have use for empty diplomacy, dissimulation, double-speak,
   hidden agendas and good manners that mask reality. Those who were
   fierce enemies have to speak from the stark and clear truth. They have
   to learn how to cultivate a penitential memory, one that can accept the
   past in order not to cloud the future with their own regrets, problems
   and plans. Only by basing themselves on the historical truth of events
   will they be able to make a broad and persevering effort to understand
   one another and to strive for a new synthesis for the good of all.
   Every "peace process requires enduring commitment. It is a patient
   effort to seek truth and justice, to honour the memory of victims and
   to open the way, step by step, to a shared hope stronger than the
   desire for vengeance".[230][209] As the Bishops of the Congo have said
   with regard to one recurring conflict: "Peace agreements on paper will
   not be enough. We will have to go further, by respecting the demands of
   truth regarding the origins of this recurring crisis. The people have
   the right to know what happened".[231][210]

   227. "Truth, in fact, is an inseparable companion of justice and mercy.
   All three together are essential to building peace; each, moreover,
   prevents the other from being altered... Truth should not lead to
   revenge, but rather to reconciliation and forgiveness. Truth means
   telling families torn apart by pain what happened to their missing
   relatives. Truth means confessing what happened to minors recruited by
   cruel and violent people. Truth means recognizing the pain of women who
   are victims of violence and abuse... Every act of violence committed
   against a human being is a wound in humanity's flesh; every violent
   death diminishes us as people... Violence leads to more violence,
   hatred to more hatred, death to more death. We must break this cycle
   which seems inescapable".[232][211]

   THE ART AND ARCHITECTURE OF PEACE

   228. The path to peace does not mean making society blandly uniform,
   but getting people to work together, side-by-side, in pursuing goals
   that benefit everyone. A wide variety of practical proposals and
   diverse experiences can help achieve shared objectives and serve the
   common good. The problems that a society is experiencing need to be
   clearly identified, so that the existence of different ways of
   understanding and resolving them can be appreciated. The path to social
   unity always entails acknowledging the possibility that others have, at
   least in part, a legitimate point of view, something worthwhile to
   contribute, even if they were in error or acted badly. "We should never
   confine others to what they may have said or done, but value them for
   the promise that they embody",[233][212] a promise that always brings
   with it a spark of new hope.

   229. The Bishops of South Africa have pointed out that true
   reconciliation is achieved proactively, "by forming a new society, a
   society based on service to others, rather than the desire to dominate;
   a society based on sharing what one has with others, rather than the
   selfish scramble by each for as much wealth as possible; a society in
   which the value of being together as human beings is ultimately more
   important than any lesser group, whether it be family, nation, race or
   culture".[234][213] As the Bishops of South Korea have pointed out,
   true peace "can be achieved only when we strive for justice through
   dialogue, pursuing reconciliation and mutual development".[235][214]

   230. Working to overcome our divisions without losing our identity as
   individuals presumes that a basic sense of belonging is present in
   everyone. Indeed, "society benefits when each person and social group
   feels truly at home. In a family, parents, grandparents and children
   all feel at home; no one is excluded. If someone has a problem, even a
   serious one, even if he brought it upon himself, the rest of the family
   comes to his assistance; they support him. His problems are theirs...
   In families, everyone contributes to the common purpose; everyone works
   for the common good, not denying each person's individuality but
   encouraging and supporting it. They may quarrel, but there is something
   that does not change: the family bond. Family disputes are always
   resolved afterwards. The joys and sorrows of each of its members are
   felt by all. That is what it means to be a family! If only we could
   view our political opponents or neighbours in the same way that we view
   our children or our spouse, mother or father! How good would this be!
   Do we love our society or is it still something remote, something
   anonymous that does not involve us, something to which we are not
   committed?"[236][215]

   231. Negotiation often becomes necessary for shaping concrete paths to
   peace. Yet the processes of change that lead to lasting peace are
   crafted above all by peoples; each individual can act as an effective
   leaven by the way he or she lives each day. Great changes are not
   produced behind desks or in offices. This means that "everyone has a
   fundamental role to play in a single great creative project: to write a
   new page of history, a page full of hope, peace and
   reconciliation".[237][216] There is an "architecture" of peace, to
   which different institutions of society contribute, each according to
   its own area of expertise, but there is also an "art" of peace that
   involves us all. From the various peace processes that have taken place
   in different parts of the world, "we have learned that these ways of
   making peace, of placing reason above revenge, of the delicate harmony
   between politics and law, cannot ignore the involvement of ordinary
   people. Peace is not achieved by normative frameworks and institutional
   arrangements between well-meaning political or economic groups... It is
   always helpful to incorporate into our peace processes the experience
   of those sectors that have often been overlooked, so that communities
   themselves can influence the development of a collective
   memory".[238][217]

   232. There is no end to the building of a country's social peace;
   rather, it is "an open-ended endeavour, a never-ending task that
   demands the commitment of everyone and challenges us to work tirelessly
   to build the unity of the nation. Despite obstacles, differences and
   varying perspectives on the way to achieve peaceful coexistence, this
   task summons us to persevere in the struggle to promote a `culture of
   encounter'. This requires us to place at the centre of all political,
   social and economic activity the human person, who enjoys the highest
   dignity, and respect for the common good. May this determination help
   us flee from the temptation for revenge and the satisfaction of
   short-term partisan interests".[239][218] Violent public
   demonstrations, on one side or the other, do not help in finding
   solutions. Mainly because, as the Bishops of Colombia have rightly
   noted, the "origins and objectives of civil demonstrations are not
   always clear; certain forms of political manipulation are present and
   in some cases they have been exploited for partisan
   interests".[240][219]

   Beginning with the least

   233. Building social friendship does not only call for rapprochement
   between groups who took different sides at some troubled period of
   history, but also for a renewed encounter with the most impoverished
   and vulnerable sectors of society. For peace "is not merely absence of
   war but a tireless commitment - especially on the part of those of us
   charged with greater responsibility - to recognize, protect and
   concretely restore the dignity, so often overlooked or ignored, of our
   brothers and sisters, so that they can see themselves as the principal
   protagonists of the destiny of their nation".[241][220]

   234. Often, the more vulnerable members of society are the victims of
   unfair generalizations. If at times the poor and the dispossessed react
   with attitudes that appear antisocial, we should realize that in many
   cases those reactions are born of a history of scorn and social
   exclusion. The Latin American Bishops have observed that "only the
   closeness that makes us friends can enable us to appreciate deeply the
   values of the poor today, their legitimate desires, and their own
   manner of living the faith. The option for the poor should lead us to
   friendship with the poor".[242][221]

   235. Those who work for tranquil social coexistence should never forget
   that inequality and lack of integral human development make peace
   impossible. Indeed, "without equal opportunities, different forms of
   aggression and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and
   eventually explode. When a society - whether local, national or global
   - is willing to leave a part of itself on the fringes, no political
   programmes or resources spent on law enforcement or surveillance
   systems can indefinitely guarantee tranquility".[243][222] If we have
   to begin anew, it must always be from the least of our brothers and
   sisters.

   THE VALUE AND MEANING OF FORGIVENESS

   236. There are those who prefer not to talk of reconciliation, for they
   think that conflict, violence and breakdown are part of the normal
   functioning of a society. In any human group there are always going to
   be more or less subtle power struggles between different parties.
   Others think that promoting forgiveness means yielding ground and
   influence to others. For this reason, they feel it is better to keep
   things as they are, maintaining a balance of power between differing
   groups. Still others believe that reconciliation is a sign of weakness;
   incapable of truly serious dialogue, they choose to avoid problems by
   ignoring injustices. Unable to deal with problems, they opt for an
   apparent peace.

   Inevitable conflict

   237. Forgiveness and reconciliation are central themes in Christianity
   and, in various ways, in other religions. Yet there is a risk that an
   inadequate understanding and presentation of these profound convictions
   can lead to fatalism, apathy and injustice, or even intolerance and
   violence.

   238. Jesus never promoted violence or intolerance. He openly condemned
   the use of force to gain power over others: "You know that the rulers
   of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants
   over them. It will not be so among you" (Mt 20:25-26). Instead, the
   Gospel tells us to forgive "seventy times seven" (Mt 18:22) and offers
   the example of the unmerciful servant who was himself forgiven, yet
   unable to forgive others in turn (cf. Mt 18:23-35).

   239. Reading other texts of the New Testament, we can see how the early
   Christian communities, living in a pagan world marked by widespread
   corruption and aberrations, sought to show unfailing patience,
   tolerance and understanding. Some texts are very clear in this regard:
   we are told to admonish our opponents "with gentleness" (2 Tim 2:25)
   and encouraged "to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be
   gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone. For we ourselves were
   once foolish" (Tit 3:2-3). The Acts of the Apostles notes that the
   disciples, albeit persecuted by some of the authorities, "had favour
   with all the people" (2:47; cf. 4:21.33; 5:13).

   240. Yet when we reflect upon forgiveness, peace and social harmony, we
   also encounter the jarring saying of Christ: "Do not think that I have
   come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a
   sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter
   against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
   and a man's foes will be members of his own household" (Mt 10:34-36).
   These words need to be understood in the context of the chapter in
   which they are found, where it is clear that Jesus is speaking of
   fidelity to our decision to follow him; we are not to be ashamed of
   that decision, even if it entails hardships of various sorts, and even
   our loved ones refuse to accept it. Christ's words do not encourage us
   to seek conflict, but simply to endure it when it inevitably comes,
   lest deference to others, for the sake of supposed peace in our
   families or society, should detract from our own fidelity. Saint John
   Paul II observed that the Church "does not intend to condemn every
   possible form of social conflict. The Church is well aware that in the
   course of history conflicts of interest between different social groups
   inevitably arise, and that in the face of such conflicts Christians
   must often take a position, honestly and decisively".[244][223]

   Legitimate conflict and forgiveness

   241. Nor does this mean calling for forgiveness when it involves
   renouncing our own rights, confronting corrupt officials, criminals or
   those who would debase our dignity. We are called to love everyone,
   without exception; at the same time, loving an oppressor does not mean
   allowing him to keep oppressing us, or letting him think that what he
   does is acceptable. On the contrary, true love for an oppressor means
   seeking ways to make him cease his oppression; it means stripping him
   of a power that he does not know how to use, and that diminishes his
   own humanity and that of others. Forgiveness does not entail allowing
   oppressors to keep trampling on their own dignity and that of others,
   or letting criminals continue their wrongdoing. Those who suffer
   injustice have to defend strenuously their own rights and those of
   their family, precisely because they must preserve the dignity they
   have received as a loving gift from God. If a criminal has harmed me or
   a loved one, no one can forbid me from demanding justice and ensuring
   that this person - or anyone else - will not harm me, or others, again.
   This is entirely just; forgiveness does not forbid it but actually
   demands it.

   242. The important thing is not to fuel anger, which is unhealthy for
   our own soul and the soul of our people, or to become obsessed with
   taking revenge and destroying the other. No one achieves inner peace or
   returns to a normal life in that way. The truth is that "no family, no
   group of neighbours, no ethnic group, much less a nation, has a future
   if the force that unites them, brings them together and resolves their
   differences is vengeance and hatred. We cannot come to terms and unite
   for the sake of revenge, or treating others with the same violence with
   which they treated us, or plotting opportunities for retaliation under
   apparently legal auspices".[245][224] Nothing is gained this way and,
   in the end, everything is lost.

   243. To be sure, "it is no easy task to overcome the bitter legacy of
   injustices, hostility and mistrust left by conflict. It can only be
   done by overcoming evil with good (cf. Rom 12:21) and by cultivating
   those virtues which foster reconciliation, solidarity and
   peace".[246][225] In this way, "persons who nourish goodness in their
   heart find that such goodness leads to a peaceful conscience and to
   profound joy, even in the midst of difficulties and misunderstandings.
   Even when affronted, goodness is never weak but rather, shows its
   strength by refusing to take revenge".[247][226] Each of us should
   realize that "even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart against my
   brother or my sister, the open wound that was never cured, the offense
   that was never forgiven, the rancour that is only going to hurt me, are
   all instances of a struggle that I carry within me, a little flame deep
   in my heart that needs to be extinguished before it turns into a great
   blaze".[248][227]

   The best way to move on

   244. When conflicts are not resolved but kept hidden or buried in the
   past, silence can lead to complicity in grave misdeeds and sins.
   Authentic reconciliation does not flee from conflict, but is achieved
   in conflict, resolving it through dialogue and open, honest and patient
   negotiation. Conflict between different groups "if it abstains from
   enmities and mutual hatred, gradually changes into an honest discussion
   of differences founded on a desire for justice".[249][228]

   245. On numerous occasions, I have spoken of "a principle indispensable
   to the building of friendship in society: namely, that unity is greater
   than conflict... This is not to opt for a kind of syncretism, or for
   the absorption of one into the other, but rather for a resolution which
   takes place on a higher plane and preserves what is valid and useful on
   both sides".[250][229] All of us know that "when we, as individuals and
   communities, learn to look beyond ourselves and our particular
   interests, then understanding and mutual commitment bear fruit... in a
   setting where conflicts, tensions and even groups once considered
   inimical can attain a multifaceted unity that gives rise to new
   life".[251][230]

   MEMORY

   246. Of those who have endured much unjust and cruel suffering, a sort
   of "social forgiveness" must not be demanded. Reconciliation is a
   personal act, and no one can impose it upon an entire society, however
   great the need to foster it. In a strictly personal way, someone, by a
   free and generous decision, can choose not to demand punishment (cf. Mt
   5:44-46), even if it is quite legitimately demanded by society and its
   justice system. However, it is not possible to proclaim a "blanket
   reconciliation" in an effort to bind wounds by decree or to cover
   injustices in a cloak of oblivion. Who can claim the right to forgive
   in the name of others? It is moving to see forgiveness shown by those
   who are able to leave behind the harm they suffered, but it is also
   humanly understandable in the case of those who cannot. In any case,
   forgetting is never the answer.

   247. The Shoah must not be forgotten. It is "the enduring symbol of the
   depths to which human evil can sink when, spurred by false ideologies,
   it fails to recognize the fundamental dignity of each person, which
   merits unconditional respect regardless of ethnic origin or religious
   belief".[252][231] As I think of it, I cannot help but repeat this
   prayer: "Lord, remember us in your mercy. Grant us the grace to be
   ashamed of what we men have done, to be ashamed of this massive
   idolatry, of having despised and destroyed our own flesh which you
   formed from the earth, to which you gave life with your own breath of
   life. Never again, Lord, never again!".[253][232]

   248. Nor must we forget the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and
   Nagasaki. Once again, "I pay homage to all the victims, and I bow
   before the strength and dignity of those who, having survived those
   first moments, for years afterward bore in the flesh immense suffering,
   and in their spirit seeds of death that drained their vital energy...
   We cannot allow present and future generations to lose the memory of
   what happened. It is a memory that ensures and encourages the building
   of a more fair and fraternal future".[254][233] Neither must we forget
   the persecutions, the slave trade and the ethnic killings that continue
   in various countries, as well as the many other historical events that
   make us ashamed of our humanity. They need to be remembered, always and
   ever anew. We must never grow accustomed or inured to them.

   249. Nowadays, it is easy to be tempted to turn the page, to say that
   all these things happened long ago and we should look to the future.
   For God's sake, no! We can never move forward without remembering the
   past; we do not progress without an honest and unclouded memory. We
   need to "keep alive the flame of collective conscience, bearing witness
   to succeeding generations to the horror of what happened", because that
   witness "awakens and preserves the memory of the victims, so that the
   conscience of humanity may rise up in the face of every desire for
   dominance and destruction".[255][234] The victims themselves -
   individuals, social groups or nations - need to do so, lest they
   succumb to the mindset that leads to justifying reprisals and every
   kind of violence in the name of the great evil endured. For this
   reason, I think not only of the need to remember the atrocities, but
   also all those who, amid such great inhumanity and corruption, retained
   their dignity and, with gestures small or large, chose the part of
   solidarity, forgiveness and fraternity. To remember goodness is also a
   healthy thing.

   Forgiving but not forgetting

   250. Forgiving does not mean forgetting. Or better, in the face of a
   reality that can in no way be denied, relativized or concealed,
   forgiveness is still possible. In the face of an action that can never
   be tolerated, justified or excused, we can still forgive. In the face
   of something that cannot be forgotten for any reason, we can still
   forgive. Free and heartfelt forgiveness is something noble, a
   reflection of God's own infinite ability to forgive. If forgiveness is
   gratuitous, then it can be shown even to someone who resists repentance
   and is unable to beg pardon.

   251. Those who truly forgive do not forget. Instead, they choose not to
   yield to the same destructive force that caused them so much suffering.
   They break the vicious circle; they halt the advance of the forces of
   destruction. They choose not to spread in society the spirit of revenge
   that will sooner or later return to take its toll. Revenge never truly
   satisfies victims. Some crimes are so horrendous and cruel that the
   punishment of those who perpetrated them does not serve to repair the
   harm done. Even killing the criminal would not be enough, nor could any
   form of torture prove commensurate with the sufferings inflicted on the
   victim. Revenge resolves nothing.

   252. This does not mean impunity. Justice is properly sought solely out
   of love of justice itself, out of respect for the victims, as a means
   of preventing new crimes and protecting the common good, not as an
   alleged outlet for personal anger. Forgiveness is precisely what
   enables us to pursue justice without falling into a spiral of revenge
   or the injustice of forgetting.

   253. When injustices have occurred on both sides, it is important to
   take into clear account whether they were equally grave or in any way
   comparable. Violence perpetrated by the state, using its structures and
   power, is not on the same level as that perpetrated by particular
   groups. In any event, one cannot claim that the unjust sufferings of
   one side alone should be commemorated. The Bishops of Croatia have
   stated that, "we owe equal respect to every innocent victim. There can
   be no racial, national, confessional or partisan
   differences".[256][235]

   254. I ask God "to prepare our hearts to encounter our brothers and
   sisters, so that we may overcome our differences rooted in political
   thinking, language, culture and religion. Let us ask him to anoint our
   whole being with the balm of his mercy, which heals the injuries caused
   by mistakes, misunderstandings and disputes. And let us ask him for the
   grace to send us forth, in humility and meekness, along the demanding
   but enriching path of seeking peace".[257][236]

   WAR AND THE DEATH PENALTY

   255. There are two extreme situations that may come to be seen as
   solutions in especially dramatic circumstances, without realizing that
   they are false answers that do not resolve the problems they are meant
   to solve and ultimately do no more than introduce new elements of
   destruction in the fabric of national and global society. These are war
   and the death penalty.

   The injustice of war

   256. "Deceit is in the mind of those who plan evil, but those who
   counsel peace have joy" (Prov 12:20). Yet there are those who seek
   solutions in war, frequently fueled by a breakdown in relations,
   hegemonic ambitions, abuses of power, fear of others and a tendency to
   see diversity as an obstacle.[258][237] War is not a ghost from the
   past but a constant threat. Our world is encountering growing
   difficulties on the slow path to peace upon which it had embarked and
   which had already begun to bear good fruit.

   257. Since conditions that favour the outbreak of wars are once again
   increasing, I can only reiterate that "war is the negation of all
   rights and a dramatic assault on the environment. If we want true
   integral human development for all, we must work tirelessly to avoid
   war between nations and peoples. To this end, there is a need to ensure
   the uncontested rule of law and tireless recourse to negotiation,
   mediation and arbitration, as proposed by the Charter of the United
   Nations, which constitutes truly a fundamental juridical
   norm".[259][238] The seventy-five years since the establishment of the
   United Nations and the experience of the first twenty years of this
   millennium have shown that the full application of international norms
   proves truly effective, and that failure to comply with them is
   detrimental. The Charter of the United Nations, when observed and
   applied with transparency and sincerity, is an obligatory reference
   point of justice and a channel of peace. Here there can be no room for
   disguising false intentions or placing the partisan interests of one
   country or group above the global common good. If rules are considered
   simply as means to be used whenever it proves advantageous, and to be
   ignored when it is not, uncontrollable forces are unleashed that cause
   grave harm to societies, to the poor and vulnerable, to fraternal
   relations, to the environment and to cultural treasures, with
   irretrievable losses for the global community.

   258. War can easily be chosen by invoking all sorts of allegedly
   humanitarian, defensive or precautionary excuses, and even resorting to
   the manipulation of information. In recent decades, every single war
   has been ostensibly "justified". The Catechism of the Catholic Church
   speaks of the possibility of legitimate defence by means of military
   force, which involves demonstrating that certain "rigorous conditions
   of moral legitimacy"[260][239] have been met. Yet it is easy to fall
   into an overly broad interpretation of this potential right. In this
   way, some would also wrongly justify even "preventive" attacks or acts
   of war that can hardly avoid entailing "evils and disorders graver than
   the evil to be eliminated".[261][240] At issue is whether the
   development of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and the
   enormous and growing possibilities offered by new technologies, have
   granted war an uncontrollable destructive power over great numbers of
   innocent civilians. The truth is that "never has humanity had such
   power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used
   wisely".[262][241] We can no longer think of war as a solution, because
   its risks will probably always be greater than its supposed benefits.
   In view of this, it is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational
   criteria elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of
   a "just war". Never again war![263][242]

   259. It should be added that, with increased globalization, what might
   appear as an immediate or practical solution for one part of the world
   initiates a chain of violent and often latent effects that end up
   harming the entire planet and opening the way to new and worse wars in
   the future. In today's world, there are no longer just isolated
   outbreaks of war in one country or another; instead, we are
   experiencing a "world war fought piecemeal", since the destinies of
   countries are so closely interconnected on the global scene.

   260. In the words of Saint John XXIII, "it no longer makes sense to
   maintain that war is a fit instrument with which to repair the
   violation of justice".[264][243] In making this point amid great
   international tension, he voiced the growing desire for peace emerging
   in the Cold War period. He supported the conviction that the arguments
   for peace are stronger than any calculation of particular interests and
   confidence in the use of weaponry. The opportunities offered by the end
   of the Cold War were not, however, adequately seized due to a lack of a
   vision for the future and a shared consciousness of our common destiny.
   Instead, it proved easier to pursue partisan interests without
   upholding the universal common good. The dread spectre of war thus
   began to gain new ground.

   261. Every war leaves our world worse than it was before. War is a
   failure of politics and of humanity, a shameful capitulation, a
   stinging defeat before the forces of evil. Let us not remain mired in
   theoretical discussions, but touch the wounded flesh of the victims.
   Let us look once more at all those civilians whose killing was
   considered "collateral damage". Let us ask the victims themselves. Let
   us think of the refugees and displaced, those who suffered the effects
   of atomic radiation or chemical attacks, the mothers who lost their
   children, and the boys and girls maimed or deprived of their childhood.
   Let us hear the true stories of these victims of violence, look at
   reality through their eyes, and listen with an open heart to the
   stories they tell. In this way, we will be able to grasp the abyss of
   evil at the heart of war. Nor will it trouble us to be deemed naive for
   choosing peace.

   262. Rules by themselves will not suffice if we continue to think that
   the solution to current problems is deterrence through fear or the
   threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. Indeed, "if we take
   into consideration the principal threats to peace and security with
   their many dimensions in this multipolar world of the twenty-first
   century as, for example, terrorism, asymmetrical conflicts,
   cybersecurity, environmental problems, poverty, not a few doubts arise
   regarding the inadequacy of nuclear deterrence as an effective response
   to such challenges. These concerns are even greater when we consider
   the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental consequences that would
   follow from any use of nuclear weapons, with devastating,
   indiscriminate and uncontainable effects, over time and space... We
   need also to ask ourselves how sustainable is a stability based on
   fear, when it actually increases fear and undermines relationships of
   trust between peoples. International peace and stability cannot be
   based on a false sense of security, on the threat of mutual destruction
   or total annihilation, or on simply maintaining a balance of power...
   In this context, the ultimate goal of the total elimination of nuclear
   weapons becomes both a challenge and a moral and humanitarian
   imperative... Growing interdependence and globalization mean that any
   response to the threat of nuclear weapons should be collective and
   concerted, based on mutual trust. This trust can be built only through
   dialogue that is truly directed to the common good and not to the
   protection of veiled or particular interests".[265][244] With the money
   spent on weapons and other military expenditures, let us establish a
   global fund[266][245] that can finally put an end to hunger and favour
   development in the most impoverished countries, so that their citizens
   will not resort to violent or illusory solutions, or have to leave
   their countries in order to seek a more dignified life.

   The death penalty

   263. There is yet another way to eliminate others, one aimed not at
   countries but at individuals. It is the death penalty. Saint John Paul
   II stated clearly and firmly that the death penalty is inadequate from
   a moral standpoint and no longer necessary from that of penal
   justice.[267][246] There can be no stepping back from this position.
   Today we state clearly that "the death penalty is
   inadmissible"[268][247] and the Church is firmly committed to calling
   for its abolition worldwide.[269][248]

   264. In the New Testament, while individuals are asked not to take
   justice into their own hands (cf. Rom 12:17.19), there is also a
   recognition of the need for authorities to impose penalties on
   evildoers (cf. Rom 13:4; 1 Pet 2:14). Indeed, "civic life, structured
   around an organized community, needs rules of coexistence, the wilful
   violation of which demands appropriate redress".[270][249] This means
   that legitimate public authority can and must "inflict punishments
   according to the seriousness of the crimes"[271][250] and that judicial
   power be guaranteed a "necessary independence in the realm of
   law".[272][251]

   265. From the earliest centuries of the Church, some were clearly
   opposed to capital punishment. Lactantius, for example, held that
   "there ought to be no exception at all; that it is always unlawful to
   put a man to death".[273][252] Pope Nicholas I urged that efforts be
   made "to free from the punishment of death not only each of the
   innocent, but all the guilty as well".[274][253] During the trial of
   the murderers of two priests, Saint Augustine asked the judge not to
   take the life of the assassins with this argument: "We do not object to
   your depriving these wicked men of the freedom to commit further
   crimes. Our desire is rather that justice be satisfied without the
   taking of their lives or the maiming of their bodies in any part. And,
   at the same time, that by the coercive measures provided by the law,
   they be turned from their irrational fury to the calmness of men of
   sound mind, and from their evil deeds to some useful employment. This
   too is considered a condemnation, but who does not see that, when
   savage violence is restrained and remedies meant to produce repentance
   are provided, it should be considered a benefit rather than a mere
   punitive measure... Do not let the atrocity of their sins feed a desire
   for vengeance, but desire instead to heal the wounds which those deeds
   have inflicted on their souls".[275][254]

   266. Fear and resentment can easily lead to viewing punishment in a
   vindictive and even cruel way, rather than as part of a process of
   healing and reintegration into society. Nowadays, "in some political
   sectors and certain media, public and private violence and revenge are
   incited, not only against those responsible for committing crimes, but
   also against those suspected, whether proven or not, of breaking the
   law... There is at times a tendency to deliberately fabricate enemies:
   stereotyped figures who represent all the characteristics that society
   perceives or interprets as threatening. The mechanisms that form these
   images are the same that allowed the spread of racist ideas in their
   time".[276][255] This has made all the more dangerous the growing
   practice in some countries of resorting to preventive custody,
   imprisonment without trial and especially the death penalty.

   267. Here I would stress that "it is impossible to imagine that states
   today have no other means than capital punishment to protect the lives
   of other people from the unjust aggressor". Particularly serious in
   this regard are so-called extrajudicial or extralegal executions, which
   are "homicides deliberately committed by certain states and by their
   agents, often passed off as clashes with criminals or presented as the
   unintended consequences of the reasonable, necessary and proportionate
   use of force in applying the law".[277][256]

   268. "The arguments against the death penalty are numerous and
   well-known. The Church has rightly called attention to several of
   these, such as the possibility of judicial error and the use made of
   such punishment by totalitarian and dictatorial regimes as a means of
   suppressing political dissidence or persecuting religious and cultural
   minorities, all victims whom the legislation of those regimes consider
   `delinquents'. All Christians and people of good will are today called
   to work not only for the abolition of the death penalty, legal or
   illegal, in all its forms, but also to work for the improvement of
   prison conditions, out of respect for the human dignity of persons
   deprived of their freedom. I would link this to life imprisonment... A
   life sentence is a secret death penalty".[278][257]

   269. Let us keep in mind that "not even a murderer loses his personal
   dignity, and God himself pledges to guarantee this".[279][258] The firm
   rejection of the death penalty shows to what extent it is possible to
   recognize the inalienable dignity of every human being and to accept
   that he or she has a place in this universe. If I do not deny that
   dignity to the worst of criminals, I will not deny it to anyone. I will
   give everyone the possibility of sharing this planet with me, despite
   all our differences.

   270. I ask Christians who remain hesitant on this point, and those
   tempted to yield to violence in any form, to keep in mind the words of
   the book of Isaiah: "They shall beat their swords into plowshares"
   (2:4). For us, this prophecy took flesh in Christ Jesus who, seeing a
   disciple tempted to violence, said firmly: "Put your sword back into
   its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword" (Mt
   26:52). These words echoed the ancient warning: "I will require a
   reckoning for human life. Whoever sheds the blood of a man, by man
   shall his blood be shed" (Gen 9:5-6). Jesus' reaction, which sprang
   from his heart, bridges the gap of the centuries and reaches the
   present as an enduring appeal.

                                CHAPTER EIGHT

             RELIGIONS AT THE SERVICE OF FRATERNITY IN OUR WORLD

   271. The different religions, based on their respect for each human
   person as a creature called to be a child of God, contribute
   significantly to building fraternity and defending justice in society.
   Dialogue between the followers of different religions does not take
   place simply for the sake of diplomacy, consideration or tolerance. In
   the words of the Bishops of India, "the goal of dialogue is to
   establish friendship, peace and harmony, and to share spiritual and
   moral values and experiences in a spirit of truth and love".[280][259]

   THE ULTIMATE FOUNDATION

   272. As believers, we are convinced that, without an openness to the
   Father of all, there will be no solid and stable reasons for an appeal
   to fraternity. We are certain that "only with this awareness that we
   are not orphans, but children, can we live in peace with one
   another".[281][260] For "reason, by itself, is capable of grasping the
   equality between men and of giving stability to their civic
   coexistence, but it cannot establish fraternity".[282][261]

   273. In this regard, I wish to cite the following memorable statement:
   "If there is no transcendent truth, in obedience to which man achieves
   his full identity, then there is no sure principle for guaranteeing
   just relations between people. Their self-interest as a class, group or
   nation would inevitably set them in opposition to one another. If one
   does not acknowledge transcendent truth, then the force of power takes
   over, and each person tends to make full use of the means at his
   disposal in order to impose his own interests or his own opinion, with
   no regard for the rights of others... The root of modern
   totalitarianism is to be found in the denial of the transcendent
   dignity of the human person who, as the visible image of the invisible
   God, is therefore by his very nature the subject of rights that no one
   may violate - no individual, group, class, nation or state. Not even
   the majority of the social body may violate these rights, by going
   against the minority".[283][262]

   274. From our faith experience and from the wisdom accumulated over
   centuries, but also from lessons learned from our many weaknesses and
   failures, we, the believers of the different religions, know that our
   witness to God benefits our societies. The effort to seek God with a
   sincere heart, provided it is never sullied by ideological or
   self-serving aims, helps us recognize one another as travelling
   companions, truly brothers and sisters. We are convinced that "when, in
   the name of an ideology, there is an attempt to remove God from a
   society, that society ends up adoring idols, and very soon men and
   women lose their way, their dignity is trampled and their rights
   violated. You know well how much suffering is caused by the denial of
   freedom of conscience and of religious freedom, and how that wound
   leaves a humanity which is impoverished, because it lacks hope and
   ideals to guide it".[284][263]

   275. It should be acknowledged that "among the most important causes of
   the crises of the modern world are a desensitized human conscience, a
   distancing from religious values and the prevailing individualism
   accompanied by materialistic philosophies that deify the human person
   and introduce worldly and material values in place of supreme and
   transcendental principles".[285][264] It is wrong when the only voices
   to be heard in public debate are those of the powerful and "experts".
   Room needs to be made for reflections born of religious traditions that
   are the repository of centuries of experience and wisdom. For
   "religious classics can prove meaningful in every age; they have an
   enduring power [to open new horizons, to stimulate thought, to expand
   the mind and the heart]". Yet often they are viewed with disdain as a
   result of "the myopia of a certain rationalism".[286][265]

   276. For these reasons, the Church, while respecting the autonomy of
   political life, does not restrict her mission to the private sphere. On
   the contrary, "she cannot and must not remain on the sidelines" in the
   building of a better world, or fail to "reawaken the spiritual energy"
   that can contribute to the betterment of society.[287][266] It is true
   that religious ministers must not engage in the party politics that are
   the proper domain of the laity, but neither can they renounce the
   political dimension of life itself,[288][267] which involves a constant
   attention to the common good and a concern for integral human
   development. The Church "has a public role over and above her
   charitable and educational activities". She works for "the advancement
   of humanity and of universal fraternity".[289][268] She does not claim
   to compete with earthly powers, but to offer herself as "a family among
   families, this is the Church, open to bearing witness in today's world,
   open to faith hope and love for the Lord and for those whom he loves
   with a preferential love. A home with open doors. The Church is a home
   with open doors, because she is a mother".[290][269] And in imitation
   of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, "we want to be a Church that serves, that
   leaves home and goes forth from its places of worship, goes forth from
   its sacristies, in order to accompany life, to sustain hope, to be the
   sign of unity... to build bridges, to break down walls, to sow seeds of
   reconciliation".[291][270]

   Christian identity

   277. The Church esteems the ways in which God works in other religions,
   and "rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions. She
   has a high regard for their manner of life and conduct, their precepts
   and doctrines which... often reflect a ray of that truth which
   enlightens all men and women".[292][271] Yet we Christians are very
   much aware that "if the music of the Gospel ceases to resonate in our
   very being, we will lose the joy born of compassion, the tender love
   born of trust, the capacity for reconciliation that has its source in
   our knowledge that we have been forgiven and sent forth. If the music
   of the Gospel ceases to sound in our homes, our public squares, our
   workplaces, our political and financial life, then we will no longer
   hear the strains that challenge us to defend the dignity of every man
   and woman".[293][272] Others drink from other sources. For us the
   wellspring of human dignity and fraternity is in the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ. From it, there arises, "for Christian thought and for the
   action of the Church, the primacy given to relationship, to the
   encounter with the sacred mystery of the other, to universal communion
   with the entire human family, as a vocation of all".[294][273]

   278. Called to take root in every place, the Church has been present
   for centuries throughout the world, for that is what it means to be
   "catholic". She can thus understand, from her own experience of grace
   and sin, the beauty of the invitation to universal love. Indeed, "all
   things human are our concern... wherever the councils of nations come
   together to establish the rights and duties of man, we are honoured to
   be permitted to take our place among them".[295][274] For many
   Christians, this journey of fraternity also has a Mother, whose name is
   Mary. Having received this universal motherhood at the foot of the
   cross (cf. Jn 19:26), she cares not only for Jesus but also for "the
   rest of her children" (cf. Rev 12:17). In the power of the risen Lord,
   she wants to give birth to a new world, where all of us are brothers
   and sisters, where there is room for all those whom our societies
   discard, where justice and peace are resplendent.

   279. We Christians ask that, in those countries where we are a
   minority, we be guaranteed freedom, even as we ourselves promote that
   freedom for non-Christians in places where they are a minority. One
   fundamental human right must not be forgotten in the journey towards
   fraternity and peace. It is religious freedom for believers of all
   religions. That freedom proclaims that we can "build harmony and
   understanding between different cultures and religions. It also
   testifies to the fact that, since the important things we share are so
   many, it is possible to find a means of serene, ordered and peaceful
   coexistence, accepting our differences and rejoicing that, as children
   of the one God, we are all brothers and sisters".[296][275]

   280. At the same time, we ask God to strengthen unity within the
   Church, a unity enriched by differences reconciled by the working of
   the Spirit. For "in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body"
   (1 Cor 12:13), in which each member has his or her distinctive
   contribution to make. As Saint Augustine said, "the ear sees through
   the eye, and the eye hears through the ear".[297][276] It is also
   urgent to continue to bear witness to the journey of encounter between
   the different Christian confessions. We cannot forget Christ's desire
   "that they may all be one" (cf. Jn 17:21). Hearing his call, we
   recognize with sorrow that the process of globalization still lacks the
   prophetic and spiritual contribution of unity among Christians. This
   notwithstanding, "even as we make this journey towards full communion,
   we already have the duty to offer common witness to the love of God for
   all people by working together in the service of humanity".[298][277]

   RELIGION AND VIOLENCE

   281. A journey of peace is possible between religions. Its point of
   departure must be God's way of seeing things. "God does not see with
   his eyes, God sees with his heart. And God's love is the same for
   everyone, regardless of religion. Even if they are atheists, his love
   is the same. When the last day comes, and there is sufficient light to
   see things as they really are, we are going to find ourselves quite
   surprised".[299][278]

   282. It follows that "we believers need to find occasions to speak with
   one another and to act together for the common good and the promotion
   of the poor. This has nothing to do with watering down or concealing
   our deepest convictions when we encounter others who think differently
   than ourselves... For the deeper, stronger and richer our own identity
   is, the more we will be capable of enriching others with our own proper
   contribution".[300][279] We believers are challenged to return to our
   sources, in order to concentrate on what is essential: worship of God
   and love for our neighbour, lest some of our teachings, taken out of
   context, end up feeding forms of contempt, hatred, xenophobia or
   negation of others. The truth is that violence has no basis in our
   fundamental religious convictions, but only in their distortion.

   283. Sincere and humble worship of God "bears fruit not in
   discrimination, hatred and violence, but in respect for the sacredness
   of life, respect for the dignity and freedom of others, and loving
   commitment to the welfare of all".[301][280] Truly, "whoever does not
   love does not know God, for God is love" (1 Jn 4:8). For this reason,
   "terrorism is deplorable and threatens the security of people - be they
   in the East or the West, the North or the South - and disseminates
   panic, terror and pessimism, but this is not due to religion, even when
   terrorists instrumentalize it. It is due, rather, to an accumulation of
   incorrect interpretations of religious texts and to policies linked to
   hunger, poverty, injustice, oppression and pride. That is why it is so
   necessary to stop supporting terrorist movements fuelled by financing,
   the provision of weapons and strategy, and by attempts to justify these
   movements, even using the media. All these must be regarded as
   international crimes that threaten security and world peace. Such
   terrorism must be condemned in all its forms and
   expressions".[302][281] Religious convictions about the sacred meaning
   of human life permit us "to recognize the fundamental values of our
   common humanity, values in the name of which we can and must cooperate,
   build and dialogue, pardon and grow; this will allow different voices
   to unite in creating a melody of sublime nobility and beauty, instead
   of fanatical cries of hatred".[303][282]

   284. At times fundamentalist violence is unleashed in some groups, of
   whatever religion, by the rashness of their leaders. Yet, "the
   commandment of peace is inscribed in the depths of the religious
   traditions that we represent... As religious leaders, we are called to
   be true `people of dialogue', to cooperate in building peace not as
   intermediaries but as authentic mediators. Intermediaries seek to give
   everyone a discount, ultimately in order to gain something for
   themselves. The mediator, on the other hand, is one who retains nothing
   for himself, but rather spends himself generously until he is consumed,
   knowing that the only gain is peace. Each one of us is called to be an
   artisan of peace, by uniting and not dividing, by extinguishing hatred
   and not holding on to it, by opening paths of dialogue and not by
   constructing new walls".[304][283]

   An appeal

   285. In my fraternal meeting, which I gladly recall, with the Grand
   Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, "we resolutely [declared] that religions must
   never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must
   they incite violence or the shedding of blood. These tragic realities
   are the consequence of a deviation from religious teachings. They
   result from a political manipulation of religions and from
   interpretations made by religious groups who, in the course of history,
   have taken advantage of the power of religious sentiment in the hearts
   of men and women... God, the Almighty, has no need to be defended by
   anyone and does not want his name to be used to terrorize
   people".[305][284] For this reason I would like to reiterate here the
   appeal for peace, justice and fraternity that we made together:

   "In the name of God, who has created all human beings equal in rights,
   duties and dignity, and who has called them to live together as
   brothers and sisters, to fill the earth and make known the values of
   goodness, love and peace;

   "In the name of innocent human life that God has forbidden to kill,
   affirming that whoever kills a person is like one who kills the whole
   of humanity, and that whoever saves a person is like one who saves the
   whole of humanity;

   "In the name of the poor, the destitute, the marginalized and those
   most in need, whom God has commanded us to help as a duty required of
   all persons, especially the wealthy and those of means;

   "In the name of orphans, widows, refugees and those exiled from their
   homes and their countries; in the name of all victims of wars,
   persecution and injustice; in the name of the weak, those who live in
   fear, prisoners of war and those tortured in any part of the world,
   without distinction;

   "In the name of peoples who have lost their security, peace and the
   possibility of living together, becoming victims of destruction,
   calamity and war;

   "In the name of human fraternity, that embraces all human beings,
   unites them and renders them equal;

   "In the name of this fraternity torn apart by policies of extremism and
   division, by systems of unrestrained profit or by hateful ideological
   tendencies that manipulate the actions and the future of men and women;

   "In the name of freedom, that God has given to all human beings,
   creating them free and setting them apart by this gift;

   "In the name of justice and mercy, the foundations of prosperity and
   the cornerstone of faith;

   "In the name of all persons of goodwill present in every part of the
   world;

   "In the name of God and of everything stated thus far, [we] declare the
   adoption of a culture of dialogue as the path; mutual cooperation as
   the code of conduct; reciprocal understanding as the method and
   standard".[306][285]

                                    * * *

   286. In these pages of reflection on universal fraternity, I felt
   inspired particularly by Saint Francis of Assisi, but also by others of
   our brothers and sisters who are not Catholics: Martin Luther King,
   Desmond Tutu, Mahatma Gandhi and many more. Yet I would like to
   conclude by mentioning another person of deep faith who, drawing upon
   his intense experience of God, made a journey of transformation towards
   feeling a brother to all. I am speaking of Blessed Charles de Foucauld.

   287. Blessed Charles directed his ideal of total surrender to God
   towards an identification with the poor, abandoned in the depths of the
   African desert. In that setting, he expressed his desire to feel
   himself a brother to every human being,[307][286] and asked a friend to
   "pray to God that I truly be the brother of all".[308][287] He wanted
   to be, in the end, "the universal brother".[309][288] Yet only by
   identifying with the least did he come at last to be the brother of
   all. May God inspire that dream in each one of us. Amen.

                           A Prayer to the Creator

   Lord, Father of our human family,
   you created all human beings equal in dignity:
   pour forth into our hearts a fraternal spirit
   and inspire in us a dream of renewed encounter,
   dialogue, justice and peace.
   Move us to create healthier societies
   and a more dignified world,
   a world without hunger, poverty, violence and war.

   May our hearts be open
   to all the peoples and nations of the earth.
   May we recognize the goodness and beauty
   that you have sown in each of us,
   and thus forge bonds of unity, common projects,
   and shared dreams. Amen.


                       An Ecumenical Christian Prayer

   O God, Trinity of love,
   from the profound communion of your divine life,
   pour out upon us a torrent of fraternal love.
   Grant us the love reflected in the actions of Jesus,
   in his family of Nazareth,
   and in the early Christian community.

   Grant that we Christians may live the Gospel,
   discovering Christ in each human being,
   recognizing him crucified
   in the sufferings of the abandoned
   and forgotten of our world,
   and risen in each brother or sister
   who makes a new start.

   Come, Holy Spirit, show us your beauty,
   reflected in all the peoples of the earth,
   so that we may discover anew
   that all are important and all are necessary,
   different faces of the one humanity
   that God so loves. Amen.

   Given in Assisi, at the tomb of Saint Francis, on 3 October, Vigil of
   the Feast of the Saint, in the year 2020, the eighth of my Pontificate.
