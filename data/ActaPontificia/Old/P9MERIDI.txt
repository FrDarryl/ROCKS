MERIDIONALI AMERICAE (On The Seminary For Native Clergy)
Pope Pius IX
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical Promulgated on 30 September 1865

To the Venerable Brothers, Archbishops and Bishops of South America.

Venerable Brothers, Greeting and Apostolic Benediction.

For South America, oppressed on all sides by so many trials, We are
consoled to see a happy hope rise from the indigenous young clergy whom
We take care to imbue with enduring piety and sound doctrine here in
Rome. You know how willingly We prepared the college to receive and
educate them, and how promptly, despite our limited resources, We
strove to provide the necessary means for so great an undertaking.
Naturally there was the problem of preparing candidates suitable for
the Church, of taking care of the salvation of souls in those regions
through them, and also of establishing a new clergy through them on
their return to their fatherland. But since our strength is limited, We
found ourselves unable to bear the burden, and so We fear that this
work, begun with so great an effort and with such a bright outlook, may
perish on its own. To avert such a calamity, We thus entrust this work
to your love. We know that you thoroughly understand and support the
necessity of carefully training an indigenous clergy to care for your
flock. But, because your attention is divided among so many
distractions, anguish, and cares, We remind you of this grave concern.
We certainly, if at all possible, shall not fail this youth, which We
embrace with paternal charity. While We predict a generous growth for
it, We ask of you, venerable brothers, constancy, heavenly strength,
and every consolation. And We, desiring the Apostolic Benediction to be
an auspice of this and a proof of our special benevolence, impart it
most lovingly to you, to the clergy, and to the faithful entrusted to
each one of you.

Given at Rome at St. Peter's, 30 September 1865, in the twentieth year
of Our Pontificate.
