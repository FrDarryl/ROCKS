QUAE AD NOS (On the Church in Bohemia and Moravia)
Pope Leo XIII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII promulgated on 22 November 1902

To Cardinal Skrbensky, Archbishop of Prague and to the Other
Archbishops and Bishops of Bohemia and Moravia.

1. The notices which daily come to Us about the state of your dioceses
and the departure of large numbers from the rites and practices of
Catholicism cause Us great sorrow and grief.

2. Certainly We do not doubt that you strenuously apply every argument
to repair the misfortunes of the flock entrusted to you and to prevent
losses from becoming worse with each day. If the enemies of the faith
spare neither labor nor money, and strain with all their might to
destroy your flock, you, whom Christ wished to be Pastors, must not be
idle; you must use every available means to defend your flock. However,
the magnitude of the danger persuades Us to goad the willing. We know,
to be sure, that not all of your dioceses are in the same circumstances
with regard to the security of the faith; therefore the same means of
assistance for preserving the faith cannot be applied everywhere.

However, since the danger is a common one, and it is a common
fatherland which calls for defense, We think that the very best
resolution would be for you to communicate with each other and with
united opinion to provide for what must be accomplished and what must
be avoided.

3. Therefore it is Our wish that all of you Bishops of Bohemia and
Moravia hold a meeting as soon as possible to deliberate concerning the
defense of the faith among your countrymen.

4. Naturally you will see to it that the nature of the deliberations
and decisions which take place be referred to Us so that they may be
sanctioned by the apostolic approval.

5. Moreover, We do not wish to let this opportunity go by without
commending to you again most strenuously that you take care to
extirpate totally the partisan zeal which causes the holy clergy among
you to be split apart; this divides and enervates the forces of those
whose union is greatly needed, now especially, for the defense of the
faith. May the aid of divine grace be with you in these tasks.

6. As a token of Our love receive the Apostolic Blessing which We most
lovingly in the Lord impart to you and your flock.

Given in Rome at St. Peter's, 22 November 1902, in the 25th year of Our
Pontificate.
