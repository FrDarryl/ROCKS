COMMUNIUM INTERPRETES DOLORAUM
Pope Pius XII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical Promulgated on 15 April 1945

To the Venerable Brothers, Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, other
Ordinaries of Places in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See.

Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Benediction.

1. As interpreter of the universal anguish by which almost every nation
is grievously distressed, We desire to leave nothing undone within Our
powers that may mitigate these numberless miseries or that may hasten
the end of such great destruction. We know well that the resources of
men are unable to heal these great injuries. We know that the human
mind, especially when hate and rivalry have blinded it, cannot easily
determine a just and equitable solution of affairs along with a
fraternal agreement. It is therefore necessary to implore the Father of
light and mercy[1] repeatedly. He alone, in the midst of such violent
disturbances and tumults, can persuade those concerned that too many
catastrophes and devastations have been piled up in a fearful mass,
that too many tears have been shed, and that too much blood has been
spilled. Therefore divine and human rights demand unequivocally that
such hideous slaughter cease as soon as possible.

2. The month of May, sacred in a special way to the Blessed Virgin
Mother of God, is approaching. We again exhort all&#151;but especially
the very young and innocent children&#151;to humbly entreat the divine
Redeemer, through the intercession of Mary, that the peoples who have
been forced into discord, contention, and all kinds of misery, may be
able to breathe again after their long-lasting distress and sorrow. But
since it is our sins[2] which have turned us away from Him and have
immersed us miserably in destruction, it is hardly enough to pour out
many prayers to heaven; it is hardly enough to approach the altar of
the Blessed Virgin to bring her an offering, flowers, and prayers.
Additionally we must use Christian morals to renew both public and
private life; in this way, we will lay a solid foundation on which a
building of domestic and civil concord, not discord, and a strong, but
not a tottering building, can stand. Let all remember those warnings of
the sacred prophet and assimilate them in the conduct of their lives:
"Turn to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you".[3] Also
meditate upon those words of the most wise Bishop of Hippo: "Change the
heart and the work will be changed. Eradicate cupidity and plant
charity."[4] "Do you want peace? Do justice, and you will have peace.
Justice and peace kiss one another."[5] If you do not love justice, you
will not have peace, for these two love one another and kiss each
other, so that if you practice justice, you will find peace kissing
justice. ....If therefore you desire to come to peace, do justice;
avoid evil and do good. This is to love justice; and when you have
already avoided evil and done good, seek peace and follow it."[6]

3. When all faithful Christians follow this advice, their prayers most
certainly please God. Then from a propitiated God, they will obtain
both consolation and the gifts which are so necessary in these times.

4. But you know what gifts, what resources, what consolations we need
most in these critical times. In the first place we must ask most
humbly that minds and souls be illumined and renewed by the precepts of
Christian doctrine, for from them alone private and public salvation
must be awaited. Secondly, that the internecine strife of peoples and
nations cease to rage and that all classes of citizens, joined in a
friendly pact, strive peacefully to build from the heaped up piles of
rubble&#151;under the auspices of justice and charity&#151;a new
building for the human community. But something more must be sought
from the divine Redeemer and His most holy Mother by prayer and
penance. We must seek a true and sincere peace, that may quickly end
this calamitous and bloody conflict.

5. In the midst of such great destruction and perturbation of affairs,
while many are still angry and inimical to one another, it is certainly
not easy to achieve such a peace. Peace must be tempered by the
impartial scale of justice, which embraces in fraternal charity all
peoples and all nations and which does not bear hidden germs of discord
and strife. Therefore, those who must come to agreement in this most
grave cause, and those on whose recommendations not only the fate of
their nations depends, but also the relationships of all mankind and
the future course of the ages, especially need celestial help. We
therefore desire that the faithful pray humbly to God. We also desire
that during the month of May, innocent children especially beg from the
Mother of divine Wisdom expressly this heavenly light for those who
will adjudicate the universal cause. Let them consider seriously and
ponder before God whatever has transgressed the limits of justice and
equity. If these matters are not resolved, it would be detrimental both
for the victors and the vanquished, since then their solutions could
themselves bear the seeds of future wars.

6. We desire moreover that those who heed Our exhortation, also pray
for those who are fugitives banished from their homeland and longing to
once again see their own homes; also for those in captivity who wait
for their liberation after the war; and finally those who lie in
numberless hospitals. To these miserable ones and to all others
afflicated by this monstrous conflict, may the most merciful Mother of
God grant heavenly solace and obtain for them the virtue of Christian
patience by which illnesses of the most severe kind become bearable and
lead to eternal beatitude.

7. It will be your part, venerable brothers, to communicate these
paternal desires and exhortations of Ours to the flocks entrusted to
your care. To them&#151;but first to you individually and
together&#151;as an auspice of heavenly gifts and a proof of Our good
will, We bestow most lovingly in the Lord the Apostolic Benediction.

8. Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, Sunday, the 15 of April, sacred to
the Good Shepherd Jesus Christ, 1945, in the seventh year of Our
pontificate.
