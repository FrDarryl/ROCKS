CUM PRIMUM (On Observing Canonical Sanctions)
Pope Clement XIII
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Clement XIII promulgated on 17 September 1759.

To Our Venerable Brothers, all the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops,
and Bishops who Enjoy Grace and Communion with the Apostolic See.

Venerable Brothers, Greetings and Apostolic Blessing.

Ever since We first accepted the care of the Lord's flock, through the
incomprehensible wisdom of the eternal shepherd presiding over the See
of St. Peter, We have received reports from many fervent and zealous
churchmen. Many of them were from pastors and preachers of the word of
God, who travel through the cities and provinces preaching penance and
correction of character to the people. Their unanimous complaint was
that among the abuses and corruptions which they observed and strove to
reform in the exercise of their ministry, they frequently encountered
an avarice and greed on the part of certain clergymen that cried out
for correction. As the Holy Spirit called this the root of all evil, it
is no wonder that it draws into more heinous crimes all those whose
soul it fills. It renders them apathetic in the fulfillment of their
duties and in their worship of God. Once avarice converts them to
worldly desires, they become devoted to worldly cares and
preoccupations. They publicly disavow these while they profess that
among the mysteries of the holy initiation, they recognize only God as
the portion of their inheritance. Thus they necessarily become
contentious and ready to throw everything into confusion, so as not to
lose some vile profit which they either hope for or have already
received. They are not ashamed to lower themselves to any lowly duty or
service, to the disgrace of their order and status. As a result many
laymen despise not only those who do such things, but often even the
whole priestly company. Rather, let them be bitter and scornful toward
the kind of person whose lawsuits and contentions they must endure in
worldly affairs, or through whom honest means of providing for their
own welfare and that of their loved ones seems to be forestalled.

2. We believe that these accounts are more than adequately supported by
the facts. Indeed, even some monks allow themselves on occasion to be
taken beyond the bounds of ecclesiastical moderation, away from the
concern they imposed on themselves regarding the temporal gains of
their communities. We are thus aroused to satisfactorily remove from
our midst such a corruption, which brings scandal to the faithful and
damaging effects to others.

3. It is true that from the very beginning of the Church right up to
our own times, there was nothing more plainly or more attentively
legislated either by the decrees of the councils or by the
constitutions of the popes who preceded Us. Nothing seemed to be
stressed more frequently or more eagerly by the holy fathers and the
pastors of the churches than that the ministers of the church, both
clergy and monks, abstain from the desire for temporal wealth and that
they should remove themselves from worldly concerns. Not only spiritual
censures but also very serious temporal punishments were decreed for
those who presumed to infringe or violate the canonical rules in this
matter. Having carefully considered everything, We think that there is
nothing left for Us to do, Venerable Brothers, other than to exhort you
to cling to the intention of Our predecessors and the spirit of the
church in all things. We exhort you to be zealous in obtaining the
observance due these holy laws by all churchmen-both those subject to
your ordinary jurisdiction as well as those subject to your delegated
jurisdiction-according to the example of the sacred canons and the
decrees of the Holy See and the synodical statutes of each diocese.

4. In order to clarify this matter, We devote Our constant attention
and that of the Holy See to the religious observance of the
aforementioned laws. At the same time, We approve, confirm, and renew
through this letter each and every canon and constitution of Our
predecessors against those clerics who act as businessmen and who
involve themselves in worldly matters. We mention especially those
decrees published and proclaimed by Pius IV, Urban VIII, and Clement
IX, including the most recent one which Our predecessor Popes Benedict
XIV promulgated on February 25, 1741, the first year of his
pontificate, along with each and every penalty and the censures
respectively ordained by them. Similarly, the decrees contained in the
above-mentioned laws as well as their punishments and sanctions should
be inserted word for word in Our present letter. At the same time let
all efficacy be removed from every opposing custom and practice--which
ought rather to be called by their proper names, corruptions and
abuses--by which certain churchmen strive to cover up their criminal
dabbling in worldly matters. We declare and decree that all
clergymen-both from the secular clergy and from the regular clergy of
whatever order, congregation, society, or institute, are subject to and
should be subject to all the aforementioned laws and penalties. We
should also mention specifically those favored with special and
extensive indults, privileges, and exemptions. Thus, whoever
transgresses these laws incurs the penalties prescribed in them as well
as those applicable according to the differences of circumstances and
the method of procedure prescribed by the Council of Trent or by the
Holy See. They should be punished notwithstanding any custom or
practice to the contrary, even very old ones which can be considered
indigenous to some places, dioceses, or regions. We condemn, proscribe,
and nullify this practice, considering it a damnable abuse and an
intolerable corruption in the present state of affairs.

5. We exhort all of you, then, to watch over the integrity of
ecclesiastical discipline and the salvation of the souls of all the
clergy subject to you, both by ordinary and by delegated law. Inquire
diligently into their course of action; if you discover that some of
them are infected with the stain of this greed and that they sin
against the canons and apostolic constitutions, do not neglect to
proceed against them dutifully and stringently, according to the
example of the same canons and constitutions.

6. There are two things which you should especially beware of in this
matter. First of all, do not allow your vigilance to be foiled by the
crafty arts of the evildoers. It often happens that those who know the
decrees of the laws fraudulently arrange their affairs so that even if
their crime should be brought to court, they can be on guard against
admitting any violation of those laws. Sometimes they will use an
intermediary to serve their greed, or else conduct business matters
under a different name, which they record in the tables and account
books while they firmly maintain that they are not in the least
concerned in the matter under investigation. Sometimes they are aware
that the more restrictive judgment of the laws is constrained within
certain limits; they strive to behave so that they have a defense if
they are accused of financial aspirations by their superiors. They can
maintain that they were not primarily led by base greed to seek profit,
but that they worked solely at avoiding evil through cautious planning
and that they obtained an undesired profit through the fortuitous
goodness of time. Sometimes it is not their own property which is
involved in the business matters but that of their relatives or those
joined to them by some other bond of need. They will say that they
obtain their support out of the duty of love or under the title of
management.

7. We are sufficiently aware, through Our own experience in exercising
the episcopal office, of how difficult it is to make a judgment in
certain cases in which the good or bad intention of the one who is
accused of unlawful business is of paramount importance. However, you
should not think for that reason that your diligence will be
ineffectual when the clergy at least understands that you will not
ignore such a serious violation of church discipline. You will derive
great benefit from that very thing because you will more often call to
witness your mind and that of the Church, which shrinks from the
shadier collusions even of these men. Given the opportunity, you will
announce to them that the God who scrutinizes the innermost recesses of
man will not be mocked. Before His supreme tribunal, those
sometime-sophistries, which now deceive the bishop and escape the
legally-appointed penalties, will be of no avail. Besides, it will not
be impossible to recognize for the most part the hidden truth of the
matter and subdue the secret crime, if the character of the men
involved, which reveals itself in the total conduct of their lives, and
the accompanying circumstances, which render the proffered excuses more
or less admissible, are weighed with the appropriate skill and care. We
could easily illustrate this with examples, if We did not trust in the
Lord concerning the wisdom of your brotherhood and in your experience.

8. The other thing, which you should equally beware of, is that you not
allow to flourish among you wrong interpretations of canon laws, which
diminish the strength of those laws and give excessive scope to
indulgence. These interpretations arise from private reflection,
outside the mind and spirit of the Church and without the agreement of
a legitimate superior. They are adapted to any circumstances at will.
This problem may arise when the affairs of both the secular and regular
clergy are appealed to you for judgment. If there is any question
concerning the nature of the contract which clergymen customarily enter
into in certain dioceses, whether such a thing is permissible or should
be forbidden, it will hardly be fair to rule on the basis of either the
frequency of those acts whose nature is in question or the ideas of the
contracting parties. But to remove every doubt and to restrain the
excesses and audacity of those who await a decision, the most
expeditious recourse is to this Apostolic See, which has defined many
similar questions through the Congregation of the Cardinals, the
interpreters of the Council of Trent. Thus, it will be possible in the
future to see what was decided in given cases, and what were the
suitable responses which can provide precedents for acting and judging.

9. A clear decision has been requested from Us and the Holy See on the
matter of whether it is permissible for clergymen to change money. Even
though we think that it is difficult to find another matter less
subject to doubt, We nevertheless declare and define in this letter, so
as to remove all doubt, that money changing is by its very nature a
true and proper act of business. Therefore, it should be considered
forbidden to all clergymen, both to contract in their own name or
through an intermediary. Any cleric, either secular or regular, who
changes money will be considered liable to all the penalties and
censures which have been established for clergymen who engage in
business.

10. A clergyman may try to excuse his involvement in worldly business
by pleading indigence. This plea is not valid since the canonical title
of ordination should at least be a sufficient and adequate inheritance
for each and every clergyman to sustain himself. If there are needy
clerics, each should look after his own needs through more proper means
which are in agreement with his vows. The indigence will rather be that
of his parents or sisters or some other person whom he is dutifully
bound to help. First of all, We decree that the ecclesiastical superior
should never allow such an excuse. We cannot permit that cleric not to
be punished in proportion to his guilt according to the prescriptions
of canon law, unless he shows that he has already expressed the
aforementioned needs to the Apostolic See, if he lives in Italy or the
adjacent islands. If he lives in more remote regions, he should at
least have explained matters to the Ordinary of the place. He should
also have sought a suitable dispensation after the consideration of
those matters. Finally he should have requested the Holy See or the
Ordinary for authorization to help the aforementioned person through
his labors.

11. Next, as for what concerns the Curia in this matter, We clarify our
thoughts and desires. Such dispensations and authorizations should
never be granted unless the alleged causes of the situation are based
on fact and unless it is clear that the aforementioned needs cannot be
alleviated in any other way. In the same case, let it never be
permitted for churchmen to assume any kind of business dealings whose
administration is not befitting their clerical status and character.
Rather, in those rescripts or letters of indult, let more suitable ways
to bring assistance to his poor relatives be indicated and prescribed
for the cleric, in accordance with just moderation and the measure of
true need. The Ordinaries to whom this pertains should similarly comply
with everything in the granting of such dispensations and
authorizations. Either they or the Holy See have sometimes permitted
certain indults to certain clerics for special reasons, with just
causes accompanying. Perchance these indults have come into wider
use-for example hiring church-owned farmland for cultivation at a fixed
annual rate. See to it particularly that other clerics do not usurp
these things as if they were conceded generally to everybody without
just cause and without a special indult.

12. As for the rest, We resolve that those very authorizations-even
those obtained in the above - mentioned manner - should always be
considered harmful right up to the time they are revoked. Thus, they
should be considered null and void and revoked in their own right as
soon as the alleged needs of the relatives cease or another legitimate
reason opportunely provides for them. We desire to burden the vigilance
and the conscience of the local Ordinary with the execution and
observance of all these matters.

13. It is true that the current depression of ecclesiastical dignity is
not to be attributed solely to business dealings. There are other
abuses which do not clearly oppose the letter of the sacred canons and
constitutions published by the Holy See. Yet, clergymen decide to use
them and thereby cast aside ever more frequently and more certainly the
proper dignity of the cleric and the reputation of their whole order.
They are confident that they will not be subject to the censures and
the penalties established by those canons and constitutions. We know
that many clergymen are prominent in their unseemly activities: in the
administration and care for their own goods; in selling the fruits,
animals, and other things which grow and are fed on their own farms or
those of the Church; and in preparing things which they need for their
own use or for setting in order the aforementioned farms. Thus they
show themselves completely given over to the cares and concerns of this
world, these clerics who covet worldly gain. Those who have risen above
the lot of the human condition through the eminence of Holy Orders in
this way lower themselves below men of the lowest status. Those who
should be and appear to be the sons of light seem to outdo the sons of
this generation in their concern for worldly greed. Our reports relate
that they attend all the markets and sales with almost the same
splendor and elegance as laymen, and they find anything preferable to
the appearance of clerical moderation and modesty or of the seriousness
and honor of the Church.

14. We proclaim openly that We will not forbid them anything which was
judged permissible, in regard to the very nature of the business, for
the correct and prudent administration of the Church's patrimony or
which the holy fathers and the writers of Church laws entrusted to
their care. For there are many things which clerics are not forbidden
in regard to the substance of the matter, things which they are
permitted to use under certain limitations; but the holy canons will
inflict both temporal punishments and spiritual censures on those who
go beyond the prescribed limitations or who violate the established
rule of ecclesiastical discipline. The general rules of canon law and
the individual statutes of the various dioceses contain many examples
of this, examples which prescribe many things to observe or avoid in
regard to the life, honesty, habit, or tonsure of the clerics. Thus,
Venerable Brothers, you should watch over the motives of all the
clergymen living in your dioceses in regard to the things We have just
mentioned. If they approach you frequently to allow something which
might not be in conformity with their clerical status, you should teach
them through suitable instructions that they should comtemplate the
eminence of the dignity they have chosen for themselves. They should
not think that they are allowed to debase it with indecent acts or to
wipe away from the souls of the laity the esteem and reverence due the
ecclesiastical order, an esteem which greatly benefits the m spiritual
well-being of the faithful. Mindful that they were called to share in
the Lord's portion, they should seek for and be concerned about the
things which concern Jesus Christ and not themselves. In addition, you
know that it is necessary to meet such turpitude and greed on the part
of the clergy with suitable decrees strictly established, and you know
that you must restrain and punish the faults of the evildoers. Given
the choice of a greater or lesser scandal, first of all denounce the
evil. Then correct it with salutary penitence; finally, restrain and
punish it with the unsheathed sword of penalties and censures as an
example for others.

15. Another kind of corruption infects many clergymen and, We
understand, draws them from church service to worldly concerns. This
demands as much or even more concern and constancy from your pastoral
zeal. There are some who give over in object service to the laity all
the labor and effort which they should expend in divine worship and in
aiding their neighbors according to the law of love. Sometimes they
even hire out their services to administer the business affairs of
laymen for vile, temporal pay. In this matter it is difficult to judge
whether the blindness of those who trample upon the dignity of their
own order is to be regretted more, or the presumption of the laity.
This laity takes so lightly the holy ministers from whom they should
seek examples of Christian life and aids to eternal salvation that they
do not hesitate to use them in servile ministries.

16. This certainly disturbs Us more, that an evil of this kind should
come from an abuse which is just as detestable. Whenever someone rashly
aspires to the clerical state, it sometimes happens that he deceives
his Ordinary with false or forged documents, and he is promoted to holy
orders by a false estate which either bears no fruit or which does not
belong to him, without sufficient revenue to maintain an upright
living. For this reason, none of you should be surprised, Venerable
Brothers, if We take this opportunity to strongly exhort and warn each
and every one of you to be more careful and more vigilant in this
matter. Thus, no one subject to you should be given an opportunity to
steal up to holy ordination if he does not receive a certain amount of
annual income from an ecclesiastical benefice or ecclesiastical pension
or from an estate created for him, in cases permitted by law. All fraud
and collusion should be eliminated--if, that is, he does not receive
that amount of annual return which was decreed either in the statutes
of the diocesan synods or by legitimate custom.

17. Take care to recall to the precepts of ecclesiastical life and to
the duties of the clerical soldier those clergymen and priests who
devote themselves in the homes of the laity to these kinds of services
which do not befit their class and profession. These duties lead them
away from God's service from concern for their own spiritual progress
to worldly business dealings and servile occupations, even though they
sometimes strive to conceal their activities with the appearance of
fine titles. Do not allow them to soil themselves peacefully in their
shame or to glory with obstinate impunity in their defection from the
camp of the Church. To these ends use every zeal and as much pastoral
concern as necessary; use all the authority of ordinary and delegated
jurisdiction, and all the while observe those things which must be
observed.

18. Venerable Brothers, these are the things We wanted to suggest and
strongly commend to your care, out of the duty of Our apostolic
ministry in order to protect and vindicate the honor and the dignity of
holy orders. In this matter, which greatly depends on individual
circumstances, it is necessary that you who are present in your
respective territories have the major roles. You are better able to
recognize and more certainly judge the deeds of those subject to you,
the accompanying circumstances, the needs of the regions, the customs
of the people, and whatever might appear decent or indecent among
prudent and upright men. In order that you might be free to correct and
reform whatever might be wrong in these matters, We rely on your
prudent judgment to regulate any indult of dispensation or
authorization granted by any office of the Roman Curia up to now
concerning these matters. We do not want to grant anything further
until We have heard the reports of your brotherhood, as well as the
desires and the accompanying formula and conditions of the indult, by
which you have the entire authority to know about its execution and
effect. Thus, no clergyman should be allowed to conduct any business
dealings under any pretext or to assume a less upright ministry
contrary to your prohibition or to retain it and prolong it once it has
been granted. Meanwhile, We take pleasure in your pastoral zeal, and We
lovingly grant to your brotherhood the apostolic blessing.

Given in Rome at St. Mary Major on the 17th day of September, 1759, in
the second year of Our pontificate.
