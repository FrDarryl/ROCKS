EX QUO (On the Euchologion)
Pope Benedict
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Benedict XIV promulgated on 1 March 1756.

To the Archbishops, Bishops and Other Clerics, Secular and Regular, of
the Greek Rite Who Enjoy Favor and Communion with the Apostolic See.

Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons, We Give You Greeting and Our
Apostolic Blessing.

Ever since We first became Pope, We have proven Our fatherly love in
embracing in Christ Our beloved eastern clergy and people, the Uniates
as they are called, who are in agreement with Us and are free from the
stain of schism. We have made every attempt to induce the schismatics
to abandon their errors and join Us in Catholic unity. We do not intend
to recall here all the measures We took for this purpose since the
records of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith are filled
with Our decrees on this subject and everyone can refer to Our
apostolic letters and constitutions on eastern affairs in the volumes
of Our Bullarium. Our present purpose is to inform you that the work of
correcting the Greek Euchologion is now completed. It has already been
printed by the press of the Congregation for the Propagation of the
Faith following a lengthy scrutiny of every detail and most careful
correction.

Consequently We exhort you to set aside previous editions which have
been found to contain too many different errors, and to use this
edition in sacred rites. The errors of former editions, however, are
not to be wonderered at, for errors are readily made whenever the same
work goes through many editions and the editors do not exert the
strictest care. Such care is necessary to prevent the repeated
insertion or addition of matters which are not found in the earliest
and most faithful editions, whether through deceit or ignorance. Then
since these errors have to be excised or somehow restrained,
corrections and new editions more faithful to the original eventually
are necessary. This has obviously occurred in the Western Church too,
even though it is not as subject to these errors as the Eastern Church.
Accordingly the Roman Pontiffs have often had to see to it that
Missals, Rituals, Breviaries, and Martyrologies were newly issued in
improved editions after appropriate corrections.

In regard to the corrections of your Euchologion (which, as you well
know, is no more than the collection of prayers and blessings of the
Church and so with Goarius We can appropriately term it the Ritual,
Manual, Sacerdotal, or Pontifical of your Church), We propose to
address two subjects in particular in this letter: namely, to set down
first, the history of the new corrected edition which has just been
completed, and then to expound in greater detail certain admonitions
which have been suitably placed at the beginning of the Euchologion. We
have postponed making known to you several other matters relating to
the Euchologion itself. These could not properly be included in the
present letter since they would make it immoderately long and would
impose excessive toil on Us quite unsuited to Our age and not easily
included with the other important concerns which particularly engage Us
at present in Our Apostolic ministry and cannot now be laid aside.

Correction of the Euchologion

2. Philip IV, Catholic King of the Spains, towards the beginning of
1631, had recourse to the Apostolic See. He revealed that he had been
informed by Greek Uniate inhabitants of this realm that a Euchologion
containing many errors had been published by the Greek schismatics; he
asked at that time for the application of appropriate remedies to this
source of foolish confusion. At once Urban VIII formed a special
Congregation for the correction of the Euchologion and personally
appointed to it certain Cardinals, Prelates of the Roman Curia, and
renowned theologians. At that time, he summoned to Rome others with a
worldwide reputation for ecclesiastical learning, intending to appoint
them also to this Congregation. Among those summoned was Dionysius
Petavius, a priest of the Society of Jesus living in France; however,
he understandably excused himself from so long a journey because of his
advanced age. Jean Morin, a priest of the Gallican oratory, was also
called to Rome; he attended many sessions and made many noteworthy
proposals which aided the organization and direction of the
undertaking. These We will discuss in another place.

3. The members of this Congregation conscientiously undertook the work
entrusted to them; their careful work was approved by Leo Allatius who
wrote in a discussion of the Greek Euchologion: "I could relate and
investigate many matters about the book, but since it is submitted to
the censure and judgment of keen scholars, I wait for a true statement
and an infallible verdict concerning it." They met indeed for
eighty-two sessions, as was long ago affirmed by Cardinal Franciscus
Barberinus the elder at the meeting of the Congregation for the
Propagation of the Faith. Pope Innocent X attended this meeting on
January 23, 1645, shortly after the death of his predecessor Urban, the
uncle of this cardinal. Yet the correction of the Euchologion was not
finished, and the new edition could not be brought to completion.

New Congregation on the Euchologion

4. With succeeding popes, although the work was never completely
abandoned, it proceeded slowly while, as often happens, its final
conclusion was held up by the emergence of new and later business. But
when God raised Us to the supreme pontificate, among Our first concerns
was the correction of the books of the Oriental Church, particularly of
the Euchologion of the Greeks. So We soon gave the following orders and
were careful to have them carried out so that We might finally reach
Our desired goal. First, the transactions of the Congregations which
met in the reign of Urban VIII and his successors were collected and
put in order to ascertain the form of those resolutions which had been
adopted but not reinforced by papal confirmation: for apparently the
popes had not condemned these resolutions but had deferred their
consideration, possibly for good reasons, to more suitable times. Next,
after the deaths of all who served on the Congregation, We assigned
other Cardinals and Consultors to press on with the important task.
Among the Cardinals who died were Antonio Xaverio Gentili, Philippo
Monti, Gioachimo Besozzi, and Aloysio Lucini, in that order. As Prefect
of the Congregation, We established the presbyter cardinal Fortunato
Tamburini, who is still living. As Consultors We designated Brother
Giuseppi Agustino Orsi of the Order of Preachers, the master of Our
Apostolic palace; Leonardus Siderer, a priest of the Society of Jesus;
Domenico Vitali, a monk of the Order of St. Basil; Thomas Sergius, a
priest of the Pious Workers; and Domenico Teoli, a Roman priest. Some
of these are still living. Finally We appointed as Secretary of this
Congregation Master Niccolo Antonelli, Our domestic prelate. All of
these men were obliged to deal with the matters submitted to their
judgment. This they did diligently for an entire ten years.

At the start a dispute arose as to the method to be followed in the
investigating-some judging that the forms of the Sacraments should be
examined first, while others urged that matters relating to the duty of
simple priests should be dealt with separately from those pertaining to
bishops. We removed this problem by commanding that the revision and
correction of the Euchologion should proceed in stages from the first
page to the following pages in the order in which the Euchologion
itself is arranged and printed. Finally We required the Secretary of
the Congregation to produce an agenda before every session, for timely
delivery not only to each of the Cardinals and Consultors who were to
meet but also to Us, since We wanted to know of every matter to be
discussed in the Congregation. In this agenda he was to list the
headings of the questions to be brought forward, and to add notes on
the considerations adduced and conclusions arrived at on these matters
in the Congregations of previous popes insofar as they had been dealt
with in former Congregations, followed by opinions on these questions
from theological authors and ecclesiastical records.

Secretary of the Congregation

5. It was unnecessary, as one would expect, to advise the Secretary on
the subject of examining and comparing old Euchologia. He is expert in
the Greek language, outstanding in sacred learning and teaching, and
ready to undertake any great labor in obedience to and for the benefit
of the Apostolic See; he has often shown this on other occasions when
affairs demanded it, and also by zealously publishing books.

Everyone is aware that Father Jacobus Goarius of the Order of
Preachers, a Frenchman by race, spent eight years in eastern parts
examining all matters closely, and then came to Rome about 1640. There
he conferred at length with outstanding scholars and experts in Greek
affairs; with Leo Allatius, a Prelate of the Roman Curia; Basilio
Falasca, Procurator General of the Order of St. Basil; Giorgio Coresio;
and Pantaleone Ligaridio. Fr. Echardus records this in De scriptoribus
Ordinis Praedicatorum (vol. 2, p. 574). Finally he returned to France
and published the Greek Euchologion together with a Latin translation.
The excellence of this work is enhanced by the careful learning with
which the author examined and evaluated many manuscript codices and
printed books, and criticized them in his Preface to the Reader. He
added variant readings everywhere and occasionally inserted appropriate
and learned notes. He first published that work at Paris in the year of
the Lord 1647. It was reprinted at Venice in 1739.

Importance of Extant Manuscripts of Old

6. Men of learning are also aware that several manuscript examples of
the Greek Euchologion are preserved in the Vatican library, and that
the Library of the Barberini has the famous Euchologium Barberinum S.
Marci, so called because it was brought there long ago from the
monastery of St. Mark at Florence. They know that this is more than ten
centuries old, since Leo Allatius testified that already in his day it
was considered to be more than nine hundred years old by the greatest
experts of his time: "The Barberini codex surpasses all the others in
point of antiquity. It is a most accurate copy in square letters on
parchment and was written more than nine hundred years ago in the
opinion of those who are considered foremost in judging these matters."
Learned men must also know of the precious codex preserved in the
archive of the monastery of Grottaferrata which is called the
Euchologium Patriarchale. It was left to the monks of that abbey by the
will of the great Cardinal Besscion, who was the first Commendatory
Abbot of that monastery. He always regarded it very highly since he had
received it as a gift from Cardinal Giuliano Cesarino, who had in turn
been given it at the Council of Florence by the Cretan priest Georgius
Varj, as Arcudius testifies. All these copies of the Euchologion have
been examined and critically compared as a guide to accuracy and
soundness in the new edition of the Euchologion. This work was done
both by the prelate who is Secretary and by other members of the
Congregation who are skilled in Greek usage. Moreover there was no need
for Us to advise this measure, since they themselves of their own
accord undertook this trouble and performed it with great care.

7. Likewise We did not need to remind the learned Cardinals and
Consultors in the Congrgation of those wise remarks of the renowned
Joannes Morinus in the preface to his work De Sacris Ordinibus, of
Lukas Holstein in his in Dissertatione 1, de Sacramento Confirmationis,
and finally of the author of the Vindiciarum P. le Brun where he writes
on the form of the Sacrament of the Eucharist. These remarks should be
certainly kept in mind if one desires to judge the Greek rites
correctly. For it would of course be unjust, mistaken, and opposed to
the peace and unity of the Church to make judgments concerning the
Greek Rites solely on the basis of a knowledge of the Latin Rituals and
what is reported by some of our writers. Even though they are expert in
our practices, they are uninstructed in Greek customs, and do not know
how the Apostolic See has always regarded them. So they unhesitatingly
condemn everything in the sacred Greek rites which they discover to be
dissimilar and not in agreement with the Latin rite.

As We say, there was no need to remind the Cardinals and Consultors
selected for the correction of the Euchologion of these matters, since
they had already themselves decided on this method of action and
judgment and had thoroughly followed it. We acknowledge that this was
also done by the cardinals and prelates who gave their opinion in the
Congregations which met on this subject under Urban VIII. All the
measures which We insisted on, as mentioned above, were fully
implemented and the unceasing care and effort expended by all the
members of the Congregation in completing the work cannot be
sufficiently emphasized. Not only did the Secretary show Us the agenda
before each of their sessions, but also after each session he carefully
reported to Us the statements and resolutions of the Congregation. We
read them all attentively and after due consideration approved and
confirmed them insofar as it seemed expedient to do so. By keeping to
this method the correction of the Euchologion was completed and the new
edition of it was printed in 1754, at the press of the Congregation for
the Propagation of the Faith. We were desirous of bringing these
matters to your attention to acquaint you with the great zeal, toil,
and care which were devoted to the publication of the corrected edition
of your Euchologion.

Four Admonitions

8. At the beginning of this most recent edition four admonitions are to
be found. We want to explain briefly to you in this letter the reasons
for the presence of these remarks.

First Admonition-Commemoration of Pontiff in the Mass

9. The first admonition is thus expressed: "It must be known that the
priests who will use the Euchologion should be acquainted with the
ecclesiastical canons of the holy Fathers and the Constitutions of the
Catholic Church in order that they may avoid obvious mistakes in
administering the divine Sacraments and performing their other duties.
Therefore where commemorations are customarily made in the sacred
liturgy, the Roman Pontiff should be first commemorated, then one's own
bishop and patriarch, provided they are Catholic. But if either or both
of them are schismatic or heretic they should by no means be
commemorated." Certainly this is in full agreement with the decrees
passed at the meeting of the Congregation on May 1, 1746, which We
approved and confirmed. The following question was raised at that
meeting: "whether the name of the supreme pontiff should be put into
the prayers said by priest and deacon at the Offertory as well as in
the other prayers, that is, For the supreme pontiff N." This response
was given to that question: "In the instruction which is to be added at
the start of the Euchologion, Greek priests should be advised to make a
commemoration of the supreme pontiff and of their bishop or archbishop
if he is in union with the Roman Catholic Church, and moreover a rubric
should be put in the margin of the Liturgy referring them to the
instruction." For it seemed best to add in this manner such matter as
was missed in the text of the Euchologion itself.

This Practice is Long-Standing

10. We have Ourselves dealt with the commemoration of the Roman pontiff
in the sacrifice of the Mass, and with the antiquity of this practice
in Our treatise De Sacrificio Missae, sect. I, n. 219. But since the
publication of this book, the same subject has been treated with many
extraordinary observations by Dominicus Georgius (who in his lifetime
was Our dear sacristan) in his De Liturgia Romani Pontificis, vol. 3,
chap. 3, no. 14, where he writes: "It has ever been customary in the
Catholic Church to recite the name of the Roman pontiff during the
sacred mysteries." In no. 22 he adds: "All the ancient testimonies and
the oldest copies of the sacred canon agree concerning the name of the
supreme pontiff." Indeed, that such a commemoration had been made in
the Mass is shown by the Ambrosian Liturgy, the Mozarabic Mass, and the
Latin Mass which the Lutheran Flaccus Illyricus copied from one ancient
manuscript and published. So also does the most ancient Liturgy which
is found in the old manuscript on the Sacraments of the Roman Church
which was published by Venerable Cardinal Thomasius. Finally, this is
also shown in all the sacred canons of the Mass, whether printed or
written by hand, as the prelate Niccolo Antonelli amply shows in the
long and learned dissertation which he wrote as a necessary part of his
duty as Secretary of the Congregation for the Correction of the
Euchologion; he had it printed when a dispute on this subject arose
among the Cardinals and Consultors. A reprint of this can also be I
found in the Appendix to the old Lateran Monastic Missal in the
Collectio Liturgica, vol. 1, made by Fr. Emanuele de Azevedo.

11. So far the testimonies mentioned relate to the Latin Church. As
regards the Greek Church, Cardinal Bona says that it is not known
whether in the early centuries it recalled the Roman pontiff in the
sacrifice of the Mass: "But whether in the first centuries Orthodox
Greece commemorated the Roman pontiff is unclear" (Rer. Liturgicar, bk.
2, chap. 11, no. 3). Moreover Isaac Habertus admits that among the
records of the early age, he has found none to establish that it was
customary in the Oriental Church to commemorate the Roman pontiff
during the celebration of Mass: "I could wish it was done and if it had
been done I would approve of it, but even so I do not read that it was
done." But he says that the name of the Roman Pontiff had been added to
that of the Patriarch in the time of Pope Nicholas I, that is about
858, since the following words are found in several ancient copies of
the Holy Liturgy of John Chrysostom: "Long be the days of most holy
Nicholas the universal pope" (Observationes ad Pontificale Graecorum,
pt. 8, observ. 12).

But Antonelli, whom We have praised, argues in his dissertation that it
was customary in the Greek Church to commemorate the Roman Pontiff
during Mass long before the period assigned by Habertus. He proves his
point especially by the fact reported by Nicephorus in his in Historia
Ecclesiast., bk. 16, chap. 17, where he depends on the testimony of a
more ancient and serious historian, Basilius Cilix. Acacius, bishop of
Constantinople, a supporter of the Eutychian heresy, prevailed on the
emperor Zeno to publish his ill-fated edict, the Henoticon, which
rendered void the definition of the holy Council of Chalcedon which
opposed the heresy of Eutyches. When Pope Felix III could not ignore
this and therefore deprived Acacius of communion, he had the audacity
in the year of the Lord 484 to erase the name of the Roman pontiff
Felix from the sacred diptychs in a new and hitherto unheard-of excess
of rashness. For this reason the memory of Acacius was then condemned.
The Greek church accepted this condemnation in the time of Pope
Hormisdas and Emperor Justin, although the two predecessors of
Hormisdas, Anastasius 11 and Symmachus, had failed to win this
acceptance. So in the great church of Constantinople (whose example was
doubtless followed by the other lesser churches of the east) the name
of the Roman pontiff was in the sacred diptychs; therefore it must be
asserted that he was prayed for by name during the celebration of
Masses. Acacius is described as the first to erase this name and his
deed was on this account particularly punished since, without any
precedent, he committed a new sort of outrage till then unheard of,
even though in former times there had been no lack of offense and
disagreements between the Roman pontiffs and the bishops of the
imperial city. It is thus abundantly proved that long before the time
of Acacius and so in the early centuries, the name of the Roman pontiff
was written in the sacred diptychs of the Greeks and thus it was
customary to pray for him during the celebration of Mass.

But however it may be with this disputed point of ecclesiastical
learning, it suffices Us to be able to state that a commemoration of
the supreme pontiff and prayers offered for him during the sacrifice of
the Mass is considered, and really is, an affirmative indication which
recognizes him as the head of the Church, the vicar of Christ, and the
successor of blessed Peter, and is the profession of a mind and will
which firmly espouses Catholic unity. This was rightly noticed by
Christianus Lupus in his work on the Councils: "This commemoration is
the chief and most glorious form of communion" (tome 4, p. 422,
Brussels edition). This view is not merely approved by the authority of
Ivo of Flaviniaca who writes: "Whosoever does not pronounce the name of
the Apostolic one in the canon for whatever reason should realize that
he is separated from the communion of the whole world" (Chronicle, p.
228); or by the authority of the famous Alcuin: "It is generally agreed
that those who do not for any reason recall the memory of the Apostolic
pontiff in the course of the sacred mysteries according to custom are,
as the blessed Pelagius teaches, separated from the communion of the
entire world" (de Divinis Officiis, bk. 1, chap. 12).

Pope Pelagius II who held the Apostolic See in the sixth century of the
Church gives this weightier statement on Our present subject in his
letter: "I am greatly astonished at your separation from the rest of
the Church and I cannot equably endure it. For Augustine, mindful that
the Lord established the foundation of the Church on the Apostolic
sees, says that whosoever removes himself from the authority and
communion of the prelates of those sees is in schism. He states plainly
that there is no church apart from one which is firmly established on
the pontifical bases of the Apostolic sees. Thus how can you believe
that you are not separated from the communion of the whole world if you
do not commemorate my name during the sacred mysteries, according to
custom? For you see that the strength of the Apostolic See resides in
me, despite my unworthiness, through episcopal succession at the
present time" (Labbe, Conciliorum Collectione, vol. 5, col. 794f and
810). This letter of Pelagius has also been used by St. Agobard, the
great archbishop of Lyons, in his treatise De comparatione utriusque
regiminis. This is printed in the in Magna Bibliotheca Patrum (vol. 14,
p. 315, no. 21, Lyons) and was reissued by Balutius with other writings
of this saint (col. 2, p. 49).

13. Moreover it suffices Us to be able to affirm without peril that at
whatever time the practice of praying by name for the Roman pontiff at
Mass was finally accepted by the Greek Church, this practice was
definitely in force in Greek churches many centuries before schism
broke out, and was only broken off after the fatal separation. A letter
dated 1053 of Peter, patriarch of Antioch, to Michael Cerularius, the
well-known reviver of the Photian schism, survives. This letter is
published in Greek and Latin by Joannes Baptista Cotelerius in the
second volume of his Monument. Eccles. Graec. Michael had said that he
was surprised that Peter of Antioch himself as well as the bishops of
Alexandria and Jerusalem mentioned the Roman pontiff in the sacred
diptychs (p. 140 of the above-mentioned volume). But Peter most sharply
rebuked the rashness of the maddened man in showing that both at
Antioch and at Constantinople, the commemoration of the Roman pontiff
had never been omitted up to his time: "Of these matters I too am an
unexceptionable witness, as are the many others who with me hold high
office in the Church, that in the time of Lord John (patriarch of
Antioch), the Pope at Rome, also called John, was included in the
sacred diptychs. Furthermore, when I came to Constantinople forty-five
years ago I found that under Patriarch Sergius the Pope was mentioned
at holy Mass along with the other Patriarchs."

It is said in addition that no discussions on restoring unity were ever
begun without the acceptance of the prior condition that the
commemoration of the Roman pontiff should be included in the sacred
liturgy, nor was a union which had been agreed on regarded as complete
until the previous condition had actually been put into effect. The
clear result of all this is that the Latin and Greek churches agree in
recognizing and affirming that the commemoration implies a profession
of due subjection to the Roman pontiff as head of the Church, and of a
willingness to remain in the unity of the Church. On the other hand the
omission of this commemoration signifies the intention of steadfastly
espousing schism.

14. When Michael Palaeologus, Emperor of Constantinople, in 1263 and
thereafter, affirmed his desire to return in company with his Greek
subjects to unity and concord with the Roman Church, Urban IV aptly
proposed the condition "that in sacred ceremonies from the diptychs,
the name of the Pope should be commemorated together with the four
patriarchs" (Nicetas, bk. 5, chap. 2). And when thereafter the
negotiation of this union was again undertaken by Emperor Michael and
Patriarch Giovanni Vecco and was seriously debated at the General
Council of Lyons held in the year of the Lord 1274, the Pope, Blessed
Gregory X, with the agreement of the assembled council fathers, first
proposed several indispensable conditions for the effective negotiation
of union. The first of these was "that the Pope be included in the
diptych with the other four patriarchs and commemorated during the holy
services" (Nicetas, as above). And Pachymeres (bk. 5, chap. 22)
testifies that this condition was accepted by the Greeks and carried
out in practice: "There were two immediate results of this arrival of
the ambassadors who brought back word that peace had been made on the
strength of the previous agreements: the deposition of the Patriarch
and the public commemoration of the Pope in holy services."

15. His son Andronicus succeeded Michael Palaeologus as emperor, and
was so extreme a supporter of the schism which had been condemned that
he allowed his father's body to be buried beyond the sacred precinct
because he had attempted to establish a union of the Greek Church with
the Latin. Because the emperor could hardly hope for success in his
intended revival of the schism while the Catholic patriarch, Giovanni
Vecco, was leader of the church at Constantinople, he imposed as
patriarch a certain Joseph who was tainted with the stain of heresy. As
a result affairs began to deteriorate and a sincere reconciliation of
the churches was no longer possible. Finally, at the meeting of the
General Council of Ferrara, later transferred to Florence, in the year
1434, after proper deliberations of the issues by the Greek and Latin
fathers, the wall of division was cast down which had for so long kept
the one church apart from the other. To attest to everyone the reality
of the enacted union John Palaeologus, emperor of the Greeks, gave
orders that the name of the Pope be replaced in the sacred diptychs, as
is testified even by the schismatic author Sylvester Sguropolus in his
Historia Concilii Flor., sess. 10. chap. 2. Afterwards when the decree
of established union had been brought to Philotheus, patriarch of
Alexandria, he was careful to state in his answer to Pope Eugenius IV
that he had also decided that the commemoration of the Roman pontiff in
the sacrifice of the Mass should be placed before that of the other
patriarchs: "Hence in company with our Egyptian bishops and other
clergy, we decided that everywhere in all of Christ's churches during
the sacrifice of the Mass, we should commemorate Your Blessedness
before the other Patriarchs, as is provided for in the sacred canons."
This passage may be found in the collection of the transactions of the
Council of Florence made by Cardinal Justinianus (pt. 2, collect. 22,
p. 323).

16. Constantine was the Greek emperor after John Palaeologus. When he
sent ambassadors to Nicholas V to beseech help for his faltering
fortunes, he was careful to profess that he would make every effort to
implement as fully as could be desired the harmony which was agreed on
at Florence, and that consequently he would see to it that the name of
the Roman pontiff was restored to the sacred diptychs. This is attested
by Ducas in his Historia Byzantina: The emperor had already sent to
Rome to request reinforcements with the additional purpose of
strengthening the harmony achieved at Florence and of having the Pope's
name proclaimed from the sacred diptychs during the liturgies of the
great church." The Pope showed himself ready to give him as much aid as
he could and continued at the same time to exhort him to promulgate the
decree of the union which had been agreed on at the Council of
Florence. He urged him to see to it that the name of the Roman pontiff
"was proclaimed in the diptychs and that the whole Greek church prayed
for him expressly and by name, as was the former practice of men who
were pleasing to God, both patriarchs of Constantinople and emperors"
(Raynaldus, Annales, 1451 A.D., no. 2).

17. This is all We want to say on the first part of the first
Admonition which deals with the obligation of celebrants to pray for
the pope in the sacrifice of the Mass. Nothing further is to be added
except that even before this Admonition, Catholic Greek Oriental
bishops were careful to decree this very measure in their synods. We
Ourselves did not neglect the publication of such suitable decrees for
Italian Greeks. In 1720, a provincial synod was held at Zamoscia on the
order of Pope Clement XI, under the presidency of Hieronymus Grimaldus.
He was then the archbishop of Edessa and nuncio of the Apostolic See in
the kingdom of Poland; later, he was raised to the honor of the
Cardinalate by Pope Clement XII. In the decrees of this synod, which
were confirmed after proper investigation by Pope Benedict XIII, the
following words are found under the heading de fide Catholica: "For the
same reason" - that is, to remove all suspicion of schism - "and to
show a sincere union of the members with their head, it has decided and
commanded under penalties to be applied at the judgment of the Ordinary
that wherever a Roman pontiff is to be commemorated, especially at the
Offertory of the Mass, it should be made in clear and definite words
which can signify none other than the universal Bishop of Rome."

In agreement with this view are the fathers of the Synod of Lebanon
which occurred in 1736 under the presidency of Joseph Simonius
Assemanus, a prelate of the Roman curia and an Apostolic envoy. In the
decrees of this council too, under the heading de Symbolo Fidei,
ejusque professione, no. 12, these words are found: "Let us not neglect
to repeat the commemoration of the most holy Roman pontiff, both in
Masses and in the divine services, before the name of the most reverend
lord patriarch, as has hitherto been our custom." After the strictest
investigation, We confirmed this council with Apostolic authority, as
may be seen in Our constitution Singularis (Bullarium, vol. I, no. 31).
Peter Arcudius in his work de Concordia Ecclesiae Occidentalis et
Orientalis, bk. 2, chap. 39, offers an admonition for Latin bishops
with Greeks living in their dioceses to zealously impel them to
commemorate the Roman pontiff in the Mass, to banish the last shade of
suspicion of any inclination to schism: "The Latin bishops should see
to it that the Greek priests subject to them are in Catholic unity and
recognize the Supreme Pastor, and according to the ancient custom
solemnly pray for him" in the sacrifice of the Mass - the subject under
discussion in this passage. In agreement with this most just
admonition, the following provision was made in Our constitution issued
for the Italian Greeks, Etsi Pastoralis (Bullarium, vol. 1, 57, sect.
9, no. 4): "Next a commemoration should be made of the Supreme Roman
Pontiff and of the Local Ordinary in Masses and divine services."

First Admonition-Commemoration of Bishop and Patriarch

18. Now follows the second part of this first admonition which, as was
mentioned above, obliges the Greek priest during Mass, after praying
for the Roman pontiff, to pray for his own bishop and his patriarch if
they are Catholic. For if either is or both are schismatic or heretic,
a commemoration should not be made.

19. In the Latin Church there is usually no difficulty in commemorating
the bishop in whose diocese the priest celebrates Mass. We Ourselves
have dealt with this subject in Our work de Sacrificio Missae (sect. 1,
no. 220 in the Latin edition) and have shown that the priest who
celebrates Mass in any diocese should commemorate the bishop of that
diocese rather than the bishop in whose diocese he was ordained or the
one to whose Ordinary jurisdiction he is subject. We added that it was
not permissible for regular clergy to commemorate their Superior
General or for other priests to commemorate during Mass any lesser
prelate of a separate territory to whom they are subject. For this
honor is to be conferred only on the superior or prelate who possesses
the episcopal authority and order. In that work We adduced the writings
of the men who transmit to us all these matters and establish them by
their testimony. So at this point We will add no more except to quote
the remarks of the above-mentioned Dominicus Georgius in his treatise
De Liturgia Romani Pontificis in which he studied many ancient
manuscripts, which has appeared since the publication of Our work:
"Nearly all the most ancient copies of the sacred canon of the Mass
note the name of the bishop after the Roman Pontiff as is attested by
Florus and the more ancient writers on the Mass whom We give in an
appendix" (Op. cit., vol. 3, chap. 3, no. 23, p. 52).

20. Still in reference to the Latin practice, We will also note that
when a bishop is celebrating Mass, he prays for himself as an "unworthy
servant." This practice is in harmony with the words of the apostolic
constitutions where the celebrant, after praying for others, prays for
himself in these words: "We now beseech you for a man of no worth, for
myself who am offering to You" etc. (Ap. Const., bk. 8, in Cotelerius,
Opera Patrum Apostolicorum, vol. 1, p. 407). Moreover it should be
known that in Rome commemoration is made only of the Roman Pontiff
since he is not only Supreme Pontiff, but also the bishop of the city
of Rome in particular. When the Pope himself says Mass, he prays for
himself in precisely the same way as any bishop prays for himself
during Mass. In reply to the bishop of Orense who enquired how the Pope
commemorated himself during the celebration of Mass, Innocent III, in a
letter not yet published but preserved in the Vatican archives (bk. 9,
no. 33) replied as follows: "You have also asked to be instructed as to
the words used by the Roman Pontiff at the place in the canon of the
Mass where a priest of lower rank says 'together with our Pope,' since
the Pope is then obviously praying for himself and is subordinate to no
bishop. Our reply to your devotedness is this: at that place We say
'together with me your unworthy servant.'"

Finally it must be remarked that Latin priests make no commemoration of
an archbishop such as a metropolitan in the canon. This point is also
rightly made by P. Merati in his Commentaria ad Gavantum (pt. 2, head.
8, no. 5) and the case is the same even if the episcopal see is vacant:
"But if the bishop, who is Ordinary of the place in which Mass is being
celebrated, has departed this life, the aforesaid words are omitted" -
that is, a commemoration is not made - "but it is to be noticed that
the Vicar Capitular cannot be named instead of the bishop, since
although while the see is vacant he is Ordinary of that place, he is
still not the bishop of that diocese. Moreover, the archbishop or the
patriarch of the province which includes the diocese of the dead bishop
cannot be named, even though he has a certain jurisdiction over it,
since an archbishop or a patriarch is not said to be Ordinary in the
dioceses of his suffragans."

21. Turning now to the Greeks, We consider first the Italian Greeks.
These are entirely subject to the jurisdiction of the Latin bishop in
whose diocese they live, in accordance with constitution 74, Romanus
Pontifex, of Our predecessor, Pope Pius IV. This is to be found in
volume two of the Bullar. Rom. and We have discussed it at length in
Our treatise De Synodo Dioecesana, bk. 2, chap. 12, of the most recent
Roman edition. Therefore these Italian Greek priests, in offering the
sacrifice of the Mass, are required to follow the Latin practice and
commemorate the Roman Pontiff and the local bishop. They should never
commemorate eastern bishops or patriarchs even if they are Catholic,
since these possess no jurisdiction in Italy and the adjacent islands,
as has been discussed in Our constitution Etsi Pastoralis (Bullarium,
vol. 1, const. 57, sect. 9 no. 4).

Of course in the Dictatus of Pope St. Gregory VII (can. 10) we find the
dictum: "That the name of the Pope alone be pronounced in the church."
This Dictatus is included in the collections of the councils (Royal
Parisian, vol. 26; Labbe, vol. 6, pt. 1). Still We are well aware that
there is a vigorous debate among scholars as to whether this is an
authentic work of the holy pontiff or rather a forgery. Indeed Fr.
Mabillon in his treatise De Studiis Monasticis has ranked this among
the more difficult questions which professors of Church history can
engage in solving. But laying aside this problem also - as to whether
the Dictatus Papae is an authentic work of St. Gregory VII - the real
and pertinent meaning of the Canon quoted is not that in the Latin
Church the name of the diocesan bishop be removed from the Canon of the
Mass, but that the name of Oriental Patriarchs should not be included
there.

The Patriarchs indeed professed their agreement with the condition,
that the name of the Roman Pontiff should be replaced in the Liturgy
and that prayers should be offered for him in all the churches of the
east, if in turn the Pope would consent to their names being pronounced
in the Canon of the Mass by Latin priests of the Roman Church and of
the other churches in the Patriarchate of Rome. Lupus wisely notes:
"Purposing to abandon his schism, Michael (Cerularius, Patriarch of
Constantinople) tried to have his name inscribed on the Roman tablets
and he promised to restore the name of the Pope to the tablets of all
of his churches. But Leo (Pope Leo IX) would not consent: for the
reciprocal pronouncement of the names of Patriarchs was practiced only
among the equal sister sees of the eastern patriarchs, but never by the
Roman see. For this see is not only sister but also mother and head of
the eastern sees and so has never pronounced any other name than the
bishops" (ad Concilia, pt. 4, p. 437, Brussels edition). He continues
in this way on the following page: "The names of the eastern patriarchs
have never been pronounced by the Roman church nor for that matter by
any Latin church."

22. The foregoing discussion relates to the Italian Greeks. But as
regards the rest of the Greeks and Orientals, the admonition in the
preface of the Euchologion, which We are now considering, by no means
prevents them from commemorating their metropolitans and patriarchs
during the Mass, but merely forbids this if they should be schismatic
or heretic. It is beyond dispute that the commemoration of patriarchs
in the prayers of the Mass is an ancient custom in the Greek church.
Theodorus Balsamon in his de Patriarcharum juribus has written: "It is
established that in every church of God, whether on the Euphrates or on
the edge of the Ocean, the names of the patriarchs are mentioned
together." Goarius cites this as the established practice that in the
Greek liturgy the priest prays for all the bishops and for the
metropolitan (in Notis ad Rituale Graecorum, p. 63). Meratus, after
establishing the fact that We mentioned earlier, that in the Latin
church a commemoration of the archbishop is not made in the Mass even
during a vacancy in a suffragan church, adds that: "This however is not
the practice of the Greeks and other Orientals. These name the
patriarch and the metropolitan" (in notis ad Gavantum, vol. 1, p. 539,
Roman edition).

This practice is not absolutely forbidden to them in the admonition in
question, but only in the cases when the metropolitan or patriarch is
schismatic or heretic. This is in accordance with rules which were
established and accepted before the correction of the Euchologion was
undertaken. When this practice was dealt with in the Congregation of
the Holy Office in 1673, the following decree was published: "At the
General Congregation of the Holy Office on June 7, 1673, the question
was posed whether a priest in the town of Lebanon during Mass might
name the patriarch of the Armenians, who is schismatic, with the
purpose of praying for him. The petition for this concession was made
with great urgency in order by this means to attract that people to a
greater friendship for the Latins. The Sacred Congregation responded
that it could not be done and should be utterly forbidden. In the same
Congregation on June 20, 1674, there was read a letter of the nuncio at
Florence written on April 10, 1674, sent to the Sacred Congregation for
the Propagation of the Faith and forwarded by this Congregation to the
Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office. It was decided that a reply
should be sent to the nuncio informing him that on the subject of
prayer in the liturgy for the patriarch of the Armenians, the Sacred
Congregation abided by its decrees published in 1673, that is, that it
could not be done and should be utterly forbidden."

23. In harmony with this decision is another very similar decree of the
Congregation on the corrected edition of the Coptic Missal made in
1732. Among other disputed questions the following was proposed:
"Whether, and in what way, the words in which the priest commemorates
the patriarch, bishop, etc. are to be corrected." This was the answer
which was given: "A rubric should be placed at the beginning of the
missal to advise and inform the priest on points relating to the
celebration of Mass. Here should be placed a special rubric on the
commemoration of the Roman pontiff as well as of the patriarch and
bishop, provided that they are in union with the Roman Church. This
rubric should be consulted in its own place." Moreover heretics and
schismatics are subject to the censure of major excommunication by the
law of Can. de Ligur. 23, quest. 5, and Can. Nulli, 5, dist. 19. But
the sacred canons of the Church forbid public prayer for the
excommunicated as can be seen in chap. A nobis, 2, and chap. Sacris on
the sentence of excommunication. Though this does not forbid prayer for
their conversion, still such prayer must not take the form of
proclaiming their names in the solemn prayer during the sacrifice of
the Mass. This fully accords with the ancient practice, as may be seen
in Estius in 4. Sententiar., dist. 12, sec. 15. For that purpose it is
sufficient to beseech to lead back the wanderers to the way of
salvation and to the bosom of holy Mother Church, as is expounded by
Sylvius, in 3. part. D. Thomae, vol. 4, quest. 83, art. 1, qu. 9.

Here is the teaching of St. Thomas himself in 4. Sent., dist. 18,
quest. 2, art. 1, in answer to the first difficulty: "Prayer can be
offered for the excommunicated, although this should be done apart from
prayers which are offered for members of the Church." This does not
necessarily involve a confusion of the Church's laws which exclude from
the roster of its faithful followers the names of those who have cut
themselves off from it. In forbidding public prayers to be offered for
them, the Church definitely rules out commemorating them in the
celebration of Mass. Very relevant is the view of Ven. Card.
Bellarmine: "Someone will ask whether at the present time it is
permissible to offer the sacrifice of the Mass for the conversion of
heretics or the infidels. The reason for doubt is that the entire
liturgy of the Latin church, as it is now performed, relates to the
faithful, as is clear from the prayers of the offertory both before and
during the canon. I answer that I consider it permissible, provided
that no addition is made to the Mass, but the sacrifice is applied to
the conversion of the infidels or heretics only by the intention of the
priest. For this is the practice of pious and learned men, with whom we
cannot disagree, and it is not forbidden by the Church"
(Controversarium, vol. 3, bk. 6, de Missae, chap. 6).

Should the King be Commemorated?

24. In this first admonition, however, there is no mention at all of
commemorating or saying a prayer for an emperor or king and his whole
palace and army. But since this matter is very closely connected with
the other matters mentioned in the first admonition, We judge it
appropriate to append the following remarks.

25. All the euchologies, whether manuscript or printed, which are
earlier than the revision of Leontius, included prayers for the
emperor, the king, his palace, and army. In the May 1, 1746, session of
the Congregation for the Correction of the Euchologion, it was disputed
whether these prayers should be removed. It was decided, with Our
subsequent approval, that "they should be left in the canon or the
liturgy." But since the Greeks of old used to offer these prayers at
the prothesis as well, but later removed them, it was added that "they
are not to be said during the prothesis or preparation." For it seemed
pointless to say such prayers at the prothesis when they were already
being said in the canon, or liturgy." The newly corrected edition of
the Euchologion has treated the matter in just this way.

26. We Ourselves in Our treatise de Sacrificio Missae, sect. 1, no.
221, have already discussed the commemoration in the canon of the
emperor or king, as is customary in some districts belonging to their
temporal realm. Cardinal Bona provides evidence that in many Latin
churches the name of the king is commemorated in the canon (Rer.
Liturgicar. bk. 2, chap. 11, no. 4). Furthermore Martene in his work de
antiquis Ecclesiae Ritibus, bk. 1, chap. 4, art. 8, no. 9, after
adducing the appropriate evidence, comes to the following conclusion:
"From the unchanging tradition of the Church as it was received from
the Apostles, it is certain that prayers for kings and princes have
always been offered during the sacred mysteries." It is quite evident
that the writer is here relying on the words of the Apostle (1 Tm 2)
commanding that prayers and petitions be made for kings and all who are
in high places, as well as on the text of the apostolic constitutions:
"We also beseech You, Lord, for the king and for those who are in high
places and for all the army that our affairs may prosper" and "Let us
pray for kings and those of exalted power that our affairs may enjoy
peace" (Cotelerius, Patrum Apostolicorum, col. 1, bk. 8, chap. 12 and
13). On this point Gregorius too may be consulted (de Liturgia Rom.
Pont., bk. 4, chap. 3, no. 4). However it may be with the dispute
conducted between Balutius and Lupus, on the date when the emperor's
name was replaced by that of the king in the lands subject to the sway
of kings (a question treated at great length by Lupus (can. 10,
Dictatus S. Greg. VII), it is sufficiently established that in the
Latin church a commemoration of the king is made in those districts in
which it has long been an accepted custom or where a concession of the
Apostolic See has allowed it, as Meratus remarks (ad Gavantum, vol. 1,
pt. 1, p. 539, no. 6 of the Roman edition).

27. But among the Oriental peoples this practice of commemorating the
king in the sacred liturgy is common, as may be seen in the Liturgies
of the Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians and Syrians. But if it should be
asked how it can be endured where it is certain that the kings for whom
they pray and whom they commemorate in the liturgy are infidels, Ven.
Card. Bellarmine would reply (as in fact he replied in the chapter
quoted above) that it is by no means forbidden by the nature of the
object, as theologians say, to pray during Mass even for infidels since
the sacrifice of the Cross has been offered for all men. And of course
St. Thomas teaches that although St. Augustine wrote in his work de
origine Animae that the sacrifice is offered only for those who are
members of Christ, his statement must be understood to include both
those who are already members of Christ and those who are able to
become such (in 4. Sentent., dist. 12, quest. 2, art. 2, quest. 2, to
the fourth). Therefore, the Cardinal adds that the whole question
should be assessed in terms of what the Church has forbidden: "It is
certain from the nature of the object that if the Church has not
prohibited it, it is permissible to offer prayers for those men (i.e.,
the infidels)." Although there is such a prohibition against the
excommunicated and so against heretics and schismatics, there is none
against infidels and these are not bound by excommunication. This is
enough, he says, to allow commemoration of them during Mass and even
the offering of the sacrifice for them in accordance with the evident
tradition in this matter and with the apostolic constitution. "But
someone may ask whether it is permissible if the king is an infidel as
in Greece, where the Turk is ruler, and as in India, Japan and China
where pagans rule, for priests there to offer prayers expressly for the
king. I answer that I consider it permissible provided that the king is
not excommunicated as are heretic kings, but is a pagan. For this
tradition, this constitution, is apostolic, as I showed just above. To
my knowledge there is no clear prohibition of this by the Church." A
useful addition to the present discussion is the text of Tertullian:
"We offer sacrifice for the health of the Emperor but we offer it to
our God and his in the prayerful way commanded by God. For God the
Creator of the whole world has no need of honor or of anyone's blood"
(ad Scapulam, chap. 2).

28. However, We may leave aside these statements without further
inquiry, since they are unnecessary for justifying the retention of the
commemoration of emperors or kings in the text of the Greek
Euchologion. But it is worth remarking that when Greek Catholics were
asked if, in making these commemorations they intended to offer prayers
for the Turks to whose temporal sovereignty they have been subject
since they were deprived of their own leaders, they answered that their
intention at all times was to pray for Orthodox kings and Christian
princes. This is asserted by Goarius in his in notis ad Euchologium, p.
38, where he says that when he asked Greek Catholics whether they
intended to include Turks in their prayers, they invariably replied
that they meant only our Christian kings, and that they proclaimed in
the churches as lords in faith and religion those whom they wanted as
rulers. For those alone they unfailingly desired to pray even when the
published books suppressed the prayers."

Second Admonition

29. The second of the admonitions in the preface of the new edition of
the Greek Euchologion is expressed as follows: "In addition the priest
in the sacred liturgy approaches the gifts while singing the glory of
God; raising these in a fitting religious manner above his head, he
carries them to the altar in a procession around and up through the
church. Meanwhile the people devoutly bow the head and kneel as they
pray that they may be remembered in this procession of the gifts. But
some of the faithful who kneel think these gifts are the Body and Blood
of Christ and adore them as such, perhaps because they confuse them
with the entry of the presanctified, that is when previously
consecrated bread is carried, and do not understand the difference
between the two carryings. The priest therefore should carefully teach
and inform all the faithful of the difference between these two
processions of the gifts, since in one case they have been changed and
sanctified by the word of God. These gifts should be worshipped and
adored most religiously since under the appearance and symbols of bread
and wine, they contain the Body and Blood of Christ. But the case is
different before they are consecrated and consummated."

The Greater Entrance

30. You already know well that your liturgy has two entrances, called
the smaller and the greater. The smaller entrance is when the book of
the holy Gospel is brought in, but the greater entrance is when the
unconsecrated gifts of bread and wine are carried to the holy altar
from the small altar or table known as the prothesis on which they were
prepared. Accordingly the second sentence of this admonition deals with
the greater, not with the smaller entrance. At the greater entrance,
the practice of this Rite is for either the deacon or the priest to
carry over his head the bread on a paten covered with a veil. The
deacon carries the bread when a solemn Mass is celebrated with a deacon
as assistant and minister. On such an occasion, he holds the paten with
the bread above his head with his left hand and with his right he
incenses the priest who is carrying the chalice with wine. When the
priest celebrates without a deacon, he is incensed by the lector while
he holds the paten with the bread over his head with his left hand and
with his right he carries the sacred chalice on a level with his
breast. It is at this greater entrance, then, that the people bow, or,
in accordance with the different customs of different districts,
prostrate themselves, and strike the ground with their foreheads just
as if the Body and Blood of Christ the Lord were contained under the
appearances of the bread and wine even before consecration. "The people
everywhere address and adore the King of Heaven as if He were present
in this offering; in Greece they bow very low but avoid bending the
knee so as not to appear to imitate the Latins even on weekdays; while
in Russia they prostrate themselves and strike the ground with their
foreheads" (Peter Arcudius, De Concordia Eccles. Occid. et Orient., bk.
3, chap. 19).

31. The rite of the greater entrance when a patriarch or a metropolitan
celebrates Mass is described by Christianus Lupus, Operum super
Conciliis, pt. 3, p. 760 of the Brussels edition. In his Vocabulario
Ecclesiastico under the word Prothesis, Magri describes in detail the
actions performed by the Emperor while standing at the sacred assembly
on the day of his coronation as emperor. Goarius explains most
carefully the complete ceremony of the greater entrance in his in notis
ad Liturgiam Sancti Joannis Chrysostomi, no. 110, as does Cardinal Bona
in Rer. Liturgic., bk. 2, chap. 9, no. 4. Everything done by the Greeks
on this occasion is likewise done by the Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians,
and Syrian Jacobites, as can be seen in Le Brun, Explanatione Missae,
vol. 3; in Chardon, Historia Sacramentorum, vol. 2, chap. 2; and in
Renaudot, vol. 1, on in notis ad Liturgiam Cophtorum. Why, even in the
city of Rome, on the feast of St. Athanasius, the Greeks may be seen in
their own church performing all the ceremonies We have reviewed above.
"And in this way even today the Greeks perform the liturgy on the feast
of St. Athanasius in his basilica in Rome" (Lupus, loc. cit.).

Adoration of Consecrated Hosts

32. You understand also that in accordance with your Rite during the
days of the Lenten fast, only the Mass of the Presanctified is
celebrated among you, except on Saturdays and Sundays and on the feast
of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary if it occurs in the
Lenten period as is specified in the Trullan Canon 52. "On all days of
the holy Lenten fast except on Saturday, Sunday, and the holy day of
the Annunciation, the sacred ministry of the Presanctified should take
place." As you already know, the priest who celebrates Mass in Lent on
the days when he is permitted to do so, that is on Saturday and Sunday,
consecrates and consumes one host but reserves another consecrated
host. He divides this into as many pieces as will suffice for the
number of Masses of the Presanctified which are to be celebrated on the
following days, at which he will give communion to himself and to the
other communicants, if there are any, from the Eucharistic bread which
was consecrated on the preceding days. This is how Leo Allatius rightly
describes the entire ceremony in the prolegomena to Gabriel Naud's de
Missa Praesanctificatorum, p. 1531, no. 1: "Each priest counts on his
fingers the days of the coming week on which he is going to celebrate,
then breaks off at the offertory as many pieces of bread as will
suffice for the Masses he is going to say. He consecrates these as well
as the piece he will consume on the same day and preserves in the pyx
the consecrated pieces after dipping them in the Lord's Blood, as is
customary. He removes a piece from the pyx at an appropriate time
later, when he is about to celebrate (leaving the others there for
future use), places it on the paten and, after bringing it to the
greater altar, he consumes it."

33. On this occasion likewise a solemn procession through the church is
made. The deacon carries above his head the sacred pyx in which is
contained the sacrament under the appearance of bread, while the priest
carries in his hands a chalice containing wine mixed with water which
has been blessed but not consecrated. If the priest celebrates alone -
since he does not always have the assistance of a deacon in saying Mass
- he carries the pyx in his left hand over his head and holds the
chalice in his right, proceeding in this way from the small to the
larger altar. This is stated by Arcudius in the work already mentioned,
bk. 3, chap. 58: "The Greeks have the custom in liturgies of the
Presanctified of placing the Sacrament on a paten on a small altar of
offering, and of pouring wine into a chalice without prayers before the
ceremony begins. Then about the middle of the Mass, the priest, if he
is celebrating alone, holds the paten above his head, takes the chalice
in his right hand, and brings them to the larger altar, etc. But if the
priest is celebrating this kind of Mass with the assistance of a
deacon, it is customary for him to give the paten with the Sacrament to
the deacon who carries it above his head, while he himself takes the
chalice and follows after the deacon." At that point the people bend
the knee, beat the breast, and adore the consecrated Bread carried by
the priest or by the deacon, as We have mentioned above.

It is claimed that this is why people offer the same reverence during
the greater entrance, when the bread and wine which are not yet
consecrated are carried through the church in a rite of supplication.
This is indeed the problem, and it is on the basis of this that
criticisms have been leveled against the greater entrance. Nicolas
Cabasilas writes: "If, however, there are some who prostrate themselves
on the ground when the priest enters with the gifts, and adore and
address these gifts as if they were the Body and Blood of Christ, these
people have been confused by the entrance of the presanctified gifts
and do not understand the difference between the two kinds of
sacrifice; for in the first kind the gifts are not sanctified and not
yet perfected at the entrance, while in the second kind they are
perfected and sanctified and are the Body and Blood of Christ" (in
Expositione Liturgiae, chap. 24). Later Arcudius gives this account:
"Therefore the people through not understanding the difference between
the two kinds of liturgy behave in the same way at ordinary and
presanctified liturgies. And so they make a serious mistake, since of
course when the priest carries the true Body of Christ on the paten at
liturgies of the Presanctified, it is right that they prostrate
themselves on the ground and adore it. But at sacrifices of the other
kind, they should behave with more restraint since the offertory in
these cases is made before the consecration" (Op. cit. bk. 3, chap.
19). In later chapters of this book, Arcudius refutes Gabriel,
Archbishop of Philadelphia, a voluminous defender of this rite. Even
Goarius, in the passage quoted above, considered it necessary to adduce
some appropriate arguments in defense of this rite.

The following passage occurs in the latest edition of a work called
Perpetuitas Fidei Catholicae de Sacramento Eucharistiae, adversus
Claudium vindicata, p. 68: that "the Greeks, far from not adoring the
sacrament of the Eucharist, are rather obliged to cleanse themselves,
thereby demonstrating that they do not pass beyond the limits of what
is right and do not honor still unconsecrated bread and wine with the
same acts of adoration as they use to reverence them after
consecration." Le Brun asserted without hesitation that the nature of
the rite called for some measure of reformation. In relating that he
observed with his own eyes the performance of this ceremony among the
Armenians, Tournefort (vol. 3, pp. 411f) expresses a certain
indignation. Chardon in the passage noted above cites from the writings
of Tournefort and Fr. Le Brun, but then leaves the point of the
question undecided. So the fathers of the council held at Zamosc in
1720, in their decree de celebratione Missarum, sect. 4, unhesitatingly
prohibited any genuflection or bowing of the head while still
unconsecrated bread and wine were being brought from the small altar to
the main altar. "The synod forbids all genuflection and bowing of the
head while the bread of oblation is being brought for consecration from
the smaller altar to the main altar during the period of the offertory.
It commands the parish priests to admonish the people on this matter,
to prevent their exposure to the danger of idolatry." In making this
decree, the fathers may have had in mind the incident related in 2
Kings 18 of Ezechiah, King of Judah, who broke the bronze snake made by
Moses because the children of Israel burned incense for it even up to
his time.

34. We were able to gather the preceding passages from the books which
have treated of this rite. Now We will add the opinions and decisions
regarding this rite which emerged both in the Congregations convened
under Urban VIII and in those which were held in Our days, whose
decrees We Ourselves subsequently approved.

35. It was first prudently observed that to abolish the ceremony of the
greater entrance (a course which incidentally would have put the blade
to the root, as the saying is) would be extremely odious to the Greek
church. It would also be inconsistent with the established practice of
the Latin church which had always tried to preserve as much as possible
the Greek rite in the Greek church. Such a course would be all the more
unacceptable because the ceremony is ancient. It is usually said in
explanation of this rite that it preserves an ancient custom in
reference to the triumphal entrance of Christ when He came from Bethany
to Jerusalem. Germanus, Patriarch of Constantinople, wrote on this very
subject: "For at that time on the human level a great crowd and the
children of the Hebrews sang a hymn as for a king and the conqueror of
death, but on the spiritual plane the angels with the cherubim rendered
the hymn, Thrice Holy." He then added that the smaller entrance
signifies the humble coming of the Son of God into this world.

36. In the second place, attention was directed to the difference
between the words sung during the transference of the presanctified and
those sung by the clergy during the procession of the greater entrance.
In the latter case the words are, "As men who are about to welcome the
king of all things," and these point not to a king who is present, but
to one who is to come hereafter. In the former case they omit the hymn
of the cherubim and repeat the following words: "Behold the mystical
and consummated sacrifice." So great is the difference that everyone,
even men of the slightest intelligence, can distinguish between the two
ceremonies. For in the transference of the Presanctified, Jesus Christ
is shown as present under the appearances of bread, while in the
ceremony of the greater entrance the same Lord is referred to, not as
present under the appearances of bread and wine, but as very soon to be
present after the words of consecration have been pronounced by the
priest.

External Acts of Adoration

37. Thirdly, it was considered that the Greeks who are learned in
religious matters understand fully that the Body and Blood of the Lord
are not yet present under the appearances of bread and wine during the
greater entrance. If they also know, as they surely must, that acts of
worship (latria) are due to God alone, no one can justly suspect that
they intend to offer worship to still unconsecrated species by the
external actions of veneration which they practice at the entrance of
the offerings. These same signs of external reverence are usually
offered at different times to the Creator and to created things. Thus
the holy Scriptures say that Abraham adored the angels, that Jacob more
than once prostrated himself before his brother Esau, and that the
prophet Nathan did likewise in the presence of David. The condemnation
of this Greek rite is unnecessary also because worship (latria) is not
constituted by external acts alone, but particularly by the inner
disposition of the mind which determines the external actions. Moreover
if the Greeks at the Mass of the Presanctified show reverence by the
same acts of external adoration to the bread which is consecrated and
at the same time to the wine contained in the chalice which is
admittedly not consecrated, they are not for this reason accused of
adoring with an equal act of worship the bread which has been
consecrated and the wine which has only been blessed in the Mass of the
Presanctified. This accusation is not made, of course, because external
actions are guided by the mind. Therefore in accordance with different
intentions, one and the same act can convey at one time the adoration
of worship, at another the implication of a lesser reverence.

This point sufficiently establishes that even if during the greater
entrance, in the presence of the still unconsecrated bread and wine,
the Greeks perform the same external acts of adoration as they are
accustomed to offer to the Eucharistic bread and consecrated chalice,
it cannot be asserted that they worship ordinary bread and
unconsecrated wine. For every action should be measured by the intent,
which can direct the same external actions after the consecration to
express an adoration of worship towards the Eucharistic Bread and Wine.
It can also exclude the act of worship from the performance of the same
actions before the consecration at the solemn entrance of the
offerings. So the following passage of Leo Allatius is relevant: "This
service is not called worship, which is due to Got alone, but it is
such as is demanded by the veneration of creatures. For a gesture of
external reverence such as uncovering the head, kissing the hands,
joining them in an attitude of supplication, stretching them out,
raising them on high and the like, as well as kneeling and prostrating
oneself on the ground, is offered not only in adoration of God but of
creatures too. No wrong is done in such cases provided that we mentally
distinguish God the Creator from the creation, and a more excellent
creature from a less excellent one. So through external gestures of the
body, service rendered to God in adoration is considered worship not on
account of the nature of these actions, but on account of the intention
which determines them, since otherwise in their mere nature they are
indifferent. For the inner will and intention of pleasing the divine
honor through these external actions makes these acts suitable for the
service of God, and allows the external adoration of Got to be
exercised through them" (Tractat. de Missa Praesanctificatorum, no. 8).

St. Thomas teaches as follows: "Adoration chiefly consists in an inner
reverence of God, but in a secondary way in certain bodily signs of
humility, just as we bend the knee to show how weak we are in
comparison with God and we prostrate ourselves to proclaim that, of
ourselves, we are nothing" (Summa Theol. 2.2, quest. 84, art. 82,
answer to the second). In explaining this teaching, Sylvius adds these
words: "It is fitting that adoration chiefly consist in an interior
reverence for God, but secondarily in certain bodily signs. This is
true, although there is hardly any bodily sign of reverence or service
which cannot be offered in homage to a creature as well as to God.
Consequently external acts of homage must be distinguished on the basis
of the intention of the offerer. For if he intends by an external mark
of reverence to offer an honor appropriate only to God and to honor Him
as supreme, then such a service will pertain to divine worship; but if
it is intended to offer reverence to an outstanding creature pleasing
to God, it will be an instance of the service of Dulia or Hyperdulia. I
said "hardly" since no doubt there is an external sacrifice which can
be offered only to God." Thus Sylvius states that the one outer sign
which necessarily implies a service of Latria is an external sacrifice
which is most definitely offered to God alone, as is shown at length by
St. Thomas too (Summa Theol. 2.2, quest. 85, art. 2). So we read in the
Acts of the Apostles that when the Laodiceans thought that Paul and
Barnabas were gods, they at once considered the need of offering
sacrifice to them.

Suarez hands on precisely the same doctrine: "External acts are not of
their own nature fixed to the extent that they cannot be performed both
to reverence God and to honor a creature, etc. Therefore, in these
external acts, the distinction of the Latria due to God alone from the
reverence of a creature depends chiefly on the inner intention" (in 3.
part. Divi Thomae, vol. 1, quest. 25, art. 2, disput. 61, sect. 4). The
same writer, it is true, adds a little later that it is not only the
agent's inner will which confers on an external act the nature of
divine reverence; the act can become such and be so considered if such
a meaning is assigned to it by one who has the requisite authority:
"Apart from inner intention a public imposition must be considered. For
if these signs are imposed by sufficient authority and power to signify
God and His service, they can only be used for the service of God. Then
if such service is imparted to creatures, it will be at least external
idolatry even if it does not proceed from the intention or arises from
a mistaken judgment." But this teaching can have no application to Our
present subject for there exists nowhere a decree of public authority
that the external acts described above as performed by the Greeks at
the procession through the church at the greater entrance must be
considered as acts and signs of a service of Latria.

38. Fourthly and finally, the Congregation for the Correction of the
Euchologion at its meeting on September 5, 1745, discussed the question
of whether the rite of the greater entrance which We have been
describing should be abolished or corrected. After full discussion, it
decided that no innovations should be made; we subsequently confirmed
this decision. No different, of course, were the opinions of the
Congregations which examined this very question in the time of Urban
VIII. However they advised that Bishops and others who have the care of
souls should be sure to teach the uninstructed laity that the Body and
Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ are not present under the appearances of
the sacred gifts while these are being carried in solemn rite from the
prothesis to the main altar, since they have not yet been consecrated.
Therefore, the extemal acts of reverence displayed towards the still
unconsecrated gifts are not performed to offer the service of Latria,
which is due to God alone, but to render a lesser service directed to
the approaching transubstantiation of those gifts into the Body and
Blood of the Lord.

A similar measure was employed by the fathers of the Council of Trent
when they discussed the veneration and service of sacred images. They
decided, that while no change should be made in the ancient practice of
the Church in this matter, it was incumbent on the bishops and on
others who teach to instruct the Christian people on the relevant
points (session 25, Decreto de invocatione, et veneratione, et
Reliquiis Sanctorum, et Sacris Immaginibus). With more immediate
relevance to Our subject, Goarius in the passage mentioned earlier
likewise advised that the rite of the greater entrance should not be
abrogated, but that the people should be taught with appropriate
proofs: "Certainly the faith of that simple people should be
instructed, but their devotion should never be quenched nor their
external cult wholly abolished." So too, Philipus de Carboneano in his
Appendix ad Tract. P. Antoine de Eucharistia, sect. 3, concludes that
"there are no grounds for blame in this case, but the simple people
should be taught not to reverence those gifts as the Body and Blood of
Christ."

But if you take this measure, as We are confident you shall, you will
wholly escape the accusation levelled by Arcudius at the Greek bishops
of his day. He stated that while the people then lived in the darkest
ignorance, the bishops could easily have cured their blindness by means
of appropriate teaching, if they had not refrained from undertaking
this task through fear of worldly censure. "The Greek bishops could and
should carefully advise the people, and if they worked together they
could achieve much. But perhaps they themselves are afflicted with the
same disease and live in the same error on account of their ignorance.
Or if some of them indeed understand, these few fear the majority
because they fear to lose earthly glory and human regard and they dread
that their name will be trodden underfoot by the mob like the
heretics'. And so they give an excellent imitation of the others'
error, at least outwardly, and they ignore these matters in deep
silence, pretending they do not exist. So the blind lead the blind and
they all fall into the ditch" (de Concordia, bk. 3, chap. 19).

39. Furthermore, before the celebrant carries the sacred gifts from the
small table to the main altar, he approaches the prothesis clad in the
sacred vestments and divides the bread for consecration into many
pieces. The large piece is offered to show due service to God who is
best and greatest, in remembrance of Our Savior Jesus Christ. The other
smaller pieces, called merides, are likewise offered to Almighty God,
but of these one is offered in honor of the glorious Virgin Mary,
Mother of God; another in honor of St. John the Baptist, the holy
Apostles, and the other saints whom the priest names; another for the
salvation of the living whose names are mentioned by the priest;
another for the dead who are likewise commemorated by name; another in
honor of the saint whose feast day is being celebrated. The priest may
still offer the Sacrifice especially for the person or persons of his
choice. That this rite of dividing the Bread into pieces is long
established is proved by Montfaucon's edition of the Typico of the
Empress Irene (Analect. Graecor. vol. 1, chap. 34). But if a bishop or
the priest who takes the part of the main celebrant concelebrates with
other priests, and deacons also assist as ministers in the service, not
only each priest but each deacon as well offers one larger host
together with the smaller merides. If at the end any of the smaller
pieces have not been consumed by the celebrant or celebrants, they are
distributed to those present who wish to receive holy communion. All
these matters are related in careful detail by Cardinal Bona, Rer.
Liturgicar, bk. 2, chap. 1, no. 7; Arcudius de Concordia, bk. 2, chap.
9; and Goarius, ad Rituale Graecorum, in notis ad Liturgiam S. Joannis
Chrys., p. 98f.

40. There is no dispute among Catholics about the rite of the large and
smaller hosts, called merides. For when this rite was examined at the
ecumenical council of Florence, it was noted in the Proceedings that
the Archbishop of Mitylene fully answered the questions which were
raised. Although the content of his answers is not given, it must be
assumed that he could satisfy his questioners only by demonstrating the
antiquity of this rite. It has been observed throughout many centuries
in the Oriental church to indicate the various ends for which the
sacrifice is being offered. "He will have said he considered it to be
an ancient custom of the Oriental Church which was used to state
different ends of the sacrifice" (Arcudius, op. cit., bk. 3, chap. 9).
Moreover, We have said that no dispute over this rite has arisen among
Catholics. But among the schismatics it is generally accepted that
Simeon, Archbishop of Thessalonica, betrayed certain doubts about the
consecration of the particles in his treatise de Sacramentis. But
everyone can easily see how unreasonable his doubting was. The priest
at the sacred altar pronounces the form of consecration over the
smaller particles no less than over the larger piece. Since his
intention is equally aimed at consecrating all of them, and the matter
of all of them is suitable for sacramental transformation, the smaller
particles must certainly be consecrated too if the larger piece
receives consecration.

41. Catholics, however, have disputed whether the oblation can be
performed by the deacons, as We mentioned above. Arcudius shows that
this is wholly unlawful for them according to the Sacred Canons (bk. 3,
chap. 17). Goarius states that oblation by the deacon was not an
accepted usage in the great church of Constantinople (ad Euchologium,
p. 72). Many feel that the words relating to the oblation by the deacon
should be struck from the Euchologion on the grounds that they had been
added by the schismatics. On the other side of the question, Cardinal
Bona knows of no canon opposed to this rite. While the sacred canons
exclude the deacon from rashly making the oblation at the holy altar,
they do not forbid the oblation which he performs at the prothesis.
Indeed this is nothing but the preparation for the other oblation which
the priest will perform at the holy altar (Rer. Liturgic. bk. 2, chap.
1, no. 7). He also shows that the rite of oblation by the deacon is
ancient and has been practiced for many centuries in the Greek Church.
In fact, when it was questioned at the council of Florence, the fathers
assembled there were satisfied by the answers of the Archbishop of
Mitylene. Likewise Berlendis recognizes the oblation at the prothesis
as an office of deacons even though the right of making oblation at the
altar is forbidden to them as belonging only to priests. "The office of
making oblation given to the deacon means the first oblation of the
particles while they are still on the table, called the prothesis, but
not the other two oblations which are performed by the priest during
the liturgy" (Tractatu de Oblationibus, sect. 5, p. 143, Venice, 1743).

42. St. Ambrose extolled the virtue of St. Lawrence, who as a deacon
desired to be led to martyrdom together with Pope St. Sixtus. He
imagines him speaking as follows: "Test me, and see if you have
appointed a suitable minister to be entrusted with the distribution of
the Lord's Blood!" We know, of course, that some copies read
"consecration" for "distribution," but here "consecration" merely means
the ministry of assistance given to the consecrating priest. Peter of
Blois says: "to us deacons the consecration of the saving Host is
entrusted, not so that we may consecrate it but that we may humbly help
those who do" (epistle 123). Similar is the explanation of Peter Cantor
given in Menard, in notis et observationibus ad librum Sacramentorum S.
Gregorii, p. 287. It has always been forbidden to subdeacons to
administer the Eucharist to the people either under the appearance of
bread or under the appearance of wine, according to canon 25 of
Laodicea (see the notes on this canon by Balsamon, Zonaras and
Aristenus in Beveregius, vol. 1, p. 464). But this was not the case
with deacons, who of old were particularly entrusted with the sole
distribution of the Lord's Blood. Later this privilege was taken from
them on account of certain abuses which had developed (Cotelerius,
Constitutionum, quae Apostolicae dicuntur, vol. 1, on bk. 8, chap. 13).

43. Now the Congregations which met under Urban VIII, as well as those
during Our pontificate, carefully examined the question of whether the
oblation by the deacons at the prothesis should be abolished. The
Congregation held on January 3, 1745, issued a directive that "no
innovations should be made," and We gave this directive Our approval.
For the reasons in favor of this rite adduced by Cardinal Bona seemed
stronger and weightier than those assembled by Arcudius for its
abolition. So in the new edition of the Euchologion, the rite of
oblation by the deacon remains unchanged. Although this rite is not
mentioned in the statement of the second admonition which We have
hitherto discussed, We still thought it proper to enter a little on the
subject here. For not only is it one of the sacred actions which are
performed at the prothesis to which We have directed the foregoing
remarks, but We also avail Ourselves of every occasion to assure you
that the Roman church is not at all hostile to your rites. Rather it
makes every effort to preserve them unchanged when they contain no
error or disgrace.

Third Admonition-Sacrament of Extreme Unction

44. We come now to the third admonition which consists of two parts and
is expressed as follows: "The priests should remember that the
sacrament of holy oil, called euchelaeon, was instituted by Christ as a
heavenly medicine for the health of the body as well as that of the
soul. Accordingly it is to be given only to the sick at the time they
desire it and while they are still in possession of their faculties. So
coming with faith and a devout will to be anointed with the holy oil,
they will receive additional grace from the sacrament. Likewise it must
be understood that although bishops of the Oriental Church customarily
use many spices in preparing the sacred chrism, only oil and balm are
required. Then with these, in accordance with the ancient custom of the
Oriental Church, other spices may rightly be mixed if they are
available. But if some are lacking, since they are not required, the
holy chrism may duly be prepared with only oil and balm."

45. This sacrament is called "extreme unction" by both the Latins and
the Greeks. At the second general council of Lyons convened by the
leaders of east and west in 1274, Latins and Greeks approved and signed
a statement of faith (Harduin, Collect., vol. 7, p. 695). The Greeks
also call this sacrament the oil consecrated and sanctified by the
prayers of priests, and the perfecting or fulfillment of the sacrament
of penance. It is named <euchelaeon> in the Euchologion of Goarius, p.
346, no. 42 and p. 349, no. 1. The same name is used by writers of the
next generation as can be seen in Georgius Pachymeres, Hist. Palaeol.,
bk. 6, chap. 32, and Possinus uses the same name in Bk. 1 Glos., p. 386
in Gabriel Philadelphius De Sacramento Euchelaei and Acta Ecclesiae
Orientalis, vol. 1, p. 338. Moreover, the Greeks sometimes call this
sacrament Heptapapadum. At the synod in Constantinople which met under
Patriarch Giovanni Veccos in 1277, the Patriarch accepted the
confession of faith agreed upon at the Council of Lyons. He wrote to
the Roman Pontiff John XX (XXI) that: "We also accept extreme unction
as we accept the other sacraments. It is named heptapapadum from our
way of conferring it," that is, the service of seven priests, since the
Greeks administer the sacrament in this way.

46. We shall not speak in this letter of the institution of this
sacrament by Christ or of its effect. Nor shall We deal with the rules
to be observed in administering it, namely that it should be conferred
not on those who are in good health but only on the faithful who are
seriously ill while they are still fully conscious. We shall not treat,
either, of certain rites of the Greek church, such as the blessing of
the oil of the sick by a priest and not only by a bishop as is the
Latin practice, or the administering of the sacrament of extreme
unction by many priests rather than by one only. For We have given a
detailed account of all these matters in Our treatise de Synodo
Diocesana, bk. 8, chaps. 1-8 of the latest edition. But simply to cast
light on the first part of the third admonition, We will add that both
in the time of Urban VIII and in the earlier years of Our pontificate,
a lengthy dispute took place concerning whether words should be struck
from the Greek Euchologion which apparently suggested that it was
permissible to confer this sacrament even on those in good health. In
the assembly on September 3, 1747, the Congregation decided that no
changes should be made in the text, but that necessary points of
observance should be mentioned in an admonition placed at the start of
the Euchologion. We then approved this decision. This has been done in
the words quoted above which warn Greek priests not to confer the
sacrament of extreme unction on those in good health, but only on those
who are seriously ill. There was clearly no need to alter the text of
the Euchologion at this point, since the words could be interpreted
correctly. For it does not state that the sacrament may be conferred on
those in good health, but that persons who come to the church may also
be anointed. This can be easily understood of those who, though
grievously ill, are still able either to walk to the church or to be
brought there by the assistance of others to ask for the sacrament of
extreme unction. Examples of this kind can be found even in the western
church as can be seen in Martene, de antiquis Ecclesiae Ritibus, bk. 2,
chaps. 7, art. 2, no. 7-8, and in Mabillon's preface to the first
century in Acta Sanctorum Ordinis Benedictini, sec. 9, no. 101.

47. The two following points are to be noticed in connection with the
first part of the third admonition. First, even though the Greeks have
been clearly forbidden to confer the sacrament of extreme unction on
any but the seriously ill, they have not been prohibited from anointing
sick or possessed people with the oil of the lamp, which is kept in the
church, as well as others who ask for it either out of devotion or for
deliverance from some affliction. For the oil which is kept in the lamp
was not consecrated by the bishop or priest for use in administering
extreme unction. We are well aware that the request has previously been
made for permission for the Greeks to be anointed with the oil of
extreme unction in cases other than serious illness without the
sacramental form being spoken by the priest. They of course reasoned
that the sacrament is conferred not by the mere application of the
matter, but necessarily requires that the form be pronounced at the
same time. But this request was not acceptable since We can never
permit a sacrament established by Christ to be converted into any
whimsical ceremony even if it is a pious one. This is rightly observed
by Fr. de Carboneano in his Appendix ad Tractatum P. Antoine de Extrema
Unctione, sect. 4, p. 661. Despite the affirmation of Quintaduenas that
parish clergy may send the holy oil of the sick upon request to the ill
and others in order that they may anoint themselves in their sickness
(Treatise 5, de Extreme Unctione, sing. 11), anyone who attempts to do
this is punished with heavy penalties by the ecclesiastical tribunal,
either for misuse of a sacrament of the church or being under suspicion
of unorthodox belief concerning the sacrament, as Clericatus aptly
remarks (de Savamento Extremae Unctionis, sect. 70, no. 32).

48. Furthermore, since it is forbidden to administer the sacrament of
extreme unction except in a case of serious illness, a penitent may no
means be obliged to receive anointing with oil of extreme unction as
penance or satisfaction for his sins. As Pope Eugene IV established in
his Decretum pro Instructione Armenorum, satisfaction for sins or
penance imposed by confessors on their penitents should consist chiefly
in prayers, fasting, and almsgiving. In times past such anointing was
introduced among eastern Christians. That it was purely ceremonial may
be gathered from canon 74 or the Council of Nicaea (from the Arabic
translation, Harduin, Collect. vol. 1, p. 492). There it is decreed
that if one of the faithful shall live impurely with an unbeliever, he
may be reconciled to the Church after extended penance "through holy
water and the oil of the sick." This was the source of a further abuse.
According to Joannes Nathanael, de Moribus Graecorum, and Francois
Richard, de Expeditione Sacra, rich penitents were often obliged to
receive this anointing as penance for their sins; thus this practice
was quite profitable for the clergy.

Pope Innocent IV opposed this serious error in his letter to the Bishop
of Tusculum: "Confessors may not impose on anyone any mere anointing in
satisfaction for their sins" (sect. 6). The synod of Nicosia passed a
similar decree (Harduin, Collect. vol. 7, p. 1114) and We renewed this
precept in Our constitution, Etsi Pastoralis, sect. 5 (Bullarium, vol.
1, no. 57). Thiers, de Superstit., bk. 8, chap. 6, should also be
consulted. Arcudius, moreover, refers to Greek priests who impose this
on their penitents; he states that they usually employ the sacramental
words in performing the anointing. He criticizes them severely for this
(de Concordia, bk. 5, chap. 4, sect. Ego praesentem). However, Goarius
asserts that the Greeks did not intend to confer the sacrament in
performing this anointing: "They do not consider that the infirmities
of the soul are removed automatically by the anointing and prayers, but
only that the devotion of the penitent or the prayerful charity of the
minister, that is, the intention of the agent, may possibly have this
effect" (in notis ad Euchologium, p. 350). Still, even he criticizes
this custom since, as he says, the Greeks should be careful to act in
this affair in accordance with the teaching of the holy Roman Church.
Many serious errors stem from this practice of anointing: either the
sacrament of extreme unction is conferred on one in good health and so
incapable of receiving this sacrament, or the matter and form of the
sacrament is used without the intention of conferring the sacrament
itself.

49. The second part of the third admonition concerns the holy chrism.
The Greeks make this not only from oil and balm, but with additional
spices. This section indicates that the addition of spices is not
forbidden, but that the chrism must consist of oil and balm. So even if
some of those spices are absent, sacred chrism may still be prepared.

50. The imposition of hands while conferring this sacrament is not
prescribed for the Greeks. In his treatise de Confirmatione, chap. 4,
Morinus writes: "The Latins have always joined the imposition of hands
to anointing, but the Greeks have always kept these rites separate and
have used only anointing in conferring this sacrament. Neither old nor
new euchologies mention the imposition of hands." The same point is
made by Goarius, in Euchologio, p. 299, no. 28. Renaudot in his Opus de
Perpetuitate, vol. 5, bk. 2, chap. 12, affirms that for many centuries
in the Greek church no evidence is to be found of an imposition of
hands in conferring the sacrament of Confirmation. As authorities for
this statement he cites the modern Greek theologians, Simeon of
Thessalonica, Gabriel of Philadelphia, Sirinus, and others. Recently
Chardon, in Historia Sacramentorum, bk. 1, chap. 1, De Confirmatione,
argues that in earlier centuries the Greek church did include the
imposition of hands in the rite of Confirmation, but he does grant that
for many centuries since then, there is no evidence for this. Finally
Guiseppe Agostino Orsi O. P., at present the master of Our apostolic
palace, proves by marshalling much learned evidence in his historical
theological dissertation, de Chrismate Confirmatorio, that among the
Greeks the matter of the sacrament of Confirmation is the holy oil, not
the imposition of hands. This gives no grounds for asserting, as some
have rashly done, that the sacrament of Confirmation does not exist in
the Greek church because it does not include the imposition of hands.
For no one can believe that the sacrament of Confirmation did not exist
for many centuries in so large a portion of the Christian world
especially in a church renowned for its learning and its sanctity.
Goarius (loc. Cit.) gives an apt expression to Our opinion: "Few men in
my judgment will attempt to assert that so large a portion of the
Christian world, which is learned and loyal to apostolic and
ecclesiastical rules, either rejected, neglected or remained in
ignorance of this perfect sacrament."

51. The main issue of this unfair and untimely disagreement between the
Latin and Greek churches derives from the controversies in which our
theologians habitually engage. Some dispute whether the Apostles
conferred the sacrament of Confirmation by laying on of hands or by
using holy oil, and as usual some assert what others deny. They also
dispute whether the imposition of hands alone is the matter of this
sacrament. Some hold that this is the case, while others consider the
holy oil to be the remote matter of the sacrament; in this case the
application of this oil in the sign of the Cross to the forehead of the
confirmand is considered the proximate matter. These last argue from
the text of the decree for the Instruction of the Armenians published
by Pope Eugenius IV: "The second sacrament is Confirmation whose matter
is chrism. Chrism is made from oil and balm which has been blessed by
the bishop. The oil signifies a good conscience and the balm, good
reputation." In speaking of the imposition of hands which the Apostles
used in conferring this sacrament, Pope Eugenius adds: "In place of
that imposition of hands, however, Confirmation is given in the
Church." Finally, others join together the imposition of hands and the
chrism, stating that both are equally the matter of the sacrament of
Confirmation, but that either is insufficient by itself. Only when
these two are joined together do they comprise the full matter of the
sacrament.

As regards the imposition of hands, some think it consists in the
stretching out of the hands of the bishop towards the confirmands at
the start of the ceremony while he is saying the opening prayers.
Others understand it to consist in the very act of anointing of the
forehead of the confirmand by the bishop, since it is impossible to
anoint the forehead without laying a hand on it. These are
controversies which engage our theologians, and everyone may embrace
the interpretation he finds most persuasive. But it is wrong for anyone
to assert that the sacrament of Confirmation does not exist in the
Greek Church. For this opinion is contradicted by ancient eastern
practice as found in the Greek Rituals which make no reference to the
imposition of hands as matter either sufficient or insufficient of the
sacrament of Confirmation. And this practice has never been condemned
or criticized by the Apostolic See although it was well-known. So to
escape the labyrinth of this difficulty, a different line must be
followed, a line which is open to the careful seeker. This line avoids
a condemnation of a view which has many supporters among the orthodox,
on the basis of an uncertain and undefined proposition.

52. What is beyond dispute should be stated: that in the Latin church,
the sacrament of confirmation is conferred by the priest pronouncing
the words of the sacramental form while he makes the sign of the Cross
on the forehead of the candidate with holy chrism, that is olive oil
mixed with balm and blessed by the bishop. In those areas where genuine
balm is not be to found, the popes have readily allowed the use of a
sweet-smelling juice or liquid, generally taken for real balm, in
preparing chrism. This is clear from constitution 180 of St. Pius V
which grants this privilege to the bishops of the Indies, and from
constitution 97 of Sixtus V (in Bullario nova, vol. 4, pt. 3, Roman
edition). Pope Sixtus explains that real balm is scarce chiefly because
the Turks completely destroyed its main source, the trees which once
flourished in Palestine and particularly in the Jericho valley. He
accordingly gives permission to the Archbishops and Bishops of Portugal
to use balm from Brazil and other areas of the New World in preparing
holy chrism. In so doing the Pope asserts that he is following the
example of his predecessors Pius IV and Gregory XIII. The prudence of
these popes has been praised by Morinus in his posthumous work de
Sacramento Confirmationis, p. 35.

Likewise in the Greek church the sacrament of confirmation is conferred
by means of holy oil. This is made from olive oil and balm, but in
addition twenty-three kinds of other herbs are used as well as a little
wine. These herbs are carefully listed by Habert, in librum
Pontificalem Ecclesiae Graecae, observation 5, on the rite of chrism;
and by Berti, Theologia, vol. 7, bk. 32, chap. 5. The latter, however,
thinks it practically impossible for the Greeks to add all the herbs
mentioned by Habert since some of them are so unknown that they receive
scant mention in dictionaries and specialized writings on plants and
herbs. Whatever the truth of this question, the rite has been left
unchanged in the admonition under discussion, since the practice of
adding these herbs is an ancient one. The Greeks are merely advised
that they should not consider these herbs essential for the matter of
the sacrament; they should recognize the sacrament as valid when it is
performed only with oil and balm blessed by the bishop, even though
some of the herbs which they usually add in accordance with their rite
are lacking. Wisely and with good cause did the fathers at the Synod of
Zamoscia in 1720 affirm that whatever herbs were added to the balm,
care should be taken "that the largest part of the chrism should always
be oil mixed with balm" (sect. 2, de Confirmatione).

53. Now that the second part of the third admonition has been
completed, We shall add here in the form of an appendix some comments
well-suited to Our present purpose, since they are related both to the
doctrine of the sacrament of confirmation and to the revision of the
Euchologion.

54. The form of the sacrament of confirmation in the Greek church,
according to the generally received opinion, consists in the words:
"the sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit" uttered by the minister while
making the sign of the Cross with the holy oil on the forehead of the
candidate. This is clear from canon 7 of the First Council of
Constantinople (Harduin, Collect. vol. I, p. 811) as Cardinal Bessarion
correctly understands the words of that canon (in Opuscolo de
Eucharistia, printed in the Library of the Fathers, vol. 26, p. 765,
Lyons edition): "The Second Ecumenical Council gives the words of
consecration for holy chrism in the seventh canon as follows: 'While
signing them, that is while anointing them with the most holy chrism,
we say: the sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit.' According to them
these words confer the sacrament of confirmation." But although this
statement of the Cardinal has been contested by Lupus, in notis ad
Canonem 95. Concilii Trullani, he is not likely to win much support for
his opinion since his antagonist is Cardinal Bessarion. Arcudius draws
attention to this point when he cites Bessarion's statement and
continues: "Bessarion speaks thus and certainly no one could excel him
in knowledge of the practices of the eastern church in administering
the sacraments" (bk. 2, chap. 7). Goarius shares this opinion (in notis
ad Euchologium, p. 302, no. 31). So too does Habert (in suis notis ad
Pontificale Graecorum, observ. 4, n. 2). It would be easy to assemble
many other testimonies, but it will suffice to state what the Synod of
Zamoscia said when treating the sacrament of confirmation: "The form of
the sacrament which is recommended by the approved Euchologia which are
more ancient than the schism itself, is this: 'The sign of the gift of
the Holy Spirit, amen' and this should be said once only while the
anointing is conferred."

55. The decree of St. Methodius, Patriarch of Constantinople, is
well-known in the Greek church. Methodius was Patriarch about the
middle of the ninth century and tirelessly strove to call the wanderers
back home to holy unity. His decree lays down the method of restoring
to the Church those who have left it and subsequently returned: "At the
end of the prayer he takes the holy oil in accordance with the custom
of the baptized, and anoints him, making the sign of the Cross on his
forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, both ears, hands, breast, and
shoulders while he says: 'the sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit."'

This passage certainly gives rise to a great difficulty, for apparently
it must be admitted either that the words "the sign of the gift of the
Holy Spirit" are not the form of the sacrament of confirmation in the
Greek church or that this sacrament is conferred a second time on those
who have already received it validly once, if after the sin of apostasy
they desire to return to the Church. The latter view is of course
contrary to the established opinion that sacraments, which impress a
character on the soul, can never be conferred again on those who have
received them validly once. This was defined by the Council of Trent,
session 7, on the sacraments in general, canon 9. There is no use in
appealing to canon 7 of the Council of Constantinople, which was
mentioned above. This canon lays down that Arians, Macedonians,
Novatians, and Apollinarians who turn from their heresy and come to the
Church are to be received with holy chrism. This ruling refers only to
these heretics, since they confer the sacrament of confirmation
invalidly, if at all; the decree of St. Methodius though is general and
applies to all who wish to return after leaving the Church. Moreover,
since provisions similar to those of the decree of Methodius are made
in some euchologies in the section on the reconciliation of penitents,
the same difficulty arises in these cases.

56. The subtlety of scholars has been fully deployed to solve this
problem. Some assert that the decree in question was not issued by St.
Methodius, Patriarch of Constantinople in 842, but by a different
Methodius, the schismatic Patriarch of Constantinople, in 1240. But
Goarius states that he saw several documents anterior to the latter
Methodius which assign the decree to St. Methodius the Patriarch (in
notis ad ipsum Decretum in his elucidation of the Euchologion, p. 698).
That is enough to deprive this solution of its weight.

Others grant that the words "the sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit"
are the form of the sacrament of confirmation, and recognize that the
same words are to be said during the anointing of repentant apostates
who are being received back into the Church in accordance with the
decree of St. Methodius. They think, however, that this does not give
grounds for saying that the sacrament of confirmation has been
conferred on men who have already received it, since the intention of
the minister is necessary for the conferring of the sacraments. In this
case it is quite clear that the intention of the minister is not to
confer the sacrament but to reconcile a returned apostate to the
Church. This solution is embraced by the following writers: Du Hamel,
Theologiae, vol. 6, p. 383, Paris 1605; Goarius, in notis ad Eucholog.,
p. 598; Tournely, in Tractatu de Confirmatione, p. 612f; and Assemanus
the Younger, Codex Liturgicus, bk. 3, De Confirmatione, p. 63.

However, many others are dissatisfied with this solution. Juveninus, in
particular, raises two objections. In the first place he notices that
there is no Greek evidence to suggest that it is not the minister's
intention to confer the sacrament of confirmation when he reconciles an
apostate by anointing him with holy oil and using words which contain
the form of the sacrament. He suggests secondly that if a minister
applies the matter and form of a sacrament to one who is not capable of
receiving it, his act is wrong and sinful, even if his intention is not
to confer the sacrament.

Finally, others point out that evidence from the early centuries
establishes that apostates in the Western church were sometimes
reconciled by an imposition of hands. They admit that it is now
forbidden to confer the sacrament of confirmation a second time on
those who have already validly received it, but they claim that it was
not so in the early days of the Church. Hence, they conclude that it
should not seem so strange that the decree of St. Methodius, which
relates to the Eastern church, requires returned apostates to be
confirmed a second time despite their first valid confirmation.

But this argument is fragile. For some of the early evidence states
plainly that apostates were received back by the imposition of hands
alone. If this is to be understood as the conferring of confirmation,
it will have to be shown that this sacrament was then conferred by the
imposition of hands alone without any anointing. If it is said, and
there is some evidence to this effect, that holy oil as well as the
imposition of hands was used in reconciling this type of penitent, it
will still have to be shown what form of words if any was used by the
minister who imposed hands and anointed with chrism in order to
establish that the sacrament was repeated. Marcus Rehmensis describes
many types of imposition of hands in his treatise on in Tractatu de
variis Capitibus Ecclesiae, chap. 18. The author of the Gloss on the
Can. Manus impositio, 1, quest. 1, also gives a careful account of this
matter. Sirmondus and Morinus, both illustrious, consider that the
imposition of hands, which is now in question, imparted Confirmation
(Sirm., in suo Antirbetico secundo, chap. 5; Mor. de Sacram. Confir.,
chap. 12, p. 56 and in Tract. de Poenitentia, bk. 9, chap. 9-10). But
Peter Aurelius argues that the imposition of hands given when receiving
heretics back was purely ceremonial and did not confer the sacrament.
This opinion is shared by Lupus in Can. 7. Constanti nopolitanum, vol.
2, p. 46f; Arcudius, bk. 2, chap. 18; Suarez, in 3. part. Divi Thomae,
vol. 3, quest. 72, disp. 34, sect. 1, resp. 3, and disp. 36, art. 11,
sect. 3. Accordingly Witasse, after reviewing all the evidence for both
views, finally judges both possible and leaves the matter there (Tract.
de Sacram. Confirmat., esp. p. 63). The author of the additions to
Estius in bk. 4. Sentent., dist. 5, sect. 16, lit. B. p. 87, behaves
with similar caution.

57. So a different way must be found to solve the difficulty under
discussion. First of all, as regards the decree of St. Methodius, the
text We gave above is quite different from that found in the much-used
Annals of Cardinal Baronius for 842 A.D. The text given by Baronius
does not prescribe the use of the words "the sign of the gift of the
Holy Spirit" in receiving back an apostate, although it requires that
he be anointed with holy oil. The text reads: "Let them be anointed
with chrism as those who are baptized are usually anointed." Even
admitting that these words are authentic rather than a later addition
as there is some reason to believe, their obvious sense will always be
that when an apostate is received back, the same parts of the body
should be anointed as are anointed when Confirmation is administered
after Baptism. And since no mention is made of saying the words: "The
sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit," the whole force of the problem is
dispersed.

There is the additional consideration that the legates sent by Pope
Nicholas I to Bulgaria conferred the sacrament of confirmation on those
who had already received it from Greek priests. Their main reason for
so doing was that the Greek ministers had not received the faculty for
administering this sacrament from the Apostolic See. Photius launched a
bitter attack against them in his encyclical letters, accusing them of
conferring the sacrament of chrism on people who had been confirmed
already. "Who ever heard of such madness as was unwaveringly engaged in
by those fools? They have confirmed a second time people already
anointed with chrism, making trivial mockery of exalted mysteries."
This proves clearly that St. Methodius did not intend to prescribe that
penitent apostates on returning to the church should be given the
sacrament of chrism a second time if they had already been confirmed.
For Photius, who was Patriarch about forty years after St. Methodius,
despite his perverse mind, enjoyed a constant reputation for learning
and circumspection. He would never have accused the apostolic legates
so bitterly for repeating the sacrament of chrism if St. Methodius had
previously decreed or intended that apostates should receive the same
sacrament a second time upon returning to the Church. For he would have
foreseen that the legates would answer that they had only followed the
custom of the eastern church in receiving the wanderers back to unity
in accordance with the decree of St. Methodius.

58. The occurrence in some of the euchologies of the words, "the sign
of the gift of the Holy Spirit," in conjunction with anointing when
reconciling the repentant is to be attributed to the interpolation of
schismatics. Theodore Balsamon convinced them that any Latin who
seceded to the Greeks should be confirmed again. This is stated by
Gregory Protosyncellus in his Apologia against Marcus of Ephesus
(Harduin, Collect., vol. 9, p. 640). But the use of the words in
question is not prescribed in the many manuscript copies of the
Euchologion examined and compared by Joannes Matthaeus Cariophylus
Cydonius, a trustworthy witness, according to Arcudius, de Reformat.,
bk. 2, chap. 18. Neither are they found in the famous Euchologion of
Grottaferrata, a point of great importance. Therefore the Congregations
for the Correction of the Euchologion which met in the time of Urban
VII and in Our day decreed with Our approval that the rite of
reconciling penitents should be printed in the revised Euchologion
exactly as it is described in the Euchologion of Grottaferrata; this
has been done. At the meeting of the Congregation on January 7, 1748,
the question was raised as to whether the rite of receiving back
apostates on their return to the Church should be made to conform to
the decree of St. Methodius. It was pointed out that this anointing was
to be performed in the way that those who are baptized are anointed,
but that the requirement of saying at the same time the words, "the
sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit," was to be found only in a few
modem euchologies. Therefore the Congregation of February 18, decreed
that "the euchology should be revised to conform to the patriarchal
euchology of Cardinal Bassarion, now of Grottaferrata." On receiving
this report, We examined the matter and gave Our approval to the
decree.

Fourth Admonition-Removing Impurities

59. Next We must deal with the fourth admonition, which concerns the
removal of certain impurities by blessings and prayers which are
included in the Euchologion. The words of the admonition are: "Finally,
it should be known that if anything unclean or defiled chances to fall
in a well or other receptacle of liquid, or if an unclean thing is
touched or eaten, or if an impure animal is born or dies in a church,
the priests of the eastern church in accordance with the custom of
their Church use the prayers and blessings contained in the
Euchologion. However they are not attempting to observe the precepts of
the old Law which as everybody knows have been revoked by the coming of
Christ."

60. In the revised Euchologion, just as in the Euchologion of
Grottaferrata, once Cardinal Bessarion's, and in the most ancient
manuscripts, there is a prayer which mentions the distinction made in
the old Law between clean and unclean foods as well as the uncleanness
in the eyes of the Law of anyone who ate unclean food. The prayer goes
on to say that the one who has eaten unclean foods cannot receive the
precious Body and Blood of Christ without sin. The contents and
expressions of this prayer and others like it occasioned a discussion
of whether one might well suspect that the observance of the legal
ceremonies of the old Law was being added to or retained alongside the
new law and the Gospel. To understand whether there are any grounds for
this suspicion, We will touch briefly on the following considerations.
They will throw light on all aspects of the question and the reason for
each detail will be plain.

61. The first consideration is that the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law
were abrogated by the coming of Christ and that they can no longer be
observed without sin after the promulgation of the Gospel. Since, then,
the distinction made by the old Law between clean and unclean foods
belongs to the ceremonial precepts, it may justly be affirmed that such
a distinction no longer exists and ought not be insisted on. It is true
that I the holy Apostles forbade the faithful to eat blood or the flesh
of animals which had been strangled. This view was expressed by James
at the Council of Jerusalem: "Therefore I judge that those of the
Gentiles who turn to God should not be disturbed, but that we should
write to them to abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, from
unchastity, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood" (Acts
15). But it is clear that this was ordained to remove all occasion of
disagreement between Jewish and Gentile converts to Christ. Since this
reason has long since vanished, its consequence should also be said to
have vanished. "Similarly, we profess that the legalities of the Old
Testament, the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law, the rites, sacrifices, and
sacraments have ceased at the coming of Our Lord Jesus Christ; they
cannot be observed without sin after the promulgation of the Gospel.
The distinction of clean and unclean foods found in the old Law
pertains to the ceremonies which have passed away with the rise of the
Gospel. The Apostles' prohibition on food offered to idols, blood, and
the meat of strangled animals was suitable at that time to remove cause
for disagreement between Jews and Gentiles; but since the reason for
this prohibition has ceased to be, the prohibition too has come to an
end."

62. The preceding words are from the Profession of Orthodox Faith which
Pope Urban VIII required of Orientals, as published in 1642 by the
Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. They are in harmony with
the teaching of St. Thomas (Summa 1, 2, quest. 103, art. 4, to 3rd).
Moreover this teaching is confirmed by ancient documents. St. Gregory
II in his capitular letter (chap. 7) appointing Bishop Marinianus and
the priest George as legates to Bavaria, writes: "No food should be
considered unclean to eat, except what was sacrificed to idols since,
as we learn from the apostolic teaching, every creation of God is good
and whatever is taken with thanks is not to be rejected." Likewise St.
Nicholas I in his answer to the 43rd decree of the Bulgarians regarding
clean and unclean animals, said: "God showed clearly, in my opinion,
what animals or birds may be eaten when, after the flood, he gave all
animals to Noah and his sons to eat.... Therefore, every animal may be
eaten whose flesh is definitely not harmful to the body and is regarded
as food by human society." So the Decree for the Jacobites of the
Council of Florence reads: "The holy Roman Church firmly believes,
professes, and preaches that every creature of God is good and not to
be rejected if it is taken with thanks. According to the Lord's word, a
man is not defiled by what enters his mouth. The Church affirms that
the distinction made by the Mosaic Law between clean and unclean foods
belongs to the ceremonial laws which have passed away with the coming
of the Gospel.... So it declares that no kind of food is to be
condemned which human society regards as food, and no distinction is to
be made between animals on the basis of gender or the manner of their
death. However many things which are not forbidden may and should be
given up for the health of the body, the practice of virtue, and
regular Church discipline. As the Apostle says: 'All things are
permitted, but not all are expedient."'

63. The second consideration is that although the ceremonial precepts
of the old Law have come to an end with the promulgation of the Gospel,
and the new Law does not contain any precept which distinguishes
between clean and unclean foods, nevertheless the Church of Christ has
the power of renewing the obligation to observe some of the old
precepts for just and serious reasons, despite their abrogation by the
new Law. However, precepts whose main function was to foreshadow the
coming Messiah should not be restored, for example, circumcision and
the sacrifice of animals, as Vasquez aptly remarks in 1, 2, Divi
Thomae, vol. 2, disp. 182, chap. 9, sect. ex quibus omnibus. Precepts
regarding external discipline and cleanliness of body, the kind which
contain the precepts on clean and unclean foods, may be restored. The
Western as well as the Eastern Church assumed this practice; this is
documented from the earliest centuries.

64. The Gentiles invented the calumny about the early Christians eating
the flesh of infants and drinking human blood. Such calumny was
occasioned by the prevailing practice of religious secrecy. The
faithful kept secret the Real Presence of Christ's Body in the
Eucharistic meal which they ate, but the Gentiles got some vague rumor
of this Mystery and used this as a basis for inventing and spreading
this falsehood against the Christians. This is shown by Schelestratus
in his Dissertat. de Disciplina Arcani, artic. unic., chap. 4, sect.
17.

Equally renowned is the answer the ancient Apologists gave to the
Gentiles on behalf of the Christians without disclosing the secret.
They asserted that it was quite impossible that the disciples of Christ
should eat human flesh and drink human blood since, as was well known,
they even abstained from the blood of animals and from the flesh of
strangled animals. Tertullian uses this proof in his Apologetici, chap.
9. This answer, however, proves clearly that in the first centuries
Christians distinguished between foods for some reason and abstained
from blood and the meat of strangled animals. This is wisely noted by
both Nicholas le Nourry, vol. 2, Apparatus in Biblioth. Patr., diss. 4
on Tertullian, chap. 12, art. 2, and by Pamelius, in dictum cap. 9
Tertulliani, no. 138.

Those Christians did not think that the Mosaic Law was still binding in
this matter. They knew that the apostolic prohibition regarding
abstinence from blood and the meat of strangled animals had been
removed. They did not consider these foods prohibited in any way, yet
they abstained from them on the grounds that it was fitting to observe
the custom handed down by the fathers. Natalis Alexander writes that
"the custom of abstaining from blood and the meat of strangled animals
was so religiously observed in those churches because they had received
this custom from their fathers, not because they considered that these
foods were absolutely prohibited" (Hist. Ecdesiast. Saecul. 1, diss.
10).

65. In his Comment. on the words "from strangled animals and blood"
(Acts 15), Calmet states that some Latin churches distinguished between
clean and unclean foods and abstained from blood and strangled meat as
late as the tenth and eleventh century. He does not at this point offer
any proof for his statement but its truth is quite evident to anyone
who has the slightest acquaintance with Christian writing. For Canisius
published an old Roman penitential from the end of the eighth or the
start of the ninth century; under the heading "On strangled meat," it
prescribes a penance for eating the meat of a strangled animal, and
under the heading "On mangled flesh," it prescribes penances and fasts
for eating fish which died in the pool or for drinking water from a
well in which a mouse or a hen died before thoroughly cleansing the
well.

Humbertus, Cardinal of Silva Candida, as Legate of Pope St. Leo IX at
Constantinople, argued violently with the Greeks, but he openly
admitted during the disputations that on this subject Latins and Greeks
did not disagree since this practice was still observed in some Latin
and Greek churches. "Maintaining the ancient custom or tradition of our
fathers, we too hold these things in abomination; apart from the great
danger to life, a heavy penance is imposed on those among us who eat
blood or corpses or polluted waters or animals which died by accident."
And elsewhere he says, "So even though the Lord and the Apostles give
us permission to eat everything which does not harm our own health nor
that of our brother, the custom of some areas and the precepts of our
fathers make us abstain from some foods. We do this not because they
are bad or unclean, but either because at times they are not expedient,
or they revolt us now that long- lasting habit has become nature for
us."

66. There is no trace of this abstinence left in the Latin churches, if
we may believe Cornelius a Lapide (in Commentar. in Actus Apost., chap.
15, "and from blood"). But it is still strong in the Greek church which
considers it praiseworthy to maintain the apostolic precept on
abstinence from blood and strangled meat. So say Calmet and a Lapide.
Christianus Lupus says further that "the Greeks too have for a long
time afterwards observed unchanged this apostolic law" (Notes on Canon
67 of the Trullan Synod). This Trullan Canon 67 says, "The divine
scripture has commanded us to abstain from blood, strangled meat, and
fornication. We fittingly punish those who for the pleasure of the
belly skillfully season, serve, and eat the blood of an animal. So if
anyone henceforth eats the blood of an animal in any way, he should be
deposed if a cleric and separated if a layman."

The Armenians alone, to Our knowledge, have publicly abandoned this
custom of the Greeks upon entering into union with the Roman Church.
For the schismatic Vartanes had persuaded them to abstain from certain
foods which the Mosaic Law called unclean with the sole exception of
pork; this he claimed had been allowed by St. Gregory the Illuminator,
their first patriarch. He also instructed them to destroy vessels of
oil and wine if a fly or suchlike drowned therein. Nevertheless the
conferences which effected the union of the Armenians with the Roman
Church decreed that "the Armenian fathers at both the synods of Sis and
Adana in uniting their church with the Church of Rome have approved the
Dogmatic Letter of Gregory, Patriarch of Armenia, to King Haytones,
which rejects the Jewish distinction of foods by the words, "We command
that all impure foods be considered purified, as St. Paul says,
especially in the case of the poor. The lord Nierses, that is,
Ghelajensis, also a Doctor and Patriarch of Armenia, taught that such
foods should be blessed with prayers" (Galanus, vol. 2 De conciliatione
Ecclesiae Armenae cum Romana).

67. The third and final point suggested by the text of the fourth
admonition is that Greek priests are not forbidden to use any of the
prayers or blessings which are in their Euchologion by reason of
references to matters which were subject to the ceremonial precepts of
the Old Law. They should, however, do everything with the intention not
of obeying the precepts of the old Law, which has now been abrogated,
but of respecting the new Law of the Church or canonical custom made
strong by long and unbroken observance.

In dealing with the Greek custom of abstaining from blood and strangled
flesh, Lorinus notes that "if the Greeks today abstain from blood on
the grounds that they are bound by this law, they are superstitious.
This law now binds nobody and its observance savors of the ceremonies
of the old Law. But they should not be blamed if they reject this food
from a natural revulsion or other good reason" (in cit. Actuum Apos.
15.20). Goarius, in writing in variantibus lectionibus in the Greek
Euchologion, considers the prayer "for those who have eaten forbidden
and unclean things." He notes that "the Orientals avoid partaking of
unclean foods through zeal for the Church, rather than for the Mosaic
Law, etc. Consequently, despite the babbling calumny of Catumsyritus,
they are far from observing Jewish ritual since they are observing the
traditions of the Church." Catumsyritus would have some basis for his
daring statement if the Greeks acted as they do not for these reasons,
but from wrongly thinking that they are bound by the Apostolic precept
on abstinence from blood and strangled meat. William Beveregius
unfortunately attempts to defend this opinion in his Codex Canonum
Ecclesiae primitivae, vol. 2, chap. 7, no. 5.

Certain schismatics have tried to calumniate the Latin church by saying
that it judaizes by consecrating unleavened bread, observing the
Sabbath, and retaining the anointing of kings among the sacred rites.
But Leo Allatius counters their rash claim in his splendid work de
perpetua consensione Ecclesiae Occidentalis et Orientalis, bk. 3, chap.
4. He refutes them particularly by arguing as follows: "Since Jews
observe Sabbaths, a man who observes Sabbaths acts in Jewish fashion:
therefore the man who does not eat the flesh of strangled animals acts
in Jewish fashion since the Jews are forbidden by the Law to eat such
food: but the Greeks do not eat such food: therefore, the Greek
judaize" (loc. cit. n. 4). Then to Our purpose he concludes (n. 9) that
it cannot be absolutely asserted that that man judaizes who does
something in the Church which corresponds to the ceremonies of the old
Law. "If a man should perform acts for a different end and purpose
(even with the intention of worship and as religious ceremonies), not
in the spirit of that Law nor on the basis of it, but either from
personal decision, from human custom, or on the instruction of the
Church, he would not sin, nor could he be said to judaize. So when a
man does something in the Church which resembles the ceremonies of the
old Law, he must not always be said to judaize."

68. Since We have added an appendix to Our treatment of each of the
first three admonitions, before ending Our encyclical We now want to
add to this fourth admonition an appendix relevant both to the subject
of the admonition and to the publication of the revised Euchologion.

69. In the Book of Leviticus, chap. 12, it is decreed that a woman who
has borne a boy is unclean for seven days and remains for a further
thirty- three days in "the blood of her purification." If she has been
delivered of a girl, she is unclean for two weeks and remains for
sixty-six days "in the blood of her purification." She may not enter
the sanctuary before this time has elapsed. When she first enters the
temple, she is to bring a prescribed offering.

70. It cannot be denied that this prohibition continued for some time
in the Church. In the Penitential Canons of Theodorus, quoted by Ivo in
his decree and mentioned by Cardinal Baronius under 266 A.D., it is
said that "a woman who enters the church before her blood is clean
after birth must do penance for thirty-three days if she brought forth
a boy and for fifty- six days if she bore a girl. If any woman rashly
enters the church before the prescribed time, she must do penance on
bread and water for as many days as she should have stayed away from
the church." But it also cannot be denied that this prohibition was
removed in the Latin Church in the course of time. "If at the same hour
as she has brought forth, a woman enters the church to give thanks, she
does not commit any sin," said Pope Gregory, and his words are quoted
in the Decree of Gratian, can. 2, dist. 5. In his decretal Volens, De
purificatione post partum, Innocent III cites the text, "The law was
given through Moses: grace and truth came through Jesus Christ." He
adds that a woman who wishes not to enter the church for a time after
childbirth is not forbidden to do so, but that a woman who comes to
church does not sin. "So they commit no sin and are not to be forbidden
to enter the churches. To forbid them would obviously imply that their
punishment was a sin. Still if they want to stay away for some time out
of a feeling of reverence, We do not believe that their devotion should
be condemned."

The Blessed Virgin Mary willingly subjected herself to the law of
Leviticus, although this law did not apply to her, when she presented
herself and her divine Son in the Temple at the proper time after
childbirth. In memory of this remarkable event, the rite which is found
in the Roman Ritual published by order of Pope Paul V was established.
After childbirth a woman goes to the church and is met at the door by a
priest. He prays over her and sprinkles her with holy water. Then
holding the hem of the priest's stole, she goes up to the altar,
genuflects before it, and offers thanks to God for the benefits she has
received. In the Latin church, however, this blessing of the woman
after childbirth is not obligatory and there is no sin involved if it
is omitted, although to omit it from contempt would be a sin as Quartus
warns in his work de Benedictionibus, tit. 3, sect. 12, diff. 1).

71. In the Greek Church, however, the law regarding childbirth is
observed religiously as if a commandment, and a woman who has given
birth is not allowed to come to the church before the appointed time.
Indeed in earlier centuries the practice of the Greeks was so strict
that women during menstruation were prevented from sharing the
Eucharist, even when critically ill. For this practice they were
severely criticized by Cardinal Humbertus of Silva Candida (Baronius,
1054 A.D.). This strictness was later modified to the extent that women
during menstruation who were in danger of death were allowed to receive
the Eucharist. This is seen both from the Canonical Letter of Dionysius
of Alexandria and from Novella 13 of Emperor Leo the Wise. The remark
of Cardinal Baronius (266 A.D., no. 11) should be recalled here. He
notes that Dionysius in this letter merely expressed his own opinion
and submitted it to the judgment of Basilides and others. "I have
written this not as a teacher, but to make my opinion public with all
appropriate simplicity. After repeated examination, write and tell me
the conclusion you have come to and whether this is the best view of
the matter." On the other hand the reasoning of St. Gregory the Great
is clearly true: "The excess of nature cannot be counted as a sin, and
it is not just to prevent a woman from entering the church because of
what she endures against her will" (cited by Gratian, can. 4, dist. 5).

As regards partaking of the Eucharist, the holy Doctor openly declares
that he does not condemn a woman for communicating even at this time,
although he does not disapprove if she abstains from doing so from
reverence. "She should be praised if she does not presume to receive
the sacrament from a feeling of great reverence, but if she does
receive she is not to be condemned. For it is characteristic of good
people to see sins in some measure in actions of their own which
involve no sin."

Therefore Theophilus Raynaudus criticizes the practice of the Greeks in
this matter (Operum, vol. 16, <Heterodita Spiritualia>, p. 33, no. 28,
Lyons). And even Goarius, who is otherwise so constant a promoter and
defender of Greek rites, frankly admits that the law which forbids
communion to women during menstruation is too severe and contrary to
all order. "Still women who are defiled should be treated more mildly,
despite all the arguments and subterfuges of the Greeks, etc. The
weakness is one of nature which relieves itself automatically" (in
notis ad Euchologium, p. 270). He then invokes the authority of St.
Gregory by quoting the passage from his letter which is given above.

72. Whatever be the case with women during menstruation entering the
church and being allowed to receive the Lord's body, We turn back now
to women after childbirth. As has been said, in the Latin Church
observance of a period following birth is simply advised but not
prescribed, while the Greek Church obliges women not to enter the
church for a specified number of days. As Goarius says (p. 269): "The
Greeks demand this behavior as a duty, the Latins only as a
demonstration of reverence." But the Euchologion contains prayers to be
said by the priest on this occasion as part of the whole ritual of the
ceremony surrounding childbirth.

73. Accordingly this matter was carefully examined and discussed in the
Congregations which met for the revision of the Euchologion both under
Urban VIII and during Our pontificate. No one proposed the entire
elimination from the Euchologion of the rites surrounding childbirth,
but the suggestion was made that the prescribed period of forty days
should be changed, and that different prayers should be substituted for
the prayer in the Euchology which seemed to refer excessively to the
legal uncleanness which caused the Jews to prevent their wives from
doing any business for forty days after birth and from entering the
temple. It seemed especially unfitting to beseech God to "cleanse etc.
the defilement of her body from all the defilement of sin and wash away
the stains of the soul in the course of forty days."

74. But others remarked wisely that some, surely, of the ceremonial
rites of the old Law could be observed under the new Law if only they
were not done as obligations of the old Law, which was abrogated, but
as a custom, or lawful tradition, or as a new precept issued by one
enjoying the recognized and competent authority to make laws and to
enforce them, as Vasquez observes (vol. 3, in the 3rd part of the
Summa, disp. 210, quest. 80, art. 7). It was decided that there was no
real ground for surprise that the observance of a period after
childbirth should be simply a counsel for Latin women, but obligatory
law for the Greeks. Moreover, since the Greeks perform the rite in a
different way than the Jews of old in not making an offering to the
priest in the Jewish way, and since they sanctify the rite with
suitable prayers, beseeching God to forgive any sins the woman has
committed, and since the patronage of the Virgin Mother of God is
invoked for this very purpose, it was decided on January 8, 1747, by
those whom We had placed in charge of the revision of the Euchologion,
to make no changes in this section. We subsequently approved their
decision.

For it is easy to arrive at a correct understanding of the words quoted
from the Greek prayer, by saying that God is thereby asked both to
cleanse the woman's soul from every sin and to free her body from all
uncleanness, natural not legal, insofar as it indicates a spiritual
uncleanness. For cleanliness of body also is part of the service and
reverence due to the churches and holy things. Therefore in the early
centuries the faithful used to enter the churches only after carefully
washing themselves, as St. John Chrysostom says, and in private they
always washed their hands before touching the volume of the Gospels.

75. We thought We should explain these matters to you in this
encyclical letter, venerable brothers and beloved sons, to inform you
of the reasons why the Apostolic See has for a long time felt that the
laborious task of revising your Euchologion should be undertaken, and
to make known to you the care, zeal and cautious reasoning with which
the work was undertaken and brought to completion. No changes were made
in the oldest and most authoritative euchologies; only what seemed to
have been included in some more recent editions by the credulity or
wickedness of some men was eliminated or emended. Everything was kept
which could possibly be kept, and some benevolent interpretation was
employed to save your Rite from any appearance of attack.

We do not doubt that all of this speaks of Our real love for you and of
the love of the Apostolic See. We are also certain that you will
understand how great Our zeal and concern is that you persevere firmly
in holy union and that the wanderers be recalled one day by God's grace
to the same union and the way of salvation. It is up to you to use this
revised edition of the Euchologion and to see to it carefully that any
new edition of it conforms in every point to this edition, which has
been published in 1754 at the press of the Congregation for the
Propagation of the Faith. This will ensure that all the errors and
nonsense which formerly found their way into and spoiled other editions
will be kept out.

Finally We ask you to assist Us by your prayers in Our difficult task
of governing the universal Church and We lovingly impart to you Our
Apostolic blessing.

Given at Rome in St. Mary Major's on the 1st of March 1756 in the
sixteenth year of Our Pontificate.
