APOSTOLICA CONSTITUTIO (On Preparation for the Holy Year
Pope Benedict XIV
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Benedict XIV of June 26, 1749, in Preparation for
the Holy Year

To all Patriarchs, Archbishops and Bishops.

Venerable Brothers:

Pilgrimages

The Apostolic Constitution which We have recently promulgated announces
to Christ's faithful the celebration of a Holy Year. It summons them to
undertake holy pilgrimages, thus performing a work highly recommended
in the Old Testament, which records the numerous journeys to the holy
places of Jerusalem in the first centuries of the Church. This
continuous custom has brought even emperors and kings to visit the
sacred monuments of this fair City, especially the blessed tomb of the
holy apostles Peter and Paul. Although heretics despise pilgrimages,
Our writers have defended them convincingly. For if such pilgrimages
are organized in a fitting and orderly manner by those who direct the
churches, they unite the strivings of piety and religion; those who
question pilgrimages seriously will understand this.

History of Pilgrimages

2. In the old law God commanded all sons of the Israelites to approach
the Tabernacle or the Temple of the Lord with devotion three times each
year. "On three occasions throughout the year all your males will
appear in the sight of the Lord your God in the place which He has
chosen at the festivals of Azymes, of Weeks and of Tabernacles" (Dt
16). Elcana and his wife Anna carefully obeyed this command (1 Kgs I).
And Our most beloved Redeemer, accompanied by His mother the Blessed
Virgin and His foster- father St. Joseph, came to the Temple at the
appointed times (Lk 2). So in order that even the Gentiles should come
in great numbers to the Temple built by Solomon, Solomon himself
besought God in his kindness to grant the requests of foreign peoples
who visited the Temple after lengthy journeys even if they were not
reckoned among the Israelites: "In addition when the foreigner who is
not of Your people Israel comes from a far land for the sake of Your
name (for Your great name will be heard and Your strong hand and Your
arm outstretched everywhere) . . . You will hear in heaven and in the
firmament of Your habitation and You will do all that the foreigner
asks of You." (3 Kgs 8).

3. Eusebius supplies a shining testimony when he records the arrival of
St. Alexander, bishop of Cappadocia, in Jerusalem to gaze on those holy
places and reverence them, saying: "Alexander was urged on by a divine
oracle when he set out for Jerusalem from Cappadocia, where he had
previously been ordained bishop, both to pray and to visit the places"
(Hist Eccl, bk 6, chap. 11). But a much more eloquent witness to this
practice is given by St. Jerome in epistle 46 (35) in the following
words: "It would be a lengthy undertaking now to review the bishops,
martyrs, and Christian teachers who have visited Jerusalem from the
ascension of the Lord down to the present day. They felt that they had
less devotion, less knowledge, and had not achieved the pinnacle, so to
speak, of the virtues until they had worshipped Christ in those places
where the Gospel first shone from the Cross."

4. It is not Our purpose here to append a long disquisition on the
numerous visits of kings, bishops, prelates, and faithful on continual
pilgrimages to the tombs of the Apostles, particularly since several
famous scholars have previously treated this whole subject. We refer of
course to Onuphrius Pavinus in his treatise On the Eminence of the
Basilica of the Vatican, which We read often before its publication as
it rested safely in the archives of the basilica. At the time, We were
still among the lesser clergy, that is, appointed to the canons of the
Vatican basilica and acting as Prefect of the Archives of this
basilica; We refer also to Jacobus Gretserus, de sacris
Peregrinationibus in tome 4, bk. 2, chap. 12ff, of the new edition of
his works; Coccius, Thes. Catholic., bk. 5, chap. 17; Stanislaus
Hosius, cap. de Caeremoniis; Rutilius Benzonius, de anno Sancti
Jubilaei, bk. 6, chap. lf; Drexellius, tome 13, part 1, chap. 7, pp.
126ff of the Monachian edition; and quite recently Trombelli, de Cultu
Sanctor, tome 1, pt. 2, chap. 46f. But the formula of the monk Marculf
who lived in the seventh century is never mentioned by the above
writers. His formula describes the way letters of recommendation,
written for those setting out on pilgrimages, should be composed. These
letters are addressed to the supreme pontiff and to bishops. This
formula is to be found in bk. 2, chap. 49, and reads as follows: "The
bearer of this, considering hard and toilsome journeys of little
account, not because of idleness (others read: for the sake of
wandering) but in the name of the Lord, and desirous of approaching the
tombs of the blessed apostles of the Lord, Peter and Paul, to gain the
benefits of their prayers, has asked me in my littleness to recommend
him to your kindness." St. John Chrysostom writes thus on this subject:
"in the royal city of Rome emperors, consuls, and military commanders
hasten without their retinue to the tombs of the fisherman and the
tentmaker" (Quod Christus sit Deus, tome 1, p. 570, no. 9, Paris,
1718). Eginhard testifies that the emperor Charlemagne in the course of
forty-seven years, under the spur of devotion, came to Rome four times,
saying: "Charlemagne, within a span of forty-seven years, travelled to
Rome to pray and accomplish what he had vowed." And We must mention the
fine testimony of Nicholas 1, who flourished in the ninth century,
which records the very numerous pilgrimages to this city in honor of
the blessed remains of the Apostle Peter. "So many thousands of men
hastening from every region of the earth betake themselves daily to the
protection and intercession of blessed Peter the prince of the
Apostles, and purpose to remain near his tomb to the very end of their
lives. By analogy with the incident recorded in Acts when the vessel
was let down from heaven in which all kinds of living things were shown
to this same Blessed Peter who is their guide, the Catholic Church is
signified by the City of Rome alone, in which the bodily presence of
this Apostle is carefully reverenced, and which contains as in a vessel
all nations of all animals (whose spiritual significance is men)"
(Epistle 8 to Emperor Michael).

Defense of Pilgrimages

5. However, Our writers have excellently defended the practice of
pilgrimages against the falsehoods of the heretics, and the Church's
prelates have ensured that these pilgrimages are properly conducted and
free from all scandal. Without wishing to compose a dissertation or
treatise, We merely indicate what Jonas, bishop of Orleans, a writer of
the ninth century, wrote against Claudius of Turin who was opposed to
holy images and so to holy pilgrimages as well. We also indicate what
Aegidius Carlerius, Dean of the church of Cameraca, said in his famous
sermon at Basel against the errors of Nicholas the Taborite, in which
he clearly demolished by learned arguments whatever objections his
opponent raised to pilgrimages, as is obvious to the reader of this
sermon in Harduin, Collectionis Conciliorum, tome 8, pp. 1896ff.
Likewise to be borne in mind are the decrees of the second council of
Cabilone in the year 813 (chap. 45) and the fuller expression of the
council of Bourges in the year 1584 (Harduin, tome 10, pp. 1466ff), for
it will be clear that some canons were formed to remove certain
nonsense which had managed to infect holy pilgrimages. And the
information which Laurentius Bochelli carefully assembled on this
subject in in Decretis Ecclesiae Gallicanae, bk. 4, 14, de
Peregrinationibus, should not be passed over in silence.

6. We also know well the two little works of St. Gregory of Nyssa, one
de iis, qui adeunt Jerosolymam and the other ad Eustatiam, Ambrosiam,
et Basilissam (Operum, tome 3, pp. 651ff, Paris, 1638), which the
heterodox often misuse to deride and condemn the journeys of the
faithful to holy places. We realize too that a serious dispute has
arisen among scholars as to the authenticity of these works. Lippomano,
Baronius, Natalis, Alexander, Tillemont, and Ceillerus believe them to
be genuine. On the other hand, Cardinal Bellarmine considers them of
doubtful authenticity. Gretserus even condemns them as forgeries and
apocryphal and attempts to prove this by many arguments in his precise
annotations on p. 71ff in tome 3 of the above edition. But let us leave
the dispute to one side; grant the works to be genuine and grant that
St. Gregory inveighed against the abuses which had infected pilgrimages
to the holy places of Jerusalem. Let us condemn the ridiculous opinion
of those who say that these pilgrimages are altogether necessary for
the attainment of eternal salvation. All of this does not weaken or
destroy the truth We put forward at the start. For We do not insist on
the necessity of sacred journeys, but simply recommend them as
beneficial. We do not defend the nonsense which sometimes develops in
the course of long journeys, but as will later be clear, We prevent
scandals from arising by applying timely remedies. Even if the
over-zealous holy Doctor at times uses a vehement style to attack the
holy pilgrimages to Jerusalem, either some harsh opinions are to be
believed about the inferior morals of pilgrims or about the general
sense and custom of the Church. It considers the holy journeys of
Christians to be pious and devout works, provided that they are
organized with proper modesty and discipline. The Church's judgment is
preferable even to that of a Doctor renowned for his holiness and
teaching.

Responsibilities of Those Going on Pilgrimages

7. We especially recommend pilgrimage to the bishops, provided that
their physical health is good and that no loss will befall their flock
from the absence of the shepherd. Indeed they should remember that many
of their predecessors-at least those who lived reasonably close-came to
the holy city every year to join the Roman Pontiff in celebrating the
feast days of the most holy Apostles Peter and Paul; this is well known
from Letters 13 and 16 of St. Paulinus. We exhort also the priests and
the rest of the clergy to come, provided that they bring dimissorial
letters from their bishops, as is proper. For this law originated in
the earliest centuries of the Church, as is clear from Canons 41 and 42
of the Council of Laodicea in the year 372 (Harduin, tome 1, pp.
789-790). We exhort the Regular clergy also to come, provided that they
obtain the appropriate approval of their superiors. With equal zeal We
exhort the laity to come, provided that they learn properly what they
should do from their parish priest or confessor before they undertake
the journey. However, to prevent the priests or confessors from being
easily misled, they should put the questions to the laity very
carefully according to the theologians, especially Theophilus Raynardus
in his treatise Heteroclita spiritualia (Operum, tome 15, p. 217, no.
13). "A pilgrimage," says Raynardus, "is a work of supererogation and
belongs to voluntary devotion. Its performance is not of equal worth
with acts of virtue which are an obligation. Thus a husband who is
bound to cleave to his wife by the tie of marriage will do evil if he
undertakes a long pilgrimage against the will of his wife and leaves
her at home, etc. Indeed, even if his wife consents, a long pilgrimage
by the husband could constitute an aberration, if the absence might
result in the loss of virtue by either of the spouses. Similarly, it
would be unusual for the father of a family to go on a pilgrimage,
since he is needed at home to support his family. The same judgment
must be made on an impoverished man who chooses to visit the holy
places when the only way he can repay his debts is by staying in some
one place and working."

Everyone knows of the plenary indulgence for sins by Urban II at the
Council of Clermont bestowed on those who enlisted in the holy army for
the recovery of the holy places in Jerusalem and wore the emblem of the
Cross. "Whosoever journeys to Jerusalem to free the Church of God
solely from devotion, and not for the sake of acquiring honor or money
- let that journey be considered a full repentance" - these are the
words of the above-mentioned council which was held in 1095 and are
contained in Labbe's edition, tome 10. To the question of "Whether a
man can take the Cross if there are fears for his continence?" St.
Thomas answers, in accordance with the teaching which We have set out
above, that "it necessarily devolves on a husband to carry his wife's
cross since the husband is the head of his wife. But to take the Cross
and go over the seas lies in the sphere of his own will. Therefore if
his wife cannot go with him because of some impediment and her
continence is questioned, he must not be advised to take the Cross and
leave his wife. The case is different, however, if the wife willingly
proposes continence or wishes and is able to go with her husband"
(quodlibet. 4, art. 11). But We do not discourage even women from
coming to Rome at the time of the year of Jubilee, if it is for their
good and they are not bound by laws of enclosure. For there are many
examples at hand which recommend holy journeys by women. St. Ambrose
describes the haste of St. Helena in going to the holy places. Socrates
records the pilgrimages to Jerusalem of Eudoxia, who married
Theodosius. St. Jerome shows the Roman matron Paula anxious to visit
the places in the Holy Land. With the same great zeal St. Bridget
journeyed to Compostella and Rome to kiss the tomb of the holy
Apostles. During the long period We have spent in this city as a
servant of the Holy See, We have witnessed the repeated arrival of
women of all ages and classes. However, to prevent the enemy sowing
weeds where the cautious father of the family sows wheat, We beseech
those who are entrusted with the protection of discipline and morals to
guard carefully against the sins which easily arise from young women
when they encounter those of different character, disposition, and sex.
But if married women undertake a journey, their brothers should act as
guardians in the absence of their husbands; or at least they should be
entrusted to men whose kinship both frees them from suspicion and makes
them concerned about the preservation of chastity.

Tomb of Peter and Paul

8. It now remains for Us to reveal at last the purpose of Our
exhortation. But We cannot explain this well without first setting out
some noteworthy facts from the holy Fathers and the records of Church
history. St. John Chrysostom asserts that the city of Rome is worthy of
praise because its size, antiquity, beauty, huge population, riches,
and her war-time victories elicit great wonder. But this is not the
chief reason for his commendation. For he saw another object in Rome
which not only elicited praises but in addition, inspired the greatest
love and longing-the sacred remains of the holy Apostles Peter and
Paul, which greatly increase the noble glory and dignity of Rome.
"Therefore," says the holy Doctor, "although I could praise Rome for
other reasons, for its size, its antiquity, its beauty, its huge
population, its power, its riches, and its fine martial feats, I pass
over all these reasons and proclaim Rome blessed for the single reason
that Paul in his lifetime wrote to the Romans and loved them and spoke
to them in person and ended his life there. For this reason then,
rather than all the others, Rome is more famous, and like a great
strong body the city has two shining eyes, the bodies of these saints.
The sky is not so shining when the sun sends forth its rays as the city
of the Romans in its possession of those two lanterns which send forth
light over the whole world" (Homily 32, in Epistolam ad Romanos, tome
9, p. 757, of the edition mentioned earlier). He reverenced the bodies
of the blessed Apostles from afar since he could not gaze on them in
person and impatiently desired to visit Rome. "Who will now give me the
power," he continues, "to embrace the body of Paul, to cleave to his
tomb, to see the dust of that body which brought to completion the work
of Christ, which bore His stigmata and spread abroad in every place His
preaching?" and a little later: "Oh! to see the tomb where lie the arms
of righteousness, the arms of light, and the limbs which now live,
since they were dead in his lifetime while Christ lived in them all,
the members which were crucified to the world, the members of Christ,
which put on Christ, the temple of the Spirit, the holy building, the
limbs which were bound together by the Spirit, which were transfixed by
the fear of God and carried the stigmata of Christ. This body, more
than any towers and walls, protects Rome as if with walls and the body
of Peter accompanies it. For Paul honored him in his lifetime: 'I went
up to see Peter.'"

History of Idolatry

9. So We can safely follow St. John Chrysostom in saying that Our city
with its spacious buildings and its wonderful adornments may justly
attract and please its beholders. However Our prayers and exhortation
to the faithful do not rest on this foundation. The chief glory of Rome
is that the head of the Catholic religion and the center of its unity
established residence here. Because idolatry prevailed in the city for
so long, it is wonderful to see how completely it has been destroyed.
Scholars are acquainted with the opinion of Petrus Angelus Bargaeus in
his well-known letter, de privatorum publicorumque aedificiorum Urbis
Romae eversoribus, in which he tries to prove that the magnificent
theatres, temples, and baths as well as the many images of idols were
not destroyed by the Goths, Vandals, and other savage nations. He
contends that they were demolished by the Roman Pontiffs, especially
St. Gregory the Great, and others so as to remove completely from their
presence all remembrance of idolatrous worship and the provocation of
superstition. But whether or not this is true, he certainly succeeded
in completing a laborious treatise on the profane and superstitious
remains of the pagans interred in the churches. He has also named and
counted the churches which were built upon the foundations of profane
pagan temples; these can still be seen in Rome. So We recommend sacred
pilgrimages in order that the faithful may visit these holy places with
the same spirit of piety which strongly inspired St. John Chrysostom
even though he never was able to visit Rome.

Origin of the Indulgence

10. But We have not yet set out all the reasons for Our present
exhortation. What is said to have occurred in 1300 in the time of
Boniface VIII is well known. At that time a rumor spread that in the
first year of every century a plenary indulgence for sins was granted
to all who approached the tombs of the holy apostles. The originator of
this rumor, which was rife not only in Rome but also in many other
parts of the world, despite a long and careful search, was never found.
Thereupon Boniface VIII at the very turn of the century published his
famous constitution Antiquorum habet fida relatio in which he granted
the fullest forgiveness of sins to all who confessed with true
repentance and visited the basilicas of the Holy Apostles Peter and
Paul fifteen times if they were strangers and thirty times if they were
Romans. And furthermore he conferred forever on the first year in
future centuries the same benefit of most ample indulgences obtainable
on the same conditions. The whole progress of this affair was recorded
by the trustworthy pen of Jacobus Cajetan Cardinal Deacon of St. George
in Velabra, the nephew of this Pontiff, and is printed in Bibliothecae
Maximae Patrum, tome 25, p. 937f, of the Lyons edition. Similarly the
period of a hundred years prescribed by Boniface VIII was reduced to
fifty years by Clement VI, to thirty-three years by Urban VI, and
finally to twenty-five years by Paul 11. Clement VI added a visitation
of the Lateran basilica and Urban VI, of the Liberian basilica. In Our
recently published Constitution, We have made no changes in the
customary practice of the Church, either regarding the churches to be
visited or the number of visits or works prescribed for obtaining
indulgences, except for adding the reception of the Holy Eucharist.

Exhortation

Finally, Our aim is to ensure that the pious works undertaken on these
pilgrimages are accomplished with the proper humility and devotion. For
the performance of these works is mandatory, not just advisable. Now We
address all the faithful with the words with which Augustinus Valerius,
the watchful bishop of the church of Verona (soon to be an excellent
Cardinal of the holy Roman Church), exhorted the beloved people of his
city and diocese in his in Pastorali epistola in 1574. This was
published on the occasion of the Jubilee Gregory XIII solemnized in the
following year. The citation from the epistle is translated from
Italian into Latin: "Brothers, the grace of the Holy Spirit summons you
to Rome in the coming year of Jubilee; likewise the great treasure
which is offered to you invites you. I exhort you all equally for your
part to don the vestment of joy which is the permanent companion of a
good conscience. For so it will come about that on receiving the grace
of sanctification in this year of Jubilee, you will return from the
holy pilgrimage more ready than before to serve God."

St. Charles Borromeo

11. We would similarly like to make Our own, the words used by St.
Charles Borromeo, the famous Archbishop of the church of Milan, in two
letters to the flock entrusted to him, written in Italian in order to
be understood by all. The first letter was written on September 10,
1574, that is, in the year preceding the Jubilee proclaimed by Gregory
XIII, the second in the year 1576 when the time of Jubilee was over. We
are glad to reproduce a portion from each letter in a Latin
translation. In the earlier letter he writes: "The opportunity which
brings these great advantages for your souls, dearest sons, is not to
be despised. Do not, we beseech you, reject this great benefit because
you fear the journey will tire you temporarily. Reflect on how
diligently you pursue earthly benefits and advantages. For their sake
you readily undertake long dangerous journeys, without being deterred
by toil, pain, or discomfort. Shame on you then if you are more
concerned with your body than your soul. For if it is a matter of
gaining freedom from a temporal burden, some of you do not hesitate to
undertake very difficult journeys, but this holy pilgrimage obtains
freedom from many serious sins which encumber the soul. Because it is
so advantageous for the soul, you ought to be inspired to undertake
this holy journey. The traditional devotion of the faithful and the
ancient example of peoples and princes summon you." St. Charles wrote
the second letter when the year of Jubilee had ended. The Pope at St.
Charles' request had transferred the plenary indulgence of the Jubilee
to Milan for the benefit of those who had not gone to Rome in the
preceding year. This is what St. Charles said: "You know how we prayed
last year that all of you should make a pilgrimage to Rome and not let
any business or hindrance deter you. We encouraged everyone to hasten
to gain spiritual riches for himself and to reverence the Church by
going to Rome. By so doing, one could obtain in person the Apostolic
blessings, revere the holy bodies of blessed Peter and Paul and the
relics of the other saints, and see the ancient, venerable churches and
other places which the blood of martyrs has stained and consecrated.
For that City was singled out when God established there forever the
See of St. Peter, the infallible truth of the Catholic Faith and the
magisterium of discipline and morals. The earth, walls, altars,
churches, martyrs' tombs, and every view of the city presents some holy
object to the mind; those who visit those holy retreats in a properly
prepared state feel and know this. Hence We many times exhorted you by
voice and urged you on by letter and advised you by the example of our
own pilgrimage, since we felt we should lead you in this situation."

Importance of Instruction

12. We thought We could end Our encyclical letter now, but contrary to
Our preconceived expectation, many points still remain to be dealt
with. The fathers of the second synod of Cabilona in 813 in Canon 45
mention several foolish practices which were common in their time on
the occasion of pilgrimages and which perhaps could occur even in our
day. "For some make a serious mistake," says the canon, "and travel to
Rome, Tours, and other places without instruction, under the pretext of
prayer. Some priests, deacons, and other clerics who live carelessly
think that they will be cleansed from sins and fulfill their ministry
if they arrive at the aforesaid places. Likewise some lay people think
they are safe from the penalties of past or present sins by thronging
to these places. They are so senseless as to think that the mere
visitation of holy places cleanses them of their sins" (Harduin, tome
4, p. 1039). The abbot Albert von Staden in his Chronico similarly
records other foolish notions of succeeding times which render the
pilgrimages of the faithful ineffectual. "I have never or hardly ever
seen anyone who came back improved from lands over sea or the tombs of
the saints." To meet those abuses the fathers of Cabilona prescribed
the following remedies: "Those who have confessed their sins and have
been advised by their priests to do penance, show praiseworthy devotion
in wishing to visit the tombs of the Apostles or other saints while
praying urgently, giving alms, correcting their way of life, and
putting their morals in order." The abbot of Staden also does not
conceal the remedies, saying: "I think this results when they neither
leave nor come back with proper devotion: for they should set out with
the attitude that they are about to depart this life." Therefore We
should concentrate on obviating all these evils and on explaining the
necessary preconditions for receiving indulgences.

13. As everyone knows, several months intervene between the issue at
Rome of the Bull proclaiming the year of Jubilee and the actual start
of this Holy Year. Continuing the ancient practice of the Church, the
holy door is opened on the next vigil of the Birth of the Lord; then
the Year of Jubilee begins. We use these intervening months to hold
missions in different districts of Rome. We highly recommended their
usefulness in Our pastoral Edicts when We were Archbishop of Bologna.
These appeared in print and were soon translated into Latin. We impress
upon the evangelical laborers in missions to instruct the people in
order to explain the Catholic doctrine of indulgences and of the
universal Jubilee, rather than in purely academic questions of
Apologetic and Moral Theology. The faithful must be fully aware that
sin and its eternal punishment are remitted by the Sacrament of Penance
if one makes proper use of it; however the entire temporal punishment
is very seldom taken away. This must be removed either by satisfactory
works in this life or by the fire of Purgatory after death. The holy
Council of Trent in session 6, chap. 4, and canon 30 of the same
session teaches this under the heading de Justificatione. Inform the
Christian people of the unfailing treasury in the Church which was
constituted by the immeasurable abundance of the merits of Christ and
increased by the merits of His saints. Distribution from this treasury
has been entrusted by Christ the Lord to His vicar on earth, the Roman
Pontiff; consequently the Pontiff prudently decides when these merits
can be applied, either by way of absolution for the living or by way of
prayer for the dead, provided that the living have destroyed their sin
and its eternal punishment by Penance, and that the dead have departed
this life united with God in charity. This distribution of merits is in
the form of indulgences. When one obtains one, he is freed from the
temporal punishment due to sins to the extent granted and defined by
the lawful distributor. This we read in the constitutions of the
Supreme Pontiffs and especially in the famous Decretal of Our
Predecessor Leo X to Cardinal Tommaso de Vio, otherwise known as
Cajetan, when he was serving as Apostolic Legate in Germany. The result
is that the practice of indulgences is most beneficial to Christians;
hence the evil idea which either denies the benefit of indulgences or
deprives the Church of the power of conferring them is to be condemned.
This was decided by the Council of Trent, session 25, in the decree on
Indulgences. Finally, the Christian people must be advised that the
Indulgence of the Jubilee year is a plenary one, but is distinguished
from other plenary indulgences also distributed on the occasion of the
Jubilee by the fact that in a holy year of Jubilee, confessors
designated for this purpose receive a wider power both of absolving
from sins and of dispensing from certain bonds and impediments which
often ensnare the consciences of penitents.

Constitution of Leo X

14. We feel it is appropriate to reproduce here the constitution which
Leo X promulgated: "We indicate to you by the present document that the
Roman Pontiff can forgive sin and can remove the punishment due to
actual sins- sin by means of the sacrament of Penance, and the temporal
punishment by means of ecclesiastical indulgence. He can for reasonable
causes grant indulgences to the faithful who are members of Christ, be
they in this life or in Purgatory. The Church can, by Apostolic
authority, grant an indulgence both for the living and the dead. It is
accustomed both to confer the indulgence itself by way of absolution
and to transfer it by way of prayer; accordingly all, both living and
dead, who have obtained these indulgences are freed from as much
temporal punishment due to their actual sins as corresponds to the
indulgence which was granted and acquired. We decree etc. by Our
Apostolic authority etc. that this doctrine must be held and preached
by all."

Instruction of the Faithful

15. This will sufficiently inform the people on the subject of
indulgences. But since special pains must be taken to ensure that the
faithful do seek indulgences, the clergy should provide further
instruction. With Apostolic zeal they should attack in their preaching
the vices of the age which flourish everywhere, remembering the words
of Isaiah 58: "Cry out; do not stop. Raise up your voice as a trumpet
and announce their crimes to My people, their sins to the house of
Jacob." Let them proclaim the need for penance and insist on the
inevitable loss of the soul unless sins are destroyed by means of
repentance, as is conveyed in the saying of Christ the Lord, Luke 13:
"Unless you do penance, you will all likewise perish." In addition, let
them extol the riches of God's mercy which are poured out for those who
completely cast off their former evil ways and provide themselves with
a new heart and a new spirit. All the while they should be aware of the
Lord's words in Ezekiel 18: "Be converted and do penance for all your
iniquities, and you shall not be destroyed by iniquity. Cast from you
all your prevarications and make yourselves a new heart and a new
spirit.... For I do not wish for the death of the one who is dying,
says the Lord God, turn again and live." And in chapter 33: "As I live,
says the Lord God, I do not wish for the death of the sinner, but
rather that the sinner be converted from his way and live."

Benefits of Confession

16. When they have dwelt on the virtue of penance, they should then
preach on the sacrament of Penance redoubling their exhortations and
advice to the faithful to enter on the year of Jubilee with the proper
dispositions, fortified by this most wholesome sacrament. Then they
should teach the people how to make a beneficial confession and explain
the absolute necessity for repeating former void confessions.
Furthermore they should encourage even those who do not consider
themselves obliged to do so, to confess again their past sins in the
sacrament of Penance and to make a general confession of their sins.
"Although it is not necessary to confess the same sins twice, still We
consider it salutary to do so on account of the shame felt, which is so
large a part of repentance," as Our predecessor Benedict XI wrote in
his decretal Inter cunctas de Privilegiis, to be found among his
general Occasional Decretals. St. Charles Borromeo writes in agreement
with this view in his ad Confessarios Monitis, a work which Our
predecessor Innocent XII had reprinted in Rome to be an example and
pattern for those who hear confessions. "Confessors," says St. Charles,
"should encourage their penitents to make a general confession, having
regard to the nature of each person and the suitability of time and
place. This way, in reviewing their past, they may return to the Lord
with greater eagerness, making good any mistakes from previous
confessions."

17. St. Francis de Sales, in many of his writings, recommends the
benefit to be derived from general confessions. We cite here in Latin
translation the gentle words he wrote in a letter to a woman who had
been widowed: "I have received a letter from your father requesting me
to reveal to him some measure which would assist him in saving his
soul. I gladly, and perhaps more readily than I should, accede to his
desire. The advice I am giving him can be summed up in two points: one
is the careful and comprehensive examination of his previous life
followed by a general confession and corresponding repentance. For no
good man avoids this before death. The second point consists in aiming
at a gradual detachment of the mind from the attractions of the world."
The text of this letter can be found in tome I of his Operum, p. 914,
no. 6, Paris, 1669. Benefits from general confessions during holy
missions are referred to in the Italian biography of St. Vincent de
Paul, founder of the Congregation of the Mission. Hence the Rules of
this Congregation, approved by the Holy See, state that one of their
ministries is: "to encourage and hear general confessions of a
penitent's entire earlier life." The words of Urban VIII contained in
the bull Salvatoris nostri, confirming the establishment of this
Congregation, have the same tenor, for he recommends the beneficial
practice of general confession as follows: "From the abundant success
of these (i.e. of the works and ministries proper and peculiar to the
institution of the Congregation), it seems manifest that this pious
institute is most acceptable to God, of great benefit to men, and
altogether necessary: for by means of it the practice of sacramental
confession and of general confession and of the most holy Eucharist has
become frequent, although previously it was rare."

Hence Our predecessor Innocent XII, reflecting on the serious losses
which can result from the making of past invalid confessions, exhorts
each pilgrim before his departure to make a general confession. This
exhortation is in the Instruction which he published after the
proclamation of the year of Jubilee. Here is Our Latin translation of
his words: "The one who is on the point of leaving (on a pilgrimage)
should first make a valid general confession; he should be advised of
this in order to cure any possible defects of his previous
confessions." Assuredly directors of conscience agree unanimously that
general confession is beneficial. The entire account of one's life is
reviewed and this results in fear and humility; a greater horror of sin
develops; one's strength is increased to meet and rout any temptation
to evil; a most pleasant peace and quiet enters the mind and the
defects of previous confessions are repaired.

Advice to Confessors

18. We know well that sacramental confessions - whether made to remove
everyday faults, to rectify invalid confessions, or to gather together
all the sins of one's life - will only produce the desired results if
they are heard by ministers of Penance who are upright, learned, and
properly educated in the sound doctrine of the Church. When We were in
charge of the Archbishopric of Bologna, We appointed as ministers of
Penance only those whom We personally or others in Our presence
approved after an examination in which they had to give substantial
proof of morals and doctrine. We did not give anyone unlimited
authority to hear confessions. Rather, We granted a limited authority
for a short period of time in order that, once proven, they might be
examined a second time either by Ourselves or by others in Our
presence. Although this was a great bother to confessors, it was of
great benefit to penitents. Currently, however, We are so engaged in
governing the universal Church, a task practically beyond Our strength,
that We have left the examination of confessors for the city of Rome to
the judgment of other trustworthy men. Only when Lent approaches do We
indicate to Preachers and Parish Priests whom We have convened all
matters which are beneficial to their position and to the salvation of
souls. But a much more important reason impels Us to address all
confessors on the occasion of the coming year of Jubilee, and
accordingly to offer them the following advice and exhortations in the
strongest possible words and with vehemence of spirit.

19. In the first place We remind them that they are guilty of serious
sin if, while sitting in the holy tribunal of Penance, they hear their
penitents carelessly without advising or questioning them, but
immediately pronouncing the form of absolution when the penitent has
completed the list of sins. Such a procedure is, of course, far
different from that of a skilful doctor who pours oil and wine on the
wound. Yet every minister of the sacrament of Penance does a doctor's
work. So they should examine carefully not only the circumstances of
the sins but also the character and disposition of the one who has
committed the sins; then the minister can prescribe the appropriate
remedies to enable him to obtain the salvation of his soul. "But the
priest should be discerning and prudent, so that as an experienced
doctor does, he likewise may pour oil and wine on the wounds of the
afflicted person by carefully investigating the circumstances both of
the sinner and of the sin. Thus he may discover the proper advice to
offer and the proper remedy to apply by taking different measures for
the cure of the sick man." These are the words of Our famous
predecessor Innocent III at the General Council of the Lateran, chapter
Omnis utriusque sexus, de Poenitentiis et remissionibus. The Roman
Ritual approved by Paul V, likewise Our predecessor, in an Apostolic
Constitution, agrees with this doctrine, where it states under the
heading de Sacramento Poenitentiae: "If the penitent does not mention
the number, kind, and circumstances of sins, the priest should
prudently question him." But if the confessor knows that the penitent
has not confessed certain sins, whether from forgetfulness or
ignorance, the confessor must circumspectly and prudently remind him of
his omissions since otherwise the confession would lack completeness.
He must warn and correct him that by proper preparation, he may obtain
the fruit of the sacrament of Penance. This is the opinion of St.
Bernardine of Siena, who answers in the affirmative the question
whether the confessor is obliged to investigate and examine the
conscience of the sinner carefully. He says that "this is to be done
not only regarding omissions through carelessness or shame but also
regarding his ignorant silence, because sinners do not know the things
of God. So, if the confessor hears anything from the penitent or knows
of anything through a probable conjecture, he should remind him of it.
Otherwise, it may be feared that the penitent is crassly ignorant,
which according to William does not excuse him. Perhaps though he does
not know that such an act is a sin, for according to Isidore the
ignorant man sins every day and does not know it" (tome 2, serm. 27,
art. 2, chap. 3, p. 167).

20. The theologians give clear direction in these cases, even those not
known as strict disciplinarians. For We are not here discussing
so-called invincible ignorance of positive law, when the penitent has
fallen into some sin known only to the confessor, which could occasion
greater evil if the penitent was made aware of it. We are speaking of
vincible ignorance, when the penitent either does not know certain
actions to be sins, although he should know it, or he is surrounded by
circumstances of action which confirm the sinner in evildoing if the
confessor passes them by without comment. This would then scandalize
others, who could infer that certain acts are permissible from seeing
them done without penalty by persons who regularly receive the Church's
sacraments. In these cases the opinion of the theologians is unanimous
that a confessor must assist the penitent by advice and questioning,
even when he sees that this will make the penitent sorrowful. But if at
the time the result does not correspond to the advice of the confessor,
there is still hope that it will be of benefit later on, since God is
helping. Among theologians of the Order of Preachers or of those who
accept the teaching of St. Thomas, reference may be made to Solo, in 4.
Sententiar., dist. 18, quest. 2, sect. 4, and Silvius, in 3. par. D.
Thomae, vol. 4, quest. 9, arts. 2 to 7. Among the students of the
Franciscan family and the other disciples of Scotus, Cardinal de
Laureaea, in 4. Sentent., vol. 2, de Sacrament. Poeniten., disp. 21,
art. 3, n. 64ff. Among the writers of the Society of Jesus: Suarez, in
3. part. D. Thomae, vol. 4, disp. 32, sects. 3 and 4; Theophilus
Reynaudus, vol. 16, Heteroclit. spiritual., pt. 9, n. 4; Cardinal
Antonius, tract. de Poenitent., art. 3, quest. 3; and Cardinal de Lugo,
de Sacram. Poenitent., disp. 22, sect. 2, where in his burning zeal for
the salvation of souls he attacks the lazy confessors of bishops,
prelates, princes, and governors who, though they hear no
self-accusation for sins which are public knowledge, stay silent, and
with no exhortation dispense the grace of absolution after a hasty
decision.

"In the second place," he says, "I consider what must be said of the
obligation of confessors of prelates, princes, governors and suchlike
when they see or know that their penitents do not really fulfill their
duty in conferring benefits, selecting ministers or in governing their
subjects, in giving alms from the excess of the church revenues or the
like. In these cases it should be noted that ignorance is seldom
invincible and without fault. Also their ignorance is seldom not a
scandal to their subjects, who readily believe that what they observe
their prelates and princes doing is permissible, or at least not very
harmful. Therefore the confessor is obliged to advise all penitents of
their obligations. He does not fulfill his function by absolving the
sins which the penitent tells him; if he does only this, then he is
responsible for what his penitent overlooked. Then as a blind man
leading the blind, they both will fall into the eternal pit. So if he
trembles in the presence of the powerful, let him not take on himself
the office of shepherd, but modestly excuse himself as one less fit to
bear that burden." This salutary opinion of Cardinal de Lugo refers not
only to those who hear the confessions of bishops and princes. It also
binds equally all confessors who hear the confessions of penitents
whose morals and example are a proximate occasion of sin, if not of
externally sinful actions at least of evil desires and morose
delectations, and who in spite of this customarily accommodate
themselves to the penitent unaffected by any concern for manifesting
the miserable state of a sinful life.

21. Another warning for confessors is this, that if it should happen
(and it tends to happen rather often) that the minister of confession
hears something from his penitents which deserves to be specially
investigated, he should beware of responding by intuition, but should
devote suitable time and thought to the matter before settling it. It
would certainly be desirable that every confessor should be endowed
with what is called "eminent" knowledge, but since this is given to few
men, it is wholly necessary that each be provided with at least
competent knowledge. More cannot be expected: since moral theology
deals with so many important questions which depend on a knowledge of
the sacred canons and the apostolic constitutions, it is obviously a
hard task for anyone to know all these well and immediately to solve
every question as those men often do who excel in eminent knowledge. It
will then be sufficient if confessors of lesser mark duly settle the
more difficult questions by consulting books. Our predecessor Innocent
IV wisely observes: "We consider a knowledge eminent if it can discuss
and define subtle problems and quickly find their solutions. But that
man has an average knowledge who can investigate matters in a certain
manner; although he cannot answer all questions, he can search out the
truth in books and so does not arrive at all his solutions quickly" (in
Commentariis ad Cap., Cum in cunctis, no. 2, under the heading de
electione, et electi potestate. So when a more difficult question or a
new kind of deed is reported to the confessor and he must consequently
consult books, he must do so carefully and selectively. For it is well
known that among so many writings there are some whose opinions and
assertions do not well agree with the simplicity of the Gospel and the
teaching of the holy Fathers. "Many opinions advocate a relaxation of
Christian discipline and bring ruin to souls, some being old opinions
revived, others newly invented, and the great license of rank minds
grows daily more extravagant. By this means, a way of thinking
completely at variance with the simplicity of the Gospel and the
teaching of the holy Fathers has crept in concerning matters of
conscience. If the faithful should adopt it as correct, a mighty
corruption of the Christian life would ensue," to quote Our predecessor
Alexander VII (decree published September 7, 1665). On this subject We
do not want to use plainer speech; We do not want to touch on the
disputed questions of the trustworthiness of authors and the soundness
of their doctrine. It will be enough to advise confessors not to rely
on their own opinion in a doubtful matter. Before judging the case they
should refer to as many books as possible, especially those with more
substantial doctrine, and then support the opinion which reason
suggests and authority confirms. This is exactly what We taught in Our
encyclical on usury where We wrote: "They should not cleave excessively
to their own private opinions, but before giving an answer they should
examine many authors who are especially commended and then take the
side which they see is upheld both by reason and authority" (Bullarii
nostri, tome 1, ord. 143, sect. 8). We repeat this advice now. For Our
statement is not limited to matters of usury, but refers also to all
matters which can in any way contribute to the sacramental forum or the
proper direction of consciences.

22. In the third place We advise confessors to consider the celebrated
saying of venerable Cardinal Bellarmine: "there would not be such ready
sinning if there were not such ready absolution." We also advise them
to recall the propositions Our predecessors anathematized, especially
propositions 60-63, condemned by Innocent XI on March 2, 1679, and so
to learn the cases in which absolution is to be granted, denied, or
deferred. "The diligent priest should understand when and to whom
absolution should be granted, denied, or deferred. He should not
absolve those who give no signs of sorrow or are unwilling to lay aside
hate and enmity, to make restitution to others if they are able, to
leave the proximate occasion of sin or to abandon sins in other ways
and to change their life for the better. Nor should he absolve those
who have given public scandal, unless they make public satisfaction and
remove the scandal." These are the words not of a theologian of the
stricter school, but of the Roman Ritual. This also commands
confessors, in cases where they deny or defer absolution, to explain to
their penitents in a mild spirit and gentle words the reasons for their
doing so, and show them that it is necessary to do so for the salvation
of their souls. Then they should encourage them to return as soon as
possible and inspire them to perform properly everything which they are
commanded before their return; then when they return to the sacramental
court, they may receive absolution. But when they grant absolution,
especially to those who seldom approach the sacrament of Penance or
only when burdened with many sins, they should exhort them continually.
They should emphasize to them the wretched life they have lived under
the yoke of sin and explain the vileness of their sins in order, of
course, that they may be heartily sorry and seriously resolve to
abandon sin in the future. For it is considered that strong serious
exhortations by confessors delivered in the forum of Penance are much
more effective than the holy sermons of preachers in separating a
penitent from his sins. For the hearers of sermons tend to refer the
criticism they hear to others rather than to themselves. This, however,
cannot occur in the case of a private warning from one's confessor
which strikes one individual penitent and is brandished before his eyes
unalloyed with any palliation of or excuse for his sins. Confessors
should not reply that this is impossible when the large number of
penitents encourages brevity, for the golden statement of St. Francis
Xavier resolves this difficulty: "He considered that penitents should
be helped carefully, not hurriedly, advising that confessors should
prefer to hear a few confessions properly than many at a rash speed"
(Tursellini in ejus Vita [S. Francisci Xaverii], bk. 6, chap. 17).

23. Our fourth point concerns satisfaction, the final part of the
sacrament of Penance and necessary for its completeness. Our loving
mother the Church, in sympathy for human weakness, has softened in some
ways primitive severity and abandoned the practice of the Penitential
canons. "In the weakness of our times when not only men's merits but
their bodies are weak, that ancient strict censure is not allowed to
remain for all offenses" (in Can. Fraternitatis, dist. 34). Therefore
it is not right for confessors to rashly impose a sacramental
satisfaction as a whim, but in so doing they should unite the laws of
justice, prudence, and fairness. "In ordaining a penalty for
satisfaction, the priests will consider that nothing is to be imposed
from their own judgment, but all is to be guided by justice, prudence,
and piety. This is laid down in the Roman catechism for the use of
priests, which was composed at the command of the Council of Trent and
published by Our predecessor St. Pius V under the heading de
Poenitentia. The Council of Trent ordained these matters when it laid
down this salutary doctrine: "Therefore the priests of the Lord should
impose salutary and fitting satisfaction as their spirit and their
prudence suggest, in accordance with the kind of sins and the means of
the penitents. In this way, they can avoid sharing in the sins of
others by perhaps overlooking their sins and dealing too leniently with
penitents in imposing very light works for the gravest faults. But they
should be conscious that the satisfaction is not only a guardian of
their new life and a medicine against weakness, but also a punishment
and chastisement for their past sins. For, as the ancient Fathers
believe and teach, the keys of the priests were given not for loosing
alone but also for binding" (chap. 8, session 14, de poenitentia).
However, a knowledge of the penitential canons will assist the
confessor in getting sinners to readily accept the suitable
satisfaction imposed on them. For although he should not resume the
practice of those Canons, he can still use them to explain the measure
of the penalties formerly laid down for these sins. The penitent as a
result will both recognize the great malice of sin and gladly accept
the satisfaction imposed on him, although otherwise it might have
seemed too severe to him. He will do so, of course, after comparing his
punishment with what he would have suffered for the same sins if he had
approached a confessor in the far-off days when the penitential canons
were in force, before the kind discipline of the Church softened the
severity of the old Canons. This is the conclusion too of many authors
outstanding for piety and doctrine. We recorded their names in in
nostro Tractatu de Synodo, bk. 7, chap. 62, and think it ineffective to
repeat them here. We do add, however, that the life and morals of the
faithful who come to the sacrament of confession in Our day are far
different from the kind of life which once won praise for glorious
Agnes, renowned for her imperial rank and her pursuit of piety. For
when she came to Rome to do reverence at the tombs of the Apostles, she
revealed all the stains of her former life in the sacramental forum to
Blessed Peter Damian, an excellent Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church,
and left the confessional without any satisfaction being imposed on her
by a confessor so famous for his goodness and doctrine.

24. Blessed Peter Damian speaks of this event in Opusculo, 56, chap. 5
in tome 3, p. 432, of his Operum (Paris edition) and treats it as an
example for others. "So that those who converge on the tombs of the
Apostles may imitate your holy devotion even in the secret
confessional, I will affirm that you made me sit before the holy altar,
and through sorrowful groans and bitter sighs you gave a faithful
account of every slight and minute affection of the depths of your
humanity and of every vanity in your thoughts and every superfluity in
your speech. You covered your life from age five to now. In turn I
decided to impose no penance beyond repeating the praise of the divine
mission: 'Do what you are doing, continue the work you are engaged in'
and the message of the Angel to those in Theatyra: 'I will not send
another burden on you, only keep what you have' (Ap 2). For, as God is
witness, I did not impose even a day's fasting or other punishment, but
I commanded you only to persevere in the holy works you had begun."

25. But in our day, on the other hand, there are many sinners (among
whom We Ourselves are reckoned as no doubt were others in Blessed Peter
Damian's time) who not only in the general confession of their sins,
but also in the many confessions they make each year are burdened with
serious sins. So in the sacred forum of Penance they are liable to make
the satisfaction which corresponds to the seriousness of the sins in
accordance with the canons of the Council of Trent. This is especially
important since they produce few, if any, good works if they remain in
their accustomed manner of life, and do not, as they should, equably
bear the pains which sometimes afflict them. Consequently they lose the
richer fruit which the prayers of the Church request from God for
penitents in these words: "That whatever good you do, or whatever ill
you patiently endure, may be for you a remission of sins, an increase
of grace, and the reward of eternal life."

26. Here then, venerable brothers, We have presented the entire list of
what We have done or decreed to be done, so that all the inhabitants of
Our City may receive the spiritual fruits of the Holy Year. We wish you
to take the same measures so that your people who, in the coming year
will undertake holy pilgrimages to this City, may obtain equal benefit
and the same abundance of heavenly blessings. What We have hitherto
said on the subject of pilgrims making a sacramental confession before
their departure had already been decreed by the Council of Bourges in
1584: "Whosoever makes a pilgrimage to the holy places should be
fortified by the due and complete confession of their sins and by the
sacrament of the Eucharist before they set out" (canon 2 in Harduin,
tome 10, pp. 1466f). Our predecessor Innocent XII echoes this teaching
in his proclamation of the year of Jubilee in 1700; in his
proclamation, he especially insists on a salutary expiation of sins,
saying: "Be sanctified, therefore, most beloved sons, and prepare your
hearts for the Lord. Be washed, be pure, remove your evil thoughts from
God's sight and, renewed in the spirit of your mind, be urgent in
prayers, fast often, and give alms." To prevent the conclusion that he
addressed these words only to Romans, he wisely added words to include
others. "Adorned furthermore with these ornaments of the Christian
life, fortified with the aid of the virtues, come with confidence,
impetuously and with a holy speed of spirit, to this holy city of God
on earth as to the throne of grace, that you may obtain mercy."

27. We are perfectly confident that on your way to this city (provided
that the ministry of your pastoral office permits it), whether on your
journey or while you dwell in Rome, you will want to emulate the mode
of living which St. Charles Borromeo decided to embrace on his
pilgrimage to Rome for the year of Jubilee in 1575. This holy
pilgrimage of the excellent prelate is described by Charles of St.
Peter's basilica, bishop of Novaria, in the third book of the History
he composed on the life and deeds of St. Charles. We hope that in the
course of the journey and its various stopovers, the pilgrims will not
trouble the bishops there who must take watchful precautions against
the development of the scandals that in times past occasioned some to
speak ill of holy pilgrimages. When they arrive in Rome, We shall
zealously see to it that they lead an upright and moral life, perform
the prescribed works properly, visit the basilicas, and practice
various acts of Christian penance. We devote great zeal and effort to
ensure that all pilgrims return home, permanently improved by the
example of holy living which flourishes in Rome, firm in the faith,
fervent in virtue, and confirmed in their obedience to the Holy See. We
share the desire of Our predecessor and fellow citizen Gregory XII as
he solemnized the year of Jubilee which recurred in his time, as is
clear from the annals of his reign, bk. 3, chap. 24. Now that these
matters have been decided in this way, We have a firm hope that with
the Lord's help, to whom We recommend this entire affair with Our most
humble prayers, the pilgrims will return to their own land undeserving
of the censure with which St. Jerome insults some who had made holy
pilgrimages to the city of Jerusalem. "It is not praiseworthy merely to
have been in Jerusalem, but to have led a good life at Jerusalem" (in
epist. 58, ad Paulinum, Operum, tome 1, p. 318, Verona edition).

28. For the whole year of Jubilee, penitentiary priests and others
designated to hear confessions will be available in Rome. They will be
given the appropriate powers to hear penitents and grant deserved
absolution and dispensation, both for those who live in Rome and those
who come there from other places, to enable them to obtain the
spiritual riches of the Holy Year. In this period of time preachers of
the word of God will be plentiful. We shall speak Ourselves and
designate others to speak also, but in so doing We shall not enter on
theological controversies which involve merely the disputes of the
different schools. Both We Ourselves and those who speak in Our name
will be concerned with explaining clearly the force and significance of
the phrasing of that section of Our Bull which refers "to the faithful
who are truly repentant, have confessed their sins, and been refreshed
by holy communion." We shall likewise show by fact and examples how
worthless and vain is the opinion of those exiles from the Catholic
communion who falsely assert that repentance is lessened or even
destroyed by the use of indulgences. Furthermore, to forestall the
suspicion that We or those who preach by Our authority will adopt the
stricter opinion, We will employ the same method which the renowned
Father Bourdaloue of the Society of Jesus recommended and employed in
his Sermon delivered just before the year of Jubilee (Sermonum, tome 2,
p. 517ff, Paris 1709, 2nd edition).

In the time that We spent in Bologna, We repeatedly issued Our
instructions to the people. These were first collected in several tomes
and soon were gathered in one folio volume in a Latin translation. In
one Instruction (tome 3, 12 of the Italian edition, no. 53 of the
Latin), passing by the disputes of the theologians, We exhorted the
entire people of Our diocese on the occasion of the Plenary Indulgence
proclaimed by Our predecessor Clement XII, to add other works of piety
to the works prescribed and to produce fruits worthy of repentance. We
cited for them the golden statement of venerable Cardinal Bellarmine
(Controversiarum in tractatu de Indulgentiis, tome 2, bk. 1, chap. 12,
sect. 3): "Wise Christians receive Papal indulgences in their zeal to
produce fruits worthy of repentance, and at the same time to make
satisfaction to God for their sins." But We also added the remark of
Cardinal Pallavicinus in his in Historia Concilii Tridentini bk. 24,
chap. 12, no. 6, that those are wrong who think that by using
indulgences, Christians become lazy and distracted from making proper
satisfaction to God who punishes our sins. Indeed since men are wholly
uncertain that they have in reality obtained the fruit of indulgences,
this is an added incitement for many to strengthen their hopes by
renewing their practice of salutary works. Moreover the works
prescribed for obtaining indulgences increase piety when they are put
into practice, and as is daily experienced they introduce a new habit
which enables its possessor to perform more readily the other works of
virtue. Boniface VIII prescribed visits to the basilicas-fifteen times
for visitors and thirty times for Romans-and made the obtaining of
indulgences dependent on this work. But he did not for this reason pass
over in silence the other works of virtue; rather in his occasional
decretal Antiquorum, de poenitentiis, et remissionibus, which is found
among his general occasional decretals, he expressly adds: "Each
person, however, will merit more and will more effectively obtain an
Indulgence the oftener and the more devoutly he visits the basilicas."
These words agree closely with those which We emphasized above. Those
advised the faithful to practice other relevant works apart from the
prescribed ones. The words of the traditional formula for a solemn
blessing used by Our predecessors and Ourselves express the same
meaning. For when the ceremony of blessing is completed, a Plenary
indulgence is granted. Then humble prayers are also made to God to
confer on the people present not only "perseverance in good works, but
also a continually repentant heart," that is, a heart duly prepared for
new works of repentance to atone for past sins, even though hopefully
the fault of past sins and their punishment has been remitted in the
sacrament of penance, and the temporal punishment which remains has
been washed away by the previously granted Indulgence.

29. We read in the lives of Our Predecessors Zacharias and Paschal, by
the renowned Anastasius, that several guest houses were built near the
church on the Vatican, to welcome and refresh pilgrims who had come to
visit the tombs of the Apostles. These buildings, either in the passage
of time or by human harm have long been destroyed. But the Romans have
built others in different parts of the city which are always open to
pilgrims who arrive in this city to reverence the tombs of the blessed
apostles and obtain the treasures of indulgences especially in a holy
year of Jubilee, to supply in full measure the necessities both for
bodily nourishment and spiritual refreshment with the aid of upright
priests. These are the matters We judged We should indicate to you. And
with the full benevolence of Our spirit We confer on you and on your
whole flock the Apostolic Blessing.

Given at Castelgandolfo on the 26th of June 1749 in the ninth year of
Our Pontificate.
