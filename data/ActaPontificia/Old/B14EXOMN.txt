EX OMNIBUS (On the Apostolic Constitution Unigenitus)
Pope Benedict XIV
__________________________________________________________________

Encyclical of Pope Benedict XIV promulgated on 16 October 1756.

To Our Venerable Brothers, Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, and
Archbishops and Bishops of France.

Greetings and Apostolic Blessing.

From all the regions of the Christian world to which our pastoral care
extends, many things have made us concerned for the state of each and
every church. But We have been especially troubled by the controversies
and dissensions afflicting the flourishing Catholic nation of France
some years ago. We did not cease, during the whole time of your
disturbance, to ask the God of peace to restore a true and solid
tranquillity to your disturbed church. Often too by Apostolic letters
We sought the help of Louis, the Christian King of France, for the
protection and defense of ecclesiastical peace. We have declared
Ourselves ready to sacrifice the remainder of Our life for the peace of
the French church, which We embrace with a sincere and constant love.
We have also supported proposals for redress that were apt and suitable
to cure the malady, if they were likely to succeed and if they seemed
to approach the intended end.

Support from France

2. The letters which the French Assembly sent Us on October 31 of last
year relieved some of Our concern. Indeed, reading them, We learned of
your unanimous constancy in preserving true and salutary doctrine, and
in retaining your age-old veneration of the Apostolic See of Blessed
Peter, the center of Catholic unity. Nor did we find any dissension
among you regarding canonical rules and principles; the only
differences concern the choice of means for applying the common
principles in practice. Although this is a most undesirable state of
affairs, it should not be a cause of wonder for those who know that
dissension in serious matters has arisen among other bishops renowned
for their learning and holiness. We have been further consoled by the
exceptional piety of the king, a piety joined with his hereditary
submission to this Apostolic See. This is clear not only from his
recent letter dated December 19 of last year (which included the
aforementioned letter of the clergy), but also in all his other
writings. We have always understood the French king, whose thinking
greatly becomes an orthodox Prince endowed with true reverence for God
and the Roman See. We firmly approve his desire to restore and preserve
peace in his kingdom.

Denial of Viaticum

3. The authority of the apostolic constitution which begins with the
word Unigenitus is certainly so great and lays claim everywhere to such
sincere veneration and obedience that no one can withdraw the
submission due it or oppose it without risking the loss of eternal
salvation. Now, a controversy has risen concerning whether viaticum
must be denied to those who oppose the constitution. The answer must be
given without any hesitation that as long as they are opposed publicly
and notoriously, viaticum must be denied them; this follows for the
universal law which prohibits a known public sinner to be admitted to
Eucharistic communion, whether he asks for it in public or in private.

4. Now public and notorious objectors in the matter under discussion
are those who have been so declared by the sentence of a competent
judge (because they have contumaciously refused the reverence and
obedience due the constitution Unigenitus) and who have admitted their
guilt in court. There are others, also objectors, who, although they
have not been condemned by a judge and have not admitted the crime in
court, nevertheless, at the time when they are about to receive the
sacred viaticum, voluntarily confess their stubborn resistance to the
constitution. Still others are known to have done something manifestly
opposed to the veneration and obedience due to this constitution, and
to have continued in that state; this is so commonly known that the
public scandal arising from it has not yet subsided. In these latter
cases, We are as confident of Our judgment as when a sentence has been
passed in court.

Two Kinds of Notoriety

5. In this matter, however, a difference must be maintained between the
notoriety in which a certain fact is apprehended and guilt consists in
the external action itself, such as the notoriety of the usurer or of
the person living in concubinage, and another kind of notoriety in
which the external fact is noted but the guilt depends very much on the
disposition of the mind. It is this latter kind of notoriety which We
shall discuss. The former must certainly be established with grave
proofs; the latter must be proven with more certain and more serious
evidence.

6. The required certainty is not present when the crime is supported by
mere conjecture, presumption, and rumor, which generally originate in
hostility, prejudice, or partisan interest. When we lend credence to
these things, experience shows how many ways men can err and be led
into hostility.

7. But some pastors and ministers, renowned for piety and zeal, are
influenced by such conjectures and presumptions; they are perplexed
when called to administer viaticum to certain men and fear that it may
not be possible for them to ad minister the sacrament without danger to
their own conscience. We append a certain rule of action which they may
follow.

Rule of Action on Viaticum

8. They ought first to consider whether the person who is asking for
viaticum has been to holy communion previously, especially during the
Easter season, and has received holy communion from the pastor of the
place where he was living; if indeed it was not denied him in life,
this will be an argument that the man is free of all blame, or at least
that he was not considered a truly public sinner. From this it will
follow that it is not possible to deny him when he publicly asks for
viaticum at the end of his life, unless perhaps in the meantime he has
done something to incur the stigma of a public and notorious sinner
with reference to the aforesaid issue.

9. Sometimes, however, no certain conclusions can be reached, but from
other sources valid presumptions and grave indications against the sick
man are present, so that these zealous pastors cannot rid themselves of
the scruple that has arisen. In these circumstances they should,
delaying any decisions, address the sick person with all gentleness and
mildness, not like one who disputes and is anxious to convince. They
should show him the reasons why the conduct of his life is suspect and
implore him to come to his senses. Then they should convince him that
although they are prepared to administer the Body of Christ, and
actually may even administer it, this will not itself make him safe
before the tribunal of Christ. If indeed he had not repented, it will
make him guilty of a new and horrible crime, eating and drinking
judgment on himself. In addition they will administer the sacrament of
the Body of Christ to him for no other reason than to obey the Church,
which strives to avoid public scandal, and to prevent infamy for the
sick person himself. Although she considers him to be a sinner in the
sight of God, she does not recognize him as a public and notorious
sinner in her tribunal.

10. You must now propose this norm of judging and acting which We
approve to all who legitimately administer the sacraments. Indeed, this
decision is supported by ecclesiastical regulations, by the decrees of
councils held in France, and by the opinions of serious theologians in
your own country. Following the example of your predecessors, you sent
Us your controversies and the doubts that they occasioned and asked Us
for guidance in reestablishing and preserving peace for your churches.
Now it is your duty to enforce this rule wherever it pertains. We
expect that you will do so, since We feel that We have omitted no
diligence or study either in weighing and discussing the articles which
the bishops proposed in assembly (though not unanimously); or in taking
into account their differences of opinion to better understand the
whole matter and to reach a right judgment; or in reading and weighing
the written opinions of the Cardinals, whose advice We had requested on
this matter; or in carrying out all other things to merit the aid of
the divine illumination for which We have prayed

11. Nor do We doubt that your illustrious king, who approved your
council and wrote to Us concerning the matter, will in his piety for
God and the Church, offer his strong aid to your Fraternity.
Accordingly both you and the lower ministers of the Church may be free
to regulate the administration of the sacred mysteries according to the
norm described above. Because of this confidence, We did not consider
it necessary to address your other articles concerning episcopal
regulation over participation in the same sacraments and the various
controversies that have arisen concerning these matters. Rather We
decided to communicate with the king so that he may protect the sacred
rights of the episcopate by his own magnanimity and virtue. And We are
confident that he will do this according to his own custom and that of
his ancestors, so that the noble churches of France may rejoice to have
retained their former glory and may soon regain the tranquillity which
was disturbed for a time. As an auspice of this desired event, We
lovingly give to your Fraternity and the people entrusted to your care
the Apostolic Benediction.

Given in Rome at St. Mary Major, 16 October 1756, in the seventeenth
year of Our Pontificate.
