            The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians^[64]1

                                  --------
   Chapter I.-The Salutation. Praise of the Corinthians Before the
       Breaking Forth of Schism Among Them.

   The Church of God which sojourns at Rome, to the Church of God
   sojourning at Corinth, to them that are called and sanctified by the
   will of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace,
   from Almighty God through Jesus Christ, be multiplied.

   Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events
   which have happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat
   tardy in turning our attention to the points respecting which you
   consulted us;^[65]2 and especially to that shameful and detestable
   sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and
   self-confident persons have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that
   your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be universally loved,
   has suffered grievous injury.^[66]3 For who ever dwelt even for a short
   time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue
   as it was firmly established?^[67]4 Who did not admire the sobriety and
   moderation of your godliness in Christ? Who did not proclaim the
   magnificence of your habitual hospitality? And who did not rejoice over
   your perfect and well-grounded knowledge? For ye did all things without
   respect of persons, and walked in the commandments of God, being
   obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving all fitting
   honour to the presbyters among you. Ye enjoined young men to be of a
   sober and serious mind; ye instructed your wives to do all things with
   a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in
   duty bound; and ye taught them that, living in the rule of obedience,
   they should manage their household affairs becomingly, and be in every
   respect marked by discretion.
   Chapter II.-Praise of the Corinthians Continued.

   Moreover, ye were all distinguished by humility, and were in no respect
   puffed up with pride, but yielded obedience rather than extorted
   it,^[68]5 and were more willing to give than to receive.^[69]6 Content
   with the provision which God had made for you, and carefully attending
   to His words, ye were inwardly filled^[70]7 with His doctrine, and His
   sufferings were before your eyes. Thus a profound and abundant peace
   was given to you all, and ye had an insatiable desire for doing good,
   while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon you all. Full of
   holy designs, ye did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly
   confidence, stretch forth your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to
   be merciful unto you, if ye had been guilty of any involuntary
   transgression. Day and night ye were anxious for the whole
   brotherhood,^[71]8 that the number of God's elect might be saved with
   mercy and a good conscience.^[72]9 Ye were sincere and uncorrupted, and
   forgetful of injuries between one another. Every kind of faction and
   schism was abominable in your sight. Ye mourned over the transgressions
   of your neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your own. Ye never
   grudged any act of kindness, being "ready to every good work."^[73]10
   Adorned by a thoroughly virtuous and religious life, ye did all things
   in the fear of God. The commandments and ordinances of the Lord were
   written upon the tablets of your hearts.^[74]11
   Chapter III.-The Sad State of the Corinthian Church After Sedition
       Arose in It from Envy and Emulation.

   Every kind of honour and happiness^[75]12 was bestowed upon you, and
   then was fulfilled that which is written, "My beloved did eat and
   drink, and was enlarged and became fat, and kicked."^[76]13 Hence
   flowed emulation and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and
   disorder, war and captivity. So the worthless rose up against the
   honoured, those of no reputation against such as were renowned, the
   foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced in years.
   For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you,
   inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in
   His faith,^[77]14 neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment,
   nor acts a part becoming a Christian,^[78]15 but walks after his own
   wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy,
   by which death itself entered into the world.^[79]16
   Chapter IV.-Many Evils Have Already Flowed from This Source in Ancient
       Times.

   For thus it is written: "And it came to pass after certain days, that
   Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God; and Abel
   also brought of the firstlings of his sheep, and of the fat thereof.
   And God had respect to Abel and to his offerings, but Cain and his
   sacrifices He did not regard. And Cain was deeply grieved, and his
   countenance fell. And God said to Cain, Why art thou grieved, and why
   is try countenance fallen? If thou offerest rightly, but dost not
   divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at peace: thine offering
   returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it. And Cain said to
   Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And it came to pass, while
   they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and
   slew him."^[80]17 Ye see, brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the
   murder of a brother. Through envy, also, our father Jacob fled from the
   face of Esau his brother.^[81]18 Envy made Joseph be persecuted unto
   death, and to come into bondage.^[82]19 Envy compelled Moses to flee
   from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from
   his fellow-countryman, "Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us? wilt
   thou kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday? "^[83]20 On
   account of envy, Aaron and Miriam had to make their abode without the
   camp.^[84]21 Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive to Hades,
   through the sedition which they excited against God's servant
   Moses.^[85]22 Through envy, David underwent the hatred not only of
   foreigners, but was also persecuted by Saul king of Israel.^[86]23
   Chapter V.-No Less Evils Have Arisen from the Same Source in the Most
       Recent Times. The Martyrdom of Peter and Paul.

   But not to dwell upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent
   spiritual heroes.^[87]24 Let us take the noble examples furnished in
   our own generation. Through envy and jealousy, the greatest and most
   righteous pillars [of the Church] have been persecuted and put to
   death.^[88]25 Let us set before our eyes the illustrious^[89]26
   apostles. Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but
   numerous labours and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, departed
   to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul also obtained the
   reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into
   captivity,^[90]27 compelled^[91]28 to flee, and stoned. After preaching
   both in the east and west, he gained the illustrious reputation due to
   his faith, having taught righteousness to the whole world, and come to
   the extreme limit of the west,^[92]29 and suffered martyrdom under the
   prefects.^[93]30 Thus was he removed from the world, and went into the
   holy place, having proved himself a striking example of patience.
   Chapter VI.-Continuation. Several Other Martyrs.

   To these men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there
   is to be added a great multitude of the elect, who, having through envy
   endured many indignities and tortures, furnished. us with a most
   excellent example. Through envy, those women, the Danaids^[94]31 and
   Dircae, being persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and
   unspeakable torments, finished the course of their faith with
   stedfastness,^[95]32 and though weak in body, received a noble reward.
   Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying
   of our father Adam, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
   flesh."^[96]33 Envy and strife have overthrown great cities and rooted
   up mighty nations.
   Chapter VII.-An Exhortation to Repentance.

   These things, beloved, we write unto you, not merely to admonish you of
   your duty, but also to remind ourselves. For we are struggling on the
   same arena, and the same conflict is assigned to both of us. Wherefore
   let us give up vain and fruitless cares, and approach to the glorious
   and venerable rule of our holy calling. Let us attend to what is good,
   pleasing, and acceptable in the sight of Him who formed us. Let us look
   stedfastly to the blood of Christ, and see how precious that blood is
   to God,^[97]34 which, having been shed for our salvation, has set the
   grace of repentance before the whole world. Let us turn to every age
   that has passed, and learn that, from generation to generation, the
   Lord has granted a place of repentance to all such as would be
   converted unto Him. Noah preached repentance, and as many as listened
   to him were saved.^[98]35 Jonah proclaimed destruction to the
   Ninevites;^[99]36 but they, repenting of their sins, propitiated God by
   prayer, and obtained salvation, although they were aliens [to the
   covenant] of God.
   Chapter VIII.-Continuation Respecting Repentance.

   The ministers of the grace of God have, by the Holy Spirit, spoken of
   repentance; and the Lord of all things has himself declared with an
   oath regarding it, "As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death
   of the sinner, but rather his repentance ; "^[100]37 adding, moreover,
   this gracious declaration Repent O house of Israel, of your
   iniquity.^[101]38 Say to the children of My people, Though your sins
   reach from earth to heaven, I and though they be redder^[102]39 than
   scarlet, and blacker than sackcloth, yet if ye turn to Me with your
   whole heart, and say, Father! I will listen to you, as to a
   holy^[103]40 people." And in another place He speaks thus: "Wash you,
   and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before
   mine eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out
   judgment, deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that
   justice is done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together. He
   declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as
   snow; though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if
   ye be willing and obey Me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye
   refuse, and will not hearken unto Me, the sword shall devour you, for
   the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things."^[104]41 Desiring,
   therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He
   has, by His almighty will, established [these declarations].
   Chapter IX.-Examples of the Saints.

   Wherefore, let us yield obedience to His excellent and glorious will;
   and imploring His mercy and loving-kindness, while we forsake all
   fruitless labours,^[105]42 and strife, and envy, which leads to death,
   let us turn and have recourse to His compassions. Let us stedfastly
   contemplate those who have perfectly ministered to His excellent glory.
   Let us take (for instance) Enoch, who, being found righteous in
   obedience, was translated, and death was never known to happen to
   him.^[106]43 Noah, being found faithful, preached regeneration to the
   world through his ministry; and the Lord saved by him the animals
   which, with one accord, entered into the ark.
   Chapter X.-Continuation of the Above.

   Abraham, styled "the friend,"^[107]44 was found faithful, inasmuch as
   he rendered obedience to the words of God. He, in the exercise of
   obedience, went out from his own country, and from his kindred, and
   from his father's house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory,
   and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the
   promises of God. For God said to him, "Get thee out from thy country,
   and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into the land which
   I shall show thee. And I will make thee a great nation, and will bless
   thee, and make thy name great, and thou shall be blessed. And I will
   bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee
   shall all the families of the earth be blessed."^[108]45 And again, on
   his departing from Lot, God said to him. "Lift up thine eyes, and look
   from the place where thou now art, northward, and southward, and
   eastward, and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will
   I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the
   dust of the earth, [so that] if a man can number the dust of the earth,
   then shall thy seed also be numbered."^[109]46 And again [the
   Scripture] saith, "God brought forth Abram, and spake unto him, Look up
   now to heaven, and count the stars if thou be able to number them; so
   shall thy seed be. And Abram believed God, and it was counted to him
   for righteousness."^[110]47 On account of his faith and hospitality, a
   son was given him in his old age; and in the exercise of obedience, he
   offered him as a sacrifice to God on one of the mountains which He
   showed him.^[111]48
   Chapter XI.-Continuation. Lot.

   On account of his hospitality and godliness, Lot was saved out of
   Sodore when all the country round was punished by means of fire and
   brimstone, the Lord thus making it manifest that He does not forsake
   those that hope in Him, but gives up such as depart from Him to
   punishment and torture.^[112]49 For Lot's wife, who went forth with
   him, being of a different mind from himself and not continuing in
   agreement with him [as to the command which had been given them], was
   made an example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day.^[113]50
   This was done that all might know that those who are of a double mind,
   and who distrust the power of God, bring down judgment on
   themselves^[114]51 and become a sign to all succeeding generations.
   Chapter XII.-The Rewards of Faith and Hospitality. Rahab.

   On account of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved.
   For when spies were sent by Joshua, the son of Nun, to Jericho, the
   king of the country ascertained that they were come to spy out their
   land, and sent men to seize them, in order that, when taken, they might
   be put to death. But the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed
   them on the roof of her house under some stalks of flax. And when the
   men sent by the king arrived and said "There came men unto thee who are
   to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so the king commands," she
   answered them, "The two men whom ye seek came unto me, but quickly
   departed again and are gone," thus not discovering the spies to them.
   Then she said to the men, "I know assuredly that the Lord your God hath
   given you this city, for the fear and dread of you have fallen on its
   inhabitants. When therefore ye shall have taken it, keep ye me and the
   house of my father in safety." And they said to her, "It shall be as
   thou hast spoken to us. As soon, therefore, as thou knowest that we are
   at hand, thou shall gather all thy family under thy roof, and they
   shall be preserved, but all that. are found outside of thy dwelling
   shall perish."^[115]52 Moreover, they gave her a sign to this effect,
   that she should hang forth from her house a scarlet thread. And thus
   they made it manifest that redemption should flow through the blood of
   the Lord to all them that believe and hope in God.^[116]53 Ye see,
   beloved, that there was not only faith, but prophecy, in this woman.
   Chapter XIII.-An Exhortation to Humility.

   Let us therefore, brethren, be of humble mind, laying aside all
   haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings; and let us
   act according to that which is written (for the Holy Spirit saith, "Let
   not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory
   in his might, neither let the rich man Story in his riches; but let him
   that glorieth glory in the Lord, in diligently seeking Him, and doing
   judgment and righteousness"^[117]54 ), being especially mindful of the
   words of the Lord Jesus which He spake, teaching us meekness and
   long-suffering. For thus He spoke: "Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain
   mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you ; as ye do, so shall it
   be done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye are kind,
   so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with the
   same it shall be measured to you."^[118]55 By this precept and by these
   rules let us establish ourselves, that we walk with all humility in
   obedience to His holy words. For the holy word saith, "On whom shall I
   look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and that trembleth at My
   words? "^[119]56
   Chapter XIV.-We Should Obey God Rather Than the Authors of Sedition.

   It is right and holy therefore, men and brethren, rather to obey God
   than to follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the
   leaders of a detestable emulation. For we shall incur no slight injury,
   but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the
   inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, so as to
   draw us away from what is good. Let us be kind one to another after the
   pattern of the tender mercy and benignity of our Creator. For it is
   written, "The kind-hearted shall inhabit the land, and the guiltless
   shall be left upon it, but transgressors shall be destroyed from off
   the face of it."^[120]57 And again [the Scripture] saith, "I saw the
   ungodly highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon: I
   passed by, and, behold, he was not; and I diligently sought his place,
   and could not find it. Preserve innocence, and look on equity: for
   there shall be a remnant to the peaceful man."^[121]58
   Chapter XV.-We Must Adhere to Those Who Cultivate Peace, Not to Those
       Who Merely Pretend to Do So.

   Let us cleave, therefore, to those who cultivate peace with godliness,
   and not to those who hypocritically profess to desire it. For [the
   Scripture] saith in a certain place, "This people honoureth Me with
   their lips, but their heart is far from Me."^[122]59 And again: "They
   bless with their mouth, but curse with their heart."^[123]60 And again
   it saith, "They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their
   tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, neither were they
   faithful in His covenant."^[124]61 "Let the deceitful lips become
   silent,"^[125]62 [and "let the Lord destroy all the lying lips,^[126]63
   ] and the boastful tongue of those who have said, Let us magnify our
   tongue; our lips are our own; who is lord over us? For the oppression
   of the poor, and for the sighing of the needy, will I now arise, saith
   the Lord: I will place him in safety; I will deal confidently with
   him."^[127]64
   Chapter XVI.-Christ as an Example of Humility.

   For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who
   exalt themselves over His flock. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of
   the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance,
   although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy
   Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says, "Lord, who hath
   believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We
   have declared [our message] in His presence: He is, as it were, a
   child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory,
   yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was
   without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form
   of men. He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, anti acquainted
   with the endurance of grief: for His countenance was turned away; He
   was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is in
   sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own account] He was
   exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded for
   our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of
   our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed. All we, like
   sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and
   the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of
   His sufferings openeth not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the
   slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not
   His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall
   declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. For the
   transgressions of my people was He brought down to death. And I will
   give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death,^[128]65
   because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His mouth. And
   the Lord is pleased to purify Him by stripes.^[129]66 If ye
   make^[130]67 an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived
   seed. And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of the affliction of His
   soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with understanding,^[131]68 to
   justify the Just One who ministereth well to many; and the Himself
   shall carry their sins. On this account He shall inherit many, and
   shall divide the spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered to
   death, and He was reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the
   sins of many, and for their sins was He delivered."^[132]69 And again
   He saith, "I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
   the people. All that see Me have derided Me; they have spoken with
   their lips; they have wagged their head, [saying] He hoped in God, let
   Him deliver Him, let Him save Him, since He delighteth in Him."^[133]70
   Ye see, beloved, what is the example which has been given us; for if
   the Lord thus humbled Himself, what shall we do who have through Him
   come under the yoke of His grace?
   Chapter XVII.-The Saints as Examples of Humility.

   Let us be imitators also of those who in goat-skins and
   sheep-skins^[134]71 went about proclaiming the coming of Christ; I mean
   Elijah, Elisha, and Ezekiel among the prophets, with those others to
   whom a like testimony is borne [in Scripture]. Abraham was specially
   honoured, and was called the friend of God; yet he, earnestly regarding
   the glory of God, humbly declared, "I am but dust and ashes."^[135]72
   Moreover, it is thus written of Job, "Job was a righteous man, and
   blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and one that kept himself from all
   evil."^[136]73 But bringing an accusation against himself, he said, "No
   man is free from defilement, even if his life be but of one
   day."^[137]74 Moses was called faithful in all God's house;^[138]75 and
   through his instrumentality, God punished Egypt^[139]76 with plagues
   and tortures. Yet he, though thus greatly honoured, did not adopt lofty
   language, but said, when the divine oracle came to him out of the bush,
   "Who am I, that Thou sendest me? I am a man of a feeble voice and a
   slow tongue."^[140]77 And again he said, "I am but as the smoke of a
   pot."^[141]78
   Chapter XVIII.-David as an Example of Humility.

   But what shall we say concerning David, to whom such testimony was
   borne, and of whom^[142]79 God said, "I have found a man after Mine own
   heart, David the son of Jesse; and in everlasting mercy have I anointed
   him? "^[143]80 Yet this very man saith to God, "Have mercy on me, O
   Lord, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of
   Thy compassions, blot out my transgression. Wash me still more from
   mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
   iniquity, and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee only have I
   sinned, and done that which was evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be
   justified in Thy sayings, and mayest overcome when Thou^[144]81 art
   judged. For, behold, I was conceived in transgressions, and in my sins
   did my mother conceive me. For, behold, Thou hast loved truth; the
   secret and hidden things of wisdom hast Thou shown me. Thou shalt
   sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou shalt wash me,
   and I shall be whiter than snow. Thou shalt make me to hear joy and
   gladness; my bones, which have been humbled, shall exult. Turn away Thy
   face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. Create in me a
   clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.^[145]82 Cast me
   not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
   Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, and establish me by Thy
   governing Spirit. I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly
   shall be converted unto Thee. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness,^[146]83
   O God, the God of my salvation: my tongue shall exult in Thy
   righteousness. O Lord, Thou shalt open my mouth, and my lips shall show
   forth Thy praise. For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would have
   given it; Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings. The sacrifice
   [acceptable] to God is a bruised spirit; a broken and a contrite heart
   God will not despise."^[147]84
   Chapter XIX.-Imitating These Examples, Let Us Seek After Peace.

   Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men
   have rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us,
   better; even as many as have received His oracles in fear and truth.
   Wherefore, having so many great and glorious examples set before us,
   let us turn again to the practice of that peace which from the
   beginning was the mark set before us;^[148]85 and let us look
   stedfastly to the Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His
   mighty and surpassingly great gifts and benefactions, of peace. Let us
   contemplate Him with our understanding, and look with the eyes of our
   soul to His long-suffering will. Let us reflect how free from wrath He
   is towards all His creation.
   Chapter XX.-The Peace and Harmony of the Universe.

   The heavens, revolving under His government, are subject to Him in
   peace. Day and night run the course appointed by Him, in no wise
   hindering each other. The sun and moon, with the companies of the
   stars, roll on in harmony according to His command, within their
   prescribed limits, and without any deviation. The fruitful earth,
   according to His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the proper
   seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon it, never
   hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed. The
   unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of
   the lower world, are restrained by the same laws. The vast unmeasurable
   sea, gathered together by His working into various basins,^[149]86
   never passes beyond the bounds placed around it, but does as He has
   commanded. For He said, "Thus far shalt thou come, and thy waves shall
   be broken within thee."^[150]87 The ocean, impassible to man, and the
   worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same enactments of the Lord. The
   seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, peacefully give place to
   one another. The winds in their several quarters^[151]88 fulfil, at the
   proper time, their service without hindrance. The ever-flowing
   fountains, formed both for enjoyment and health, furnish without fail
   their breasts for the life of men. The very smallest of living beings
   meet together in peace and concord. All these the great Creator and
   Lord of all has appointed to exist in peace and harmony; while He does
   good to all, but most abundantly to us who have fled for refuge to His
   compassions through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty
   for ever and ever. Amen.
   Chapter XXI.-Let Us Obey God, and Not the Authors of Sedition.

   Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation
   of us all. [For thus it must be] unless we walk worthy of Him, and with
   one mind do those things which are good and well-pleasing in His sight.
   For [the Scripture] saith in a certain place, "The Spirit of the Lord
   is a candle searching the secret parts of the belly."^[152]89 Let us
   reflect how near He is, and that none of the thoughts or reasonings in
   which we engage are hid from Him. It is right, therefore, that we
   should not leave the post which His will has assigned us. Let us rather
   offend those men who are foolish, and inconsiderate, and lifted up, and
   who glory in the pride of their speech, than [offend] God. Let us
   reverence the Lord Jesus Christ, whose blood was given for us; let us
   esteem those who have the rule over us;^[153]90 let us honour the
   aged^[154]91 among us; let us train up the young men in the fear of
   God; let us direct our wives to that which is good. Let them exhibit
   the lovely habit of purity [in all their conduct]; let them show forth
   the sincere disposition of meekness; let them make manifest the command
   which they have of their tongue, by their manner^[155]92 of speaking;
   let them display their love, not by preferring^[156]93 one to another,
   but by showing equal affection to all that piously fear God. Let your
   children be partakers of true Christian training; let them learn of how
   great avail humility is with God-how much the spirit of pure affection
   can prevail with Him-how excellent and great His fear is, and how it
   saves all those who walk in^[157]94 it with a pure mind. For He is a
   Searcher of the thoughts and desires [of the heart]: His breath is in
   us; and when He pleases, He will take it away.
   Chapter XXII.-These Exhortations are Confirmed by the Christian Faith,
       Which Proclaims the Misery of Sinful Conduct.

   Now the faith which is in Christ confirms all these [admonitions]. For
   He Himself by the Holy Ghost thus addresses us: "Come, ye children,
   hearken unto Me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he
   that desireth life, and loveth to see good days? Keep thy tongue from
   evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good;
   seek peace, and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
   and His ears are [open] unto their prayers. The face of the Lord is
   against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the
   earth. The righteous cried, and the Lord heard him, and delivered him
   out of all his troubles."^[158]95 "Many are the stripes [appointed for]
   the wicked; but mercy shall compass those about who hope in the
   Lord."^[159]96
   Chapter XXIII.-Be Humble, and Believe that Christ Will Come Again.

   The all-merciful and beneficent Father has bowels [of compassion]
   towards those that fear Him, and kindly and lovingly bestows His
   favours upon those who come to Him with a simple mind. Wherefore let us
   not be double-minded; neither let our soul be lifted^[160]97 up on
   account of His exceedingly great and glorious gifts. Far from us be
   that which is written, "Wretched are they who are of a double mind, and
   of a doubting heart; who say, These things we have heard even in the
   times of our fathers; but, behold, we have grown old, and none of them
   has happened unto us."^[161]98 Ye foolish ones! compare yourselves to a
   tree: take [for instance] the vine. First of all, it sheds its leaves,
   then it buds, next it puts forth leaves, and then it flowers; after
   that comes the sour grape, and then follows the ripened fruit. Ye
   perceive how in a little time the fruit of a tree comes to maturity. Of
   a truth, soon and suddenly shall His will be accomplished, as the
   Scripture also bears witness, saying, "Speedily will He come, and will
   not tarry; "^[162]99 and, "The Lord shall suddenly come to His temple,
   even the Holy One, for whom ye look."^[163]100
   Chapter XXIV.-God Continually Shows Us in Nature that There Will Be a
       Resurrection.

   Let us consider, beloved, how the Lord continually proves to us that
   there shall be a future resurrection, of which He has rendered the Lord
   Jesus Christ the first-fruits^[164]101 by raising Him from the dead.
   Let us contemplate, beloved, the resurrection which is at all times
   taking place. Day and night declare to us a resurrection. The night
   sinks to sleep, and the day arises; the day [again] departs, and the
   night comes on. Let us behold the fruits [of the earth], how the sowing
   of grain takes place. The sower^[165]102 goes forth, and casts it into
   the ground; and the seed being thus scattered, though dry and naked
   when it fell upon the earth, is gradually dissolved. Then out of its
   dissolution the mighty power of the providence of the Lord raises it up
   again, and from one seed many arise and bring forth fruit.
   Chapter XXV.-The Phoenix an Emblem of Our Resurrection.

   Let us consider that wonderful sign [of the resurrection] which takes
   place in Eastern lands, that is, in Arabia and the countries round
   about. There is a certain bird which is called a phoenix. This is the
   only one of its kind, and lives five hundred years. And when the time
   of its dissolution draws near that it must die, it builds itself a nest
   of frankincense, and myrrh, and other spices, into which, when the time
   is fulfilled, it enters and dies. But as the flesh decays a certain
   kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by the juices of the
   dead bird, brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired strength,
   it takes up that nest in which are the bones of its parent, and bearing
   these it passes from the land of Arabia into Egypt, to the city called
   Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying in the sight of all men, it places
   them on the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its
   former abode. The priests then inspect the registers of the dates, and
   find that it has returned exactly as the five hundredth year was
   completed.^[166]103
   Chapter XXVI.-We Shall Rise Again, Then, as the Scripture Also
       Testifies.

   Do we then deem it any great and wonderful thing for the Maker of all
   things to raise up again those that have piously served Him in the
   assurance of a good faith, when even by a bird He shows us the
   mightiness of His power to fulfil His promise?^[167]104 For [the
   Scripture] saith in a certain place, "Thou shalt raise me up, and I
   shall confess unto Thee; "^[168]105 and again, "I laid me down, and
   slept; I awaked, because Thou art with me; "^[169]106 and again, Job
   says, "Thou shalt raise up this flesh of mine, which has suffered all
   these things."^[170]107
   Chapter XXVII.-In the Hope of the Resurrection, Let Us Cleave to the
       Omnipotent and Omniscient God.

   Having then this hope, let our souls be bound to Him who is faithful in
   His promises, and just in His judgments. He who has commanded us not to
   lie, shall much more Himself not lie; for nothing is impossible with
   God, except to lie.^[171]108 Let His faith therefore be stirred up
   again within us, and let us consider that all things are nigh unto Him.
   By the word of His might^[172]109 He established all things, and by His
   word He can overthrow them. "Who shall say unto Him, What hast thou
   done? or, Who shall resist the power of His strength? "^[173]110 When
   and as He pleases He will do all things, and none of the things
   determined by Him shall pass away.^[174]111 All things are open before
   Him, and nothing can be hidden from His counsel. "The heavens^[175]112
   declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handy-work. Day
   unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. And
   there are no words or speeches of which the voices are not
   heard."^[176]113
   Chapter XXVIII.-God Sees All Things: Therefore Let Us Avoid
       Transgression.

   Since then all things are seen and heard [by God], let us fear Him, and
   forsake those wicked works which proceed from evil desires;^[177]114 so
   that, through His mercy, we may be protected from the judgments to
   come. For whither can any of us flee from His mighty hand? Or what
   world will receive any of those who run away from Him? For the
   Scripture saith in a certain place, "Whither shall I go, and where
   shall I be hid from Thy presence? If I ascend into heaven, Thou art
   there; if I go away even to the uttermost parts of the earth, there is
   Thy right hand; if I make my bed in the abyss, there is Thy
   Spirit."^[178]115 Whither, then, shall any one go, or where shall he
   escape from Him who comprehends all things?
   Chapter XXIX.-Let Us Also Draw Near to God in Purity of Heart.

   Let us then draw near to Him with holiness of spirit, lifting up pure
   and undefiled hands unto Him, loving our gracious and merciful Father,
   who has made us partakers in the blessings of His elect.^[179]116 For
   thus it is written, "When the Most High divided the nations, when He
   scattered^[180]117 the sons of Adam, He fixed the bounds of the nations
   according to the number of the angels of God. His people Jacob became
   the portion of the Lord, and Israel the lot of His
   inheritance."^[181]118 And in another place [the Scripture] saith,
   "Behold, the Lord taketh unto Himself a nation out of the midst of the
   nations, as a man takes the first-fruits of his threshing-floor; and
   from that nation shall come forth the Most Holy.^[182]119
   Chapter XXX.-Let Us Do Those Things that Please God, and Flee from
       Those He Hates, that We May Be Blessed.

   Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One, let us do
   all those things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all evil-speaking,
   all abominable and impure embraces, together with all drunkenness,
   seeking after change,^[183]120 all abominable lusts, detestable
   adultery, and execrable pride. "For God," saith [the Scripture],
   "resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."^[184]121 Let us
   cleave, then, to those to whom grace has been given by God. Let us
   clothe ourselves with concord and humility, ever exercising
   self-control, standing far off from all whispering and evil-speaking,
   being justified by our works, and not our words. For [the Scripture]
   saith, "He that speaketh much, shall also hear much in answer. And does
   he that is ready in speech deem himself righteous? Blessed is he that
   is born of woman, who liveth but a short time: be not given to much
   speaking."^[185]122 Let our praise be in God, and not of ourselves; for
   God hateth those that commend themselves. Let testimony to our good
   deeds be borne by others, as it was in the case of our righteous
   forefathers. Boldness, and arrogance, and audacity belong to those that
   are accursed of God; but moderation, humility, and meekness to such as
   are blessed by Him.
   Chapter XXXI.-Let Us See by What Means We May Obtain the Divine
       Blessing.

   Let us cleave then to His blessing, and consider what are the
   means^[186]123 of possessing it. Let us think^[187]124 over the things
   which have taken place from the beginning. For what reason was our
   father Abraham blessed? was it not because he wrought righteousness and
   truth through faith?^[188]125 Isaac, with perfect confidence, as if
   knowing what was to happen,^[189]126 cheerfully yielded himself as a
   sacrifice^[190]127 Jacob, through reason^[191]128 of his brother, went
   forth with humility from his own land, and came to Laban and served
   him; and there was given to him the sceptre of the twelve tribes of
   Israel.
   Chapter XXXII.-We are Justified Not by Our Own Works, But by Faith.

   Whosoever will candidly consider each particular, will recognise the
   greatness of the gifts which were given by him.^[192]129 For from
   him^[193]130 have sprung the priests and all the Levites who minister
   at the altar of God. From him also [was descended] our Lord Jesus
   Christ according to the flesh.^[194]131 From him [arose] kings,
   princes, and rulers of the race of Judah. Nor are his other tribes in
   small glory, inasmuch as God had promised, "Thy seed shall be as the
   stars of heaven."^[195]132 All these, therefore, were highly honoured,
   and made great, not for their own sake, or for their own works, or for
   the righteousness which they wrought, but through the operation of His
   will. And we, too, being called by His will in Christ Jesus, are not
   justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or
   godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by
   that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has
   justified all men; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
   Chapter XXXIII.-But Let Us Not Owe Up the Practice of Good Works and
       Love. God Himself is an Example to Us of Good Works.

   What shall we do, then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in
   well-doing, and cease from the practice of love? God forbid that any
   such course should be followed by us! But rather let us hasten with all
   energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work. For the
   Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in His works. For by His
   infinitely great power He established the heavens, and by His
   incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them. He also divided the earth from
   the water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon the immoveable
   foundation of His own will. The animals also which are upon it He
   commanded by His own word^[196]133 into existence. So likewise, when He
   had formed the sea, and the living creatures which are in it, He
   enclosed them [within their proper bounds] by His own power. Above
   all,^[197]134 with His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most
   excellent [of His creatures], and truly great through the understanding
   given him-the express likeness of His own image. For thus says God:
   "Let us make man in Our image, and after Our likeness. So God made man;
   male and female He created them."^[198]135 Having thus finished all
   these things, He approved them, and blessed them, and said, "Increase
   and multiply."^[199]136 We see,^[200]137 then, how all righteous men
   have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord Himself, adorning
   Himself with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example, let
   us without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of
   righteousness with our whole strength.
   Chapter XXXIV.-Great is the Reward of Good Works with God. Joined
       Together in Harmony, Let Us Implore that Reward from Him.

   The good servant^[201]138 receives the bread of his labour with
   confidence; the lazy and slothful cannot look his employer in the face.
   It is requisite, therefore, that we be prompt in the practice of
   well-doing; for of Him are all things. And thus He forewarns us:
   "Behold, the Lord [cometh], and His reward is before His face, to
   render to every man according to his work."^[202]139 He exhorts us,
   therefore, with our whole heart to attend to this,^[203]140 that we be
   not lazy or slothful in any good work. Let our boasting and our
   confidence be in Him. Let us submit ourselves to His will. Let us
   consider the whole multitude of His angels, how they stand ever ready
   to minister to His will. For the Scripture saith, "Ten thousand times
   ten thousand stood around Him, and thousands of thousands ministered
   unto Him,^[204]141 and cried, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the Lord of
   Sabaoth; the whole creation is full of His glory."^[205]142 And let us
   therefore, conscientiously gathering together in harmony, cry to Him
   earnestly, as with one mouth, that we may be made partakers of His
   great and glorious promises. For [the Scripture] saith, "Eye hath not
   seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
   things which He hath prepared for them that wait for Him."^[206]143
   Chapter XXXV.-Immense is This Reward. How Shall We Obtain It?

   How blessed and wonderful, beloved, are the gifts of God! Life in
   immortality, splendour in righteousness, truth in perfect
   confidence,^[207]144 faith in assurance, self-control in holiness! And
   all these fall under the cognizance of our understandings [now]; what
   then shall those things be which are prepared for such as wait for Him?
   The Creator and Father of all worlds,^[208]145 the Most Holy, alone
   knows their amount and their beauty. Let us therefore earnestly strive
   to be found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we
   may share in His promised gifts. But how, beloved, shall this be done?
   If our understanding be fixed by faith rewards God; if we earnestly
   seek the things which are pleasing and acceptable to Him; if we do the
   things which are in harmony with His blameless will; and if we follow
   the way of truth, casting away from us all unrighteousness and
   iniquity, along with all covetousness, strife, evil practices, deceit,
   whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of God, pride and
   haughtiness, vainglory and ambition.^[209]146 For they that do such
   things are hateful to God; and not only they that do them, but also
   those that take pleasure in them that do them.^[210]147 For the
   Scripture saith, "But to the sinner God said, Wherefore dost thou
   declare my statutes, and take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou
   hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest
   a thief, thou consentedst with^[211]148 him, and didst make thy portion
   with adulterers. Thy mouth has abounded with wickedness, and thy tongue
   contrived^[212]149 deceit. Thou sittest, and speakest against thy
   brother; thou slanderest^[213]150 thine own mother's son. These things
   thou hast done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest, wicked one, that I
   should be like to thyself. But I will reprove thee, and set thyself
   before thee. Consider now these things, ye that forget God, lest He
   tear you in pieces, like a lion, and there be none to deliver. The
   sacrifice of praise will glorify Me, and a way is there by which I will
   show him the salvation of God."^[214]151
   Chapter XXXVI.-All Blessings are Given to Us Through Christ.

   This is the way, beloved, in which we find our Saviour,^[215]152 even
   Jesus Christ, the High Priest of all our offerings, the defender and
   helper of our infirmity. By Him we look up to the heights of heaven. By
   Him we behold, as in a glass, His immaculate and most excellent visage.
   By Him are the eyes of our hearts opened. By Him our foolish and
   darkened understanding blossoms^[216]153 up anew towards His marvellous
   light. By Him the Lord has willed that we should taste of immortal
   knowledge,^[217]154 "who, being the brightness of His majesty, is by so
   much greater than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more
   excellent name than they."^[218]155 For it is thus written, "Who maketh
   His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire."^[219]156 But
   concerning His Son^[220]157 the Lord spoke thus: "Thou art my Son,
   to-day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the
   heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
   Thy possession."^[221]158 And again He saith to Him, "Sit Thou at My
   right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."^[222]159 But who
   are His enemies? All the wicked, and those who set themselves to oppose
   the will of God.^[223]160
   Chapter XXXVII.-Christ is Our Leader, and We His Soldiers.

   Let us then, men and brethren, with all energy act the part of
   soldiers, in accordance with His holy commandments. Let us consider
   those who serve under our generals, with what order, obedience, and
   submissiveness they perform the things which are commanded them. All
   are not prefects, nor commanders of a thousand, nor of a hundred, nor
   of fifty, nor the like, but each one in his own rank performs the
   things commanded by the king and the generals. The great cannot subsist
   without the small, nor the small without the great. There is a kind of
   mixture in all things, and thence arises mutual advantage.^[224]161 Let
   us take our body for an example.^[225]162 The head is nothing without
   the feet, and the feet are nothing without the head; yea, the very
   smallest members of our body are necessary and useful to the whole
   body. But all work^[226]163 harmoniously together, and are under one
   common rule^[227]164 for the preservation of the whole body.
   Chapter XXXVIII.-Let the Members of the Church Submit Themselves, and
       No One Exalt Himself Above Another.

   Let our whole body, then, be preserved in, Christ Jesus; and let every
   one be subject to his neighbour, according to the special gift^[228]165
   bestowed upon him. Let the strong not despise the weak, and let the
   weak show respect unto the strong. Let the rich man provide for the
   wants of the poor; and let the poor man bless God, because He hath
   given him one by whom his need may be supplied. Let the wise man
   display his wisdom, not by [mere] words, but through good deeds. Let
   the humble not bear testimony to himself, but leave witness to be borne
   to him by another.^[229]166 Let him that is pure in the flesh not grow
   proud^[230]167 of it, and boast, knowing that it was another who
   bestowed on him the gift of continence. Let us consider, then,
   brethren, of what matter we were made,-who and what manner of beings we
   came into the world, as it were out of a sepulchre, and from utter
   darkness.^[231]168 He who made us and fashioned us, having prepared His
   bountiful gifts for us before we were born, introduced us into His
   world. Since, therefore, we receive all these things from Him, we ought
   for everything to give Him thanks; to whom be glory for ever and ever.
   Amen.
   Chapter XXXIX.-There is No Reason for Self-Conceit.

   Foolish and inconsiderate men, who have neither wisdom^[232]169 nor
   instruction, mock and deride us, being eager to exalt themselves in
   their own conceits. For what can a mortal man do? or what strength is
   there in one made out of the dust? For it is written, "There was no
   shape before mine eyes, only I heard a sound,^[233]170 and a voice
   [saying], What then? Shall a man be pure before the Lord? or shall such
   an one be [counted] blameless in his deeds, seeing He does not confide
   in His servants, and has charged^[234]171 even His angels with
   perversity? The heaven is not clean in His sight: how much less they
   that dwell in houses of clay, of which also we ourselves were made! He
   smote them as a moth; and from morning even until evening they endure
   not. Because they could furnish no assistance to themselves, they
   perished. He breathed upon them, and they died, because they had no
   wisdom. But call now, if any one will answer thee, or if thou wilt look
   to any of the holy angels; for wrath destroys the foolish man, and envy
   killeth him that is in error. I have seen the foolish taking root, but
   their habitation was presently consumed. Let their sons be far from
   safety; let them be despised^[235]172 before the gates of those less
   than themselves, and there shall be none to deliver. For what was
   prepared for them, the righteous shall eat; and they shall not be
   delivered from evil."^[236]173
   Chapter XL.-Let Us Preserve in the Church the Order Appointed by God.

   These things therefore being manifest to us, and since we look into the
   depths of the divine knowledge, it behoves us to do all things in
   [their proper] order, which the Lord has commanded us to perform at
   stated times.^[237]174 He has enjoined offerings [to be presented] and
   service to be performed [to Him], and that not thoughtlessly or
   irregularly, but at the appointed times and hours. Where and by whom He
   desires these things to be done, He Himself has fixed by His own
   supreme will, in order that all things being piously done according to
   His good pleasure, may be acceptable unto Him.^[238]175 Those,
   therefore, who present their offerings at the appointed times, are
   accepted and blessed; for inasmuch as they follow the laws of the Lord,
   they sin not. For his own peculiar services are assigned to the high
   priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and
   their own special ministrations devolve on the Levites. The layman is
   bound by the laws that pertain to laymen.
   Chapter XLI.-Continuation of the Same Subject.

   Let every one of you, brethren, give thanks to God in his own order,
   living in all good conscience, with becoming gravity, and not going
   beyond the rule of the ministry prescribed to him. Not in every place,
   brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or
   the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only.
   And even there they are not offered in any place, but only at the altar
   before the temple, that which is offered being first carefully examined
   by the high priest and the ministers already mentioned. Those,
   therefore, who do anything beyond that which is agreeable to His will,
   are punished with death. Ye see,^[239]176 brethren, that the greater
   the knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us, the greater also is the
   danger to which we are exposed.
   Chapter XLII.-The Order of Ministers in the Church.

   The apostles have preached the Gospel to us from^[240]177 the Lord
   Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ [has done sol from^[241]178 God. Christ
   therefore was sent forth by God, and the apostles by Christ. Both these
   appointments,^[242]179 then, were made in an orderly way, according to
   the will of God. Having therefore received their orders, and being
   fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   established^[243]180 in the word of God, with full assurance of the
   Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming that the kingdom of God was at
   hand. And thus preaching through countries and cities, they appointed
   the first-fruits [of their labours], having first proved them by the
   Spirit,^[244]181 to be bishops and deacons of those who should
   afterwards believe. Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many ages
   before it was written concerning bishops and deacons. For thus saith
   the Scripture in a certain place, "I will appoint their
   bishops^[245]182 in righteousness, and their deacons^[246]183 in
   faith."^[247]184
   Chapter XLIII.-Moses of Old Stilled the Contention Which Arose
       Concerning the Priestly Dignity.

   And what wonder is it if those in Christ who were entrusted with such a
   duty by God, appointed those [ministers] before mentioned, when the
   blessed Moses also, "a faithful servant in all his house,"^[248]185
   noted down in the sacred books all the injunctions which were given
   him, and when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness
   with one consent to the ordinances which he had appointed? For, when
   rivalry arose concerning the priesthood, and the tribes were contending
   among themselves as to which of them should be adorned with that
   glorious title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring
   him their rods, each one being inscribed with the name^[249]186 of the
   tribe. And he took them and bound them [together], and sealed them with
   the rings of the princes of the tribes, and laid them up in the
   tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And having shut the doors of
   the tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said
   to them, Men and brethren, the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God
   chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to minister unto
   Him. And when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six
   hundred thousand men, and showed the seals to the princes of the
   tribes, and opened the tabernacle of witness, and brought forth the
   rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only to have blossomed, but to
   bear fruit upon it.^[250]187 What think ye, beloved? Did not Moses know
   beforehand that this would happen? Undoubtedly he knew; but he acted
   thus, that there might be no sedition in Israel, and that the name of
   the true and only God might be glorified; to whom be glory for ever and
   ever. Amen.
   Chapter XLIV.-The Ordinances of the Apostles, that There Might Be No
       Contention Respecting the Priestly Office.

   Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and there would
   be strife on account of the office^[251]188 of the episcopate. For this
   reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect
   fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those [ministers] already
   mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions,^[252]189 that when these
   should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed them in their
   ministry. We are of opinion, therefore, that those appointed by
   them,^[253]190 or afterwards by other eminent men, with the consent of
   the whole Church, and who have blame-lessly served the flock of Christ
   in a humble, peaceable, and disinterested spirit, and have for a long
   time possessed the good opinion of all, cannot be justly dismissed from
   the ministry. For our sin will not be small, if we eject from the
   episcopate^[254]191 those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its
   duties.^[255]192 Blessed are those presbyters who, having finished
   their course before now, have obtained a fruitful and perfect departure
   [from this world]; for they have no fear lest any one deprive them of
   the place now appointed them. But we see that ye have removed some men
   of excellent behaviour from the ministry, which they fulfilled
   blamelessly and with honour.
   Chapter XLV.-It is the Part of the Wicked to Vex the Righteous.

   Ye are fond of contention, brethren, and full of zeal about things
   which do not pertain to salvation. Look carefully into the Scriptures,
   which are the true utterances of the Holy Spirit. Observe^[256]193 that
   nothing of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them.
   There^[257]194 you will not find that the righteous were cast off by
   men who themselves were holy. The righteous were indeed persecuted, but
   only by the wicked. They were cast into prison, but only by the unholy;
   they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain, but only
   by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against
   them. Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them gloriously. For
   what shall we say, brethren? Was Daniel^[258]195 cast into the den of
   lions by such as feared God? Were Ananias, and Azarias, and Mishael
   shut up in a furnace^[259]196 of fire by those who observed^[260]197
   the great and glorious worship of the Most High? Far from us be such a
   thought! Who, then, were they that did such things? The hateful, and
   those full of all wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of fury, that
   they inflicted torture on those who served God with a holy and
   blameless purpose [of heart], not knowing that the Most High is the
   Defender and Protector of all such as with a pure conscience
   venerate^[261]198 His all-excellent name; to whom be glory for ever and
   ever. Amen. But they who with confidence endured [these things] are now
   heirs of glory and honour, and have been exalted and made
   illustrious^[262]199 by God in their memorial for ever and ever. Amen.
   Chapter XLVI.-Let Us Cleave to the Righteous: Your Strife is
       Pernicious.

   Such examples, therefore, brethren, it is right that we should
   follow;^[263]200 since it is written, "Cleave to the holy, for those
   that cleave to them shall [themselves] be made holy."^[264]201 And
   again, in another place, [the Scripture] saith, "With a harmless man
   thou shalt prove^[265]202 thyself harmless, and with an elect man thou
   shalt be elect, and with a perverse man thou shalt show^[266]203
   thyself perverse."^[267]204 Let us cleave, therefore, to the innocent
   and righteous, since these are the elect of God. Why are there strifes,
   and tumults, and divisions, and schisms, and wars^[268]205 among you?
   Have we not [all] one God and one Christ? Is there not one Spirit of
   grace poured out upon us? And have we not one calling in
   Christ?^[269]206 Why do we divide and tear to pieces the members of
   Christ, and raise up strife against our own body, and have reached such
   a height of madness as to forget that "we are members one of another?
   "^[270]207 Remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how^[271]208 He
   said, "Woe to that man [by whom^[272]209 offences come]! It were better
   for him that he had never been born, than that he should cast a
   stumbling-block before one of my elect. Yea, it were better for him
   that a millstone should be hung about [his neck], and he should be sunk
   in the depths of the sea, than that he should cast a stumbling-block
   before one of my little ones.^[273]210 Your schism has subverted [the
   faith of] many, has discouraged many, has given rise to doubt in many,
   and has caused grief to us all. And still your sedition continueth.
   Chapter XLVII.-Your Recent Discord is Worse Than the Former Which Took
       Place in the Times of Paul.

   Take up the epistle of the blessed Apostle Paul. What did he write to
   you at the time when the Gospel first began to be preached?^[274]211
   Truly, under the inspiration^[275]212 of the Spirit, he wrote to you
   concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos,^[276]213 because even then
   parties^[277]214 had been formed among you. But that inclination for
   one above another entailed less guilt upon you, inasmuch as your
   partialities were then shown towards apostles, already of high
   reputation, and towards a man whom they had approved. But now reflect
   who those are that have perverted you, and lessened the renown of your
   far-famed brotherly love. It is disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly
   disgraceful, and unworthy of your Christian profession,^[278]215 that
   such a thing should be heard of as that the most stedfast and ancient
   Church of the Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons,
   engage in sedition against its presbyters. And this rumour has reached
   not only us, but those also who are unconnected^[279]216 with us; so
   that, through your infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed,
   while danger is also brought upon yourselves.
   Chapter XLVIII.-Let Us Return to the Practice of Brotherly Love.

   Let us therefore, with all haste, put an end^[280]217 to this [state of
   things]; and let us fall down before the Lord, and beseech Him with
   tears, that He would mercifully^[281]218 be reconciled to us, and
   restore us to our former seemly and holy practice of brotherly love.
   For [such conduct] is the gate of righteousness, which is set open for
   the attainment of life, as it is written, "Open to me the gates of
   righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the Lord: this is
   the gate of the Lord: the righteous shall enter in by it."^[282]219
   Although, therefore, many gates have been set open, yet this gate of
   righteousness is that gate in Christ by which blessed are all they that
   have entered in and have directed their way in holiness and
   righteousness, doing all things without disorder. Let a man be
   faithful: let him be powerful in the utterance of knowledge; let him be
   wise in judging of words; let him be pure in all his deeds; yet the
   more he seems to be superior to others [in these respects], the more
   humble-minded ought he to be, and to seek the common good of all, and
   not merely his own advantage.
   Chapter XLIX.-The Praise of Love.

   Let him who has love in Christ keep the commandments of Christ. Who can
   describe the [blessed] bond of the love of God? What man is able to
   tell the excellence of its beauty, as it ought to be told? The height
   to which love exalts is unspeakable. Love unites us to God. Love covers
   a multitude of sins.^[283]220 Love beareth all things, is
   long-suffering in all things.^[284]221 There is nothing base, nothing
   arrogant in love. Love admits of no schisms: love gives rise to no
   seditions: love does all things in harmony. By love have all the elect
   of God been made perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing to God.
   In love has the Lord taken us to Himself. On account of the Love he
   bore us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave His blood for us by the will of
   God; His flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls.^[285]222
   Chapter L.-Let Us Pray to Be Thought Worthy of Love.

   Ye see, beloved, how great and wonderful a thing is love, and that
   there is no declaring its perfection. Who is fit to be found in it,
   except such as God has vouchsafed to render so? Let us pray, therefore,
   and implore of His mercy, that we may live blameless in love, free from
   all human partialities for one above another. All the generations from
   Adam even unto this day have passed away; but those who, through the
   grace of God, have been made perfect in love, now possess a place among
   the godly, and shall be made manifest at the revelation^[286]223 of the
   kingdom of Christ. For it is written, "Enter into thy secret chambers
   for a little time, until my wrath and fury pass away; and I will
   remember a propitious^[287]224 day, and will raise you up out of your
   graves."^[288]225 Blessed are we, beloved, if we keep the commandments
   of God in the harmony of love; that so through love our sins may be
   forgiven us. For it is written, "Blessed are they whose transgressions
   are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin
   the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose mouth there is no
   guile."^[289]226 This blessedness cometh upon those who have been
   chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be glory for ever
   and ever. Amen.
   Chapter LI.-Let the Partakers in Strife Acknowledge Their Sins.

   Let us therefore implore forgiveness for all those transgressions which
   through any [suggestion] of the adversary we have committed. And those
   who have been the leaders of sedition and disagreement ought to have
   respect^[290]227 to the common hope. For such as live in fear and love
   would rather that they themselves than their neighbours should be
   involved in suffering. And they prefer to bear blame themselves, rather
   than that the concord which has been well and piously^[291]228 handed
   down to us should suffer. For it is better that a man should
   acknowledge his transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as
   the hearts of those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses
   the servant of God, and whose condemnation was made manifest [unto
   all]. For they went down alive into Hades, and death swallowed them
   up.^[292]229 Pharaoh with his army and all the princes of Egypt, and
   the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the depths of the Red Sea,
   and perished,^[293]230 for no other reason than that their foolish
   hearts were hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been wrought
   in the land of Egypt by Moses the servant of God.
   Chapter LII.-Such a Confession is Pleasing to God.

   The Lord, brethren, stands in need of nothing; and He desires nothing
   of any one, except that confession be made to Him. For, says the elect
   David, "I will confess unto the Lord ; and that will please Him more
   than a young bullock that hath horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it,
   and be glad."^[294]231 And again he saith, "Offer^[295]232 unto God the
   sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High. And call upon
   Me in the day of thy trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
   glorify Me."^[296]233 For "the sacrifice of God is a broken
   spirit."^[297]234
   Chapter LIII.-The Love of Moses Towards His People.

   Ye understand, beloved, ye understand well the Sacred Scriptures, and
   ye have looked very earnestly into the oracles of God. Call then these
   things to your remembrance. When Moses went up into the mount, and
   abode there, with fasting and humiliation, forty days and forty nights,
   the Lord said unto him, "Moses, Moses, get thee down quickly from
   hence; for thy people whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt
   have committed iniquity. They have speedily departed from the way in
   which I commanded them to walk, and have made to themselves molten
   images."^[298]235 And the Lord said unto him, "I have spoken to thee
   once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a
   stiff-necked people: let Me destroy them, and blot out their name from
   under heaven; and I will make thee a great and wonderful nation, and
   one much more numerous than this."^[299]236 But Moses said, "Far be it
   from Thee, Lord: pardon the sin of this people; else blot me also out
   of the book of the living."^[300]237 O marvellous^[301]238 love! O
   insuperable perfection! The servant speaks freely to his Lord, and asks
   forgiveness for the people, or begs that he himself might
   perish^[302]239 along with them.
   Chapter LIV.-He Who is Full of Love Will Incur Every Loss, that Peace
       May Be Restored to the Church.

   Who then among you is noble-minded? who compassionate? who full of
   love? Let him declare, "If on my account sedition and disagreement and
   schisms have arisen, I will depart, I will go away whithersoever ye
   desire, and I will do whatever the majority^[303]240 commands; only let
   the flock of Christ live on terms of peace with the presbyters set over
   it." He that acts thus shall procure to himself great glory in the
   Lord; and every place will welcome^[304]241 him. For "the earth is the
   Lord's, and the fulness thereof."^[305]242 These things they who live a
   godly life, that is never to be repented of, both have done and always
   will do.
   Chapter LV.-Examples of Such Love.

   To bring forward some examples from among the heathen: Many kings and
   princes, in times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an
   oracle, have given themselves up to death, in order that by their own
   blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens [from destruction]. Many
   have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be
   brought to an end within them. We know many among ourselves who have
   given themselves up to bonds, in order that they might ransom others.
   Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery, that with the
   price^[306]243 which they received for themselves, they might provide
   food for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of
   God, have performed numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when
   her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into
   the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went
   out for the love which she bare to her country and people then
   besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a
   woman.^[307]244 Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to
   no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from
   impending destruction. For with fasting and humiliation she entreated
   the everlasting God, who seeth all things; and He, perceiving the
   humility of her spirit, delivered the people for whose sake she had
   encountered peril.^[308]245 .
   Chapter LVI.-Let Us Admonish and Correct One Another.

   Let us then also pray for those who have fallen into any sin, that
   meekness and humility may be given to them, so that they may submit,
   not unto us, but to the will of God. For in this way they shall secure
   a fruitful and perfect remembrance from us, with sympathy for them,
   both in our prayers to God, and our mention of them to the
   saints.^[309]246 Let us receive correction, beloved, on account of
   which no one should feel displeased. Those exhortations by which we
   admonish one another are both good [in themselves] and highly
   profitable, for they tend to unite^[310]247 us to the will of God. For
   thus saith the holy Word: "The Lord hath severely chastened me, yet
   hath not given me over to death."^[311]248 "For whom the Lord loveth He
   chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth."^[312]249 "The
   righteous," saith it, "shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but
   let not the oil of sinners make fat my head."^[313]250 And again he
   saith, "Blessed is the man whom the Lord reproveth, and reject not thou
   the warning of the Almighty. For He causes sorrow, and again restores
   [to gladness]; He woundeth, and His hands make whole. He shall deliver
   thee in six troubles, yea, in the seventh no evil shall touch thee. In
   famine He shall rescue thee from death, and in war He shall free thee
   from the power^[314]251 of the sword. From the scourge of the tongue
   will He hide thee, and thou shalt not fear when evil cometh. Thou shalt
   laugh at the unrighteous and the wicked, and shalt not be afraid of the
   beasts of the field. For the wild beasts shall be at peace with thee:
   then shalt thou know that thy house shall be in peace, and the
   habitation of thy tabernacle shall not fail.^[315]252 Thou shall know
   also that thy seed shall be great, and thy children like the grass of
   the field. And thou shall come to the grave like ripened corn which is
   reaped in its season, or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is
   gathered together at the proper time."^[316]253 Ye see, beloved, that
   protection is afforded to those that are chastened of the Lord; for
   since God is good, He corrects us, that we may be admonished by His
   holy chastisement.
   Chapter LVII.-Let the Authors of Sedition Submit Themselves.

   Ye therefore, who laid the foundation of this sedition, submit
   yourselves to the presbyters, and receive correction so as to repent,
   bending the knees of your hearts. Learn to be subject, laying aside the
   proud and arrogant self-confidence of your tongue. For it is better for
   you that ye should occupy^[317]254 a humble but honourable place in the
   flock of Christ, than that, being highly exalted, ye should be cast out
   from the hope of His people.^[318]255 For thus speaketh all-virtuous
   Wisdom:^[319]256 " Behold, I will bring forth to you the words of My
   Spirit, and I will teach you My speech. Since I called, and ye did not
   hear; I held forth My words, and ye regarded not, but set at naught My
   counsels, and yielded not at My reproofs; therefore I too will laugh at
   your destruction; yea, I will rejoice when ruin cometh upon you, and
   when sudden confusion overtakes you, when overturning presents itself
   like a tempest, or when tribulation and oppression fall upon you. For
   it shall come to pass, that when ye call upon Me, I will not hear you;
   the wicked shall seek Me, and they shall not find Me. For they hated
   wisdom, and did not choose the fear of the Lord; nor would they listen
   to My counsels, but despised My reproofs. Wherefore they shall eat the
   fruits of their own way, and they shall be filled with their own
   ungodliness." ...^[320]257
   Chapter LVIII.-Blessings Sought for All that Call Upon God.

   May God, who seeth all things, and who is the Ruler of all spirits and
   the Lord of all flesh-who chose our Lord Jesus Christ and us through
   Him to be a peculiar^[321]258 people-grant to every soul that calleth
   upon His glorious and holy Name, faith, fear, peace, patience,
   long-suffering, self-control, purity, and sobriety, to the
   well-pleasing of His Name, through our High Priest and Protector, Jesus
   Christ, by whom be to Him glory, and majesty, and power, and honour,
   both now and for evermore. Amen.
   Chapter LIX.-The Corinthians are Exhorted Speedily to Send Back Word
       that Peace Has Been Restored. The Benediction.

   Send back speedily to us in peace and with joy these our messengers to
   you: Claudius Ephebus and Valerius Bito, with Fortunatus: that they may
   the sooner announce to us the peace and harmony we so earnestly desire
   and long for [among you], and that we may the more quickly rejoice over
   the good order re-established among you. The grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ be with you, and with all everywhere that are the called of God
   through Him, by whom be to Him glory, honour, power, majesty, and
   eternal dominion,^[322]259 from everlasting to everlasting.^[323]260
   Amen.^[324]261
