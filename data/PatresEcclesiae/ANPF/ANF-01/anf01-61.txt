                                Elucidation.

   The editor of this American Series confines himself in general to such
   occasional and very brief annotations as may suggest to students and
   others the practical views which are requisite to a clear comprehension
   of authors who wrote for past ages; for a sort and condition of men no
   longer existing, whose extinction as a class is, indeed, largely due to
   these writings. But he reserved to himself the privilege of correcting
   palpable mistakes, especially in points which bear upon questions of
   our own times.

   That our learned translators have unaccountably admitted a very
   inaccurate translation of the crucial paragraph in book iii. cap. iii.
   sect. 2, I have shown in the footnote at that place. It is evident, (1)
   because they themselves are not satisfied with it, and (2) because I
   have set it side by side with the more literal rendering of a writer
   who would have preferred their reading if it could have borne the test
   of criticism.

   Now, the authors of the Latin translation^[5]486 may have designed the
   ambiguity which gives the Ultramontane party an apparent advantage; but
   it is an advantage which disappears as soon as it is examined, and
   hence I am content to take it as it stands. Various conjectures have
   been made as to the original Greek of Irenaeus; but the Latin answers
   every purpose of the author's argument, and is fatal to the claims of
   the Papacy. Let me recur to the translation given, in loco, from a
   Roman Catholic, and this will be seen at once.

   For he thus renders it:-

   1. In this Church, "ever, by those who are on every side, has been
   preserved that tradition which is from apostles." How would such a
   proposition have sounded to Pius IX. in the Vatican Council? The faith
   is preserved by those who come to Rome, not by the Bishop who presides
   there.

   2. "For to this Church, on account of more potent principality, it is
   necessary that every Church (that is, those who are, on every side,
   faithful) resort." The greatness of Rome, that is, as the capital of
   the Empire, imparts to the local Church a superior dignity, even as
   compared with Lyons, or any other metropolitical Church. Everybody
   visits Rome: hence you find there faithful witnesses from every side
   (from all the Churches); and Their united testimony it is which
   preserves in Rome the pure apostolic traditions.

   The Latin, thus translated by a candid Roman Catholic, reverses the
   whole system of the Papacy. Pius IX. informed his Bishops, at the late
   Council, that they were not called to bear their testimony, but to hear
   his infallible decree; "reducing us," said the Archbishop of Paris, "to
   a council of sacristans."

   Sustaining these views by a few footnotes, I add (1) a literal
   rendering of my own, and then (2) a metaphrase of the same, bringing
   out the argument from the crabbed obstructions of the Latin text. This,
   then, is what Irenaeus says: (a) "For it is necessary for every Church
   (that is to say, the faithful from all parts) to meet in this Church,
   on account of the superior magistracy; in which Church, by those who
   are from all places, the tradition of the apostles has been preserved."
   Or, more freely rendered: (b) "On account of the chief magistracy [of
   the empire], the faithful from all parts, representing every Church,
   are obliged to resort to Rome, and there to come together; so that [it
   is the distinction of this Church that], in it, the tradition of the
   apostles has been preserved by Christians gathered together out of all
   the Churches." Taking the entire argument of our author with the
   context, then, it amounts to this: "We must ask, not for local, but
   universal, testimony. Now, in every Church founded by the apostles has
   been handed down their traditions; but, as it would be a tedious thing
   to collect them all, let this suffice. Take that Church (nearest at
   hand, and which is the only Apostolic Church of the West), the great
   and glorious Church at Rome, which was there founded by the two
   apostles Peter and Paul. In her have been preserved the traditions of
   all the Churches, because everybody is forced to go to the seat of
   empire: and therefore, by these representatives of the whole Catholic
   Church, the apostolic traditions have been all collected in Rome: and
   you have a synoptical view of all Churches in what is there preserved."
   Had the views of the modern Papacy ever entered the head of Irenaeus,
   what an absurdity would be this whole argument. He would have said, "It
   is no matter what may be gathered elsewhere; for the Bishop of Rome is
   the infallible oracle of all Catholic truth, and you will always find
   it by his mouth." It should be noted that Orthodoxy was indeed
   preserved there, just so long as Rome permitted other Churches to
   contribute their testimony on the principle of Irenaeus, and thus to
   make her the depository of all Catholic tradition, as witnessed "by
   all, everywhere, and from the beginning." But all this is turned upside
   down by modern Romanism. No other Church is to be heard or considered;
   but Rome takes all into her own power, and may dictate to all Churches
   what they are to believe, however novel, or contrary to the torrent of
   antiquity in the teachings of their own founders and great doctors in
   all past time.
