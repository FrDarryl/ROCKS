                 The Epistle of Ignatius to the Philippians

                                ------------

   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of God which is
   at Philippi, which has obtained mercy in faith, and patience, and love
   unfeigned: Mercy and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus
   Christ, "who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that
   believe."^[20]1
   Chapter I.-Reason for Writing the Epistle.

   Being mindful of your love and of your zeal in Christ, which ye have
   manifested towards us, we thought it fitting to write to you, who
   display such a godly and spiritual love to the brethren,^[21]2 to put
   you in remembrance of your Christian course,^[22]3 "that ye all speak
   the same thing, being of one mind, thinking the same thing, and walking
   by the same rule of faith,"^[23]4 as Paul admonished you. For if there
   is one God of the universe, the Father of Christ, "of whom are all
   things; "^[24]5 and one Lord Jesus Christ, our [Lord], "by whom are all
   things; "^[25]6 and also one Holy Spirit, who wrought^[26]7 in Moses,
   and in the prophets and apostles; and also one baptism, which is
   administered that we should have fellowship with the death of the
   Lord;^[27]8 and also one elect Church; there ought likewise to be but
   one faith in respect to Christ. For "there is one Lord, one faith, one
   baptism; one God and Father of all, who is through all, and in
   all."^[28]9
   Chapter II.-Unity of the Three Divine Persons.

   There is then one God and Father, and not two or three; One who is; and
   there is no other besides Him, the only true [God]. For "the Lord thy
   God," saith [the Scripture], "is one Lord."^[29]10 And again, "Hath not
   one God created us? Have we not all one Father?^[30]11 And there is
   also one Son, God the Word. For "the only-begotten Son," saith [the
   Scripture], "who is in the bosom of the Father."^[31]12 And again, "One
   Lord Jesus Christ."^[32]13 And in another place, "What is His name, or
   what His Son's name, that we may know? "^[33]14 And there is also one
   Paraclete.^[34]15 For "there is also," saith [the Scripture], "one
   Spirit,"^[35]16 since "we have been called in one hope of our
   calling."^[36]17 And again, "We have drunk of one Spirit,"^[37]18 with
   what follows. And it is manifest that all these gifts [possessed by
   believers] "worketh one and the self-same Spirit."^[38]19 There are not
   then either three Fathers,^[39]20 or three Sons, or three Paracletes,
   but one Father, and one Son, and one Paraclete. Wherefore also the
   Lord, when He sent forth the apostles to make disciples of all nations,
   commanded them to "baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost,"^[40]21 not unto one [person] having three
   names, nor into three [persons] who became incarnate, but into three
   possessed of equal honour.
   Chapter III.-Christ Was Truly Born, and Died.

   For there is but One that became incarnate, and that neither the Father
   nor the Paraclete, but the Son only, [who became so] not in appearance
   or imagination, but in reality. For "the Word became flesh."^[41]22 For
   "Wisdom builded for herself a house."^[42]23 And God the Word was born
   as man, with a body, of the Virgin, without any intercourse of man. For
   [it is written], "A virgin shall conceive in her womb, and bring forth
   a son."^[43]24 He was then truly born, truly grew up, truly ate and
   drank, was truly crucified, and died, and rose again. He who believes
   these things, as they really were, and as they really took place, is
   blessed. He who believeth them not is no less accursed than those who
   crucified the Lord. For the prince of this world rejoiceth when any one
   denies the cross, since he knows that the confession of the cross is
   his own destruction. For that is the trophy which has been raised up
   against his power, which when he sees, he shudders, and when he hears
   of, is afraid.
   Chapter IV.-The Malignity and Folly of Satan.

   And indeed, before the cross was erected, he (Satan) was eager that it
   should be so; and he "wrought" [for this end] "in the children of
   disobedience."^[44]25 He wrought in Judas, in the Pharisees, in the
   Sadducees, in the old, in the young, and in the priests. But when it
   was just about to be erected, he was troubled, and infused repentance
   into the traitor, and pointed him to a rope to hang himself with, and
   taught him [to die by] strangulation. He terrified also the silly
   woman, disturbing her by dreams; and he, who had tried every means to
   have the cross prepared, now endeavoured to put a stop to its
   erection;^[45]26 not that he was influenced by repentance on account of
   the greatness of his crime (for in that case he would not be utterly
   depraved), but because he perceived his own destruction [to be at
   hand]. For the cross of Christ was the beginning of his condemnation
   the beginning of his death, the beginning of his destruction.
   Wherefore, also, he works in some that they should deny the cross, be
   ashamed of the passion, call the death an appearance, mutilate and
   explain away the birth of the Virgin, and calumniate the [human]
   nature^[46]27 itself as being abominable. He fights along with the Jews
   to a denial of the cross, and with the Gentiles to the calumniating of
   Mary,^[47]28 who are heretical in holding that Christ possessed a mere
   phantasmal body.^[48]29 For the leader of all wickedness assumes
   manifold^[49]30 forms, beguiler of men as he is, inconsistent, and even
   contradicting himself, projecting one course and then following
   another. For he is wise to do evil, but as to what good may be he is
   totally ignorant. And indeed he is full of ignorance, on account of his
   voluntary want of reason: for how can he be deemed anything else who
   does not perceive reason when it lies at his very feet?
   Chapter V.-Apostrophe to Satan.

   For if the Lord were a mere man, possessed of a soul and body only, why
   dost thou mutilate and explain away His being born with the common
   nature of humanity? Why dost thou call the passion a mere appearance,
   as if it were any strange thing happening to a [mere] man? And why dost
   thou reckon the death of a mortal to be simply an imaginary death? But
   if, [on the other hand, ] He is both God and man, then why dost thou
   call it unlawful to style Him "the Lord of glory,"^[50]31 who is by
   nature unchangeable? Why dost thou say that it is unlawful to declare
   of the Lawgiver who possesses a human soul, "The Word was made
   flesh,"^[51]32 and was a perfect man, and not merely one dwelling in a
   man? But how came this magician into existence, who of old formed all
   nature that can be apprehended either by the senses or intellect,
   according to the will of the Father; and, when He became incarnate,
   healed every kind of disease and infirmity?^[52]33
   Chapter VI.-Continuation.

   And how can He be but God, who raises up the dead, sends away the lame
   sound of limb, cleanses the lepers, restores sight to the blind, and
   either increases or transmutes existing substances, as the five loaves
   and the two fishes, and the water which became wine, and who puts to
   flight thy whole host by a mere word? And why dost thou abuse the
   nature of the Virgin, and style her members disgraceful, since thou
   didst of old display such in public processions,^[53]34 and didst order
   them to be exhibited naked, males in the sight of females, and females
   to stir up the unbridled lust of males? But now these are reckoned by
   thee disgraceful, and thou pretendest to be full of modesty, thou
   spirit of fornication, not knowing that then only anything becomes
   disgraceful when it is polluted by wickedness. But when sin is not
   present, none of the things that have been created are shameful, none
   of them evil, but all very good. But inasmuch as thou art blind, thou
   revilest these things.
   Chapter VII.-Continuation: Inconsistency of Satan.

   And how, again, does Christ not at all appear to thee to be of the
   Virgin, but to be God over all,^[54]35 and the Almighty? Say, then, who
   sent Him? Who was Lord over Him? And whose will did He obey? And what
   laws did He fulfil, since He was subject neither to the will nor power
   of any one? And while you deny that Christ was born,^[55]36 you affirm
   that the unbegotten was begotten, and that He who had no beginning was
   nailed to the cross, by whose permission I am unable to say. But thy
   changeable tactics do not escape me, nor am I ignorant that thou art
   wont to walk with slanting and uncertain^[56]37 steps. And thou art
   ignorant who really was born, thou who pretendest to know everything.
   Chapter VIII.-Continuation: Ignorance of Satan.

   For many things are unknown^[57]38 to thee; [such as the following]:
   the virginity of Mary; the wonderful birth; Who it was that became
   incarnate; the star which guided those who were in the east; the Magi
   who presented gifts; the salutation of the archangel to the Virgin; the
   marvellous conception of her that was betrothed; the announcement of
   the boy-forerunner respecting the son of the Virgin, and his leaping in
   the womb on account of what was foreseen; the songs of the angels over
   Him that was born; the glad tidings announced to the shepherds; the
   fear of Herod lest his kingdom should be taken from him; the command to
   slay the infants; the removal into Egypt, and the return from that
   country to the same region; the infant swaddling-bands; the human
   registration; the nourishing by means of milk; the name of father given
   to Him who did not beget; the manger because there was not room
   [elsewhere]; no human preparation [for the Child]; the gradual growth,
   human speech, hunger, thirst, journeyings, weariness; the offering of
   sacrifices and then also circumcision, baptism; the voice of God over
   Him that was baptized, as to who He was and whence [He had come]; the
   testimony of the Spirit and the Father from above; the voice of John
   the prophet when it signified the passion by the appellation of "the
   Lamb; "the performance of divers miracles, manifold healings; the
   rebuke of the Lord ruling both the sea and the winds; evil spirits
   expelled; thou thyself subjected to torture, and, when afflicted by the
   power of Him who had been manifested, not having it in thy power to do
   anything.
   Chapter IX.-Continuation: Ignorance of Satan.

   Seeing these things, thou wast in utter perplexity.^[58]39 And thou
   wast ignorant that it was a virgin that should bring forth; but the
   angels' song of praise struck thee with astonishment, as well as the
   adoration of the Magi, and the appearance of the star. Thou didst
   revert to thy state of [wilful] ignorance, because all the
   circumstances seemed to thee trifling;^[59]40 for thou didst deem the
   swaddling-bands, the circumcision, and the nourishment by means of milk
   contemptible:^[60]41 these things appeared to thee unworthy of God.
   Again, thou didst behold a man who remained forty days and nights
   without tasting human food, along with ministering angels at whose
   presence thou didst shudder, when first of all thou hadst seen Him
   baptized as a common man, and knewest not the reason thereof. But after
   His [lengthened] fast thou didst again assume thy wonted audacity, and
   didst tempt Him when hungry, as if He had been an ordinary man, not
   knowing who He was. For thou saidst, "If thou be the Son of God,
   command that these stones be made bread."^[61]42 Now, this expression,
   "If thou be the Son," is an indication of ignorance. For if thou hadst
   possessed real knowledge, thou wouldst have understood that the Creator
   can with equal ease both create what does not exist, and change that
   which already has a being. And thou temptedst by means of hunger^[62]43
   Him who nourisheth all that require food. And thou temptedst the very
   "Lord of glory,"^[63]44 forgetting in thy malevolence that "man shall
   not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
   mouth of God." For if thou hadst known that He was the Son of God, thou
   wouldst also have understood that He who had kept his^[64]45 body from
   feeling any want for forty days and as many nights, could have also
   done the same for ever. Why, then, does He suffer hunger? In order to
   prove that He had assumed a body subject to the same feelings as those
   of ordinary men. By the first fact He showed that He was God, and by
   the second that He was also man.
   Chapter X.-Continuation: Audacity of Satan.

   Darest thou, then, who didst fall "as lightning"^[65]46 from the very
   highest glory, to say to the Lord, "Cast thyself down from hence^[66]47
   [to Him] to whom the things that are not are reckoned as if they
   were,^[67]48 and to provoke to a display of vainglory Him that was free
   from all ostentation? And didst thou pretend to read in Scripture
   concerning Him: "For He hath given His angels charge concerning Thee,
   and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest thou shouldest dash
   Thy foot against a stone? "^[68]49 At the same time thou didst pretend
   to be ignorant of the rest, furtively concealing what [the Scripture]
   predicted concerning thee and thy servants: "Thou shalt tread upon the
   adder and the basilisk; the lion and the dragon shall thou trample
   under foot."^[69]50
   Chapter XI.-Continuation: Audacity of Satan.

   If, therefore, thou art trodden down under the feet of the Lord, how
   dost thou tempt Him that cannot be tempted, forgetting that precept of
   the lawgiver, "Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God? "^[70]51 Yea,
   thou even darest, most accursed one, to appropriate the works of God to
   thyself, and to declare that the dominion over these was delivered to
   thee.^[71]52 And thou dost set forth thine own fall as an example to
   the Lord, and dost promise to give Him what is really His own, if He
   would fall down and worship thee.^[72]53 And how didst thou not
   shudder, O thou spirit more wicked through thy malevolence than all
   other wicked spirits, to utter such words against the Lord? Through
   thine appetite^[73]54 was thou overcome, and through thy vainglory wast
   thou brought to dishonour: through avarice and ambition dost thou [now]
   draw on [others] to ungodliness. Thou, O Belial, dragon, apostate,
   crooked serpent, rebel against God, outcast from Christ, alien from the
   Holy Spirit, exile from the ranks of the angels, reviler of the laws of
   God, enemy of all that is lawful, who didst rise up against the
   first-formed of men, and didst drive forth [from obedience to] the
   commandment [of God] those who had in no respect injured thee; thou who
   didst raise up against Abel the murderous Cain; thou who didst take
   arms against Job: dost thou say to the Lord, "If Thou wilt fall down
   and worship me? "Oh what audacity! Oh what madness! Thou runaway slave,
   thou incorrigible^[74]55 slave, dost thou rebel against the good Lord?
   Dost thou say to so great a Lord, the God of all that either the mind
   or the senses can perceive, "If Thou wilt fall down and worship me? "
   Chapter XII.-The Meek Reply of Christ.

   But the Lord is long-suffering, and does not reduce to nothing him who
   in his ignorance dares [to utter] such words, but meekly replies, "Get
   thee hence, Satan."^[75]56 He does not say, "Get thee behind Me," for
   it is not possible that he should be converted; but, "Begone, Satan,"
   to the course which thou hast chosen. "Begone"to those things to which,
   through thy malevolence, thou hast been called. For I know Who I am,
   and by Whom I have been sent, and Whom it behoves Me to worship. For
   "thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
   serve."^[76]57 I know the one [God]; I am acquainted with the only
   [Lord] from whom thou hast become an apostate. I am not an enemy of
   God; I acknowledge His pre-eminence; I know the Father, who is the
   author of my generation.
   Chapter XIII.-Various Exhortations and Directions.

   These things, brethren, out of the affection which I entertain for you,
   I have felt compelled to write, exhorting you with a view to the glory
   of God, not as if I were a person of any consequence, but simply as a
   brother. Be ye subject to the bishop, to the presbyters, and to the
   deacons. Love one another in the Lord, as being the images of God. Take
   heed, ye husbands, that ye love your wives as your own members. Ye
   wives also, love your husbands, as being one with them in virtue of
   your union. If any one lives in chastity or continence, let him not be
   lifted up, lest he lose his reward. Do not lightly esteem the
   festivals. Despise not the period of forty days, for it comprises an
   imitation of the conduct of the Lord. After the week of the passion, do
   not neglect to fast on the fourth and sixth days, distributing at the
   same time of thine abundance to the poor. If any one fasts on the
   Lord's Day or on the Sabbath, except on the paschal Sabbath only, he is
   a murderer of Christ.
   Chapter XIV.-Farewells and Cautions.

   Let your prayers be extended to the Church of Antioch, whence also I as
   a prisoner am being led to Rome. I salute the holy bishop Polycarp; I
   salute the holy bishop Vitalius, and the sacred presbytery, and my
   fellow-servants the deacons; in whose stead may my soul be found. Once
   more I bid farewell to the bishop, and to the presbyters in the Lord.
   If any one celebrates the passover along with the Jews, or receives the
   emblems of their feast, he is a partaker with those that killed the
   Lord and His apostles.
   Chapter XV.-Salutations. Conclusion.

   Philo and Agathopus the deacons salute you. I salute the company of
   virgins, and the order of widows; of whom may I have joy! I salute the
   people of the Lord, from the least unto the greatest. I have sent you
   this letter through Euphanius the reader, a man honoured of God, and
   very faithful, happening to meet with him at Rhegium, just as he was
   going on board ship. Remember my bonds^[77]58 that I may be made
   perfect in Christ. Fare ye well in the flesh, the soul, and the spirit,
   while ye think of things perfect, and turn yourselves away from the
   workers of iniquity, who corrupt the word of truth, and are
   strengthened inwardly by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
