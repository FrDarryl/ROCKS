      INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE EPISTLE OF POLYCARP TO THE PHILIPPIANS.

                                ------------

   [a.d. 65-100-155.] The Epistle of Polycarp is usually made a sort of
   preface to those of Ignatius, for reasons which will be obvious to the
   reader. Yet he was born later, and lived to a much later period. They
   seem to have been friends from the days of their common pupilage under
   St. John; and there is nothing improbable in the conjecture of Usher,
   that he was the "angel of the church in Smyrna," to whom the Master
   says, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
   life." His pupil Irenaeus gives us one of the very few portraits of an
   apostolic man which are to be found in antiquity, in a few sentences
   which are a picture: "I could describe the very place in which the
   blessed Polycarp sat and taught; his going out and coming in; the whole
   tenor of his life; his personal appearance; how he would speak of the
   conversations he had held with John and with others who had seen the
   Lord. How did he make mention of their words and of whatever he had
   heard from them respecting the Lord." Thus he unconsciously tantalizes
   our reverent curiosity. Alas! that such conversations were not written
   for our learning. But there is a wise Providence in what is withheld,
   as well as in the inestimable treasures we have received.

   Irenaeus will tell us more concerning him, his visit to Rome, his
   rebuke of Marcion, and incidental anecdotes, all which are instructive.
   The expression which he applied to Marcion is found in this Epistle.
   Other facts of interest are found in the Martyrdom, which follows in
   these pages. His death, in extreme old age under the first of the
   Antonines, has been variously dated; but we may accept the date we have
   given, as rendered probable by that of the Paschal question, which he
   so lovingly settled with Anicetus, Bishop of Rome.

   The Epistle to the Philippians is the more interesting as denoting the
   state of that beloved church, the firstborn of European churches, and
   so greatly endeared to St. Paul. It abounds in practical wisdom, and is
   rich in Scripture and Scriptural allusions. It reflects the spirit of
   St. John, alike in its lamb-like and its aquiline features: he is as
   loving as the beloved disciple himself when he speaks of Christ and his
   church, but "the son of thunder" is echoed in his rebukes of threatened
   corruptions in faith and morals. Nothing can be more clear than his
   view of the doctrines of grace; but he writes like the disciple of St.
   John, though in perfect harmony with St. Paul's hymn-like eulogy of
   Christian love.

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:-

   The authenticity of the following Epistle can on no fair grounds be
   questioned. It is abundantly established by external testimony, and is
   also supported by the internal evidence. Irenaeus says (Adv. Haer.,
   iii. 3): "There is extant an Epistle of Polycarp written to the
   Philippians, most satisfactory, from which those that have a mind to do
   so may learn the character of his faith," etc. This passage is embodied
   by Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History (iv. 14); and in another
   place the same writer refers to the Epistle before us as an undoubted
   production of Polycarp (Hist. Eccl., iii. 36). Other ancient
   testimonies might easily be added, but are superfluous, inasmuch as
   there is a general consent among scholars at the present day that we
   have in this letter an authentic production of the renowned Bishop of
   Smyrna.

   Of Polycarp's life little is known, but that little is highly
   interesting. Irenaeus was his disciple, and tells us that "Polycarp was
   instructed by the apostles, and was brought into contact with many who
   had seen Christ" (Adv. Haer., iii. 3; Euseb. Hist. Eccl., iv. 14).
   There is also a very graphic account given of Polycarp by Irenaeus in
   his Epistle to Florinus, to which the reader is referred. It has been
   preserved by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., v. 20 ).

   The Epistle before us is not perfect in any of the Greek mss. which
   contain it. But the chapters wanting in Greek are contained in an
   ancient Latin version. While there is no ground for supposing, as some
   have done, that the whole Epistle is spurious, there seems considerable
   force in the arguments by which many others have sought to prove chap.
   xiii. to be an interpolation.

   The date of the Epistle cannot be satisfactorily determined. It depends
   on the conclusion we reach as to some points, very difficult and
   obscure, connected with that account of the martyrdom of Polycarp which
   has come down to us. We shall not, however, probably be far wrong if we
   fix it about the middle of the second century.
