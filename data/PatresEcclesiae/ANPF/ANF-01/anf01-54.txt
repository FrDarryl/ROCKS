                      The Martyrdom of the Holy Martyrs

     Justin, Chariton, Charites, Paeon, and Liberianus, Who Suffered at
                                    Rome.

                   [Translated by the Rev. M. Dods, M.a.]

                                  --------
   Chapter I.-Examination of Justin by the Prefect.

   In the time of the lawless partisans of idolatry, wicked decrees were
   passed against the godly Christians in town and country, to force them
   to offer libations to vain idols; and accordingly the holy men, having
   been apprehended, were brought before the prefect of Rome, Rusticus by
   name. And when they had been brought before his judgment-seat, said to
   Justin, "Obey the gods at once, and submit to the kings."^[11]1 Justin
   said, "To obey the commandments of our Saviour Jesus Christ is worthy
   neither of blame nor of condemnation." Rusticus the prefect said, "What
   kind of doctrines do you profess? "Justin said, "I have endeavoured to
   learn all doctrines; but I have acquiesced at last in the true
   doctrines, those namely of the Christians, even though they do not
   please those who hold false opinions." Rusticus the prefect said, "Are
   those the doctrines that please you, you utterly wretched man? "Justin
   said, "Yes, since I adhere to them with right dogma."^[12]2 Rusticus
   the prefect said, "What is the dogma? "Justin said, "That according to
   which we worship the God of the Christians, whom we reckon to be one
   from the beginning, the maker and fashioner of the whole creation,
   visible and invisible; and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who
   had also been preached beforehand by the prophets as about to be
   present with the race of men, the herald of salvation and teacher of
   good disciples. And I, being a man, think that what I can say is
   insignificant in comparison with His boundless divinity, acknowledging
   a Certain prophetic power,^[13]3 since it was prophesied concerning Him
   of whom now I say that He is the Son of God. For I know that of old the
   prophets foretold His appearance among men."
   Chapter II.-Examination of Justin Continued.

   Rusticus the prefect said, "Where do you assemble? "Justin said, "Where
   each one chooses and can: for do you fancy that we all meet in the very
   same place? Not so; because the God of the Christians is not
   circumscribed by place; but being invisible, fills heaven and earth,
   and everywhere is worshipped and glorified by the faithful." Rusticus
   the prefect said, "Tell me where you assemble, or into what place do
   you collect your followers? "Justin said, "I live above one Martinus,
   at the Timiotinian Bath; and during the whole time (and I am now living
   in Rome for the second time) I am unaware of any other meeting than
   his. And if any one wished to come to me, I communicated to him the
   doctrines of truth." Rusticus said, "Are you not, then, a Christian?
   "Justin said, "Yes, I am a Christian."
   Chapter III.-Examination of Chariton and Others.

   Then said the prefect Rusticus to Chariton, "Tell me further, Chariton,
   are you also a Christian? "Chariton said, "I am a Christian by the
   command of God." Rusticus the prefect asked the woman Charito, "What
   say you, Charito? "Charito said, "I am a Christian by the grace of
   God." Rusticus said to Euelpistus, "And what are you? "Euelpistus, a
   servant of Caesar, answered, "I too am a Christian, having been freed
   by Christ; and by the grace of Christ I partake of the same hope."
   Rusticus the prefect said to Hierax, "And you, are you a Christian?
   "Hierax said, "Yes, I am a Christian, for I revere and worship the same
   God." Rusticus the prefect said, "Did Justin make you Christians?
   "Hierax said, "I was a Christian, and will be a Christian." And Paeon
   stood up and said, "I too am a Christian." Rusticus the prefect said,
   "Who taught you? "Paeon said, "From our parents we received this good
   confession." Euelpistus said, "I willingly heard the words of Justin.
   But from my parents also I learned to be a Christian." Rusticus the
   prefect said, "Where are your parents? "Euelpistus said, "In
   Cappadocia." Rusticus says to Hierax, "Where are your parents? "And he
   answered, and said, "Christ is our true father, and faith in Him is our
   mother; and my earthly parents died; and I, when I was driven from
   Iconium in Phrygia, came here." Rusticus the prefect said to
   Liberianus, "And what say you? Are you a Christian, and unwilling to
   worship [the gods]? "Liberianus said, "I too am a Christian, for I
   worship and reverence the only true God."
   Chapter IV.-Rusticus Threatens the Christians with Death.

   The prefect says to Justin, "Hearken, you who are called learned, and
   think that you know true doctrines; if you are scourged and beheaded,
   do you believe you will ascend into heaven? "Justin said, "I hope that,
   if I endure these things, I shall have His gifts.^[14]4 For I know
   that, to all who have thus lived, there abides the divine favour until
   the completion of the whole world." Rusticus the prefect said, "Do you
   suppose, then, that you will ascend into heaven to receive some
   recompense? "Justin said, "I do not suppose it, but I know and am fully
   persuaded of it." Rusticus the prefect said, "Let us, then, now come to
   the matter in hand, and which presses. Having come together, offer
   sacrifice with one accord to the gods." Justin said, "No right-thinking
   person falls away from piety to impiety." Rusticus the prefect said,
   "Unless ye obey, ye shall be mercilessly punished." Justin said,
   "Through prayer we can be saved on account of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   even when we have been punished,^[15]5 because this shall become to us
   salvation and confidence at the more fearful and universal
   judgment-seat of our Lord and Saviour." Thus also said the other
   martyrs: "Do what you will, for we are Christians, and do not sacrifice
   to idols."
   Chapter V.-Sentence Pronounced and Executed.

   Rusticus the prefect pronounced sentence, saying, "Let those who have
   refused to sacrifice to the gods and to yield to the command of the
   emperor be scourged,^[16]6 and led away to suffer the punishment of
   decapitation, according to the laws." The holy martyrs having glorified
   God, and having gone forth to the accustomed place, were beheaded, and
   perfected their testimony in the confession of the Saviour. And some of
   the faithful having secretly removed their bodies, laid them in a
   suitable place, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ having wrought along
   with them, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
