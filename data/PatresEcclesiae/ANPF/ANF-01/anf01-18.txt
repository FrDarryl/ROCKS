                  The Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians

                         Shorter and Longer Versions

                                ------------
   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the holy Church which is at
       Tralles, in Asia, beloved of God, the Father of Jesus Christ,
       elect, and worthy of God, possessing peace through the flesh, and
       blood, and passion of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, through our
       rising again to Him,^[19]1 which also I salute in its
       fulness,^[20]2 and in the apostalical character,^[21]3 and wish
       abundance of happiness.
       Ignatius, who is also called Theaphorus, to the holy Church which
       is at Tralles, beloved by God the Rather, and Jesus Christ, elect,
       and worthy of God, possessing peace through the flesh and Spirit of
       Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in His passion by the cross and
       death, and in His resurrection, which also I salute in its
       fulness,^[22]4 and in the apostolical character,^[23]5 and wish
       abundance of happiness.
       Chapter I.-Acknowledgment of Their Excellence.

   I know that ye possess an unblameable and sincere mind in patience, and
   that not only in present practice,^[24]6 but according to inherent
   nature, as Polybius your bishop has shown me, who has come to Smyrna by
   the will of God and Jesus Christ, and so sympathized in the joy which
   I, who am bound in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your whole
   multitude in him. Having therefore received through him the testimony
   of your good-will, according to God, I gloried to find you, as I knew
   you were, the followers of God.

   I know that ye possess an unblameable and sincere mind in patience, and
   that not only for present use,^[25]7 but as a permanent possession, as
   Polybius your bishop has shown me, who has come to Smyrna by the will
   of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, His Son, with the
   co-operation of the Spirit, and so sympathized in the joy which I, who
   am bound in Christ Jesus, possess, that I beheld your whole multitude
   in Him. Having therefore received through him the testimony of your
   good-will according to God, I gloried to find that you were the
   followers of Jesus Christ the Saviour.
   Chapter II.-Be Subject to the Bishop, Etc.

   For, since ye are subject to the bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye appear
   to me to live not after the manner of men, but according to Jesus
   Christ, who died for us, in order, by believing in His death, ye may
   escape from death. It is therefore necessary that, as ye indeed do, so
   without the bishop ye should do nothing, but should also be subject to
   the presbytery, as to the apostle of Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in
   whom, if we live, we shall [at last] be found. It is fitting also that
   the deacons, as being [the ministers] of the mysteries of Jesus Christ,
   should in every respect be pleasing to all.^[26]8 For they are not
   ministers of meat and drink, but servants of the Church of God. They
   are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation [against
   them], as they would do fire.

   Be ye subject to the bishop as to the Lord, for "he watches for your
   souls, as one that shall give account to God."^[27]9 Wherefore also, ye
   appear to me to live not after the manner of men, but according to
   Jesus Christ, who died for us, in order that, by believing in His
   death, ye may by baptism be made partakers of His resurrection. It is
   therefore necessary, whatsoever things ye do, to do nothing without the
   bishop. And be ye subject also to the presbytery, as to the apostles of
   Jesus Christ, who is our hope, in whom, if we live, we shall be found
   in Him. It behoves you also, in every way, to please the deacons, who
   are [ministers] of the mysteries of Christ Jesus; for they are not
   ministers of meat and drink, but servants of the Church of God. They
   are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation [against
   them], as they would a burning fire. Let them, then, prove themselves
   to be such.
   Chapter III.-Honour the Deacons, Etc.

   In like manner, let all reverence the deacons as an appointment^[28]10
   of Jesus Christ, and the bishop as Jesus Christ, who is the Son of the
   Father, and the presbyters as the sanhedrim of God, and assembly of the
   apostles. Apart from these, there is no Church.^[29]11 Concerning all
   this, I am persuaded that ye are of the same opinion. For I have
   received the manifestation^[30]12 of your love, and still have it with
   me, in your bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive,^[31]13
   and his meekness of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly
   must reverence, seeing they are^[32]14 also pleased that I do not spare
   myself. But shall I, when permitted to write on this point, reach such
   a height of self-esteem, that though being a condemned^[33]15 man, I
   should issue commands to you as if I were an apostle?

   And do ye reverence them as Christ Jesus, of whose place they are the
   keepers, even as the bishop is the representative of the Father of all
   things, and the presbyters are the sanhedrim of God, and
   assembly^[34]16 of the apostles of Christ. Apart from these there is no
   elect Church, no congregation of holy ones, no assembly of saints. I am
   persuaded that ye also are of this opinion. For I have received the
   manifestation^[35]17 of your love, and still have it with me, in your
   bishop, whose very appearance is highly instructive, and his meekness
   of itself a power; whom I imagine even the ungodly must reverence.
   Loving you as I do, I avoid writing in any severer strain to you, that
   I may not seem harsh to any, or wanting [in tenderness]. I am indeed
   bound for the sake of Christ, but I am not yet worthy of Christ. But
   when I am perfected, perhaps I shall then become so. I do not issue
   orders like an apostle.
   Chapter IV.-I Have Need of Humility.

   I have great knowledge in God,^[36]18 but I restrain myself, lest, I
   should perish through boasting. For now it is needful for me to be the
   more fearful; and not give heed to those that puff me up. For they that
   speak to me [in the way of commendation] scourge me. For I do indeed
   desire to suffer, but I know not if I be worthy to do so. For this
   longing, though it is not manifest to many, all the more vehemently
   assails me.^[37]19 I therefore have need of meekness, by which the
   prince of this world is brought to nought.

   But I measure myself, that I may not perish through boasting: but it is
   good to glory in the Lord.^[38]20 And even though I were
   established^[39]21 in things pertaining to God, yet then would it befit
   me to be the more fearful, and not give heed to those that vainly puff
   me up. For those that commend me scourge me. [I do indeed desire to
   suffer^[40]22 ], but I know not if I be worthy to do so. For the envy
   of the wicked one is not visible to many, but it wars against me. I
   therefore have need of meekness, by which the devil, the prince of this
   world, is brought to nought.
   Chapter V.-I Will Not Teach You Profound Doctrines.

   Am I not able to write to you of heavenly things? But I fear to do so,
   lest I should inflict injury on you who are but babes [in Christ].
   Pardon me in this respect, lest, as not being able to receive [such
   doctrines], ye should be strangled by them. For even I, though I am
   bound [for Christ], yet am not on that account able to understand
   heavenly things, and the places^[41]23 of the angels, and their
   gatherings under their respective princes, things visible and
   invisible. Without reference to such abstruse subjects, I am still but
   a learner [in other respects^[42]24 ]; for many things are wanting to
   us, that we come not short of God.

   For might^[43]25 not I write to you things more full of mystery? But I
   fear to do so, lest I should inflict injury on you who are but babes
   [in Christ]. Pardon me in this respect, lest, as not being able to
   receive their weighty import,^[44]26 ye should be strangled by them.
   For even I, though I am bound [for Christ], and am able to understand
   heavenly things, the angelic orders, and the different sorts^[45]27 of
   angels and hosts, the distinctions between powers and dominions, and
   the diversities between thrones and authorities, the mightiness of the
   Aeons, and the pre-eminence of the cherubim and seraphim, the sublimity
   of the spirit, the kingdom of the Lord, and above all, the incomparable
   majesty of Almighty God-though I am acquainted with these things, yet
   am I not therefore by any means perfect; nor am I such a disciple as
   Paul or Peter. For many things are yet wanting to me, that I may not
   fall short of God.
   Chapter VI.-Abstain from the Poison of Heretics.

   I therefore, yet not I, but the love of Jesus Christ, entreat you that
   ye use Christian nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a
   different kind; I mean heresy. For those^[46]28 [that are given to
   this] mix^[47]29 up Jesus Christ with their own poison, speaking things
   which are unworthy of credit, like those who administer a deadly drug
   in sweet wine, which he who is ignorant of does greedily^[48]30 take,
   with a fatal pleasure^[49]31 leading to his own death.

   I therefore, yet not I, out the love of Jesus Christ, "entreat you that
   ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you;
   but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the
   same judgment."^[50]32 For there are some vain talkers^[51]33 and
   deceivers, not Christians, but Christ-betrayers,^[52]34 bearing about
   the name of Christ in deceit, and "corrupting the word"^[53]35 of the
   Gospel; while they intermix the poison of their deceit with their
   persuasive talk,^[54]36 as if they mingled aconite with sweet wine,
   that so he who drinks, being deceived in his taste by the very great
   sweetness of the draught, may incautiously meet with his death. One of
   the ancients gives us this advice, "Let no man be called good who mixes
   good with evil."^[55]37 For they speak of Christ, not that they may
   preach Christ, but that they may reject Christ; and they speak^[56]38
   of the law, not that they may establish the law, but that they may
   proclaim things contrary to it. For they alienate Christ from the
   Father, and the law from Christ. They also calumniate His being born of
   the Virgin; they are ashamed of His cross; they deny His passion; and
   they do not believe His resurrection. They introduce God as a Being
   unknown; they suppose Christ to be unbegotten; and as to the Spirit,
   they do not admit that He exists. Some of them say that the Son is a
   mere man, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are but the same
   person, and that the creation is the work of God, not by Christ, but by
   some other strange power.
   Chapter VII.-The Same Continued.

   Be on your guard, therefore, against such persons. And this will be the
   case with you if you are not puffed up, and continue in intimate union
   with^[57]39 Jesus Christ our God, and the bishop, and the enactments of
   the apostles. He that is within the altar is pure, but^[58]40 he that
   is without is not pure; that is, he who does anything apart from the
   bishop, and presbytery, and deacons,^[59]41 such a man is not pure in
   his conscience.

   Be on your guard, [therefore, against such persons, that ye admit not
   of a snare for your own souls. And act so that your life shall be
   without offence to all men, lest ye become as "a snare upon a
   watch-tower, and as a net which is spread out."^[60]42 For" he that
   does not heal himself in his own works, is the brother of him that
   destroys himself."^[61]43 If, therefore, ye also put away conceit,
   arrogance, disdain, and haughtiness, it will be your privilege to be
   inseparably united to God, for "He is nigh unto those that fear
   Him."^[62]44 And says He, "Upon whom will I look, but upon him that is
   humble and quiet, and that trembles at my words? "^[63]45 And do ye
   also reverence your bishop as Christ Himself, according as the blessed
   apostles have enjoined you. He that is within the altar is pure,
   wherefore also he is obedient to the bishop and presbyters: but he that
   is without is one that does anything apart from the bishop, the
   presbyters, and the deacons. Such a person is defiled in his
   conscience, and is worse than an infidel. For what is the bishop but
   one who beyond all others possesses all power and authority, so far as
   it is possible for a man to possess it, who according to his ability
   has been made an imitator of the Christ Of God?^[64]46 And what is the
   presbytery but a sacred assembly, the counsellors and assessors of the
   bishop? And what are the deacons but imitators of the angelic
   powers,^[65]47 fulfilling a pure and blameless ministry unto him, as
   the holy Stephen did to the blessed James, Timothy and Linus to Paul,
   Anencletus and Clement to Peter? He, therefore, that will not yield
   obedience to such, must needs be one utterly without God, an impious
   man who despises Christ, and depreciates His appointments.
   Chapter VIII.-Be on Your Guard Against the Snares of the Devil.

   Not that I know there is anything of this kind among you; but I put you
   on your guard, inasmuch as I love you greatly, and foresee the snares
   of the devil. Wherefore, clothing^[66]48 yourselves with meekness, be
   ye renewed^[67]49 in faith, that is the flesh of the Lord, and in love,
   that is the blood of Jesus Christ. Let no one of you cherish any grudge
   against his neighbour. Give no occasion to the Gentiles, lest by means
   of a few foolish men the whole multitude [of those that believe] in God
   be evil spoken of. For, "Woe to him by whose vanity my name is
   blasphemed among any."^[68]50

   Now I write these things unto you, not that I know there are any such
   persons among you; nay, indeed I hope that God will never permit any
   such report to reach my ears, He "who spared not His Son for the sake
   of His holy Church."^[69]51 But foreseeing the snares of the wicked
   one, I arm you beforehand by my admonitions, as my beloved and faithful
   children in Christ, furnishing you with the means of protection^[70]52
   against the deadly disease of unruly men, by which do ye flee from the
   disease^[71]53 [referred to] by the good-will of Christ our Lord. Do ye
   therefore, clothing^[72]54 yourselves with meekness, become the
   imitators of His sufferings, and of His love, wherewith^[73]55 He loved
   us when He gave Himself a ransom^[74]56 for us, that He might cleanse
   us by His blood from our old ungodliness, and bestow life on us when we
   were almost on the point of perishing through the depravity that was in
   us. Let no one of you, therefore, cherish any grudge against his
   neighbour. For says our Lord, "Forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto
   you."^[75]57 Give no occasion to the Gentiles, lest "by means of a few
   foolish men the word and doctrine [of Christ.] be blasphemed."^[76]58
   For says the prophet, as in the person of God, "Woe to him by whom my
   name is blasphemed among the Gentiles."^[77]59
   Chapter IX.-Reference to the History of Christ.

   Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance
   with^[78]60 Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of
   Mary; who was truly born, and did eat and drink. He was truly
   persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and [truly]
   died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the
   earth. He was also truly raised from the dead, His Father quickening
   Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so raise up us who
   believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the
   true life.

   Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance
   with^[79]61 Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was descended from David,
   and was also of Mary; who was truly begotten of God and of the Virgin,
   but not after the same manner. For indeed God and man are not the same.
   He truly assumed a body; for "the Word was made flesh,"^[80]62 and
   lived upon earth without sin. For says He, "Which of you convicteth me
   of sin? "^[81]63 He did in reality both eat and drink. He was crucified
   and died under Pontius Pilate. He really, and not merely in appearance,
   was crucified, and died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on
   earth, and under the earth. By those in heaven I mean such as are
   possessed of incorporeal natures; by those on earth, the Jews and
   Romans, and such persons as were present at that time when the Lord was
   crucified; and by those under the earth, the multitude that arose along
   with the Lord. For says the Scripture, "Many bodies of the saints that
   slept arose,"^[82]64 their graves being opened. He descended, indeed,
   into Hades alone, but He arose accompanied by a multitude; and rent
   asunder that means^[83]65 of separation which had existed from the
   beginning of the world, and cast down its partition-wall. He also rose
   again in three days, the Father raising Him up; and after spending
   forty days with the apostles, He was received up to the Father, and
   "sat down at His right hand, expecting till His enemies are placed
   under His feet."^[84]66 On the day of the preparation, then, at the
   third hour, He received the sentence from Pilate, the Father permitting
   that to happen; at the sixth hour He was crucified; at the ninth hour
   He gave up the ghost; and before sunset He was buried.^[85]67 During
   the Sabbath He continued under the earth in the tomb in which Joseph of
   Arimathaea had laid Him. At the dawning of the Lord's day He arose from
   the dead, according to what was spoken by Himself, "As Jonah was three
   days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of man
   also be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."^[86]68
   The day of the preparation, then, comprises the passion; the Sabbath
   embraces the burial; the Lord's Day contains the resurrection.
   Chapter X.-The Reality of Christ's Passion.

   But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say,
   that He only seemed to suffer (they themselves only seeming to exist),
   then why am I in bonds? Why do I long to be exposed to^[87]69 the wild
   beasts? Do I therefore die in vain?^[88]70 Am I not then guilty of
   falsehood^[89]71 against [the cross of] the Lord?

   But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, He
   became man in appearance [only], that He did not in reality take unto
   Him a body, that He died in appearance [merely], and did not in very
   deed suffer, then for what reason am I now in bonds, and long to be
   exposed to^[90]72 the wild beasts? In such a case, I die in vain, and
   am guilty of falsehood^[91]73 against the cross of the Lord. Then also
   does the prophet in vain declare, "They shall look on Him whom they
   have pierced, and mourn over themselves as over one beloved."^[92]74
   These men, therefore, are not less unbelievers than were those that
   crucified Him. But as for me, I do not place my hopes in one who died
   for me in appearance, but in reality. For that which is false is quite
   abhorrent to the truth. Mary then did truly conceive a body which had
   God inhabiting it. And God the Word was truly born of the Virgin,
   having clothed Himself with a body of like passions with our own. He
   who forms all men in the womb, was Himself really in the womb, and made
   for Himself a body of the seed of the Virgin, but without any
   intercourse of man. He was carried in the womb, even as we are, for the
   usual period of time; and was really born, as we also are; and was in
   reality nourished with milk, and partook of common meat and drink, even
   as we do. And when He had lived among men for thirty years, He was
   baptized by John, really and not in appearance; and when He had
   preached the Gospel three years, and done signs and wonders, He who was
   Himself the Judge was judged by the Jews, falsely so called, and by
   Pilate the governor; was scourged, was smitten on the cheek, was spit
   upon; He wore a crown of thorns and a purple robe; He was condemned: He
   was crucified in reality, and not in appearance, not in imagination,
   not in deceit. He really died, and was buried, and rose from the dead,
   even as He prayed in a certain place, saying, "But do Thou, O Lord,
   raise me up again, and I shall recompense them."^[93]75 And the Father,
   who always hears Him,^[94]76 answered and said, "Arise, O God, and
   judge the earth; for Thou shall receive all the heathen for Thine
   inheritance."^[95]77 The Father, therefore, who raised Him up, will
   also raise us up through Him, apart from whom no one will attain to
   true life. For says He, "I am the life; he that believeth in me, even
   though he die, shall live: and every one that liveth and believeth in
   me, even though he die, shall live for ever."^[96]78 Do ye therefore
   flee from these ungodly heresies; for they are the inventions of the
   devil, that serpent who was the author of evil, and who by means of the
   woman deceived Adam, the father of our race.
   Chapter XI.-Avoid the Deadly Errors of the Docetae.

   Flee, therefore, those evil offshoots [of Satan], which produce
   death-bearing fruit, whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies. For
   these men are not the planting of the Father. For if they were, they
   would appear as branches of the cross, and their fruit would be
   incorruptible. By it^[97]79 He calls you through His passion, as being
   His members. The head, therefore, cannot be born by itself, without its
   members; God, who is [the Saviour] Himself, having promised their
   union.^[98]80

   Do ye also avoid those wicked offshoots of his,^[99]81 Simon his
   firstborn son, and Menander, and Basilides, and all his wicked mob of
   followers,^[100]82 the worshippers of a man, whom also the prophet
   Jeremiah pronounces accursed.^[101]83 Flee also the impure
   Nicolaitanes, falsely so called,^[102]84 who are lovers of pleasure,
   and given to calumnious speeches. Avoid also the children of the evil
   one, Theodotus and Cleobulus, who produce death-bearing fruit, whereof
   if any one tastes, he instantly dies, and that not a mere temporary
   death, but one that shall endure for ever. These men are not the
   planting of the Father, but are an accursed brood. And says the Lord,
   "Let every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted be rooted
   up."^[103]85 For if they had been branches of the Father, they would
   not have been "enemies of the cross of Christ,"^[104]86 but rather of
   those who "killed the Lord of glory."^[105]87 But now, by denying the
   cross, and being ashamed of the passion, they cover the transgression
   of the Jews, those fighters against God, those murderers of the Lord;
   for it were too little to style them merely murderers of the prophets.
   But Christ invites you to [share in] His immortality, by His passion
   and resurrection, inasmuch as ye are His members.
   Chapter XII.-Continue in Unity and Love.

   I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are
   with me, who have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in
   the spirit. My bonds, which I carry about with me for the sake of Jesus
   Christ (praying that I may attain to God), exhort you. Continue in
   harmony among yourselves, and in prayer with one another; for it
   becomes every one of you, and especially the presbyters, to refresh the
   bishop, to the honour of the Father, of Jesus Christ, and of the
   apostles. I entreat you in love to hear me, that I may not, by having
   written, be a testimony against you. And do ye also pray for me, who
   have need of your love, along with the mercy of God, that I may be
   worthy of the lot for which I am destined, and that I may not be found
   reprobate.

   I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are
   with me, whose rulers have refreshed me in every respect, both in the
   flesh and in the spirit. My bonds, which I carry about with me for the
   sake of Jesus Christ (praying that I may attain to God), exhort you.
   Continue in harmony among yourselves, and in supplication; for it
   becomes every one of you, and especially the presbyters, to refresh the
   bishop, to the honour of the Father, and to the honour of Jesus Christ
   and of the apostles. I entreat you in love to hear me, that I may not,
   by having thus written, be a testimony against you. And do ye also pray
   for me, who have need of your love, along with the mercy of God, that I
   may be thought worthy to attain the lot for which I am now designed,
   and that I may not be found reprobate.
   Chapter XIII.-Conclusion.

   The love of the Smymaeans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember in your
   prayers the Church which is in Syria, from which also I am not worthy
   to receive my appellation, being the last^[106]88 of them. Fare ye well
   in Jesus Christ, while ye continue subject to the bishop, as to the
   command [of God], and in like manner to the presbytery. And do ye,
   every man, love one another with an undivided heart. Let my spirit be
   sanctified^[107]89 by yours, not only now, but also when I shall attain
   to God. For I am as yet exposed to danger. But the Father is faithful
   in Jesus Christ to fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may ye
   be found unblameable.

   The love of the Smyrnaeans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember our
   Church which is in Syria, from which I am not worthy to receive my
   appellation, being the last^[108]90 of those of that place. Fare ye
   well in the Lord Jesus Christ, while ye continue subject to the bishop,
   and in like manner to the presbyters and to the deacons. And do ye,
   every man, love one another with an undivided heart. My spirit salutes
   you,^[109]91 not only now, but also when I shall have attained to God;
   for I am as yet exposed to danger. But the Father of Jesus Christ is
   faithful to fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may we be
   found without spot. May I have joy of you in the Lord.
