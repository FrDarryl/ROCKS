                        The Epistle of Barnabas^[26]1

                                  --------
   Chapter I.-After the Salutation, the Writer Declares that He Would
       Communicate to His Brethren Something of that Which He Had Himself
       Received.

   All hail, ye sons and daughters, in the name of our Lord^[27]2 Jesus
   Christ, who loved us in peace.

   Seeing that the divine fruits^[28]3 of righteousness abound among you,
   I rejoice exceedingly and above measure in your happy and honoured
   spirits, because ye have with such effect received the engrafted^[29]4
   spiritual gift. Wherefore also I inwardly rejoice the more, hoping to
   be saved, because I truly perceive in you the Spirit poured forth from
   the rich Lord^[30]5 of love. Your greatly desired appearance has thus
   filled me with astonishment over you.^[31]6 I am therefore pursuaded of
   this, and fully convinced in my own mind, that since I began to speak
   among you I understand many things, because the Lord hath accompanied
   me in the way of righteousness. I am also on this account bound^[32]7
   by the strictest obligation to love you above my own soul, because
   great are the faith and love dwelling in you, while you hope for the
   life which He has promised.^[33]8 Considering this, therefore, that if
   I should take the trouble to communicate to you some portion of what I
   have myself received, it will prove to me a sufficient reward that I
   minister to such spirits, I have hastened briefly to write unto you, in
   order that, along with your faith, ye might have perfect knowledge. The
   doctrines of the Lord, then, are three:^[34]9 the hope of life, the
   beginning and the completion of it. For the Lord hath made known to us
   by the prophets both the things which are past and present, giving us
   also the first-fruits of the knowledge^[35]10 of things to come, which
   things as we see accomplished, one by one, we ought with the greater
   richness of faith^[36]11 and elevation of spirit to draw near to Him
   with reverence.^[37]12 I then, not as your teacher, but as one of
   yourselves, will set forth a few things by which in present
   circumstances ye may be rendered the more joyful.
   Chapter II.-The Jewish Sacrifices are Now Abolished.

   Since, therefore, the days are evil, and Satan^[38]13 possesses the
   power of this world, we ought to give heed to ourselves, and diligently
   inquire into the ordinances of the Lord. Fear and patience, then, are
   helpers of our faith; and long-suffering and continence are things
   which fight on our side. While these remain pure in what respects the
   Lord, Wisdom, Understanding, Science, and Knowledge rejoice along with
   them.^[39]14 For He hath revealed to us by all the prophets that He
   needs neither sacrifices, nor burnt-offerings, nor oblations, saying
   thus, "What is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me, saith the
   Lord? I am full of burnt-offerings, and desire not the fat of lambs,
   and the blood of bulls and goats, not when ye come to appear before Me:
   for who hath required these things at your hands? Tread no more My
   courts, not though ye bring with you fine flour. Incense is a vain
   abomination unto Me, and your new moons and sabbaths I cannot
   endure."^[40]15 He has therefore abolished these things, that the new
   law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of necessity,
   might have a human oblation.^[41]16 And again He says to them, "Did I
   command your fathers, when they went out from the land of Egypt, to
   offer unto Me burnt-offerings and sacrifices? But this rather I
   commanded them, Let no one of you cherish any evil in his heart against
   his neighbour, and love not an oath of falsehood."^[42]17 We ought
   therefore, being possessed of understanding, to perceive the gracious
   intention of our Father; for He speaks to us, desirous that we,
   not^[43]18 going astray like them, should ask how we may approach Him.
   To us, then, He declares, "A sacrifice [pleasing] to God is a broken
   spirit; a smell of sweet savour to the Lord is a heart that glorifieth
   Him that made it."^[44]19 We ought therefore, brethren, carefully to
   inquire concerning our salvation, lest the wicked one, having made his
   entrance by deceit, should hurl^[45]20 us forth from our [true] life.
   Chapter III.-The Fasts of the Jews are Not True Fasts, Nor Acceptable
       to God.

   He says then to them again concerning these things, "Why do ye fast to
   Me as on this day, saith the Lord, that your voice should be heard with
   a cry? I have not chosen this fast, saith the Lord, that a man should
   humble his soul. Nor, though ye bend your neck like a ring, and put
   upon you sackcloth and ashes, will ye call it an acceptable
   fast."^[46]21 To us He saith, "Behold, this is the fast that I have
   chosen, saith the Lord, not that a man should humble his soul, but that
   he should loose every band of iniquity, untie the fastenings of harsh
   agreements, restore to liberty them that are bruised, tear in pieces
   every unjust engagement, feed the hungry with thy bread, clothe the
   naked when thou seest him, bring the homeless into thy house, not
   despise the humble if thou behold him, and not [turn away] from the
   members of thine own family. Then shall thy dawn break forth, and thy
   healing shall quickly spring up, and righteousness shall go forth
   before thee, and the glory of God shall encompass thee; and then thou
   shalt call, and God shall hear thee; whilst thou art yet speaking, He
   shall say, Behold, I am with thee; if thou take away from thee the
   chain [binding others], and the stretching forth of the hands^[47]22
   [to sweat falsely], and words of murmuring, and give cheerfully thy
   bread to the hungry, and show compassion to the soul that has been
   humbled."^[48]23 To this end, therefore, brethren, He is
   long-suffering, foreseeing how the people whom He has prepared shall
   with guilelessness believe in His Beloved. For He revealed all these
   things to us beforehand, that we should not rush forward as rash
   acceptors of their laws.^[49]24
   Chapter IV.-Antichrist is at Hand: Let Us Therefore Avoid Jewish
       Errors.

   It therefore behoves us, who inquire much concerning events at
   hand,^[50]25 to search diligently into those things which are able to
   save us. Let us then utterly flee from all the works of iniquity, lest
   these should take hold of us; and let us hate the error of the present
   time, that we may set our love on the world to come: let us not give
   loose reins to our soul, that it should have power to run with sinners
   and the wicked, lest we become like them. The final stumbling-block (or
   source of danger) approaches, concerning which it is written, as
   Enoch^[51]26 says, "For for this end the Lord has cut short the times
   and the days, that His Beloved may hasten; and He will come to the
   inheritance." And the prophet also speaks thus: "Ten kingdoms shall
   reign upon the earth, and a little king shall rise up after them, who
   shall subdue under one three of the kings.^[52]27 In like manner Daniel
   says concerning the same, "And I beheld the fourth beast, wicked and
   powerful, and more savage than all the beasts of the earth, and how
   from it sprang up ten horns, and out of them a little budding horn, and
   how it subdued under one three of the great horns."^[53]28 Ye ought
   therefore to understand. And this also I further beg of you, as being
   one of you, and loving you both individually and collectively more than
   my own soul, to take heed now to yourselves, and not to be like some,
   adding largely to your sins, and saying, "The covenant is both theirs
   and ours."^[54]29 But they thus finally lost it, after Moses had
   already received it. For the Scripture saith, "And Moses was fasting in
   the mount forty days and forty nights, and received the covenant from
   the Lord, tables of stone written with the finger of the hand of the
   Lord; "^[55]30 but turning away to idols, they lost it. For the Lord
   speaks thus to Moses: "Moses go down quickly; for the people whom thou
   hast brought out of the land of Egypt have transgressed."^[56]31 And
   Moses understood [the meaning of God], and cast the two tables out of
   his hands; and their covenant was broken, in order that the covenant of
   the beloved Jesus might be sealed upon our heart, in the hope which
   flows from believing in Him.^[57]32 Now, being desirous to write many
   things to you, not as your teacher, but as becometh one who loves you,
   I have taken care not to fail to write to you from what I myself
   possess, with a view to your purification.^[58]33 We take
   earnest^[59]34 heed in these last days; for the whole [past] time of
   your faith will profit you nothing, unless now in this wicked time we
   also withstand coming sources of danger, as becometh the sons of God.
   That the Black One^[60]35 may find no means of entrance, let us flee
   from every vanity, let us utterly hate the works of the way of
   wickedness. Do not, by retiring apart, live a solitary life, as if you
   were already [fully] justified; but coming together in one place, make
   common inquiry concerning what tends to your general welfare. For the
   Scripture saith, "Woe to them who are wise to themselves, and prudent
   in their own sight!"^[61]36 Let us be spiritually-minded: let us be a
   perfect temple to God. As much as in us lies, let us meditate upon the
   fear of God, and let us keep His commandments, that we may rejoice in
   His ordinances. The Lord will judge the world without respect of
   persons. Each will receive as he has done: if he is righteous, his
   righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked, the reward of
   wickedness is before him. Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those
   who are the called [of God], we should fall asleep in our sins, and the
   wicked prince, acquiring power over us, should thrust us away from the
   kingdom of the Lord. And all the more attend to this, my brethren, when
   ye reflect and behold, that after so great signs and wonders were
   wrought in Israel, they were thus [at length] abandoned. Let us beware
   lest we be found [fulfilling that saying], as it is written, "Many are
   called, but few are chosen."^[62]37
   Chapter V.-The New Covenant, Founded on the Sufferings of Christ, Tends
       to Our Salvation, But to the Jews' Destruction.

   For to this end the Lord endured to deliver up His flesh to corruption,
   that we might be sanctified through the remission of sins, which is
   effected by His blood of sprinkling. For it is written concerning Him,
   partly with reference to Israel, and partly to us; and [the Scripture]
   saith thus: "He was wounded for our transgressions, and braised for our
   iniquities: with His stripes we are healed. He was brought as a sheep
   to the slaughter, and as a lamb which is dumb before its
   shearer."^[63]38 Therefore we ought to be deeply grateful to the Lord,
   because He has both made known to us things that are past, and hath
   given us wisdom concerning things present, and hath not left us without
   understanding in regard to things which are to come. Now, the Scripture
   saith, "Not unjustly are nets spread out for birds."^[64]39 This means
   that the man perishes justly, who, having a knowledge of the way of
   righteousness, rushes off into the way of darkness. And further, my
   brethren: if the Lord endured to suffer for our soul, He being Lord of
   all the world, to whom God said at the foundation of the world, "Let us
   make man after our image, and after our likeness,"^[65]40 understand
   how it was that He endured to suffer at the hand of men. The prophets,
   having obtained grace from Him, prophesied concerning Him. And He
   (since it behoved Him to appear in flesh), that He might abolish death,
   and reveal the resurrection from the dead, endured [what and as He
   did], in order that He might fulfill the promise made unto the fathers,
   and by preparing a new people for Himself, might show, while He dwelt
   on earth, that He, when He has raised mankind, will also judge them.
   Moreover, teaching Israel, and doing so great miracles and signs, He
   preached [the truth] to him, and greatly loved him. But when He chose
   His own apostles who where to preach His Gospel, [He did so from among
   those] who were sinners above all sin, that He might show He came "not
   to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."^[66]41 Then He
   manifested Himself to be the Son of God. For if He had not come in the
   flesh, how could men have been saved by beholding Him?^[67]42 Since
   looking upon the sun which is to cease to exist, and is the work of His
   hands, their eyes are not able to bear his rays. The Son of God
   therefore came in the flesh with this view, that He might bring to a
   head the sum of their sins who had persecuted His prophets^[68]43 to
   the death. For this purpose, then, He endured. For God saith, "The
   stroke of his flesh is from them; "^[69]44 and^[70]45 "when I shall
   smite the Shepherd, then the sheep of the flock shall be
   scattered."^[71]46 He himself willed thus to suffer, for it was
   necessary that He should suffer on the tree. For says he who prophesies
   regarding Him, "Spare my soul from the sword,^[72]47 fasten my flesh
   with nails; for the assemblies of the wicked have risen up against
   me."^[73]48 And again he says, "Behold, I have given my back to
   scourges, and my cheeks to strokes, and I have set my countenance as a
   firm rock."^[74]49
   Chapter VI.-The Sufferings of Christ, and the New Covenant, Were
       Announced by the Prophets.

   When, therefore, He has fulfilled the commandment, what saith He? "Who
   is he that will contend with Me? let him oppose Me: or who is he that
   will enter into judgment with Me? let him draw near to the servant of
   the Lord."^[75]50 "Woe unto you, for ye shall all wax old, like a
   garment, and the moth shall eat you up."^[76]51 And again the prophet
   says, "Since^[77]52 as a mighty stone He is laid for crushing, behold I
   cast down for the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, a
   corner-stone, honourable." Next, what says He? "And he who shall
   trust^[78]53 in it shall live for ever." Is our hope, then, upon a
   stone? Far from it. But [the language is used] inasmuch as He laid his
   flesh [as a foundation] with power; for He says, "And He placed me as a
   firm rock."^[79]54 And the prophet says again, "The stone which the
   builders rejected, the same has become the head of the corner."^[80]55
   And again he says, "This is the great and wonderful day which the Lord
   hath made.^[81]56 I write the more simply unto you, that ye may
   understand. I am the off-scouring of your love.^[82]57 What, then,
   again says the prophet? "The assembly of the wicked surrounded me; they
   encompassed me as bees do a honeycomb,"^[83]58 and "upon my garment
   they cast lots."^[84]59 Since, therefore, He was about to be manifested
   and to suffer in the flesh, His suffering was foreshown. For the
   prophet speaks against Israel, "Woe to their soul, because they have
   counselled an evil counsel against themselves,^[85]60 saying, Let us
   bind the just one, because he is displeasing to us."^[86]61 And Moses
   also says to them,^[87]62 "Behold these things, saith the Lord God:
   Enter into the good land which the Lord swore [to give] to Abraham, and
   Isaac, and Jacob, and inherit ye it, a land flowing with milk and
   honey."^[88]63 What, then, says Knowledge?^[89]64 Learn: "Trust," she
   says, "in Him who is to be manifested to you in the flesh-that is,
   Jesus." For man is earth in a suffering state, for the formation of
   Adam was from the face of the earth. What, then, meaneth this: "into
   the good land, a land flowing with milk and honey? "Blessed be our
   Lord, who has placed in us wisdom and understanding of secret things.
   For the prophet says, "Who shall understand the parable of the Lord,
   except him who is wise and prudent, and who loves his Lord? "^[90]65
   Since, therefore, having renewed us by the remission of our sins, He
   hath made us after another pattern, [it is His purpose] that we should
   possess the soul of children, inasmuch as He has created us anew by His
   Spirit.^[91]66 For the Scripture says concerning us, while He speaks to
   the Son, "Let Us make man after Our image, and after Our likeness; and
   let them have dominion over the beasts of the earth, and the fowls of
   heaven, and the fishes of the sea."^[92]67 And the Lord said, on
   beholding the fair creature^[93]68 man, "Increase, and multiply, and
   replenish the earth."^[94]69 These things [were spoken] to the Son.
   Again, I will show thee how, in respect to us,^[95]70 He has
   accomplished a second fashioning in these last days. The Lord says,
   "Behold, I will make^[96]71 the last like the first."^[97]72 In
   reference to this, then, the prophet proclaimed, "Enter ye into the
   land flowing with milk and honey, and have dominion over it."^[98]73
   Behold, therefore, we have been refashioned, as again He says in
   another prophet, "Behold, saith the Lord, I will take away from these,
   that is, from those whom the Spirit of the Lord foresaw, their stony
   hearts, and I will put hearts of flesh within them,"^[99]74 because
   He^[100]75 was to be manifested in flesh, and to sojourn among us. For,
   my brethren, the habitation of our heart is a holy temple to the
   Lord.^[101]76 For again saith the Lord, "And wherewith shall I appear
   before the Lord my God, and be glorified? "^[102]77 He says,^[103]78 "I
   will confess to thee in the Church in the midst^[104]79 of my brethren;
   and I will praise thee in the midst of the assembly of the
   saints."^[105]80 We, then, are they whom He has led into the good land.
   What, then, mean milk and honey? This, that as the infant is kept alive
   first by honey, and then by milk, so also we, being quickened and kept
   alive by the faith of the promise and by the word, shall live ruling
   over the earth. But He said above,^[106]81 "Let them increase, and rule
   over the fishes."^[107]82 Who then is able to govern the beasts, or the
   fishes, or the fowls of heaven? For we ought to perceive that to govern
   implies authority, so that one should command and rule. If, therefore,
   this does not exist at present, yet still He has promised it to us.
   When? When we ourselves also have been made perfect [so as] to become
   heirs of the covenant of the Lord.^[108]83
   Chapter VII.-Fasting, and the Goat Sent Away, Were Types of Christ.

   Understand, then, ye children of gladness, that the good Lord has
   foreshown all things to us, that we might know to whom we ought for
   everything to render thanksgiving and praise. If therefore the Son of
   God, who is Lord [of all things], and who will judge the living and the
   dead, suffered, that His stroke might give us life, let us believe that
   the Son of God could not have suffered except for our sakes. Moreover,
   when fixed to the cross, He had given Him to drink vinegar and gall.
   Hearken how the priests of the people^[109]84 gave previous indications
   of this. His commandment having been written, the Lord enjoined, that
   whosoever did not keep the fast should be put to death, because He also
   Himself was to offer in sacrifice for our sins the vessel of the
   Spirit, in order that the type established in Isaac when he was offered
   upon the altar might be fully accomplished. What, then, says He in the
   prophet? "And let them eat of the goat which is offered, with fasting,
   for all their sins."^[110]85 Attend carefully: "And let all the priests
   alone eat the inwards, unwashed with vinegar." Wherefore? Because to
   me, who am to offer my flesh for the sins of my new people, ye are to
   give gall with vinegar to drink: eat ye alone, while the people fast
   and mourn in sackcloth and ashes. [These things were done] that He
   might show that it was necessary for Him to suffer for them.^[111]86
   How,^[112]87 then, ran the commandment? Give your attention. Take two
   goats of goodly aspect, and similar to each other, and offer them. And
   let the priest take one as a burnt-offering for sins.^[113]88 And what
   should they do with the other? "Accursed," says He, "is the one." Mark
   how the type of Jesus^[114]89 now comes out. "And all of you spit upon
   it, and pierce it, and encircle its head with scarlet wool, and thus
   let it be driven into the wilderness." And when all this has been done,
   he who bears the goat brings it into the desert, and takes the wool off
   from it, and places that upon a shrub which is called Rachia,^[115]90
   of which also we are accustomed to eat the fruits^[116]91 when we find
   them in the field. Of this^[117]92 kind of shrub alone the fruits are
   sweet. Why then, again, is this? Give good heed. [You see] "one upon
   the altar, and the other accursed; "and why [do you behold] the one
   that is accursed crowned? Because they shall see Him then in that day
   having a scarlet robe about his body down to his feet; and they shall
   say, Is not this He whom we once despised, and pierced, and mocked, and
   crucified? Truly this is^[118]93 He who then declared Himself to be the
   Son of God. For how like is He to Him!^[119]94 With a view to this, [He
   required] the goats to be of goodly aspect, and similar, that, when
   they see Him then coming, they may be amazed by the likeness of the
   goat. Behold, then,^[120]95 the type of Jesus who was to suffer. But
   why is it that they place the wool in the midst of thorns? It is a type
   of Jesus set before the view of the Church. [They^[121]96 place the
   wool among thorns], that any one who wishes to bear it away may find it
   necessary to suffer much, because the thorn is formidable, and thus
   obtain it only as the result of suffering. Thus also, says He, "Those
   who wish to behold Me, and lay hold of My kingdom, must through
   tribulation and suffering obtain Me."^[122]97
   Chapter VIII.-The Red Heifer a Type of Christ.

   Now what do you suppose this to be a type of, that a command was given
   to Israel, that men of the greatest wickedness^[123]98 should offer a
   heifer, and slay and burn it, and, that then boys should take the
   ashes, and put these into vessels, and bind round a stick^[124]99
   purple wool along with hyssop, and that thus the boys should sprinkle
   the people, one by one, in order that they might be purified from their
   sins? Consider how He speaks to you with simplicity. The calf^[125]100
   is Jesus: the sinful men offering it are those who led Him to the
   slaughter. But now the men are no longer guilty, are no longer regarded
   as sinners.^[126]101 And the boys that sprinkle are those that have
   proclaimed to us the remission of sins and purification of heart. To
   these He gave authority to preach the Gospel, being twelve in number,
   corresponding to the twelve tribes^[127]102 of Israel. But why are
   there three boys that sprinkle? To correspond^[128]103 to Abraham, and
   Isaac, and Jacob, because these were great with God. And why was the
   wool [placed] upon the wood? Because by wood Jesus holds His kingdom,
   so that [through the cross] those believing on Him shall live for ever.
   But why was hyssop joined with the wool? Because in His kingdom the
   days will be evil and polluted in which we shall be saved, [and]
   because he who suffers in body is cured through the cleansing^[129]104
   efficacy of hyssop. And on this account the things which stand thus are
   clear to us, but obscure to them because they did not hear the voice of
   the Lord.
   Chapter IX.-The Spiritual Meaning of Circumcision.

   He speaks moreover concerning our ears, how He hath circumcised both
   them and our heart. The Lord saith in the prophet, "In the hearing of
   the ear they obeyed me."^[130]105 And again He saith, "By hearing,
   those shall hear who are afar off; they shall know what I have
   done."^[131]106 And, "Be ye circumcised in your hearts, saith the
   Lord."^[132]107 And again He says, "Hear, O Israel, for these things
   saith the Lord thy God."^[133]108 And once more the Spirit of the Lord
   proclaims, "Who is he that wishes to live for ever? By hearing let him
   hear the voice of my servant."^[134]109 And again He saith, "Hear, O
   heaven, and give ear, O earth, for God^[135]110 hath spoken."^[136]111
   These are in proof.^[137]112 And again He saith, "Hear the word of the
   Lord, ye rulers of this people."^[138]113 And again He saith, "Hear, ye
   children, the voice of one crying in the wilderness."^[139]114
   Therefore He hath circumcised our ears, that we might hear His word and
   believe, for the circumcision in which they trusted is
   abolished.^[140]115 For He declared that circumcision was not of the
   flesh, but they transgressed because an evil angel deluded
   them.^[141]116 He saith to them, "These things saith the Lord your
   God"-(here^[142]117 I find a new^[143]118 commandment)-"Sow not among
   thorns, but circumcise yourselves to the Lord."^[144]119 And why speaks
   He thus: "Circumcise the stubbornness of your heart, and harden not
   your neck? "^[145]120 And again: "Behold, saith the Lord, all the
   nations are uncircumcised^[146]121 in the flesh, but this people are
   uncircumcised in heart."^[147]122 But thou wilt say, "Yea, verily the
   people are circumcised for a seal." But so also is every Syrian and
   Arab, and all the priests of idols: are these then also within the bond
   of His covenant?^[148]123 Yea, the Egyptians also practise
   circumcision. Learn then, my children, concerning all things
   richly,^[149]124 that Abraham, the first who enjoined circumcision,
   looking forward in spirit to Jesus, practised that rite, having
   received the mysteries^[150]125 of the three letters. For [the
   Scripture] saith, "And Abraham circumcised ten, and eight, and three
   hundred men of his household."^[151]126 What, then, was the knowledge
   given to him in this? Learn the eighteen first, and then the three
   hundred.^[152]127 The ten and the eight are thus denoted-Ten by I, and
   Eight by H.^[153]128 You have [the initials of the, name of] Jesus. And
   because^[154]129 the cross was to express the grace [of our redemption]
   by the letter T, he says also, "Three Hundred." He signifies,
   therefore, Jesus by two letters, and the cross by one. He knows this,
   who has put within us the engrafted^[155]130 gift of His doctrine. No
   one has been admitted by me to a more excellent piece of
   knowledge^[156]131 than this, but I know that ye are worthy.
   Chapter X.-Spiritual Significance of the Precepts of Moses Respecting
       Different Kinds of Food.

   Now, wherefore did Moses say, "Thou shalt not eat the swine, nor the
   eagle, nor the hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish which is not possessed
   of scales? "^[157]132 He embraced three doctrines in his mind [in doing
   so]. Moreover, the Lord saith to them in Deuteronomy, "And I will
   establish my ordinances among this people."^[158]133 Is there then not
   a command of God they should not eat [these things]? There is, but
   Moses spoke with a spiritual reference.^[159]134 For this reason he
   named the swine, as much as to say, "Thou shalt not join thyself to men
   who resemble swine." For when they live in pleasure, they forget their
   Lord; but when they come to want, they acknowledge the Lord. And [in
   like manner] the swine, when it has eaten, does not recognize its
   master; but when hungry it cries out, and on receiving food is quiet
   again. "Neither shalt thou eat," says he "the eagle, nor the hawk, nor
   the kite, nor the raven." "Thou shalt not join thyself," he means, "to
   such men as know not how to procure food for themselves by labour and
   sweat, but seize on that of others in their iniquity, and although
   wearing an aspect of simplicity, are on the watch to plunder
   others."^[160]135 So these birds, while they sit idle, inquire how they
   may devour the flesh of others, proving themselves pests [to all] by
   their wickedness. "And thou shalt not eat," he says, "the lamprey, or
   the polypus, or the cuttlefish." He means, "Thou shalt not join thyself
   or be like to such men as are ungodly to the end, and are
   condemned^[161]136 to death." In like manner as those fishes, above
   accursed, float in the deep, not swimming [on the surface] like the
   rest, but make their abode in the mud which lies at the bottom.
   Moreover, "Thou shall not," he says, "eat the hare." Wherefore? "Thou
   shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like unto such."^[162]137 Because
   the hare multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception; for as
   many years as it lives so many^[163]138 it has. Moreover, "Thou shall
   not eat the hyena." He means, "Thou shall not be an adulterer, nor a
   corrupter, nor be like to them that are such." Wherefore? Because that
   animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at
   another female. Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel. For he
   means, "Thou shalt not be like to those whom we hear of as committing
   wickedness with the mouth,^[164]139 on account of their uncleanness;
   nor shall thou be joined to those impure women who commit iniquity with
   the mouth. For this animal conceives by the mouth." Moses then
   issued^[165]140 three doctrines concerning meats with a spiritual
   significance; but they received them according to fleshly desire, as if
   he had merely spoken of [literal] meats. David, however, comprehends
   the knowledge of the three doctrines, and speaks in like manner:
   "Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the
   ungodly,"^[166]141 even as the fishes [referred to] go in darkness to
   the depths [of the sea]; "and hath not stood in the way of sinners,"
   even as those who profess to fear the Lord, but go astray like swine;
   "and hath not sat in the seat of scorners,"^[167]142 even as those
   birds that lie in wait for prey. Take a full and firm grasp of this
   spiritual^[168]143 knowledge. But Moses says still further, "Ye shall
   eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant." What does he
   mean? [The ruminant animal denotes him] who, on receiving food,
   recognizes Him that nourishes him, and being satisfied by Him,^[169]144
   is visibly made glad. Well spake [Moses], having respect to the
   commandment. What, then, does he mean? That we ought to join ourselves
   to those that fear the Lord, those who meditate in their heart on the
   commandment which they have received, those who both utter the
   judgments of the Lord and observe them, those who know that meditation
   is a work of gladness, and who ruminate^[170]145 upon the word of the
   Lord. But what means the cloven-footed? That the righteous man also
   walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy state^[171]146 [to
   come]. Behold how well Moses legislated. But how was it possible for
   them to understand or comprehend these things? We then, rightly
   understanding his commandments,^[172]147 explain them as the Lord
   intended. For this purpose He circumcised our ears and our hearts, that
   we might understand these things.
   Chapter XI.-Baptism and the Cross Prefigured in the Old Testament.

   Let us further inquire whether the Lord took any care to foreshadow the
   water [of baptism] and the cross. Concerning the water, indeed, it is
   written, in reference to the Israelites, that they should not receive
   that baptism which leads to the remission of sins, but should
   procure^[173]148 another for themselves. The prophet therefore
   declares, "Be astonished, O heaven, and let the earth tremble^[174]149
   at this, because this people hath committed two great evils: they have
   forsaken Me, a living fountain, and have hewn out for themselves broken
   cisterns.^[175]150 Is my holy hill Zion a desolate rock? For ye shall
   be as the fledglings of a bird, which fly away when the nest is
   removed."^[176]151 And again saith the prophet, "I will go before thee
   and make level the mountains, and will break the brazen gates, and
   bruise in pieces the iron bars; and I will give thee the
   secret,^[177]152 hidden, invisible treasures, that they may know that I
   am the Lord God."^[178]153 And "He shall dwell in a lofty cave of the
   strong rock."^[179]154 Furthermore, what saith He in reference to the
   Son? "His water is sure;^[180]155 ye shall see the King in His glory,
   and your soul shall meditate on the fear of the Lord."^[181]156 And
   again He saith in another prophet, "The man who doeth these things
   shall be like a tree planted by the courses of waters, which shall
   yield its fruit in due season; and his leaf shall not fade, and all
   that he doeth shall prosper. Not so are the ungodly, not so, but even
   as chaff, which the wind sweeps away from the face of the earth.
   Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in judgment, nor sinners in the
   counsel of the just; for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but
   the way of the ungodly shall perish."^[182]157 Mark how He has
   described at once both the water and the cross. For these words imply,
   Blessed are they who, placing their trust in the cross, have gone down
   into the water; for, says He, they shall receive their reward in due
   time: then He declares, I will recompense them. But now He
   saith,^[183]158 "Their leaves shall not fade." This meaneth, that every
   word which proceedeth out of your mouth in faith and love shall tend to
   bring conversion and hope to many. Again, another prophet saith, "And
   the land of Jacob shall be extolled above every land."^[184]159 This
   meaneth the vessel of His Spirit, which He shall glorify. Further, what
   says He? "And there was a river flowing on the right, and from it arose
   beautiful trees; and whosoever shall eat of them shall live for
   ever."^[185]160 This meaneth,^[186]161 that we indeed descend into the
   water full of sins and defilement, but come up, bearing fruit in our
   heart, having the fear [of God] and trust in Jesus in our spirit. "And
   whosoever shall eat of these shall live for ever," This meaneth:
   Whosoever, He declares, shall hear thee speaking, and believe, shall
   live for ever.
   Chapter XII.-The Cross of Christ Frequently Announced in the Old
       Testament.

   In like manner He points to the cross of Christ in another prophet, who
   saith,^[187]162 "And when shall these things be accomplished? And the
   Lord saith, When a tree shall be bent down, and again arise, and when
   blood shall flow out of wood."^[188]163 Here again you have an
   intimation concerning the cross, and Him who should be crucified. Yet
   again He speaks of this^[189]164 in Moses, when Israel was attacked by
   strangers. And that He might remind them, when assailed, that it was on
   account of their sins they were delivered to death, the Spirit speaks
   to the heart of Moses, that he should make a figure of the
   cross,^[190]165 and of Him about to suffer thereon; for unless they put
   their trust in Him, they shall be overcome for ever. Moses therefore
   placed one weapon above another in the midst of the hill,^[191]166 and
   standing upon it, so as to be higher than all the people, he stretched
   forth his hands,^[192]167 and thus again Israel acquired the mastery.
   But when again he let down his hands, they were again destroyed. For
   what reason? That they might know that they could not be saved unless
   they put their trust in Him.^[193]168 And in another prophet He
   declares, "All day long I have stretched forth My hands to an
   unbelieving people, and one that gainsays My righteous way."^[194]169
   And again Moses makes a type of Jesus, [signifying] that it was
   necessary for Him to suffer, [and also] that He would be the author of
   life^[195]170 [to others], whom they believed to have destroyed on the
   cross^[196]171 when Israel was failing. For since transgression was
   committed by Eve through means of the serpent, [the Lord] brought it to
   pass that every [kind of] serpents bit them, and they died,^[197]172
   that He might convince them, that on account of their transgression
   they were given over to the straits of death. Moreover Moses, when he
   commanded, "Ye shall not have any graven or molten [image] for your
   God,"^[198]173 did so that he might reveal a type of Jesus. Moses then
   makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,^[199]174 and by
   proclamation assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come
   together, they besought Moses that he would offer sacrifice^[200]175 in
   their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them,
   saying, "When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent
   placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though
   dead, it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be
   restored."^[201]176 And they did so. Thou hast in this also [an
   indication of] the glory of Jesus; for in Him and to Him are all
   things.^[202]177 What, again, says Moses to Jesus (Joshua) the son of
   Nave, when he gave him^[203]178 this name, as being a prophet, with
   this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would
   reveal all things concerning His Son Jesus to the son^[204]179 of Nave?
   This name then being given him when he sent him to spy out the land, he
   said, "Take a book into thy hands, and write what the Lord declares,
   that the Son of God will in the last days cut off from the roots all
   the house of Amalek."^[205]180 Behold again: Jesus who was manifested,
   both by type and in the flesh,^[206]181 is not the Son of man, but the
   Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to say that Christ was the
   son^[207]182 of David, fearing and understanding the error of the
   wicked, he saith, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand,
   until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."^[208]183 And again, thus
   saith Isaiah, "The Lord said to Christ,^[209]184 my Lord, whose right
   hand I have holden,^[210]185 that the nations should yield obedience
   before Him; and I will break in pieces the strength of kings."^[211]186
   Behold how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.
   Chapter XIII.-Christians, and Not Jews, the Heirs of the Covenant.

   But let us see if this people^[212]187 is the heir, or the former, and
   if the covenant belongs to us or to them. Hear ye now what the
   Scripture saith concerning the people. Isaac prayed for Rebecca his
   wife, because she was barren; and she conceived.^[213]188 Furthermore
   also, Rebecca went forth to inquire of the Lord; and the Lord said to
   her, "Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples in thy belly; and
   the one people shall surpass the other, and the elder shall serve the
   younger."^[214]189 You ought to understand who was Isaac, who Rebecca,
   and concerning what persons He declared that this people should be
   greater than that. And in another prophecy Jacob speaks more clearly to
   his son Joseph, saying, "Behold, the Lord hath not deprived me of thy
   presence; bring thy sons to me, that I may bless them."^[215]190 And he
   brought Manasseh and Ephraim, desiring that Manasseh^[216]191 should be
   blessed, because he was the elder. With this view Joseph led him to the
   right hand of his father Jacob. But Jacob saw in spirit the type of the
   people to arise afterwards. And what says [the Scripture]? And Jacob
   changed the direction of his bands, and laid his fight hand upon the
   head of Ephraim, the second and younger, and blessed him. And Joseph
   said to Jacob, "Transfer thy right hand to the head of
   Manasseh,^[217]192 for he is my first-born son."^[218]193 And Jacob
   said, "I know it, my son, I know it; but the elder shall serve the
   younger: yet he also shall be blessed."^[219]194 Ye see on whom he
   laid^[220]195 [his hands], that this people should be first, and heir
   of the covenant. If then, still further, the same thing was intimated
   through Abraham, we reach the perfection of our knowledge. What, then,
   says He to Abraham? "Because thou hast believed,^[221]196 it is imputed
   to thee for righteousness: behold, I have made thee the father of those
   nations who believe in the Lord while in [a state of]
   uncircumcision."^[222]197
   Chapter XIV.-The Lord Hath Given Us the Testament Which Moses Received
       and Broke.

   Yes [it is even so]; but let us inquire if the Lord has really given
   that testament which He swore to the fathers that He would
   give^[223]198 to the people. He did give it; but they were not worthy
   to receive it, on account of their sins. For the prophet declares, "And
   Moses was fasting forty days and forty nights on Mount Sinai, that he
   might receive the testament of the Lord for the people."^[224]199 And
   he received from the Lord^[225]200 two tables, written in the spirit by
   the finger of the hand of the Lord. And Moses having received them,
   carried them down to give to the people. And the Lord said to Moses,
   "Moses, Moses, go down quickly; for thy people hath sinned, whom thou
   didst bring out of the land of Egypt."^[226]201 And Moses understood
   that they had again^[227]202 made molten images; and he threw the
   tables out of his hands, and the tables of the testament of the Lord
   were broken. Moses then received it, but they proved themselves
   unworthy. Learn now how we have received it. Moses, as a
   servant,^[228]203 received it; but the Lord himself, having suffered in
   our behalf, hath given it to us, that we should be the people of
   inheritance. But He was manifested, in order that they might be
   perfected in their iniquities, and that we, being constituted heirs
   through Him,^[229]204 might receive the testament of the Lord Jesus,
   who was prepared for this end, that by His personal manifestation,
   redeeming our hearts (which were already wasted by death, and given
   over to the iniquity of error) from darkness, He might by His word
   enter into a covenant with us. For it is written how the Father, about
   to redeem^[230]205 us from darkness, commanded Him to prepare^[231]206
   a holy people for Himself. The prophet therefore declares, "I, the Lord
   Thy God, have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thy hand, and
   will strengthen Thee; and I have given Thee for a covenant to the
   people, for a light to the nations, to open the eyes of the blind, and
   to bring forth from fetters them that are bound, and those that sit in
   darkness out of the prison-house."^[232]207 Ye perceive,^[233]208 then,
   whence we have been redeemed. And again, the prophet says, "Behold, I
   have appointed Thee as a light to the nations, that Thou mightest be
   for salvation even to the ends of the earth, saith the Lord God that
   redeemeth thee."^[234]209 And again, the prophet saith, "The Spirit of
   the Lord is upon me; because He hath anointed me to preach the Gospel
   to the humble: He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim
   deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind; to
   announce the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of recompense; to
   comfort all that mourn."^[235]210
   Chapter XV.-The False and the True Sabbath.

   Further,^[236]211 also, it is written concerning the Sabbath in the
   Decalogue which [the Lord] spoke, face to face, to Moses on Mount
   Sinai, "And sanctify ye the Sabbath of the Lord with clean hands and a
   pure heart."^[237]212 And He says in another place, "If my sons keep
   the Sabbath, then will I cause my mercy to rest upon them."^[238]213
   The Sabbath is mentioned at the beginning of the creation [thus]: "And
   God made in six days the works of His hands, and made an end on the
   seventh day, and rested on it, and sanctified it."^[239]214 Attend, my
   children, to the meaning of this expression, "He finished in six days."
   This implieth that the Lord will finish all things in six thousand
   years, for a day is^[240]215 with Him a thousand years. And He Himself
   testifieth,^[241]216 saying, "Behold, to-day^[242]217 will be as a
   thousand years."^[243]218 Therefore, my children, in six days, that is,
   in six thousand years, all things will be finished. "And He rested on
   the seventh day." This meaneth: when His Son, coming [again], shall
   destroy the time of the wicked man,^[244]219 and judge the ungodly, and
   change the-sun, and the moon,^[245]220 and the stars, then shall He
   truly rest on the seventh day. Moreover, He says, "Thou shalt sanctify
   it with pure hands and a pure heart." If, therefore, any one can now
   sanctify the day which God hath sanctified, except he is pure in heart
   in all things,^[246]221 we are deceived.^[247]222 Behold,
   therefore:^[248]223 certainly then one properly resting sanctifies it,
   when we ourselves, having received the promise, wickedness no longer
   existing, and all things having been made new by the Lord, shall be
   able to work righteousness.^[249]224 Then we shall be able to sanctify
   it, having been first sanctified ourselves.^[250]225 Further, He says
   to them, "Your new moons and your Sabbath I cannot endure."^[251]226 Ye
   perceive how He speaks: Your present Sabbaths are not acceptable to Me,
   but that is which I have made, [namely this, ] when, giving rest to all
   things, I shall make a beginning of the eighth day, that is, a
   beginning of another world. Wherefore, also, we keep the eighth day
   with joyfulness, the day also on which Jesus rose again from the
   dead.^[252]227 And^[253]228 when He had manifested Himself, He ascended
   into the heavens.
   Chapter XVI.-The Spiritual Temple of God.

   Moreover, I will also tell you concerning the temple, how the wretched
   [Jews], wandering in error, trusted not in God Himself, but in the
   temple, as being the house of God. For almost after the manner of the
   Gentiles they worshipped Him in the temple.^[254]229 But learn how the
   Lord speaks, when abolishing it: "Who hath meted out heaven with a
   span, and the earth with his palm? Have not I? "^[255]230 "Thus saith
   the Lord, Heaven is My throne, and the earth My footstool: what kind of
   house will ye build to Me, or what is the place of My rest? "^[256]231
   Ye perceive that their hope is vain. Moreover, He again says, "Behold,
   they who have cast down this temple, even they shall build it up
   again."^[257]232 It has so happened.^[258]233 For through their going
   to war, it was destroyed by their enemies; and now: they, as the
   servants of their enemies, shall rebuild it. Again, it was revealed
   that the city and the temple and the people of Israel were to be given
   up. For the Scripture saith, "And it shall come to pass in the last
   days, that the Lord will deliver up the sheep of His pasture, and their
   sheep-fold and tower, to destruction."^[259]234 And it so happened as
   the Lord had spoken. Let us inquire, then, if there still is a temple
   of God. There is-where He himself declared He would make and finish it.
   For it is written, "And it shall come to pass, when the week is
   completed, the temple of God shall be built in glory in the name of the
   Lord."^[260]235 I find, therefore, that a temple does exist. Learn,
   then, how it shall be built in the name of the Lord. Before we believed
   in God, the habitation of our heart was corrupt and weak, as being
   indeed like a temple made with hands. For it was full of idolatry, and
   was a habitation of demons, through our doing such things as were
   opposed to [the will of] God. But it shall be built, observe ye, in the
   name of the Lord, in order that the temple of the Lord may be built in
   glory. How? Learn [as follows]. Having received the forgiveness of
   sins, and placed our trust in the name of the Lord, we have become new
   creatures, formed again from the beginning. Wherefore in our habitation
   God truly dwells in us. How? His word of faith; His calling^[261]236 of
   promise; the wisdom of the statutes; the commands of the doctrine; He
   himself prophesying in us; He himself dwelling in us; opening to us who
   were enslaved by death the doors of the temple, that is, the mouth; and
   by giving us repentance introduced us into the incorruptible
   temple.^[262]237 He then, who wishes to be saved, looks not to
   man,^[263]238 but to Him who dwelleth in him, and speaketh in him,
   amazed at never having either heard him utter such words with his
   mouth, nor himself having ever desired to hear them.^[264]239 This is
   the spiritual temple built for the Lord.
   Chapter XVII.-Conclusionof the First Part of the Epistle.

   As far as was possible, and could be done with perspicuity, I cherish
   the hope that, according to my desire, I have omitted none^[265]240 of
   those things at present [demanding consideration], which bear upon your
   salvation. For if I should write to you about things future,^[266]241
   ye would not understand, because such knowledge is hid in parables.
   These things then are so.
   Chapter XVIII.-Second Part of the Epistle. The Two Ways.

   But let us now pass to another sort of knowledge and doctrine. There
   are two ways of doctrine and authority, the one of light, and the other
   of darkness. But there is a great difference between these two ways.
   For over one are stationed the light-bringing angels of God, but over
   the other the angels^[267]242 of Satan. And He indeed (i.e., God) is
   Lord for ever and ever, but he (i.e., Satan) is prince of the
   time^[268]243 of iniquity.
   Chapter XIX.-The Way of Light.

   The way of light, then, is as follows. If any one desires to travel to
   the appointed place, he must be zealous in his works. The knowledge,
   therefore, which is given to us for the purpose of walking in this way,
   is the following. Thou shalt love Him that created thee:^[269]244 thou
   shalt glorify Him that redeemed thee from death. Thou shalt be simple
   in heart, and rich in spirit. Thou shalt not join thyself to those who
   walk in the way of death. Thou shalt hate doing what is unpleasing to
   God: thou shalt hate all hypocrisy. Thou shalt not forsake the
   commandments of the Lord. Thou shalt not exalt thyself, but shalt be of
   a lowly mind.^[270]245 Thou shalt not take glory to thyself. Thou shalt
   not take evil counsel against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not allow
   over-boldness to enter into thy soul.^[271]246 Thou shalt not commit
   fornication: thou shalt not commit adultery: thou shalt not be a
   corrupter of youth. Thou shalt not let the word of God issue from thy
   lips with any kind of impurity.^[272]247 Thou shalt not accept persons
   when thou reprovest any one for transgression. Thou shalt be meek: thou
   shalt be peaceable. Thou shalt tremble at the words which thou
   hearest.^[273]248 Thou shalt not be mindful of evil against thy
   brother. Thou shalt not be of doubtful mind^[274]249 as to whether a
   thing shall be or not. Thou shalt not take the name^[275]250 of the
   Lord in vain. Thou shalt love thy neighbour more than thine own
   soul.^[276]251 Thou shalt not slay the child by procuring abortion;
   nor, again, shalt thou destroy it after it is born. Thou shalt not
   withdraw thy hand from thy son, or from thy daughter, but from their
   infancy thou shalt teach them the fear of the Lord.^[277]252 Thou shalt
   not covet what is thy neighbour's, nor shalt thou be avaricious. Thou
   shalt not be joined in soul with the haughty, but thou shalt be
   reckoned with the righteous and lowly. Receive thou as good things the
   trials^[278]253 which come upon thee.^[279]254 Thou shalt not be of
   double mind or of double tongue,^[280]255 for a double tongue is a
   snare of death. Thou shalt be subject^[281]256 to the Lord, and to
   [other] masters as the image of God, with modesty and fear. Thou shalt
   not issue orders with bitterness to thy maidservant or thy man-servant,
   who trust in the same [God^[282]257 ], lest thou shouldst not^[283]258
   reverence that God who is above both; for He came to call men not
   according to their outward appearance,^[284]259 but according as the
   Spirit had prepared them.^[285]260 Thou shalt communicate in all things
   with thy neighbour; thou shalt not call^[286]261 things thine own; for
   if ye are partakers in common of things which are
   incorruptible,^[287]262 how much more [should you be] of those things
   which are corruptible!^[288]263 Thou shalt not be hasty with thy
   tongue, for the mouth is a snare of death. As far as possible, thou
   shalt be pure in thy soul. Do not be ready to stretch forth thy hands
   to take, whilst thou contractest them to give. Thou shalt love, as the
   apple of thine eye, every one that speaketh to thee the word of the
   Lord. Thou shalt remember the day of judgment, night and day. Thou
   shalt seek out every day the faces of the saints,^[289]264 either by
   word examining them, and going to exhort them, and meditating how to
   save a soul by the word,^[290]265 or by thy hands thou shalt labour for
   the redemption of thy sins. Thou shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur
   when thou givest. "Give to every one that asketh thee,"^[291]266 and
   thou shalt know who is the good Recompenser of the reward. Thou shalt
   preserve what thou hast received [in charge], neither adding to it nor
   taking from it. To the last thou shalt hate the wicked^[292]267
   [one].^[293]268 Thou shalt judge righteously. Thou shalt not make a
   schism, but thou shalt pacify those that contend by bringing them
   together. Thou shalt confess thy sins. Thou shalt not go to prayer with
   an evil conscience. This is the way of light.^[294]269
   Chapter XX.-The Way of Darkness.

   But the way of darkness^[295]270 is crooked, and full of cursing; for
   it is the way of eternal^[296]271 death with punishment, in which way
   are the things that destroy the soul, viz., idolatry, over-confidence,
   the arrogance of power, hypocrisy, double-heartedness, adultery,
   murder, rapine, haughtiness, transgression,^[297]272 deceit, malice,
   self-sufficiency, poisoning, magic, avarice,^[298]273 want of the fear
   of God. [In this way, too, ] are those who persecute the good, those
   who hate truth, those who love falsehood, those who know not the reward
   of righteousness, those who cleave not to that which is good, those who
   attend not with just judgment to the widow and orphan, those who watch
   not to the fear of God, [but incline] to wickedness, from whom meekness
   and patience are far off; persons who love vanity, follow after a
   reward, pity not the needy, labour not in aid of him who is overcome
   with toil; who are prone to evil-speaking, who know not Him that made
   them, who are murderers of children, destroyers of the workmanship of
   God; who turn away him that is in want, who oppress the afflicted, who
   are advocates of the rich, who are unjust judges of the poor, and who
   are in every respect transgressors.
   Chapter XXI.-Conclusion.

   It is well, therefore,^[299]274 that he who has learned the judgments
   of the Lord, as many as have been written, should walk in them. For he
   who keepeth these shall be glorified in the kingdom of God; but he who
   chooseth other things^[300]275 shall be destroyed with his works. On
   this account there will be a resurrection,^[301]276 on this account a
   retribution. I beseech you who are superiors, if you will receive any
   counsel of my good-will, have among yourselves those to whom you may
   show kindness: do not forsake them. For the day is at hand on which all
   things shall perish with the evil [one]. The Lord is near, and His
   reward. Again, and yet again, I beseech you: be good lawgivers^[302]277
   to one another; continue faithful counsellors of one another; take away
   from among you all hypocrisy. And may God, who ruleth over all the
   world, give to you wisdom, intelligence, understanding, knowledge of
   His judgments,^[303]278 with patience. And be ye^[304]279 taught of
   God, inquiring diligently what the Lord asks from you; and do it that
   ye maybe safe in the day of judgment.^[305]280 And if you have any
   remembrance of what is good, be mindful of me, meditating on these
   things, in order that both my desire and watchfulness may result in
   some good. I beseech you, entreating this as a favour. While yet you
   are in this fair vessel,^[306]281 do not fail in any one of those
   things,^[307]282 but unceasingly seek after them, and fulfil every
   commandment; for these things are worthy.^[308]283 Wherefore I have
   been the more earnest to write to you, as my ability served,^[309]284
   that I might cheer you. Farewell, ye children of love and peace. The
   Lord of glory and of all grace be with your spirit. Amen.^[310]285
