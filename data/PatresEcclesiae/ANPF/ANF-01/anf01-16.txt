                  The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians

                         Shorter and Longer Versions

                                ------------
   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which is at
       Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the
       greatness and fulness of God the Father, and predestinated before
       the beginning^[28]1 of time, that it should be always for an
       enduring and unchangeable glory, being united^[29]2 and elected
       through the true passion by the will of the Father, and Jesus
       Christ, our God: Abundant happiness through Jesus Christ, and His
       undefiled grace.
       Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which is at
       Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the
       greatness and fulness of God the Father, and predestinated before
       the beginning^[30]3 of time, that it should be always for an
       enduring and unchangeable glory, being united^[31]4 and elected
       through the true passion by the will of God the Father, and of our
       Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour : Abundant happiness through Jesus
       Christ, and His undefiled joy.^[32]5
       Chapter I.-Praise of the Ephesians.

   I have become acquainted with your name, much-beloved in God, which ye
   have acquired by the habit of righteousness, according to the faith and
   love in Jesus Christ our Saviour. Being the followers^[33]6 of God, and
   stirring up^[34]7 yourselves by the blood of God, ye have perfectly
   accomplished the work which was beseeming to you. For, on hearing that
   I came bound from Syria for the common name and hope, trusting through
   your prayers to be permitted to fight with beasts at Rome, that so by
   martyrdom I may indeed become the disciple of Him "who gave Himself for
   us, an offering and sacrifice to God,"^[35]8 [ye hastened to see
   me^[36]9 ]. I received, therefore,^[37]10 your whole multitude in the
   name of God, through Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love,^[38]11 and
   your bishop in the flesh, whom I pray you by Jesus Christ to love, and
   that you would all seek to be like him. And blessed be He who has
   granted unto you, being worthy, to obtain such an excellent bishop.

   I have become acquainted with your greatly-desired name in God, which
   ye have acquired by the habit of righteousness, according to the faith
   and love in Christ Jesus our Saviour. Being the followers^[39]12 of the
   love of God towards man, and stirring up^[40]13 yourselves by the blood
   of Christ, you have perfectly accomplished the work which was beseeming
   to you. For, on hearing that I came bound from Syria for the sake of
   Christ, our common hope, trusting through your prayers to be permitted
   to fight with beasts at Rome, that so by martyrdom I may indeed become
   the disciple of Him "who gave Himself for us, an offering and a
   sacrifice to God,"^[41]14 [ye hastened to see me^[42]15 ]. I have
   therefore received your whole multitude in the name of God, through
   Onesimus, a man of inexpressible love,^[43]16 and who is your bishop,
   whom I pray you by Jesus Christ to love, and that you would all seek to
   be like him. Blessed be God, who has granted unto you, who are
   yourselves so excellent, to obtain such an excellent bishop.
   Chapter II.-Congratulations and Entreaties.

   As to my fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in regard to God and
   blessed in all things,^[44]17 I beg that he may continue longer, both
   for your honour and that of your bishop. And Crocus also, worthy both
   of God and you, whom I have received as the manifestation^[45]18 of
   your love, hath in all things refreshed^[46]19 me, as the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ shall also refresh^[47]20 him; together with
   Onesimus, and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom, I
   have, as to love, beheld all of you. May I always have joy of you, if
   indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you should in
   every way glorify Jesus Christ, who hath glorified you, that by a
   unanimous obedience "ye may be perfectly joined together in the same
   mind, and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing
   concerning the same thing,"^[48]21 and that, being subject to the
   bishop and the presbytery, ye may in all respects be sanctified.

   As to our fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in regard to God and
   blessed in all things, I pray that he may continue blameless for the
   honour of the Church, and of your most blessed bishop. Crocus also,
   worthy both of God and you, whom we have received as the
   manifestation^[49]22 of your love to us, hath in all things
   refreshed^[50]23 me, and "hath not been ashamed of my chain,"^[51]24 as
   the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ will also refresh^[52]25 him;
   together with Onesimus, and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means
   of whom I have, as to love, beheld all of you. May I always have joy of
   you, if indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you
   should in every way glorify Jesus Christ, who hath glorified you, that
   by a unanimous obedience "ye may be perfectly joined together in the
   same mind and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing
   concerning the same thing,"^[53]26 and that, being subject to the
   bishop and the presbytery, ye may in all respects be sanctified.
   Chapter III.-Exhortations to Unity.

   I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For
   though I am bound for the name [of Christ], I am not yet perfect in
   Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as
   fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me to have been
   stirred up by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering.
   But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I
   have therefore taken^[54]27 upon me first to exhort you that ye would
   all run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus
   Christ, our inseparable life, is the [manifested] will of the Father;
   as also bishops, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds [of the
   earth], are so by the will of Jesus Christ.

   I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For
   though I am bound for His name, I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ.
   For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as my
   fellow-servants. For it was needful for me to have been admonished by
   you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch
   as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore
   taken^[55]28 upon me first to exhort you that ye would run together in
   accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ does all things
   according to the will of the Father, as He Himself declares in a
   certain place, "I do always those things that please Him."^[56]29
   Wherefore it behoves us also to live according to the will of God in
   Christ, and to imitate Him as Paul did. For, says he, "Be ye followers
   of me, even as I also am of Christ."^[57]30
   Chapter IV.-The Same Continued.

   Wherefore it is fitting that ye should run together in accordance with
   the will of your bishop, which thing also ye do. For your justly
   renowned presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop
   as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your concord and
   harmonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. And do ye, man by man, become a
   choir, that being harmonious in love, and taking up the song of God in
   unison, ye may with one voice sing to the Father through Jesus Christ,
   so that He may both hear you, and perceive by your works that ye are
   indeed the members of His Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you
   should live in an unblameable unity, that thus ye may always enjoy
   communion with God.

   Wherefore it is fitting that ye also should run together in accordance
   with the will of the bishop who by God's appointment^[58]31 rules over
   you. Which thing ye indeed of yourselves do, being instructed by the
   Spirit. For your justly-renowned presbytery, being worthy of God, is
   fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Thus,
   being joined together in concord and harmonious love, of which Jesus
   Christ is the Captain and Guardian, do ye, man by man, become but one
   choir; so that, agreeing together in concord, and obtaining^[59]32 a
   perfect unity with God, ye may indeed be one in harmonious feeling with
   God the Father, and His beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord. For, says
   He, "Grant unto them, Holy Father, that as I and Thou are one, they
   also may be one in us."^[60]33 It is therefore profitable that you,
   being joined together with God in an unblameable unity, should be the
   followers of the example of Christ, of whom also ye are members.
   Chapter V.-The Praise of Unity.

   For if I in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with
   your bishop-I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature-how
   much more do I reckon you happy who are so joined to him as the Church
   is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to the Father, that so all
   things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be
   not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the
   prayer of one or two possesses^[61]34 such power, how much more that of
   the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore, that does not assemble
   with the Church, has even^[62]35 by this manifested his pride, and
   condemned himself. For it is written, "God resisteth the proud."^[63]36
   Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves in opposition to the
   bishop, in order that we may be subject to God.

   For if I, in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship
   with your bishop-I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual
   nature-how much more do I reckon you happy, who so depend^[64]37 on him
   as the Church does on the Lord Jesus, and the Lord does on God and His
   Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive
   himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the
   bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses^[65]38 such
   power that Christ stands in the midst of them, how much more will the
   prayer of the bishop and of the whole Church, ascending up in harmony
   to God, prevail for the granting of all their petitions in Christ! He,
   therefore, that separates himself from such, and does not meet in the
   society where sacrifices^[66]39 are offered, and with "the Church of
   the first-born whose names are written in heaven," is a wolf in sheep's
   clothing,^[67]40 while he presents a mild outward appearance. Do ye,
   beloved, be careful to be subject to the bishop, and the presbyters and
   the deacons. For he that is subject to these is obedient to Christ, who
   has appointed them; but he that is disobedient to these is disobedient
   to Christ Jesus. And "he that obeyeth not^[68]41 the Son shall not see
   life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." For he that yields not
   obedience to his superiors is self-confident, quarrelsome, and proud.
   But" God," says [the Scripture] "resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
   to the humble ; "^[69]42 and, "The proud have greatly transgressed."
   The Lord also says to the priests, "He that heareth you, heareth Me;
   and he that heareth Me, heareth the Father that sent Me. He that
   despiseth you, despiseth Me; and he that despiseth Me, despiseth Him
   that sent Me."
   Chapter VI.-Have Respect to the Bishop as to Christ Himself.

   Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence,^[70]43 the more
   ought he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom the
   Master of the house sends to be over His household,^[71]44 as we would
   do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look
   upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself. And indeed
   Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all
   live according to the truth, and that no sect^[72]45 has any
   dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to any one rather
   than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.

   The more, therefore, you see the bishop silent, the more do you
   reverence him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the
   house sends to be over His household,^[73]46 as we would do Him that
   sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the
   bishop even as we would look upon the Lord Himself, standing, as he
   does, before the Lord. For "it behoves the man who looks carefully
   about him, and is active in his business, to stand before kings, and
   not to stand before slothful men."^[74]47 And indeed Onesimus himself
   greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to
   the truth, and that no sect `has any dwelling-place among you. Nor
   indeed do ye hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ, the true
   Shepherd and Teacher. And ye are, as Paul wrote to you, "one body and
   one spirit, because ye have also been called in one hope of the
   faith.^[75]48 Since also "there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
   one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in
   all."^[76]49 Such, then, are ye, having been taught by such
   instructors, Paul the Christ-bearer, and Timothy the most faithful.
   Chapter VII.-Beware of False Teachers.

   For some are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ]
   in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of God, whom
   ye must flee as ye would wild beasts. For they are ravening dogs, who
   bite secretly, against whom ye must be on your guard, inasmuch as they
   are men who can scarcely be cured. There is one Physician who is
   possessed both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God
   existing in flesh; true life in death; both of Mary and of God; first
   possible and then impossible,-^[77]50 even Jesus Christ our Lord.

   But some most worthless persons are in the habit of carrying about the
   name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practise things
   unworthy of God, and hold opinions contrary to the doctrine of Christ,
   to their own destruction, and that of those who give credit to them,
   whom you must avoid as ye would wild beasts. For "the righteous man who
   avoids them is saved for ever; but the destruction of the ungodly is
   sudden, and a subject of rejoicing."^[78]51 For "they are dumb dogs,
   that cannot bark,"^[79]52 raving mad, and biting secretly, against whom
   ye must be on your guard, since they labour under an incurable disease.
   But our Physician is the only true God, the unbegotten and
   unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and Begetter of the
   only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our God, Jesus
   the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began,^[80]53
   but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For "the Word
   was made flesh."^[81]54 Being incorporeal, He was in the body; being
   impassible, He was in a passible body; being immortal, He was in a
   mortal body; being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might
   free our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might
   restore them to health, when they were diseased with ungodliness and
   wicked lusts.
   Chapter VIII.-Renewed Praise of the Ephesians.

   Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived,
   inasmuch as ye are wholly devoted to God. For since there is no strife
   raging among you which might distress you, ye are certainly living in
   accordance with God's will. I am far inferior to you, and require to be
   sanctified by your Church of Ephesus, so renowned throughout the world.
   They that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor
   they that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith
   cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith. But
   even those things which ye do according to the flesh are spiritual; for
   ye do all things in Jesus Christ.

   Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived; for ye
   are wholly devoted to God. For when there is no evil desire within you,
   which might defile and torment you, then do ye live in accordance with
   the will of God, and are [the servants] of Christ. Cast ye out that
   which defiles^[82]55 you, who are of the^[83]56 most holy Church of the
   Ephesians, which is so famous and celebrated throughout the world. They
   that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they
   that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do
   the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith. But ye, being
   full of the Holy Spirit, do nothing according to the flesh, but all
   things according to the Spirit. Ye are complete in Christ Jesus, "who
   is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe."^[84]57
   Chapter IX.-Ye Have Given No Heed to False Teachers.

   Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed on from this to you,
   having false doctrine, whom ye did not suffer to sow among you, but
   stopped your ears, that ye might not receive those things which were
   sown by them, as being stones^[85]58 of the temple of the Father,
   prepared for the building of God the Father, and drawn up on high by
   the instrument of Jesus Christ, which is the cross,^[86]59 making use
   of the Holy Spirit as a rope, while your faith was the means by which
   you ascended, and your love the way which led up to God. Ye, therefore,
   as well as all your fellow-travellers, are God-bearers, temple-bearers,
   Christ-bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all respects with the
   commandments of Jesus Christ, in whom also I exult that I have been
   thought worthy, by means of this Epistle, to converse and rejoice with
   you, because with respect to your Christian life^[87]60 ye love nothing
   but God only.

   Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed in among you,
   holding the wicked doctrine of the strange and evil spirit; to whom ye
   did not allow entrance to sow their tares, but stopped your ears that
   ye might not receive that error which was proclaimed by them, as being
   persuaded that that spirit which deceives the people does not speak the
   things of Christ, but his own, for he is a lying spirit. But the Holy
   Spirit does not speak His own things, but those of Christ, and that not
   from himself, but from the Lord; even as the Lord also announced to us
   the things that He received from the Father. For, says He, "the word
   which ye hear is not Mine, but the Father's, who sent Me."^[88]61 And
   says He of the Holy Spirit, "He shall not speak of Himself, but
   whatsoever things He shall hear from Me."^[89]62 And He says of Himself
   to the Father, "I have," says He, "glorified Thee upon the earth ; I
   have finished the work which, Thou gavest Me; I have manifested Thy
   name to men."^[90]63 And of the Holy Ghost, "He shall glorify Me, for
   He receives of Mine."^[91]64 But the spirit of deceit preaches himself,
   and speaks his own things, for he seeks to please himself. He glorifies
   himself, for he is full of arrogance. He is lying, fraudulent,
   soothing, flattering, treacherous, rhapsodical, trifling, inharmonious,
   verbose, sordid, and timorous. From his power Jesus Christ will deliver
   you, who has founded you upon the rock, as being chosen stones, well
   fitted for the divine edifice of the Father, and who are raised up on
   high by Christ, who was crucified for you, making use of the Holy
   Spirit as a rope, and being borne up by faith, while exalted by love
   from earth to heaven, walking in company with those that are undefiled.
   For, says [the Scripture], "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who
   walk in the law of the Lord."^[92]65 Now the way is unerring, namely,
   Jesus Christ. For, says He, "I am the way and the life."^[93]66 And
   this way leads to the Father. For "no man," says He, "cometh to the
   Father but by Me."^[94]67 Blessed, then, are ye who are God-bearers,
   spirit-bearers, temple-bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all
   respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, being "a royal
   priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,"^[95]68 on whose account
   I rejoice exceedingly, and have had the privilege, by this Epistle, of
   conversing with "the saints which are at Ephesus, the faithful in
   Christ Jesus."^[96]69 I rejoice, therefore, over you, that ye do not
   give heed to vanity, and love nothing according to the flesh, but
   according to God.
   Chapter X.-Exhortations to Prayer, Humility, Etc.

   And pray ye without ceasing in behalf of other men. For there is in
   them hope of repentance that they may attain to God. See,^[97]70 then,
   that they be instructed by your works, if in no other way. Be ye meek
   in response to their wrath, humble in opposition to their boasting: to
   their blasphemies return^[98]71 your prayers; in contrast to their
   error, be ye stedfast^[99]72 in the faith; and for their cruelty,
   manifest your gentleness. While we take care not to imitate their
   conduct, let us be found their brethren in all true kindness; and let
   us seek to be followers of the Lord (who ever more unjustly treated,
   more destitute, more condemned? ), that so no plant of the devil may be
   found in you, but ye may remain in all holiness and sobriety in Jesus
   Christ, both with respect to the flesh and spirit.

   And pray ye without ceasing in behalf of other men; for there is hope
   of the repentance, that they may attain to God. For "cannot he that
   falls arise again, and he that goes astray return? "^[100]73 Permit
   them, then, to be instructed by you. Be ye therefore the ministers of
   God, and the mouth of Christ. For thus saith the Lord, "If ye take
   forth the precious from the vile, ye shall be as my mouth."^[101]74 Be
   ye humble in response to their wrath; oppose to their blasphemies your
   earnest prayers; while they go astray, stand ye stedfast in the faith.
   Conquer ye their harsh temper by gentleness, their passion by meekness.
   For "blessed are the meek ; "^[102]75 and Moses was meek above all
   men;^[103]76 and David was exceeding meek.^[104]77 Wherefore Paul
   exhorts as follows: "The servant of the Lord must not strive, but be
   gentle towards all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing
   those that oppose themselves."^[105]78 Do not seek to avenge yourselves
   on those that injure you, for says [the Scripture], If I have returned
   evil to those who returned evil to me."^[106]79 Let us make them
   brethren by our kindness. For say ye to those that hate you, Ye are our
   brethren, that the name of the Lord may be glorified. And let us
   imitate the Lord, "who, when He was reviled, reviled not again ;
   "^[107]80 when He was crucified, He answered not; "when He suffered, He
   threatened not ; "^[108]81 but prayed for His enemies, "Father, forgive
   them; they know not what they do."^[109]82 If any one, the more he is
   injured, displays the more patience, blessed is he. If any one is
   defrauded, if any one is despised, for the name of the Lord, he truly
   is the servant of Christ. Take heed that no plant of the devil be found
   among you, for such a plant is bitter and salt. "Watch ye, and be ye
   sober,"^[110]83 in Christ Jesus.
   Chapter XI.-An Exhortation to Fear God, Etc.

   The last times are come upon us. Let us therefore be of a reverent
   spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, that it tend not to our
   condemnation. For let us either stand in awe of the wrath to come, or
   show regard for the grace which is at present displayed-one of two
   things. Only [in one way or another] let us be found in Christ Jesus
   unto the true life. Apart from Him, let nothing attract^[111]84 you,
   for whom I bear about these bonds, these spiritual jewels, by which may
   I arise through your prayers, of which I entreat I may always be a
   partaker, that I may be found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus,
   who have always been of the same mind with the apostles through the
   power of Jesus Christ.

   The last times are come upon us. Let us therefore be of a reverent
   spirit, and fear the long-suffering of God, lest we despise the riches
   of His goodness and forbearance.^[112]85 For let us either fear the
   wrath to come, or let us love the present joy in the life that now is;
   and let our present and true joy be only this, to be found in Christ
   Jesus, that we may truly live. Do not at any time desire so much as
   even to breathe apart from Him. For He is my hope; He is my boast; He
   is my never-failing riches, on whose account I bear about with me these
   bonds from Syria to Rome, these spiritual jewels, in which may I be
   perfected through your prayers, and become a partaker of the sufferings
   of Christ, and have fellowship with Him in His death, His resurrection
   from the dead, and His everlasting life.^[113]86 May I attain to this,
   so that I may be found in the lot of the Christians of Ephesus, who
   have always had intercourse with the apostles by the power of Jesus
   Christ, with Paul, and John, and Timothy the most faithful.
   Chapter XII.-Praise of the Ephesians.

   I know both who I am, and to whom I write. I am a condemned man, ye
   have been the objects of mercy; I am subject to danger, ye are
   established in safety. Ye are the persons through^[114]87 whom those
   pass that are cut off for the sake of God. Ye are initiated into the
   mysteries of the Gospel with Paul, the holy, the martyred, the
   deservedly most happy, at whose feet^[115]88 may I be found, when I
   shall attain to God; who in all his Epistles makes mention of you in
   Christ Jesus.

   I know both who I am, and to whom I write. I am the very insignificant
   Ignatius, who have my lot with^[116]89 those who are exposed to danger
   and condemnation. But ye have been the objects of mercy, and are
   established in Christ. I am one delivered over [to death], but the
   least of all those that have been cut off for the sake of Christ, "from
   the blood of righteous Abel"^[117]90 to the blood of Ignatius. Ye are
   initiated into the mysteries of the Gospel with Paul, the holy, the
   martyred, inasmuch as he was "a chosen vessel; "^[118]91 at whose feet
   may I be found, and at the feet of the rest of the saints, when I shall
   attain to Jesus Christ, who is always mindful of you in His prayers.
   Chapter XIII.-Exhortation to Meet Together Frequently for the Worship
       of God.

   Take heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God, and show
   forth His praise. For when ye assemble frequently in the same place,
   the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which he
   aims^[119]92 is prevented by the unity of your faith. Nothing is more
   precious than peace, by which all war, both in heaven and
   earth,^[120]93 is brought to an end.

   Take heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God, and show
   forth His praise. For when ye come frequently together in the same
   place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and his "fiery darts"^[121]94
   urging to sin fall back ineffectual. For your concord and harmonious
   faith prove his destruction, and the torment of his assistants. Nothing
   is better than that peace which is according to Christ, by which all
   war, both of aërial and terrestrial spirits, is brought to an end. "For
   we wrestle not against blood and flesh, but against principalities and
   powers, and against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
   spiritual wickedness in heavenly places."^[122]95
   Chapter XIV.-Exhortations to Faith and Love.

   None of these things is hid from you, if ye perfectly possess that
   faith and love towards Christ Jesus^[123]96 which are the beginning and
   the end of life. For the beginning is faith, and the end is
   love.^[124]97 Now these two, being inseparably connected
   together,^[125]98 are of God, while all other things which are
   requisite for a holy life follow after them. No man [truly] making a
   profession of faith sinneth;^[126]99 nor does he that possesses love
   hate any one. The tree is made manifest by its fruit;^[127]100 so those
   that profess themselves to be Christians shall be recognised by their
   conduct. For there is not now a demand for mere profession,^[128]101
   but that a man be found continuing in the power of faith to the end.

   Wherefore none of the devices of the devil shall be hidden from you,
   if, like Paul, ye perfectly possess that faith and love towards
   Christ^[129]102 which are the beginning and the end of life. The
   beginning of life is faith, and the end is love. And these two being
   inseparably connected together, do perfect the man of God; while all
   other things which are requisite to a holy life follow after them. No
   man making a profession of faith ought to sin, nor one possessed of
   love to hate his brother. For He that said, "Thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God,"^[130]103 said also, "and thy neighbour as thyself."^[131]104
   Those that profess themselves to be Christ's are known not only by what
   they say, but by what they practise. "For the tree is known by its
   fruit."^[132]105
   Chapter XV.-Exhortation to Confess Christ by Silence as Well as Speech.

   It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk
   and not to be one. It is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts.
   There is then one Teacher, who spake and it was done; while even those
   things which He did in silence are worthy of the Father. He who
   possesses the word of Jesus, is truly able to hear even His very
   silence, that he may be perfect, and may both act as he speaks, and be
   recognised by his silence. There is nothing which is hid from God, but
   our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as
   those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples,^[133]106
   and He may be in us as our God, which indeed He is, and will manifest
   Himself before our faces. Wherefore we justly love Him.

   It is better for a man to be silent and be [a Christian], than to talk
   and not to be one. "The kingdom of God is not in word, but in
   power."^[134]107 Men "believe with the heart, and confess with the
   mouth," the one "unto righteousness," the other "unto
   salvation."^[135]108 It is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts.
   For he who shall both "do and teach, the same shall be great in the
   kingdom."^[136]109 Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, the Son of the
   living God, first did and then taught, as Luke testifies, "whose praise
   is in the Gospel through all the Churches."^[137]110 There is nothing
   which is hid from the Lord, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let
   us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that
   we may be His temples,^[138]111 and He may be in us as God. Let Christ
   speak in us, even as He did in Paul. Let the Holy Spirit teach us to
   speak the things of Christ in like manner as He did.
   Chapter XVI.-The Fate of False Teachers.

   Do not err, my brethren.^[139]112 Those that corrupt families shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God.^[140]113 If, then, those who do this as
   respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the
   case with any one who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God, for
   which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such an one becoming defiled [in this
   way], shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall every one that
   hearkens unto him.

   Do not err, my brethren.^[141]114 Those that corrupt families shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God.^[142]115 And if those that corrupt mere
   human families are condemned to death, how much more shall those suffer
   everlasting punishment who endeavour to corrupt the Church of Christ,
   for which the Lord Jesus, the only-begotten Son of God, endured the
   cross, and submitted to death! Whosoever, "being waxen fat,"^[143]116
   and "become gross," sets at nought His doctrine, shall go into hell. In
   like manner, every one that has received from God the power of
   distinguishing, and yet follows an unskilful shepherd, and receives a
   false opinion for the truth, shall be punished. "What communion hath
   light with darkness? or Christ with Belial? Or what portion hath he
   that believeth with an infidel? or the temple of God with idols?
   "^[144]117 And in like manner say I, what communion hath truth with
   falsehood? or righteousness with unrighteousness? or true doctrine with
   that which is false?
   Chapter XVII.-Beware of False Doctrines.

   For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured upon His
   head,^[145]118 that He might breathe immortality into His Church. Be
   not ye anointed with the bad odour of the doctrine of the prince of
   this world; let him not lead you away captive from the life which is
   set before you. And why are we not all prudent, since we have received
   the knowledge of God, which is Jesus Christ? Why do we foolishly
   perish, not recognising the gift which the Lord has of a truth sent to
   us?

   For this end did the Lord suffer the ointment to be poured upon His
   head,^[146]119 that His Church might breathe forth immortality. For
   saith [the Scripture], "Thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore
   have the virgins loved Thee; they have drawn Thee; at the odour of
   Thine ointments we will run after Thee."^[147]120 Let no one be
   anointed with the bad odour of the doctrine of [the prince of] this
   world; let not the holy Church of God be led captive by his subtlety,
   as was the first woman.^[148]121 Why do we not, as gifted with reason,
   act wisely? When we had received from Christ, and had grafted in us the
   faculty of judging concerning God, why do we fall headlong into
   ignorance? and why, through a careless neglect of acknowledging the
   gift which we have received, do we foolishly perish?
   Chapter XVIII.-The Glory of the Cross.

   Let my spirit be counted as nothing^[149]122 for the sake of the cross,
   which is a stumbling-block^[150]123 to those that do not believe, but
   to us salvation and life eternal. "Where is the wise man? where the
   disputer? "^[151]124 Where is the boasting of those who are styled
   prudent? For our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the
   appointment^[152]125 of God, conceived in the womb by Mary, of the seed
   of David, but by the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by His
   passion He might purify the water.

   The cross of Christ is indeed a stumbling-block to those that do not
   believe, but to the believing it is salvation and life eternal. "Where
   is the wise man? where the disputer? "^[153]126 Where is the boasting
   of those who are called mighty? For the Son of God, who was begotten
   before time began^[154]127 , and established all things according to
   the will of the Father, He was conceived in the womb of Mary, according
   to the appointment of God, of the seed of David, and by the Holy Ghost.
   For says [the Scripture], "Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and
   shall bring forth a son, and He shall be called Immanuel."^[155]128 He
   was born and was baptized by John, that He might ratify the institution
   committed to that prophet.
   Chapter XIX.-Three Celebrated Mysteries.

   Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as
   was also her offspring, and the death of the Lord; three mysteries of
   renown,^[156]129 which were wrought in silence by^[157]130 God. How,
   then, was He manifested to the world?^[158]131 A star shone forth in
   heaven above all the other stars, the light of which was inexpressible,
   while its novelty struck men with astonishment. And all the rest of the
   stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star, and its
   light was exceedingly great above them all. And there was agitation
   felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to everything else
   [in the heavens]. Hence every kind of magic was destroyed, and every
   bond of wickedness disappeared; ignorance was removed, and the old
   kingdom abolished, God Himself being manifested in human form for the
   renewal of eternal life. And now that took a beginning which had been
   prepared by God. Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult,
   because He meditated the abolition of death.

   Now the virginity of Mary was hidden from the prince of this world, as
   was also her offspring, and the death of the Lord; three mysteries of
   renown,^[159]132 which were wrought in silence, but have been revealed
   to us. A star shone forth in heaven above all that were before it, and
   its light was inexpressible, while its novelty struck men with
   astonishment. And all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon,
   formed a chorus to this star. It far exceeded them all in brightness,
   and agitation was felt as to whence this new spectacle [proceeded].
   Hence worldly wisdom became folly; conjuration was seen to be mere
   trifling; and magic became utterly ridiculous. Every law^[160]133 of
   wickedness vanished away; the darkness of ignorance was dispersed; and
   tyrannical authority was destroyed, God being manifested as a man, and
   man displaying power as God. But neither was the former a mere
   imagination,^[161]134 nor did the second imply a bare
   humanity;^[162]135 but the one was absolutely true,^[163]136 and the
   other an economical arrangement.^[164]137 Now that received a beginning
   which was perfected by God.^[165]138 Henceforth all things were in a
   state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition of death.

   Chapter XX.-Promise of Another Letter.

   Chapter XX.-Exhortations to Stedfastness and Unity.

   If Jesus Christ shall graciously permit me through your prayers, and if
   it be His will, I shall, in a second little work which I will write to
   you, make further manifest to you [the nature of] the dispensation of
   which I have begun [to treat], with respect to the new man, Jesus
   Christ, in His faith and in His love, in His suffering and in His
   resurrection. Especially [will I do this^[166]139 ] if the Lord make
   known to me that ye come together man by man in common through grace,
   individually,^[167]140 in one faith, and in Jesus Christ, who was of
   the seed of David according to the flesh, being both the Son of man and
   the Son of God, so that ye obey the bishop and the presbytery with an
   undivided mind, breaking one and the same bread, which is the medicine
   of immortality, and the antidote to prevent us from dying, but [which
   causes] that we should live for ever in Jesus Christ.

   Stand fast, brethren, in the faith of Jesus Christ, and in His love, in
   His passion, and in His resurrection. Do ye all come together in
   common, and individually,^[168]141 through grace, in one faith of God
   the Father, and of Jesus Christ His only-begotten Son, and "the
   first-born of every creature,"^[169]142 but of the seed of David
   according to the flesh, being under the guidance of the Comforter, in
   obedience to the bishop and the presbytery with an undivided mind,
   breaking one and the same bread, which is the medicine of immortality,
   and the antidote which prevents us from dying, but a cleansing remedy
   driving away evil, [which causes] that we should live in God through
   Jesus Christ.
   Chapter XXI.-Conclusion.

   My soul be for yours and theirs^[170]143 whom, for the honour of God,
   ye have sent to Smyrna; whence also I write to you, giving thanks unto
   the Lord, and loving Polycarp even as I do you. Remember me, as Jesus
   Christ also remembered you. Pray ye for the Church which is in Syria,
   whence I am led bound to Rome, being the last of the faithful who are
   there, even as I have been thought worthy to be chosen^[171]144 to show
   forth the honour of God. Farewell in God the Father, and in Jesus
   Christ, our common hope.
