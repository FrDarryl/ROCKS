               The Encyclical Epistle of the Church at Smyrnam

                Concerning the Martyrdom of the Holy Polycarp

                                ------------

   The Church of God which sojourns at Smyrna, to the Church of God
   sojourning in Philomelium,^[28]1 and to all the congregations^[29]2 of
   the Holy and Catholic Church in every place: Mercy, peace, and love
   from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, be multiplied.
   Chapter I.-Subject of Which We Write.

   We have written to you, brethren, as to what relates to the martyrs,
   and especially to the blessed Polycarp, who put an end to the
   persecution, having, as it were, set a seal upon it by his martyrdom.
   For almost all the events that happened previously [to this one], took
   place that the Lord might show us from above a martyrdom becoming the
   Gospel. For he waited to be delivered up, even as the Lord had done,
   that we also might become his followers, while we look not merely at
   what concerns ourselves but have regard also to our neighbours. For it
   is the part of a true and well-founded love, not only to wish one's
   self to be saved, but also all the brethren.
   Chapter II.-The Wonderful Constancy of the Martyrs.

   All the martyrdoms, then, were blessed and noble which took place
   according to the will of God. For it becomes us who profess^[30]3
   greater piety than others, to ascribe the authority over all things to
   God. And truly,^[31]4 who can fail to admire their nobleness of mind,
   and their patience, with that love towards their Lord which they
   displayed?-who, when they were so torn with scourges, that the frame of
   their bodies, even to the very inward veins and arteries, was laid
   open, still patiently endured, while even those that stood by pitied
   and bewailed them. But they reached such a pitch of magnanimity, that
   not one of them let a sigh or a groan escape them; thus proving to us
   all that those holy martyrs of Christ, at the very time when they
   suffered such torments, were absent from the body, or rather, that the
   Lord then stood by them, and communed with them. And, looking to the
   grace of Christ, they despised all the torments of this world,
   redeeming themselves from eternal punishment by [the suffering of] a
   single hour. For this reason the fire of their savage executioners
   appeared cool to them. For they kept before their view escape from that
   fire which is eternal and never shall be quenched, and looked forward
   with the eyes of their heart to those good things which are laid up for
   such as endure; things "which ear hath not heard, nor eye seen, neither
   have entered into the heart of man,"^[32]5 but were revealed by the
   Lord to them, inasmuch as they were no longer men, but had already
   become angels. And, in like manner, those who were condemned to the
   wild beasts endured dreadful tortures, being stretched out upon beds
   full of spikes, and subjected to various other kinds of torments, in
   order that, if it were possible, the tyrant might, by their lingering
   tortures, lead them to a denial [of Christ].
   Chapter III.-The Constancy of Germanicus. The Death of Polycarp is
       Demanded.

   For the devil did indeed invent many things against them; but thanks be
   to God, he could not prevail over all. For the most noble Germanicus
   strengthened the timidity of others by his own patience, and fought
   heroically^[33]6 with the wild beasts. For, when the proconsul sought
   to persuade him, and urged him^[34]7 to take pity upon his age, he
   attracted the wild beast towards himself, and provoked it, being
   desirous to escape all the more quickly from an unrighteous and impious
   world. But upon this the whole multitude, marvelling at the nobility of
   mind displayed by the devout and godly race of Christians,^[35]8 cried
   out, "Away with the Atheists; let Polycarp be sought out!"
   Chapter IV.-Quintus the Apostate.

   Now one named Quintus, a Phrygian, who was but lately come from
   Phrygia, when he saw the wild beasts, became afraid. This was the man
   who forced himself and some others to come forward voluntarily [for
   trial]. Him the proconsul, after many entreaties, persuaded to swear
   and to offer sacrifice. Wherefore, brethren, we do not commend those
   who give themselves up [to suffering], seeing the Gospel does not teach
   so to do.^[36]9
   Chapter V.-The Departure and Vision of Polycarp.

   But the most admirable Polycarp, when he first heard [that he was
   sought for], was in no measure disturbed, but resolved to continue in
   the city. However, in deference to the wish of many, he was persuaded
   to leave it. He departed, therefore, to a country house not far distant
   from the city. There he stayed with a few [friends], engaged in nothing
   else night and day than praying for all men, and for the Churches
   throughout the world, according to his usual custom. And while he was
   praying, a vision presented itself to him three days before he was
   taken; and, behold, the pillow under his head seemed to him on fire.
   Upon this, turning to those that were with him, he said to them
   prophetically," I must be burnt alive."
   Chapter VI.-Polycarp is Betrayed by a Servant.

   And when those who sought for him were at hand, he departed to another
   dwelling, whither his pursuers immediately came after him. And when
   they found him not, they seized upon two youths [that were there], one
   of whom, being subjected to torture, confessed. It was thus impossible
   that he should continue hid, since those that betrayed him were of his
   own household. The Irenarch^[37]10 then (whose office is the same as
   that of the Cleronomus^[38]11 ), by name Herod, hastened to bring him
   into the stadium. [This all happened] that he might fulfil his special
   lot, being made a partaker of Christ, and that they who betrayed him
   might undergo the punishment of Judas himself.
   Chapter VII.-Polycarp is Found by His Pursuers.

   His pursuers then, along with horsemen, and taking the youth with them,
   went forth at supper-time on the day of the preparation^[39]12 with
   their usual weapons, as if going out against a robber.^[40]13 And being
   come about evening [to the place where he was], they found him lying
   down in the upper room of^[41]14 a certain little house, from which he
   might have escaped into another place; but he refused, saying, "The
   will of God^[42]15 be done."^[43]16 So when he heard that they were
   come, he went down and spake with them. And as those that were present
   marvelled at his age and constancy, some of them said. "Was so much
   effort^[44]17 made to capture such a venerable man?^[45]18 Immediately
   then, in that very hour, he ordered that something to eat and drink
   should be set before them, as much indeed as they cared for, while he
   besought them to allow him an hour to pray without disturbance. And on
   their giving him leave, he stood and prayed, being full of the grace of
   God, so that he could not cease^[46]19 for two full hours, to the
   astonishment of them that heard him, insomuch that many began to repent
   that they had come forth against so godly and venerable an old man.
   Chapter VIII.-Polycarp is Brought into the City.

   Now, as soon as he had ceased praying, having made mention of all that
   had at any time come in contact with him, both small and great,
   illustrious and obscure, as well as the whole Catholic Church
   throughout the world, the time of his departure having arrived, they
   set him upon an ass, and conducted him into the city, the day being
   that of the great Sabbath. And the Irenarch Herod, accompanied by his
   father Nicetes (both riding in a chariot^[47]20 ), met him, and taking
   him up into the chariot, they seated themselves beside him, and
   endeavoured to persuade him, saying, "What harm is there in saying,
   Lord Caesar,^[48]21 and in sacrificing, with the other ceremonies
   observed on such occasions, and so make sure of safety? "But he at
   first gave them no answer; and when they continued to urge him, he
   said, "I shall not do as you advise me." So they, having no hope of
   persuading him, began to speak bitter^[49]22 words unto him, and cast
   him with violence out of the chariot,^[50]23 insomuch that, in getting
   down from the carriage, he dislocated his leg^[51]24 [by the fall]. But
   without being disturbed,^[52]25 and as if suffering nothing, he went
   eagerly forward with all haste, and was conducted to the stadium, where
   the tumult was so great, that there was no possibility of being heard.
   Chapter IX.-Polycarp Refuses to Revile Christ.

   Now, as Polycarp was entering into the stadium, there came to him a
   voice from heaven, saying, "Be strong, and show thyself a man, O
   Polycarp!" No one saw who it was that spoke to him; but those of our
   brethren who were present heard the voice. And as he was brought
   forward, the tumult became great when they heard that Polycarp was
   taken. And when he came near, the proconsul asked him whether he was
   Polycarp. On his confessing that he was, [the proconsul] sought to
   persuade him to deny [Christ], saying, "Have respect to thy old age,"
   and other similar things, according to their custom, [such as], "Swear
   by the fortune of Caesar; repent, and say, Away with the Atheists." But
   Polycarp, gazing with a stern countenance on all the multitude of the
   wicked heathen then in the stadium, and waving his hand towards them,
   while with groans he looked up to heaven, said, "Away with the
   Atheists."^[53]26 Then, the proconsul urging him, and saying, "Swear,
   and I will set thee at liberty, reproach Christ; "Polycarp declared,
   "Eighty and six years have I served Him, and He never did me any
   injury: how then can I blaspheme my King and my Saviour? "
   Chapter X.-Polycarp Confesses Himself a Christian.

   And when the proconsul yet again pressed him, and said, "Swear by the
   fortune of Caesar," he answered, "Since thou art vainly urgent that, as
   thou sayest, I should swear by the fortune of Caesar, and pretendest
   not to know who and what I am, hear me declare with boldness, I am a
   Christian. And if you wish to learn what the doctrines^[54]27 of
   Christianity are, appoint me a day, and thou shalt hear them." The
   proconsul replied, "Persuade the people." But Polycarp said, "To thee I
   have thought it right to offer an account [of my faith]; for we are
   taught to give all due honour (which entails no injury upon ourselves)
   to the powers and authorities which are ordained of God.^[55]28 But as
   for these, I do not deem them worthy of receiving any account from
   me."^[56]29
   Chapter XI.-No Threats Have Any Effect on Polycarp.

   The proconsul then said to him, "I have wild beasts at hand ; to these
   will I cast thee, except thou repent." But he answered, "Call them
   then, for we are not accustomed to repent of what is good in order to
   adopt that which is evil;^[57]30 and it is well for me to be changed
   from what is evil to what is righteous."^[58]31 But again the proconsul
   said to him, "I will cause thee to be consumed by fire, seeing thou
   despisest the wild beasts, if thou wilt not repent." But Polycarp said,
   "Thou threatenest me with fire which burneth for an hour, and after a
   little is extinguished, but art ignorant of the fire of the coming
   judgment and of eternal punishment, reserved for the ungodly. But why
   tarriest thou? Bring forth what thou wilt."
   Chapter XII.-Polycarp is Sentenced to Be Burned.

   While he spoke these and many other like things, he was filled with
   confidence and joy, and his countenance was full of grace, so that not
   merely did it not fall as if troubled by the things said to him, but,
   on the contrary, the proconsul was astonished, and sent his herald to
   proclaim in the midst of the stadium thrice, "Polycarp has confessed
   that he is a Christian." This proclamation having been made by the
   herald, the whole multitude both of the heathen and Jews, who dwelt at
   Smyrna, cried out with uncontrollable fury, and in a loud voice, "This
   is the teacher of Asia,^[59]32 the father of the Christians, and the
   overthrower of our gods, he who has been teaching many not to
   sacrifice, or to worship the gods." Speaking thus, they cried out, and
   besought Philip the Asiarch^[60]33 to let loose a lion upon Polycarp.
   But Philip answered that it was not lawful for him to do so, seeing the
   shows^[61]34 of wild beasts were already finished. Then it seemed good
   to them to cry out with one consent, that Polycarp should be burnt
   alive. For thus it behooved the vision which was revealed to him in
   regard to his pillow to be fulfilled, when, seeing it on fire as he was
   praying, he turned about and said prophetically to the faithful that
   were with him, "I must be burnt alive."
   Chapter XIII.-The Funeral Pile is Erected.

   This, then, was carried into effect with greater speed than it was
   spoken, the multitudes immediately gathering together wood and fagots
   out of the shops and baths; the Jews especially, according to custom,
   eagerly assisting them in it. And when the funeral pile was ready,
   Polycarp, laying aside all his garments, and loosing his girdle, sought
   also to take off his sandals,-a thing he was not accustomed to do,
   inasmuch as every one of the faithful was always eager who should first
   touch his skin. For, on account of his holy life,^[62]35 he was, even
   before his martyrdom, adorned^[63]36 with every kind of good.
   Immediately then they surrounded him with those substances which had
   been prepared for the funeral pile. But when they were about also to
   fix him with nails, he said, "Leave me as I am; for He that giveth me
   strength to endure the fire, will also enable me, without your securing
   me by nails, to remain without moving in the pile."
   Chapter XIV.-The Prayer of Polycarp.

   They did not nail him then, but simply bound him. And he, placing his
   hands behind him, and being bound like a distinguished ram [taken] out
   of a great flock for sacrifice, and prepared to be an acceptable
   burnt-offering unto God, looked up to heaven, and said, "O Lord God
   Almighty, the Father of thy beloved and blessed Son Jesus Christ, by
   whom we have received the knowledge of Thee, the God of angels and
   powers, and of every creature, and of the whole race of the righteous
   who live before thee, I give Thee thanks that Thou hast counted me,
   worthy of this day and this hour, that I should have a part in the
   number of Thy martyrs, in the cup^[64]37 of thy Christ, to the
   resurrection of eternal life, both of soul and body, through the
   incorruption [imparted] by the Holy Ghost. Among whom may I be accepted
   this day before Thee as a fat^[65]38 and acceptable sacrifice,
   according as Thou, the ever-truthful^[66]39 God, hast fore-ordained,
   hast revealed beforehand to me, and now hast fulfilled. Wherefore also
   I praise Thee for all things, I bless Thee, I glorify Thee, along with
   the everlasting and heavenly Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, with whom,
   to Thee, and the Holy Ghost, be glory both now and to all coming ages.
   Amen."^[67]40
   Chapter XV.-Polycarp is Not Injured by the Fire.

   When he had pronounced this amen, and so finished his prayer, those who
   were appointed for the purpose kindled the fire. And as the flame
   blazed forth in great fury,^[68]41 we, to whom it was given to witness
   it, beheld a great miracle, and have been preserved that we might
   report to others what then took place. For the fire, shaping itself
   into the form of an arch, like the sail of a ship when filled with the
   wind, encompassed as by a circle the body of the martyr. And he
   appeared within not like flesh which is burnt, but as bread that is
   baked, or as gold and silver glowing in a furnace. Moreover, we
   perceived such a sweet odour [coming from the pile], as if frankincense
   or some such precious spices had been smoking^[69]42 there.
   Chapter XVI.-Polycarp is Pierced by a Dagger.

   At length, when those wicked men perceived that his body could not be
   consumed by the fire, they commanded an executioner to go near and
   pierce him through with a dagger. And on his doing this, there came
   forth a dove,^[70]43 and a great quantity of blood, so that the fire
   was extinguished; and all the people wondered that there should be such
   a difference between the unbelievers and the elect, of whom this most
   admirable Polycarp was one, having in our own times been an apostolic
   and prophetic teacher, and bishop of the Catholic Church which is in
   Smyrna. For every word that went out of his mouth either has been or
   shall yet be accomplished.
   Chapter XVII.-The Christians are Refused Polycarp's Body.

   But when the adversary of the race of the righteous, the envious,
   malicious, and wicked one, perceived the impressive^[71]44 nature of
   his martyrdom, and [considered] the blameless life he had led from the
   beginning, and how he was now crowned with the wreath of immortality,
   having beyond dispute received his reward, he did his utmost that not
   the least memorial of him should be taken away by us, although many
   desired to do this, and to become possessors^[72]45 of his holy flesh.
   For this end he suggested it to Nicetes, the father of Herod and
   brother of Alce, to go and entreat the governor not to give up his body
   to be buried, "lest," said he, "forsaking Him that was crucified, they
   begin to worship this one." This he said at the suggestion and urgent
   persuasion of the Jews, who also watched us, as we sought to take him
   out of the fire, being ignorant of this, that it is neither possible
   for us ever to forsake Christ, who suffered for the salvation of such
   as shall be saved throughout the whole world (the blameless one for
   sinners^[73]46 ), nor to worship any other. For Him indeed, as being
   the Son of God, we adore; but the martyrs, as disciples and followers
   of the Lord, we worthily love on account of their extraordinary^[74]47
   affection towards their own King and Master, of whom may we also be
   made companions^[75]48 and fellow-disciples!
   Chapter XVIII.-The Body of Polycarp is Burned.

   The centurion then, seeing the strife excited by the Jews, placed the
   body^[76]49 in the midst of the fire, and consumed it. Accordingly, we
   afterwards took up his bones, as being more precious than the most
   exquisite jewels, and more purified^[77]50 than gold, and deposited
   them in a fitting place, whither, being gathered together, as
   opportunity is allowed us, with joy and rejoicing, the Lord shall grant
   us to celebrate the anniversary^[78]51 of his martyrdom, both in memory
   of those who have already finished their course,^[79]52 and for the
   exercising and preparation of those yet to walk in their steps.
   Chapter XIX.-Praise of the Martyr Polycarp.

   This, then, is the account of the blessed Polycarp, who, being the
   twelfth that was martyred in Smyrna (reckoning those also of
   Philadelphia), yet occupies a place of his own^[80]53 in the memory of
   all men, insomuch that he is everywhere spoken of by the heathen
   themselves. He was not merely an illustrious teacher, but also a
   pre-eminent martyr, whose martyrdom all desire to imitate, as having
   been altogether consistent with the Gospel of Christ. For, having
   through patience overcome the unjust governor, and thus acquired the
   crown of immortality, he now, with the apostles and all the righteous
   [in heaven], rejoicingly glorifies God, even the Father, and blesses
   our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour of our souls, the Governor of our
   bodies, and the Shepherd of the Catholic Church throughout the
   world.^[81]54
   Chapter XX.-This Epistle is to Be Transmitted to the Brethren.

   Since, then, ye requested that we would at large make you acquainted
   with what really took place, we have for the present sent you this
   summary account through our brother Marcus. When, therefore, ye have
   yourselves read this Epistle,^[82]55 be pleased to send it to the
   brethren at a greater distance, that they also may glorify the Lord,
   who makes such choice of His own servants. To Him who is able to bring
   us all by His grace and goodness^[83]56 into his everlasting kingdom,
   through His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, to Him be glory, and
   honour, and power, and majesty, for ever. Amen. Salute all the saints.
   They that are with us salute you, and Evarestus, who wrote this
   Epistle, with all his house.
   Chapter XXI.-The Date of the Martyrdom.

   Now, the blessed Polycarp suffered martyrdom on the second day of the
   month Xanthicus just begun,^[84]57 the seventh day before the Kalends
   of May, on the great Sabbath, at the eighth hour.^[85]58 He was taken
   by Herod, Philip the Trallian being high priest,^[86]59 Statius
   Quadratus being proconsul, but Jesus Christ being King for ever, to
   whom be glory, honour, majesty, and an everlasting throne, from
   generation to generation. Amen.
   Chapter XXII.-Salutation.

   We wish you, brethren, all happiness, while you walk according to the
   doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; with whom be glory to God the
   Father and the Holy Spirit, for the salvation of His holy elect, after
   whose example^[87]60 the blessed Polycarp suffered, following in whose
   steins may we too be found in the kingdom of Jesus Christ!

   These things^[88]61 Caius transcribed from the copy of Irenaeus (who
   was a disciple of Polycarp), having himself been intimate with
   Irenaeus. And I Socrates transcribed them at Corinth from the copy of
   Caius. Grace be with you all.

   And I again, Pionius, wrote them from the previously written copy,
   having carefully searched into them, and the blessed Polycarp having
   manifested them to me through a revelation, even as I shall show in
   what follows. I have collected these things, when they had almost faded
   away through the lapse of time, that the Lord Jesus Christ may also
   gather me along with His elect into His heavenly kingdom, to whom, with
   the Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
