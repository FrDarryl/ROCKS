               Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Ignatius.

                                  --------

   The learned dissertation of Pearson, on the difficulties of reconciling
   the supposed year of the martyrdom with the history of Trajan, etc., is
   given entire in Jacobson (vol. ii. p. 524), against the decision of
   Usher for a.d. 107. Pearson accepts a.d. 116. Consult also the preface
   of Dr. Thomas Smith,^[5]4 in the same work (p. 518), on the text of the
   original and of the Latin versions, and on the credibility of the
   narrative. Our learned translators seem to think the text they have
   used, to be without interpolation. If the simple-minded faithful of
   those days, so near the age of miracles, appear to us, in some degree,
   enthusiasts, let us remember the vision of Col. Gardiner, accredited by
   Doddridge, Lord Lyttleton's vision (see Boswell, anno 1784, chap. xi.),
   accepted by Johnson and his contemporaries, and the interesting
   narrative of the pious Mr. Tennent of New Jersey, attested by so many
   excellent and intelligent persons, almost of our own times.

   The following is the Introductory Notice of the translators:-

   The following account of the martyrdom of Ignatius professes, in
   several passages, to have been written by those who accompanied him on
   his voyage to Rome, and were present on the occasion of his death
   (chaps. v. vi. vii.). And if the genuineness of this narrative, as well
   as of the Ignatian Epistles, be admitted, there can be little doubt
   that the persons in question were Philo and Agathopus, with Crocus
   perhaps, all of whom are mentioned by Ignatius (Epist. to Smyr., chap.
   x.; to Philad., chap. xi.; to Rom., chap. x.) as having attended him on
   that journey to Rome which resulted in his martyrdom. But doubts have
   been started, by Daille and others, as to the date and authorship of
   this account. Some of these rest upon internal considerations, but the
   weightiest objection is found in the fact that no reference to this
   narrative is to be traced during the first six centuries of our
   era.^[6]5 This is certainly a very suspicious circumstance, and may
   well give rise to some hesitation in ascribing the authorship to the
   immediate companions and friends of Ignatius. On the other hand,
   however, this account of the death of Ignatius is in perfect harmony
   with the particulars recounted by Eusebius and Chrysostom regarding
   him. Its comparative simplicity, too, is greatly in its favour. It
   makes no reference to the legends which by and by connected themselves
   with the name of Ignatius. As is well known, he came in course of time
   to be identified with the child whom Christ (Matthew 18: 2) set before
   His disciples as a pattern of humility. It was said that the Saviour
   took him up in His arms, and that hence Ignatius derived his name of
   Theophorus;^[7]6 that is, according to the explanation which this
   legend gives of the word, one carried by God. But in chap. ii. of the
   following narrative we find the term explained to mean, "one who has
   Christ in his breast; "and this simple explanation, with the entire
   silence preserved as to the marvels afterwards connected with the name
   of Ignatius, is certainly a strong argument in favour of the early date
   and probable genuineness of the account. Some critics, such as Usher
   and Grabe, have reckoned the latter part of the narrative spurious,
   while accepting the former; but there appears to be a unity about it
   which requires us either to accept it in toto, or to reject it
   altogether.^[8]7
