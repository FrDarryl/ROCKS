               The Epistle of Maria the Proselyte to Ignatius

                    Mary of Cassobelae to Ignatius^[11]1

                                ------------

   Maria, a proselyte of Jesus Christ, to Ignatius Theophorus, most
   blessed bishop of the apostolic Church which is at Antioch, beloved in
   God the Father, and Jesus: Happiness and safety. We all^[12]2 beg for
   thee joy and health in Him.
   Chapter I.-Occasion of the Epistle.

   Since Christ has, to our wonder,^[13]3 been made known among us to be
   the Son of the living God, and to have become man in these last times
   by means of the Virgin Mary,^[14]4 of the seed of David and Abraham,
   according to the announcements previously made regarding Him and
   through Him by the company of the prophets, we therefore beseech and
   entreat that, by thy wisdom, Maris our friend, bishop of our native
   Neapolis,^[15]5 which is near Zarbus,^[16]6 and Eulogius, and Sobelus
   the presbyter, be sent to us, that we be not destitute of such as
   preside over the divine word as Moses also says, "Let the Lord God look
   out a man who shall guide this people, and the congregation of the Lord
   shall not be as sheep which have no shepherd."^[17]7
   Chapter II.-Youth May Be Allied with Piety and Discretion.

   But as to those whom we have named being young men, do not, thou
   blessed one, have any apprehension. For I would have you know that they
   are wise about the flesh, and are insensible to its passions, they
   themselves glowing with all the glory of a hoary head through their
   our^[18]8 intrinsic merits, and though but recently called as young men
   to the priesthood.^[19]9 Now, call thou into exercise^[20]10 thy
   thoughts through the Spirit that God has given to thee by Christ, and
   thou wilt remember^[21]11 that Samuel, while yet a little child, was
   called a seer, and was reckoned in the company of the prophets, that he
   reproved the aged Eli for transgression, since he had honoured his
   infatuated sons above God the author of all things, and bad allowed
   them to go unpunished, when they turned the office of the priesthood
   into ridicule, and acted violently towards thy people.
   Chapter III.-Examples of Youthful Devotedness.

   Moreover, the wise Daniel, while he was a young man, passed judgment on
   certain vigorous old man,^[22]12 showing them that they were abandoned
   wretches, and not [worthy to be reckoned] elders, and that, though Jews
   by extraction, they were Canaanites in practice. And Jeremiah, when on
   account of his youth he declined the office of a prophet entrusted to
   him by God, was addressed in these words: "Say not, I am a youth; for
   thou shalt go to all those to whom I send thee, and thou shalt speak
   according to all that I command thee; because I am with thee."^[23]13
   And the wise Solomon, when only in the twelfth year of his age,^[24]14
   had wisdom to decide the important question concerning the children of
   the two women,^[25]15 when it was unknown to whom these respectively
   belonged; so that the whole people were astonished at such wisdom in a
   child, and venerated him as being not a mere youth, but a full-grown
   man. And he solved the hard questions of the queen of the Ethiopians,
   which had profit in them as the streams of the Nile [have fertility],
   in such a manner that that woman, though herself so wise, was beyond
   measure astonished.^[26]16
   Chapter IV.-The Same Subject Continued.

   Josiah also, beloved of God, when as yet he could scarcely speak
   articulately, convicts those who were possessed of a wicked spirit as
   being false in their speech, and deceivers of the people. He also
   reveals the deceit of the demons, and openly exposes those that are no
   gods; yea, while yet an infant he slays their priests, and overturns
   their altars, and defiles the place where sacrifices were offered with
   dead bodies, and throws down the temples, and cuts down the groves, and
   breaks in pieces the pillars, and breaks open the tombs of the ungodly,
   that not a relic of the wicked might any longer exist.^[27]17 To such
   an extent did he display zeal in the cause of godliness, and prove
   himself a punisher of the ungodly, while he as yet faltered in speech
   like a child. David, too, who was at once a prophet and a king, and the
   root of our Saviour according to the flesh, while yet a youth is
   anointed by Samuel to be king.^[28]18 For he himself says in a certain
   place, "I was small among my brethren, and the youngest in the house of
   my father."^[29]19
   Chapter V.-Expressions of Respect for Ignatius.

   But time would fail me if I should endeavour to enumerate^[30]20 all
   those that pleased God in their youth, having been entrusted by God
   with either the prophetical, the priestly, or the kingly office. And
   those which have been mentioned may suffice, by way of bringing the
   subject to thy remembrance. But I entreat thee not to reckon me
   presumptuous or ostentatious [in writing as I have done]. For I have
   set forth these statements, not as instructing thee, but simply as
   suggesting the matter to the remembrance of my father in God. For I
   know my own place,^[31]21 and do not compare myself with such as you. I
   salute thy holy clergy, and thy Christ-loving people who are ruled
   under thy care as their pastor. All the faithful with us salute thee.
   Pray, blessed shepherd, that I may be in health as respects God.
