                     The Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp

                         Shorter and Longer Versions

                                ------------
   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to Polycarp, Bishop of the
       Church of the Smyrnaeans, or rather, who has, as his own bishop,
       God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: [wishes] abundance of
       happiness.
       Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, and a witness for Jesus Christ, to
       Polycarp, Bishop of the Church of the Smyrnaeans, or rather, who
       has, as his own bishop, God the Father, and Jesus Christ: [wishes]
       abundance of happiness.
       Chapter I.-Commendation and Exhortation.

   Having obtained good proof that thy mind is fixed in God as upon an
   immoveable rock, I loudly glorify [His name] that I have been thought
   worthy [to behold] thy blameless face,^[14]1 which may I ever enjoy in
   God! I entreat thee, by the grace with which thou art clothed, to press
   forward in thy course, and to exhort all that they may be saved.
   Maintain thy position with all care, both in the flesh and spirit. Have
   a regard to preserve unity, than which nothing is better. Bear with
   all, even as the Lord does with thee. Support^[15]2 all in love, as
   also thou doest. Give thyself to prayer without ceasing.^[16]3 Implore
   additional understanding to what thou already hast. Be watchful,
   possessing a sleepless spirit. Speak to every man separately, as God
   enables thee.^[17]4 Bear the infirmities of all, as being a perfect
   athlete [in the Christian life]: where the labour is great, the gain is
   all the more.

   immoveable rock, I loudly glorify [His name] that I have been thought
   worthy to behold thy blameless face,^[18]5 which may I ever enjoy in
   God! I entreat thee, by the grace with which thou art clothed, to press
   forward in thy course, and to exhort all that they may be saved.
   Maintain thy position with all care, both in the flesh and spirit. Have
   a regard to preserve unity, than which nothing is better. Bear with all
   even as the Lord does with thee. Support^[19]6 all in love, as also
   thou doest. Give thyself to prayer without ceasing.^[20]7 Implore
   additional understanding to what thou already hast. Be watchful,
   possessing a sleepless spirit. Speak to every man separately, as God
   enables thee.^[21]8 Bear the infirmities of all, as being a perfect
   athlete [in the Christian life], even as does the Lord of all. For says
   [the Scripture], "He Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
   sicknesses."^[22]9 Where the labour is great, the gain is all the more.
   Chapter II.-Exhortations.

   If thou lovest the good disciples, no thanks are due to thee on that
   account; but rather seek by meekness to subdue the more troublesome.
   Every kind of wound is not healed with the same plaster. Mitigate
   violent attacks [of disease] by gentle applications.^[23]10 Be in all
   things "wise as a serpent, and harmless as a dove."^[24]11 For this
   purpose thou art composed of both flesh and spirit, that thou mayest
   deal tenderly^[25]12 with those [evils] that present themselves visibly
   before thee. And as respects those that are not seen,^[26]13 pray that
   [God] would reveal them unto thee, in order that thou mayest be wanting
   in nothing, but mayest abound in every gift. The times call for thee,
   as pilots do for the winds, and as one tossed with tempest seeks for
   the haven, so that both thou [and those under thy care] may attain to
   God. Be sober as an athlete of God: the prize set before thee is
   immortality and eternal life, of which thou art also persuaded. In all
   things may my soul be for thing,^[27]14 and my bonds also, which thou
   hast loved.

   If thou lovest the good disciples, no thanks are due to thee on that
   account; but rather seek by meekness to subdue the more troublesome.
   Every kind of wound is not healed with the same plaster. Mitigate
   violent attacks [of disease] by gentle applications.^[28]15 Be in all
   things "wise as a serpent, and harmless always as a dove."^[29]16 For
   this purpose thou art composed of both soul and body, art both fleshly
   and spiritual, that thou mayest correct those [evils] that present
   themselves visibly before thee; and as respects those that are not
   seen, mayest pray that these should be revealed to thee, so that thou
   mayest be wanting in nothing, but mayest abound in every gift. The
   times call upon thee to pray. For as the wind aids the pilot of a ship,
   and as havens are advantageous for safety to a tempest-tossed vessel,
   so is also prayer to thee, in order that thou mayest attain to God. Be
   sober as an athlete of God, whose will is immortality and eternal life;
   of which thou art also persuaded. In all things may my soul be for
   thine,^[30]17 and my bonds also, which thou hast loved.
   Chapter III.-Exhortations.

   Let not those who seem worthy of credit, but teach strange
   doctrines,^[31]18 fill thee with apprehension. Stand firm, as does an
   anvil which is beaten. It is the part of a noble^[32]19 athlete to be
   wounded, and yet to conquer. And especially, we ought to bear all
   things for the sake of God, that He also may bear with us. Be ever
   becoming more zealous than what thou art. Weigh carefully the times.
   Look for Him who is above all time, eternal and invisible, yet who
   became visible for our sakes; impalpable and impassible, yet who became
   passible on our account; and who in every kind of way suffered for our
   sakes.

   Let not those who seem worthy of credit, but teach strange
   doctrines,^[33]20 fill thee with apprehension. Stand firm, as does an
   anvil which is beaten. It is the part of a noble^[34]21 athlete to be
   wounded, and yet to conquer. And especially we ought to bear all things
   for the sake of God, that He also may bear with us, and bring us into
   His kingdom. Add more and more to thy diligence; run thy race with
   increasing energy; weigh carefully the times. Whilst thou art here, be
   a conqueror; for here is the course, and there are the crowns. Look for
   Christ, the Son of God; who was before time, yet appeared in time; who
   was invisible by nature, yet visible in the flesh; who was impalpable,
   and could not be touched, as being without a body, but for our sakes
   became such, might be touched and handled in the body; who was
   impassible as God, but became passible for our sakes as man; and who in
   every kind of way suffered for our sakes.
   Chapter IV.-Exhortations.

   Let not widows be neglected. Be thou, after the Lord, their
   protector^[35]22 and friend. Let nothing be done without thy consent;
   neither do thou anything without the approval of God, which indeed thou
   dost not, inasmuch as thou art stedfast. Let your assembling together
   be of frequent^[36]23 occurrence: seek after all by name.^[37]24 Do not
   despise either male or female slaves, yet neither let them be puffed up
   with conceit, but rather let them submit themselves^[38]25 the more,
   for the glory of God, that they may obtain from God a better liberty.
   Let them not long to be set free [from slavery] at the public expense,
   that they be not found slaves to their own desires.

   Let not the widows be neglected. Be thou, after the Lord, their

   do thou anything without the approval of God, which indeed thou doest
   not. Be thou stedfast. Let your assembling together be of
   frequent^[39]26 occurrence: seek after all by name.^[40]27 Do not
   despise either male or female slaves, yet neither let them be puffed up
   with conceit, but rather let them submit themselves^[41]28 the more,
   for the glory of God, that they may obtain from God a better liberty.
   Let them not wish to be set free [from slavery] at the public expense,
   that they be not found slaves to their own desires.
   Chapter V.-The Duties of Husbands and Wives.

   Flee evil arts; but all the more discourse in public regarding
   them.^[42]29 Speak to my sisters, that they love the Lord, and be
   satisfied with their husbands both in the flesh and spirit. In like
   manner also, exhort my brethren, in the name of Jesus Christ, that they
   love their wives, even as the Lord the Church.^[43]30 If any one can
   continue in a state of purity,^[44]31 to the honour of Him who is Lord
   of the flesh,^[45]32 let him so remain without boasting. If he begins
   to boast, he is undone; and if he reckon himself greater than the
   bishop, he is ruined. But it becomes both men and women who marry, to
   form their union with the approval of the bishop, that their marriage
   may be according to God, and not after their own lust. Let all things
   be done to the honour of God.^[46]33

   remain without boasting. If he shall boast, he is undone; and if he
   seeks to be more prominent^[48]35 than the bishop, he is ruined. But it
   becomes both men and women who marry, to form their union with the
   approval of the bishop, that their marriage may be according to the
   Lord, and not after their own lust. Let all things be done to the
   honour of God.^[49]36
   Chapter VI.-The Duties of the Christian Flock.

   Give ye^[50]37 heed to the bishop, that God also may give heed to you.
   My soul be for theirs^[51]38 that are submissive to the bishop, to the
   presbyters, and to the deacons, and may my portion be along with them
   in God! Labour together with one another; strive in company together;
   run together; suffer together; sleep together; and awake together, as
   the stewards, and associates,^[52]39 and servants of God. Please ye Him
   under whom ye fight, and from whom ye receive your wages. Let none of
   you be found a deserter. Let your baptism endure as your arms; your
   faith as your helmet; your love as your spear; your patience as a
   complete panoply. Let your works be the charge^[53]40 assigned to you,
   that ye may receive a worthy recompense. Be long-suffering, therefore,
   with one another, in meekness, as God is towards you. May I have joy of
   you for ever!^[54]41

   Give ye^[55]42 heed to the bishop, that God also may give heed to you.
   My soul be for theirs^[56]43 that are submissive to the bishop, to the
   presbytery, and to the deacons: may I have my portion with them from
   God! Labour together with one another; strive in company together; run
   together; suffer together; sleep together; and awake together, as the
   stewards, and associates,^[57]44 and servants of God. Please ye Him
   under whom ye fight, and from whom ye shall receive your wages. Let
   none of you be found a deserter. Let your baptism endure as your arms;
   your faith as your helmet; your love as your spear; your patience as a
   complete panoply. Let your works be the charge assigned to you, that
   you may obtain for them a most worthy^[58]45 recompense. Be
   long-suffering, therefore, with one another, in meekness, and God shall
   be so with you. May I have joy of you for ever!^[59]46
   Chapter VII.-Request that Polycarp Would Send a Messenger to Antioch.

   Seeing that the Church which is at Antioch in Syria is, as report has
   informed me, at peace, through your prayers, I also am the more
   encouraged, resting without anxiety in God,^[60]47 if indeed by means
   of suffering I may attain to God, so that, through your prayers, I may
   be found a disciple [of Christ].^[61]48 It is fitting, O Polycarp, most
   blessed in God, to assemble a very solemn^[62]49 council, and to elect
   one whom you greatly love, and know to be a man of activity, who may be
   designated the messenger of God;^[63]50 and to bestow on him this
   honour that he may go into Syria, and glorify your ever active love to
   the praise of Christ. A Christian has not power over himself, but must
   always be ready for^[64]51 the service of God. Now, this work is both
   God's and yours, when ye shall have completed it to His glory.^[65]52
   For I trust that, through grace, ye are prepared for every good work
   pertaining to God. Knowing, therefore, your energetic love of the
   truth, I have exhorted you by this brief Epistle.

   Chapter VIII.-Let Other Churches Also Send to Antioch.

   Inasmuch as I have not been able to write to all the Churches, because
   I must suddenly sail from Troas to Neapolis, as the will^[70]57 [of the
   emperor] enjoins, [I beg that] thou, as being acquainted with the
   purpose^[71]58 of God, wilt write to the adjacent Churches, that they
   also may act in like manner, such as are able to do so sending
   messengers,^[72]59 and the others transmitting letters through those
   persons who are sent by thee, that thou^[73]60 mayest be glorified by a
   work^[74]61 which shall be remembered for ever, as indeed thou art
   worthy to be. I salute all by name, and in particular the wife of
   Epitropus, with all her house and children. I salute Attalus, my
   beloved. I salute him who shall be deemed worthy to go [from you] into
   Syria. Grace shall be with him for ever, and with Polycarp that sends
   him. I pray for your happiness for ever in our God, Jesus Christ, by
   whom continue ye in the unity and under the protection of God,^[75]62 I
   salute Alce, my dearly beloved.^[76]63 Fare ye well in the Lord.

   Inasmuch, therefore, as I have not been able to write to all Churches,

   the purpose^[78]65 of God, wilt write to the adjacent Churches, that
   they also may act in like manner, such as are able to do so sending
   messenger, and the others transmitting letters through those persons
   who are sent by thee, that thou mayest be glorified by a work^[79]66
   which shall be remembered for ever, as indeed thou art worthy to be. I
   salute all by name, and in particular the wife of Epitropus, with all
   her house and children. I salute Attalus, my beloved. I salute him who
   shall be deemed worthy to go [from you] into Syria. Grace shall be with
   him for ever, and with Polycarp that sends him. I pray for your
   happiness for ever in our God, Jesus Christ, by whom continue ye in the

   beloved.^[80]67 Amen. Grace [be with you]. Fare ye well in the Lord.
