           Introductory Note to the Spurious Epistles of Ignatius.

                                  --------

   To the following introductory note of the translators nothing need be
   prefixed, except a grateful acknowledgment of the value of their
   labours and of their good judgment in giving us even these spurious
   writings for purposes of comparison. They have thus placed the
   materials for a complete understanding of the whole subject, before
   students who have a mind to subject it to a thorough and candid
   examination.

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:-

   We formerly stated that eight out of the fifteen Epistles bearing the
   name of Ignatius are now universally admitted to be spurious. None of
   them are quoted or referred to by any ancient writer previous to the
   sixth century. The style, moreover, in which they are written, so
   different from that of the other Ignatian letters, and allusions which
   they contain to heresies and ecclesiastical arrangements of a much
   later date than that of their professed author, render it perfectly
   certain that they are not the authentic production of the illustrious
   bishop of Antioch.

   We cannot tell when or by whom these Epistles were fabricated. They
   have been thought to betray the same hand as the longer and
   interpolated form of the seven Epistles which are generally regarded as
   genuine. And some have conceived that the writer who gave forth to the
   world the Apostolic Constitutions under the name of Clement, was
   probably the author of these letters falsely ascribed to Ignatius, as
   well as of the longer recension of the seven Epistles which are
   mentioned by Eusebius.

   It was a considerable time before editors in modern times began to
   discriminate between the true and the false in the writings attributed
   to Ignatius. The letters first published under his name were those
   three which exist only in Latin. These came forth in 1495 at Paris,
   being appended to a life of Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. Some
   three years later, eleven Epistles, comprising those mentioned by
   Eusebius, and four others, were published in Latin, and passed through
   four or five editions. In 1536, the whole of the professedly Ignatian
   letters were published at Cologne in a Latin version; and this
   collection also passed through several editions. It was not till 1557
   that the Ignatian Epistles appeared for the first time in Greek at
   Dillingen. After this date many editions came forth, in which the
   probably genuine were still mixed up with the certainly spurious, the
   three Latin letters, only being rejected as destitute of authority.
   Vedelius of Geneva first made the distinction which is now universally
   accepted, in an edition of these Epistles which he published in 1623;
   and he was followed by Archbishop Usher and others, who entered more
   fully into that critical examination of these writings which has been
   continued down even to our own day.

   The reader will have no difficulty in detecting the internal grounds on
   which these eight letters are set aside as spurious. The difference of
   style from the other Ignatian writings will strike him even in perusing
   the English version which we have given, while it is of course much
   more marked in the original. And other decisive proofs present
   themselves in every one of the Epistles. In that to the Tarsians there
   is found a plain allusion to the Sabellian heresy, which did not arise
   till after the middle of the third century. In the Epistle to the
   Antiochians there is an enumeration of various Church officers, who
   were certainly unknown at the period when Ignatius lived. The Epistle
   to Hero plainly alludes to Manichaean errors, and could not therefore
   have been written before the third century. There are equally decisive
   proofs of spuriousness to be found in the Epistle to the Philippians,
   such as the references it contains to the Patripassian heresy
   originated by Praxeas in the latter part of the second century, and the
   ecclesiastical feasts, etc., of which it makes mention. The letter to
   Maria Cassobolita is of a very peculiar style, utterly alien from that
   of the other Epistles ascribed to Ignatius. And it is sufficient simply
   to glance at the short Epistles to St. John and the Virgin Mary, in
   order to see that they carry the stamp of imposture on their front;
   and, indeed, no sooner were they published than by almost universal
   consent they were rejected.

   But though the additional Ignatian letters here given are confessedly
   spurious, we have thought it not improper to present them to the
   English reader in an appendix to our first volume.^[5]16 We have done
   so, because they have been so closely connected with the name of the
   bishop of Antioch, and also because they are in themselves not
   destitute of interest. We have, moreover, the satisfaction of thus
   placing for the first time within the reach of one acquainted only with
   our language, all the materials that have entered into the protracted
   agitation of the famous Ignatian controversy.
