   Introductory Note to the Epistle Concerning the Martyrdom of Polycarp.

                                  --------

   Internal evidence goes far to establish the credit which Eusebius lends
   to this specimen of the martyrologies, certainly not the earliest if we
   accept that of Ignatius as genuine. As an encyclical of one of "the
   seven churches" to another of the same Seven, and as bearing witness to
   their aggregation with others into the unity of "the Holy and Catholic
   Church," it is a very interesting witness, not only to an article of
   the creed, but to the original meaning and acceptation of the same.
   More than this, it is evidence of the strength of Christ perfected in
   human weakness; and thus it affords us an assurance of grace equal to
   our day in every time of need. When I see in it, however, an example of
   what a noble army of martyrs, women and children included, suffered in
   those days "for the testimony of Jesus," and in order to hand down the
   knowledge of the Gospel to these boastful ages of our own, I confess
   myself edified by what I read, chiefly because I am humbled and abashed
   in comparing what a Christian used to be, with what a Christian is, in
   our times, even at his best estate.

   That this s1.v1.a3.w2 has been interpolated can hardly be doubted, when
   we compare it with the unvarnished specimen, in Eusebius. As for the
   "fragrant smell" that came from the fire, many kinds of wood emit the
   like in burning; and, apart from Oriental warmth of colouring, there
   seems nothing incredible in the narrative if we except "the dove"
   (chap. xvi.), which, however, is probably a corrupt reading,^[5]83 as
   suggested by our translators. The blade was thrust into the martyr's
   Left Side; and this, opening the heart, caused the outpouring of a
   flood, and not a mere trickling. But, though Greek thus amended is a
   plausible conjecture, there seems to have been nothing of the kind in
   the copy quoted by Eusebius. On the other hand, note the truly catholic
   and scriptural testimony: "We love the martyrs, but the Son of God we
   worship: it is impossible for us to worship any other."

   Bishop Jacobson assigns more than fifty pages to this martyrology, with
   a Latin version and abundant notes. To these I must refer the student,
   who may wish to see this attractive history in all the light of
   critical scholarship and, often, of admirable comment.

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:-

   The following letter purports to have been written by the Church at
   Smyrna to the Church at Philomelium, and through that Church to the
   whole Christian world, in order to give a succinct account of the
   circumstances attending the martyrdom of Polycarp. It is the earliest
   of all the Martyria, and has generally been accounted both the most
   interesting and authentic. Not a few, however, deem it interpolated in
   several passages, and some refer it to a much later date than the
   middle of the second century, to which it has been commonly ascribed.
   We cannot tell how much it may owe to the writers (chap. xxii.) who
   successively transcribed it. Great part of it has been engrossed by
   Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History (iv. 15); and it is instructive
   to observe, that some of the most startling miraculous phenomena
   recorded in the text as it now stands, have no place in the narrative
   as given by that early historian of the Church. Much discussion has
   arisen respecting several particulars contained in this Martyrium; but
   into these disputes we do not enter, having it for our aim simply to
   present the reader with as faithful a translation as possible of this
   very interesting monument of Christian antiquity.
