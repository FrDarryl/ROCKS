                The Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians

                         Shorter and Longer Versions

                                ------------
   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of God the
       Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, which is at Philadelphia, in
       Asia, which has obtained mercy, and is established in the harmony
       of God, and rejoiceth unceasingly^[17]1 in the passion of our Lord,
       and is filled with all mercy through his resurrection; which I
       salute in the blood of Jesus Christ, who is our eternal and
       enduring joy, especially if [men] are in unity with the bishop, the
       presbyters, and the deacons, who have been appointed according to
       the mind of Jesus Christ, whom He has established in security,
       after His own will, and by His Holy Spirit.
       Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of God the
       Father, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is at Philadelphia,
       which has obtained mercy through love, and is established in the
       harmony of God, and rejoiceth unceasingly,^[18]2 in the passion of
       our Lord Jesus, and is filled with all mercy through His
       resurrection; which I salute in the blood of Jesus Christ, who is
       our eternal and enduring joy, especially to those who are in unity
       with the bishop, and the presbyters, and the deacons, who have been
       appointed by the will of God the Father, through the Lord Jesus
       Christ, who, according to His own will, has firmly established His
       Church upon a rock, by a spiritual building, not made with hands,
       against which the winds and the floods have beaten, yet have not
       been able to overthrow it:^[19]3 yea, and may spiritual wickedness
       never be able to do so, but be thoroughly weakened by the power of
       Jesus Christ our Lord.
       Chapter I.-Praise of the Bishop.

   Which bishop,^[20]4 I know, obtained the ministry which pertains to the
   common [weal], not of himself, neither by men,^[21]5 nor through
   vainglory, but by the love of God the Father, and the Lord Jesus
   Christ; at whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by his
   silence is able to accomplish more than those who vainly talk. For he
   is in harmony with the commandments [of God], even as the harp is with
   its strings. Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy
   one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as
   well as freedom from all anger is after the example of the
   infinite^[22]6 meekness of the living God.

   Having beheld your bishop, I know that he was not selected to undertake
   the ministry which pertains to the common [weal], either by himself or
   by men,^[23]7 or out of vainglory, but by the love of Jesus Christ, and
   of God the Father, who raised Him from the dead; at whose meekness I am
   struck with admiration, and who by His silence is able to accomplish
   more than they who talk a great deal. For he is in harmony with the
   commandments and ordinances of the Lord, even as the strings are with
   the harp, and is no less blameless than was Zacharias the priest.^[24]8
   Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it
   to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom
   from all anger is after the example of the infinite meekness of the
   living God.
   Chapter II.-Maintain Union with the Bishop.

   Wherefore, as children of light and truth, flee from division and
   wicked doctrines; but where the shepherd is, there do ye as sheep
   follow. For there are many wolves that appear worthy of credit, who, by
   means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive^[25]9 those that are
   running towards God; but in your unity they shall have no place.

   Wherefore, as children of light and truth, avoid the dividing of your
   unity, and the wicked doctrine of the heretics, from whom "a defiling
   influence has gone forth into all the earth."^[26]10 But where the
   shepherd is, there do ye as sheep follow. For there are many wolves in
   sheep's clothing,^[27]11 who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry
   captive^[28]12 those that are running towards God; but in your unity
   they shall have no place.
   Chapter III.-Avoid Schismatics.

   Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not
   tend, because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have
   found any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are
   of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And as many as
   shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the
   Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according
   to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him that
   makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
   If any one walks according to a strange^[29]13 opinion, he agrees not
   with the passion [of Christ.].

   Keep yourselves, then, from those evil planes which Jesus Christ does
   not tend, but that wild beast, the destroyer of men, because they are
   not the planting of the Father, but the seed of the wicked one. Not
   that I have found any division among you do I write these things; but I
   arm you beforehand, as the children of God. For as many as are of
   Christ are also with the bishop; but as many as fall away from him, and
   embrace communion with the accursed, these shall be cut off along with
   them. For they are not Christ's husbandry, but the seed of the enemy,
   from whom may you ever be delivered by the prayers of the shepherd,
   that most faithful and gentle shepherd who presides over you. I
   therefore exhort you in the Lord to receive with all tenderness those
   that repent and return to the unity of the Church, that through your
   kindness and forbearance they may recover^[30]14 themselves out of the
   snare of the devil, and becoming worthy of Jesus Christ, may obtain
   eternal salvation in the kingdom of Christ. Brethren, be not deceived.
   If any man follows him that separates from the truth, he shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God; and if any man does not stand aloof from
   the preacher of falsehood, he shall be condemned to hell. For it is
   obligatory neither to separate from the godly, nor to associate with
   the ungodly. If any one walks according to a strange^[31]15 opinion, he
   is not of Christ, nor a partaker of His passion; but is a fox,^[32]16 a
   destroyer of the vineyard of Christ. Have no fellowship^[33]17 with
   such a man, lest ye perish along with him, even should he be thy
   father, thy son, thy brother, or a member of thy family. For says [the
   Scripture], "Thine eye shall not spare him."^[34]18 You ought therefore
   to "hate those that hate God, and to waste away [with grief] on account
   of His enemies."^[35]19 I do not mean that you should beat them or
   persecute them, as do the Gentiles "that know not the Lord and God;
   "^[36]20 but that you should regard them as your enemies, and separate
   yourselves from them, while yet you admonish them, and exhort them to
   repentance, if it may be they will hear, if it may be they will submit
   themselves. For our God is a lover of mankind, and "will have all men
   to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth."^[37]21
   Wherefore "He makes His sun to rise upon the evil and on the good, and
   sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust; "^[38]22 of whose kindness
   the Lord, wishing us also to be imitators, says, "Be ye perfect, even
   as also your Father that is in heaven is perfect."^[39]23
   Chapter IV.-Have But One Eucharist, Etc.

   Take ye heed, then, to have but one Eucharist. For there is one flesh
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup to [show forth^[40]24 ] the unity
   of His blood; one altar; as there is one bishop, along with the
   presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants: that so, whatsoever ye do,
   ye may do it according to [the will of] God.

   I have confidence of you in the Lord, that ye will be of no other mind.
   Wherefore I write boldly to your love, which is worthy of God, and
   exhort you to have but one faith, and one [kind of] preaching, and one
   Eucharist. For there is one flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ; and His
   blood which was shed for us is one; one loaf also is broken to all [the
   communicants], and one cup is distributed among them all: there is but
   one altar for the whole Church, and one bishop, with the presbytery and
   deacons, my fellow-servants. Since, also, there is but one unbegotten
   Being, God, even the Father; and one only-begotten Son, God, the Word
   and man; and one Comforter, the Spirit of truth; and also one
   preaching, and one faith, and one baptism;^[41]25 and one Church which
   the holy apostles established from one end of the earth to the other by
   the blood of Christ, and by their own sweat and toil; it behoves you
   also, therefore, as "a peculiar people, and a holy nation,"^[42]26 to
   perform all things with harmony in Christ. Wives, be ye subject to your
   husbands in the fear of God;^[43]27 and ye virgins, to Christ in
   purity, not counting marriage an abomination, but desiring that which
   is better, not for the reproach of wedlock, but for the sake of
   meditating on the law. Children, obey your parents, and have an
   affection for them, as workers together with God for your birth [into
   the world]. Servants, be subject to your masters in God, that ye may be
   the freed-men of Christ.^[44]28 Husbands, love your wives, as
   fellow-servants of God, as your own body, as the partners of your life,
   and your co-adjutors in the procreation of children. Virgins, have
   Christ alone before your eyes, and His Father in your prayers, being
   enlightened by the Spirit. May I have pleasure in your purity, as that
   of Elijah, or as of Joshua the son of Nun, as of Melchizedek, or as of
   Elisha, as of Jeremiah, or as of John the Baptist, as of the beloved
   disciple, as of Timothy, as of Titus, as of Evodius, as of Clement, who
   departed this life in [perfect] chastity,^[45]29 Not, however, that I
   blame the other blessed [saints] because they entered into the married
   state, of which I have just spoken.^[46]30 For I pray that, being found
   worthy of God, I may be found at their feet in the kingdom, as at the
   feet of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; as of Joseph, and Isaiah, and
   the rest of the prophets; as of Peter, and Paul, and the rest of the
   apostles, that were married men. For they entered into these marriages
   not for the sake of appetite, but out of regard for the propagation of
   mankind. Fathers, "bring up your children in the nurture and admonition
   of the Lord; "^[47]31 and teach them the holy Scriptures, and also
   trades, that they may not indulge in idleness. Now [the Scripture]
   says, "A righteous father educates [his children] well; his heart shall
   rejoice in a wise son."^[48]32 Masters, be gentle towards your
   servants, as holy Job has taught you;^[49]33 for there is one nature,
   and one family of mankind. For "in Christ there is neither bond nor
   free."^[50]34 Let governors be obedient to Caesar; soldiers to those
   that command them; deacons to the presbyters, as to high-priests; the
   presbyters, and deacons, and the rest of the clergy, together with all
   the people, and the soldiers, and the governors, and Caesar [himself],
   to the bishop; the bishop to Christ, even as Christ to the Father. And
   thus unity is preserved throughout. Let not the widows be wanderers
   about, nor fond of dainties, nor gadders from house to house; but let
   them be like Judith, noted for her seriousness; and like Anna, eminent
   for her sobriety. I do not ordain these things as an apostle: for "who
   am I, or what is my father's house,"^[51]35 that I should pretend to be
   equal in honour to them? But as your "fellow-soldier,"^[52]36 I hold
   the position of one who [simply] admonishes you.
   Chapter V.-Pray for Me.

   My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing
   exceedingly [over you], I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I,
   but Jesus Christ, for whose sake being bound I fear the more, inasmuch
   as I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me perfect,
   that I may attain to that portion which through mercy has been allotted
   me, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus, and to the
   apostles as to the presbytery of the Church. And let us also love the
   prophets, because they too have proclaimed the Gospel,^[53]37 and
   placed their hope in Him,^[54]38 and waited for Him; in whom also
   believing, they were saved, through union to Jesus Christ, being holy
   men, worthy of love and admiration, having had witness borne to them by
   Jesus Christ, and being reckoned along with [us] in the Gospel of the
   common hope.

   My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing
   exceedingly [over you], I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I,
   but the Lord Jesus through me; for whose sake being bound, I fear the
   more, for I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me
   perfect, that I may attain that to which I have been called, while I
   flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus Christ, and to the apostles
   as the presbytery of the Church. I do also love the prophets as those
   who announced Christ, and as being partakers of the same Spirit with
   the apostles. For as the false prophets and the false apostles drew [to
   themselves] one and the same wicked, deceitful, and seducing^[55]39
   spirit; so also did the prophets and the apostles receive from God,
   through Jesus Christ, one and the same Holy Spirit, who is good, and
   sovereign,^[56]40 and true, and the Author of [saving]
   knowledge.^[57]41 For there is one God of the Old and New Testament,
   "one Mediator between God and men," for the creation of both
   intelligent and sensitive beings, and in order to exercise a beneficial
   and suitable providence [over them]. There is also one Comforter, who
   displayed^[58]42 His power in Moses, and the prophets, and apostles.
   All the saints, therefore, were saved by Christ, hoping in Him, and
   waiting for Him; and they obtained through Him salvation, being holy
   ones, worthy of love and admiration, having testimony borne to them by
   Jesus Christ, in the Gospel of our common hope.
   Chapter VI.-Do Not Accept Judaism.

   But if any one preach the Jewish law^[59]43 unto you, listen not to
   him. For it is better to hearken to Christian doctrine from a man who
   has been circumcised, than to Judaism from one uncircumcised. But if
   either of such persons do not speak concerning Jesus Christ, they are
   in my judgment but as monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon which
   are written only the names of men. Flee therefore the wicked devices
   and snares of the prince of this world, lest at any time being
   conquered^[60]44 by his artifices,^[61]45 ye grow weak in your love.
   But be ye all joined together^[62]46 with an undivided heart. And I
   thank my God that I have a good conscience in respect to you, and that
   no one has it in his power to boast, either privately or publicly, that
   I have burdened^[63]47 any one either in much or in little. And I wish
   for all among whom I have spoken, that they may not possess that for a
   testimony against them.

   If any one preaches the one God of the law and the prophets, but denies
   Christ to be the Son of God, he is a liar, even as also is his father
   the devil,^[64]48 and is a Jew falsely so called, being possessed
   of^[65]49 mere carnal circumcision. If any one confesses Christ Jesus
   the Lord, but denies the God of the law and of the prophets, saying
   that the Father of Christ is not the Maker of heaven and earth, he has
   not continued in the truth any more than his father the devil,^[66]50
   and is a disciple of Simon Magus, not of the Holy Spirit. If any one
   says there is one God, and also confesses Christ Jesus, but thinks the
   Lord to be a mere man, and not the only-begotten^[67]51 God, and
   Wisdom, and the Word of God, and deems Him to consist merely of a soul
   and body, such an one is a serpent, that preaches deceit and error for
   the destruction of men. And such a man is poor in understanding, even
   as by name he is an Ebionite.^[68]52 If any one confesses the truths
   mentioned,^[69]53 but calls lawful wedlock, and the procreation of
   children, destruction and pollution, or deems certain kinds of food
   abominable, such an one has the apostate dragon dwelling within him. If
   any one confesses the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and
   praises the creation, but calls the incarnation merely an appearance,
   and is ashamed of the passion, such an one has denied the faith, not
   less than the Jews who killed Christ. If any one confesses these
   things, and that God the Word did dwell in a human body, being within
   it as the Word, even as the soul also is in the body, because it was
   God that inhabited it, and not a human soul, but affirms that unlawful
   unions are a good thing, and places the highest happiness^[70]54 in
   pleasure, as does the man who is falsely called a Nicolaitan, this
   person can neither be a lover of God, nor a lover of Christ, but is a
   corrupter of his own flesh, and therefore void of the Holy Spirit, and
   a stranger to Christ. All such persons are but monuments and sepulchres
   of the dead, upon which are written only the names of dead men. Flee,
   therefore, the wicked devices and snares of the spirit which now
   worketh in the children of this world,^[71]55 lest at any time being
   overcome,^[72]56 ye grow weak in your love. But be ye all joined
   together^[73]57 with an undivided heart and a willing mind, "being of
   one accord and of one judgment,"^[74]58 being always of the same
   opinion about the same things, both when you are at ease and in danger,
   both in sorrow and in joy. I thank God, through Jesus Christ, that I
   have a good conscience in respect to you, and that no one has it in his
   power to boast, either privately or publicly, that I have burdened any
   one either in much or in little. And I wish for all among whom I have
   spoken, that they may not possess that for a testimony against them.
   Chapter VII.-I Have Exhorted You to Unity.

   For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet the
   Spirit, as being from God, is not deceived. For it knows both whence it
   comes and whither it goes,^[75]59 and detects the secrets [of the
   heart]. For, when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice:
   Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. Now, some
   suspected me of having spoken thus, as knowing beforehand the division
   caused by some among you.^[76]60 But He is my witness, for whose sake I
   am in bonds, that I got no intelligence from any man.^[77]61 But the
   Spirit proclaimed these words: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your
   bodies^[78]62 as the temples of God;^[79]63 love unity; avoid
   divisions; be the followers of Jesus Christ, even as He is of His
   Father.

   For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet my
   spirit is not deceived; for I have received it from God. For it knows
   both whence it comes and whither it goes, and detects the secrets [of
   the heart]. For when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud
   voice-the word is not mine, but God's-Give heed to the bishop, and to
   the presbytery and deacons. But if ye suspect that I spake thus, as
   having learned beforehand the division caused by some among you, He is
   my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I learned nothing of it
   from the mouth of any man. But the Spirit made an announcement to me,
   saying as follows: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your
   bodies^[80]64 as the temples of God; love unity; avoid divisions; be ye
   followers of Paul, and of the rest of the apostles, even as they also
   were of Christ.
   Chapter VIII.-The Same Continued.

   I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to^[81]65 unity.
   For where there is division and wrath, God doth not dwell. To all them
   that repent, the Lord grants forgiveness, if they turn in penitence to
   the unity of God, and to communion with the bishop.^[82]66 I trust [as
   to you] in the grace of Jesus Christ, who shall free you from every
   bond. And I exhort you to do nothing out of strife, but according to
   the doctrine of Christ. When I heard some saying, If I do not find it
   in the ancient^[83]67 Scriptures, I will not believe the Gospel; on my
   saying to them, It is written, they answered me, That remains to be
   proved. But to me Jesus Christ is in the place of all that is ancient:
   His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith^[84]68 which is
   by Him, are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire,
   through your prayers, to be justified.

   I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to unity; adding
   this also, that where there is diversity of judgment, and wrath, and
   hatred, God does not dwell. To all them that repent, God grants
   forgiveness, if they with one consent return to the unity of Christ,
   and communion with the bishop.^[85]69 I trust to the grace of Jesus
   Christ, that He will free you from every bond of wickedness.^[86]70 I
   therefore exhort you that ye do nothing out of strife,^[87]71 but
   according to the doctrine of Christ. For I have heard some saying, If I
   do not find the Gospel in the archives, I will not believe it. To such
   persons I say that my archives are Jesus Christ, to disobey whom is
   manifest destruction. My authentic archives are His cross, and death,
   and resurrection, and the faith which bears on these things, by which I
   desire, through your prayers, to be justified. He who disbelieves the
   Gospel disbelieves everything along with it. For the archives ought not
   to be preferred to the Spirit.^[88]72 "It is hard to kick against the
   pricks; "^[89]73 it is hard to disbelieve Christ; it is hard to reject
   the preaching of the apostles.
   Chapter IX.-The Old Testament is Good: the New Testament is Better.

   The priests^[90]74 indeed are good, but the High Priest is better; to
   whom the holy of holies has been committed, and who alone has been
   trusted with the secrets of God. He is the door of the Father, by which
   enter in Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the
   apostles, and the Church. All these have for their object the attaining
   to the unity of God. But the Gospel possesses something transcendent
   [above the former dispensation], viz., the appearance of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, His passion and resurrection. For the beloved prophets
   announced Him,^[91]75 but the Gospel is the perfection of
   immortality.^[92]76 All these things are good together, if ye believe
   in love.

   The priests^[93]77 indeed, and the ministers of the word, are good; but
   the High Priest is better, to whom the holy of holies has been
   committed, and who alone has been entrusted with the secrets of God.
   The ministering powers of God are good. The Comforter is holy, and the
   Word is holy, the Son of the Father, by whom He made all things, and
   exercises a providence over them all. This is the Way^[94]78 which
   leads to the Father, the Rock,^[95]79 the Defence,^[96]80 the Key, the
   Shepherd,^[97]81 the Sacrifice, the Door^[98]82 of knowledge, through
   which have entered Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, Moses and all the
   company of the prophets, and these pillars of the world, the apostles,
   and the spouse of Christ, on whose account He poured out His own blood,
   as her marriage portion, that He might redeem her. All these things
   tend towards the unity of the one and only true God. But the Gospel
   possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz.
   the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, His passion, and the
   resurrection itself. For those things which the prophets announced,
   saying, "Until He come for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the
   expectation of the Gentiles,"^[99]83 have been fulfilled in the Gospel,
   [our Lord saying, ] "Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
   name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."^[100]84 All
   then are good together, the law, the prophets, the apostles, the whole
   company [of others] that have believed through them: only if we love
   one another.
   Chapter X.-Congratulate the Inhabitants of Antioch on the Close of the
       Persecution.

   Since, according to your prayers, and the compassion which ye feel in
   Christ Jesus, it is reported to me that the Church which is at Antioch
   in Syria possesses peace, it will become you, as a Church of God, to
   elect a deacon to act as the ambassador of God [for you] to [the
   brethren there], that he may rejoice along with them when they are met
   together, and glorify the name [of God]. Blessed is he in Jesus Christ,
   who shall be deemed worthy of such a ministry; and ye too shall be
   glorified. And if ye are willing, it is not beyond your power to do
   this, for the sake^[101]85 of God; as also the nearest Churches have
   sent, in some cases bishops, and in others presbyters and deacons.

   Since, according to your prayers, and the compassion which ye feel in
   Christ Jesus, it is reported to me that the Church which is at Antioch
   in Syria possesses peace, it will become you, as a Church of God, to
   elect a bishop to act as the ambassador of God [for you] to [the
   brethren] there, that it may be granted them to meet together, and to
   glorify the name of God. Blessed is he in Christ Jesus, who shall be
   deemed worthy of such a ministry; and if ye be zealous [in this
   matter], ye shall receive glory in Christ. And if ye are willing, it is
   not altogether beyond your power to do this, for the sake of^[102]86
   God; as also the nearest Churches have sent, in some cases bishops, and
   in others presbyters and deacons.
   Chapter XI.-Thanks and Salutation.

   Now, as to Philo the deacon, of Cilicia, a man of reputation, who still
   ministers to me in the word of God, along with Rheus Agathopus, an
   elect man, who has followed me from Syria, not regarding^[103]87 his
   life,-these bear witness in your behalf; and I myself give thanks to
   God for you, that ye have received them, even as the Lord you. But may
   those that dishonoured them be forgiven through the grace of Jesus
   Christ! The love of the brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I
   write to you by Burrhus, who was sent along with me by the Ephesians
   and Smyrnaeans, to show their respect.^[104]88 May the Lord Jesus
   Christ honour them, in whom they hope, in flesh, and soul, and faith,
   and love, and concord! Fare ye well in Christ Jesus, our common hope.

   Now, as to Philo the deacon, a man of Cilicia, of high reputation, who
   still ministers to me in the word of God, along with Gaius and
   Agathopus, an elect man, who has followed me from Syria, not
   regarding^[105]89 his life,-these also bear testimony in your behalf.
   And I myself give thanks to God for you, because ye have received them:
   and the Lord will also receive you. But may those that dishonoured them
   be forgiven through the grace of Jesus Christ, "who wisheth not the
   death of the sinner, but his repentance."^[106]90 ` The love of the
   brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I write to you by
   Burrhus,^[107]91 who was sent along with me by the Ephesians and
   Smyrnaeans, to show their respect:^[108]92 whom the Lord Jesus Christ
   will requite, in whom they hope, in flesh, and soul, and spirit, and
   faith, and love, and concord. Fare ye well in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   our common hope, in the Holy Ghost.
