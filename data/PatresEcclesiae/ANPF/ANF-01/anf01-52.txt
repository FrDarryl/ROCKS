              Other Fragments from the Lost Writings of Justin

                  [Translated by the Rev. A. Roberts, D.D.]

                                  --------

                                     I.

   The most admirable Justin rightly declared that the aforesaid
   demons^[24]1 resembled robbers.-Tatian's Address to the Greeks, chap.
   xviii.

                                     II.

   And Justin well said in his book against Marcion, that he would not
   have believed the Lord Himself, if He had announced any other God than
   the Fashioner and Maker [of the world], and our Nourisher. But since,
   from the one God, who both made this world and formed us and contains
   as tell as administers all things, there came to us the only-begotten
   Son, summing up His own workmanship in Himself, my faith in Him is
   stedfast, and my love towards the Father is immoveable, God bestowing
   both upon us.-Irenaeus: Heresies, iv. 6.

                                    III.

   Justin well said: Before the advent of the Lord, Satan never ventured
   to blaspheme God, inasmuch as he was not yet sure of his own damnation,
   since that was announced concerning him by the prophets only in
   parables and allegories. But after the advent of the Lord learning
   plainly from the discourses of Christ and His apostles that eternal
   fire was prepared for him who voluntarily departed from God and for all
   who, without repentance, persevere in apostasy, then, by means of a man
   of this sort, he, as if already condemned, blasphemes that God who
   inflicts judgment upon him, and imputes the sin of his apostasy to his
   Maker, instead of to his own will and predilection.-Irenaeus: Heresies,
   v. 26.

                                     IV.

   Expounding the reason of the incessant plotting of the devil against
   us, he declares: Before the advent of the Lord, the devil did not so
   plainly know the measure of his own punishment, inasmuch as the divine
   prophets had but enigmatically announced it; as, for instance, Isaiah,
   who in the person of the Assyrian tragically revealed the course to be
   followed against the devil. But when the Lord appeared, and the devil
   clearly understood that eternal fire was laid up and prepared for him
   and his angels, he then began to plot without ceasing against the
   faithful, being desirous to have many companions in his apostasy, that
   he might not by himself endure the shame of condemnation, comforting
   himself by this cold and malicious consolation.-From the writings of
   John of Antioch.

                                     V.

   And Justin of Neapolis, a man who was not far separated from the
   apostles either in age or excellence, says that that which is mortal is
   inherited, but that which is immortal inherits; and that the flesh
   indeed dies, but the kingdom of heaven lives.-From Methodius On the
   Resurrection, in Photius.

                                     VI.

   Neither is there straitness with God, nor anything that is not
   absolutely perfect.-From manuscript of the writings of Justin.

                                    VII.

   We shall not injure God by remaining ignorant of Him, but shall deprive
   ourselves of His friendship.

                                    VIII.

   The unskilfulness of the teacher proves destructive to his disciples,
   and the carelessness of the disciples entails danger on the teacher,
   and especially should they owe their negligence to his want of
   knowledge.

                                     IX.

   The soul can with difficulty be recalled to those good things from
   which it has fallen, and is with difficulty dragged away from those
   evils to which it has become accustomed. If at any time thou showest a
   disposition to blame thyself, then perhaps, through the medicine of
   repentance, I should cherish good hopes regarding thee. But when thou
   altogether despisest fear, and rejectest with scorn the very faith of
   Christ, it were better for thee that thou hadst never been born from
   the womb.-From the writings of John of Damascus.

                                     X.

   By the two birds^[25]2 Christ is denoted, both dead as man, and living
   as God. He is likened to a bird, because He is understood and declared
   to be from above, and from heaven. And the living bird, having been
   dipped in the blood of the dead one, was afterwards let go. For the
   living and divine Word was in the crucified and dead temple [of the
   body], as being a partaker of the passion, and yet impossible to God.

   By that which took place in the running^[26]3 water, in which the wood
   and the hyssop and the scarlet were dipped, is set forth the bloody
   passion of Christ on the cross for the salvation of those who are
   sprinkled with the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. Wherefore the
   material for purification was not provided chiefly with reference to
   leprosy, but with regard to the forgiveness of sins, that both leprosy
   might be understood to be an emblem of sin, and the things which were
   sacrificed an emblem of Him who was to be sacrificed for sins.

   For this reason, consequently, he ordered that the scarlet should be
   dipped at the same time in the water, thus predicting that the flesh
   should no longer possess its natural [evil] properties. For this
   reason, also, were there the two birds, the one being sacrificed in the
   water, and the other dipped both in the blood and in the water and then
   sent away, just as is narrated also respecting the goats.

   The goat that was sent away presented a type of Him who taketh away the
   sins of men. But the two contained a representation of the one economy
   of God incarnate. For He was wounded for our transgressions, and He
   bare the sins of many, and He was delivered for our iniquities.-From
   manuscript of writings of Justin.

                                     XI.

   When God formed man at the beginning, He suspended the things of nature
   on his will, and made an experiment by means of one commandment. For He
   ordained that, if he kept this, he should partake of immortal
   existence; but if he transgressed it, the contrary should be his lot.
   Man having been thus made, and immediately looking towards
   transgression, naturally became subject to corruption. Corruption then
   becoming inherent in nature, it was necessary that He who wished to
   save should be one who destroyed the efficient cause of corruption. And
   this could not otherwise be done than by the life which is according to
   nature being united to that which had received the corruption, and so
   destroying the corruption, while preserving as immortal for the future
   that which had received it. It was therefore necessary that the Word
   should become possessed of a body, that He might deliver us from the
   death of natural corruption. For if, as ye^[27]4 say, He had simply by
   a nod warded off death from us, death indeed would not have approached
   us on account of the expression of His will; but none the less would we
   again have become corruptible, inasmuch as we carried about in
   ourselves that natural corruption.-Leontius against Eutychians, etc.,
   book ii.

                                    XII.

   As it is inherent in all bodies formed by God to have a shadow, so it
   is fitting that God, who is just, should render to those who choose
   what is good, and to those who prefer what is evil, to every one
   according to his deserts.-From the writings of John of Damascus.

                                    XIII.

   He speaks not of the Gentiles in foreign lands, but concerning [the
   people] who agree with the Gentiles, according to that which is spoken
   by Jeremiah: "It is a bitter thing for thee, that thou hast forsaken
   me, saith the Lord thy God, that of old thou hast broken thy yoke, and
   torn asunder thy bands, and said, I will not serve Thee, but will go to
   every high hill, and underneath every tree, and there shall I become
   dissolute in my fornication."^[28]5 -From manuscript of the writings of
   Justin.

                                    XIV.

   Neither shall light ever be darkness as long as light exists, nor shall
   the truth of the things pertaining to us be controverted. For truth is
   that than which nothing is more powerful. Every one who might speak the
   truth, and speaks it not, shall be judged by God.-Manuscript and works
   of John of Damascus.

                                     XV.

   And the fact that it was not said of the seventh day equally with the
   other days, "And there was evening, and there was morning," is a
   distinct indication of the consummation which is to take place in it
   before it is finished, as the fathers declare, especially St. Clement,
   and Irenaeus, and Justin the martyr and philosopher, who, commenting
   with exceeding wisdom on the number six of the sixth day, affirms that
   the intelligent soul of man and his five susceptible senses were the
   six works of the sixth day. Whence also, having discoursed at length on
   the number six, he declares that all things which have been framed by
   God are divided into six classes,-viz., into things intelligent and
   immortal, such as are the angels; into things reasonable and mortal,
   such as mankind; into things sensitive and irrational, such as cattle,
   and birds, and fishes; into things that can advance, and move, and are
   insensible, such as the winds, and the clouds, and the waters, and the
   stars; into things which increase and are immoveable, such as the
   trees; and into things which are insensible and immoveable, such as the
   mountains, the earth, and such like. For all the creatures of God, in
   heaven and on earth, fall under one or other of these divisions, and
   are circumscribed by them.-From the writings of Anastasius.

                                    XVI.

   Sound doctrine does not enter into the hard and disobedient heart; but,
   as if beaten back, enters anew into itself.

                                    XVII.

   As the good of the body is health, so the good of the soul is
   knowledge, which is indeed a kind of health of soul, by which a
   likeness to God is attained.-From the writings of John of Damascus.

                                   XVIII.

   To yield and give way to our passions is the lowest slavery, even as to
   rule over them is the only liberty.

   The greatest of all good is to be free from sin, the next is to be
   justified; but he must be reckoned the most unfortunate of men, who,
   while living unrighteously, remains for a long time unpunished.

   Animals in harness cannot but be carried over a precipice by the
   inexperience and badness of their driver, even as by his skilfulness
   and excellence they will be saved.

   The end contemplated by a philosopher is likeness to God, so far as
   that is possible.-From the writings of Antonius Melissa.

                                    XIX.

   [The words] of St. Justin, philosopher and martyr, from the fifth part
   of his Apology: ^[29]6 -I reckon prosperity, O men, to consist in
   nothing else than in living according to truth. But we do not live
   properly, or according to truth, unless we understand the nature of
   things.

   It escapes them apparently, that he who has by a true faith come forth
   from error to the truth, has truly known himself, not, as they say, as
   being in a state of frenzy, but as free from the unstable and (as to
   every variety of error) changeable corruption, by the simple and ever
   identical truth.-From the writings of John of Damascus.
