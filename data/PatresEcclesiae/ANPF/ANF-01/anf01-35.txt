                  A Second Epistle of Ignatius to St. John.

                                ------------
   His friend^[5]1 Ignatius to John the holy presbyter.

   If thou wilt give me leave, I desire to go up to Jerusalem, and see the
   faithful^[6]2 saints who are there, especially Mary the mother, whom
   they report to be an object of admiration and of affection to all. For
   who would not rejoice to behold and to address her who bore the true
   God from her^[7]3 own womb, provided he is a friend of our faith and
   religion? And in like manner [I desire to see] the venerable James, who
   is surnamed Just, whom they relate to be very like Christ Jesus in
   appearance,^[8]4 in life, and in method of conduct, as if he were a
   twin-brother of the same womb. They say that, if I see him, I see also
   Jesus Himself, as to all the features and aspect of His body. Moreover,
   [I desire to see] the other saints, both male and female. Alas! why do
   I delay? Why am I kept back? Kind^[9]5 teacher, bid me hasten [to
   fulfil my wish], and fare thou well. Amen.
