                  The Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians

                         Shorter and Longer Versions

                                ------------
   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the [Church] blessed in the
       grace of God the Father, in Jesus Christ our Saviour, in whom I
       salute the Church which is at Magnesia, near the Moeander, and wish
       it abundance of happiness in God the father, and in Jesus Christ.
       Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the [Church] blessed in
       the grace of God the Father, in Jesus Christ our Saviour, in whom I
       salute the Church which is at Magnesia, near the Moeander, and wish
       it abundance of happiness in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ,
       our Lord, in whom may you have abundance of happiness.
       Chapter I.-Reason of Writing the Epistle.

   Having been informed of your godly^[21]1 love, so well-ordered, I
   rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in the faith of
   Jesus Christ. For as one who has been thought worthy of the most
   honourable of all names,^[22]2 in those bonds which I bear about, I
   commend the Churches, in which I pray for a union both of the flesh and
   spirit of Jesus Christ, the constant source of our life, and of faith
   and love, to which nothing is to be preferred, but especially of Jesus
   and the Father, in whom, if we endure all the assaults of the prince of
   this world, and escape them, we shall enjoy God.

   Having been informed of your godly^[23]3 love, so well-ordered, I
   rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in the faith of
   Jesus Christ. For as one who has been thought worthy of a divine and
   desirable name, in those bonds which I bear about, I commend the
   Churches, in which I pray for a union both of the flesh and spirit of
   Jesus Christ, "who is the Saviour of all men, but specially of them
   that believe; "^[24]4 by whose blood ye were redeemed; by whom ye have
   known God, or rather have been known by Him;^[25]5 in whom enduring, ye
   shall escape all the assaults of this world: for "He is faithful, who
   will not suffer you to be tempted above that which ye are able."^[26]6
   Chapter II.-I Rejoice in Your Messengers.

   Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your
   most worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus and
   Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio, whose
   friendship may I ever enjoy, inasmuch as he is subject to the bishop as
   to the grace of God, and to the presbytery as to the law of Jesus
   Christ, [I now write^[27]7 to you].

   Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your
   most worthy^[28]8 bishop, and through your worthy^[29]9 presbyters
   Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio,
   whose friendship may I ever enjoy,^[30]10 inasmuch as he, by the grace
   of God, is subject to the bishop and presbytery, in the law of Jesus
   Christ, [I now write^[31]11 to you].
   Chapter III.-Honour Your Youthful Bishop.

   Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on
   account of his youth,^[32]12 but to yield him all reverence, having
   respect to^[33]13 the power of God the Father, as I have known even
   holy presbyters do, not judging rashly, from the manifest youthful
   appearance^[34]14 [of their bishop], but as being themselves prudent in
   God, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of
   Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It is therefore fitting that you
   should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey [your bishop], in honour of
   Him who has wired us [so to do], since he that does not so deceives not
   [by such conduct] the bishop that is visible, but seeks to mock Him
   that is invisible. And all such conduct has reference not to
   man,^[35]15 but to God, who knows all secrets.

   Now it becomes you also not to despise the age of your bishop, but to
   yield him all reverence, according to the will of God the Father, as I
   have known even holy presbyters do, not having regard to the manifest
   youth [of their bishop], but to his knowledge in God; inasmuch as "not
   the ancient are [necessarily] wise, nor do the aged understand
   prudence; but there is a spirit in men."^[36]16 For Daniel the wise, at
   twelve years of age, became possessed of the divine Spirit, and
   convicted the elders, who in vain carried their grey hairs, of being
   false accusers, and of lusting after the beauty of another man's
   wife.^[37]17 Samuel also, when he was but a little child, reproved Eli,
   who was ninety years old, for giving honour to his sons rather than to
   God.^[38]18 In like manner, Jeremiah also received this message from
   God, "Say not, I am a child."^[39]19 Solomon too, and Josiah,
   [exemplified the same thing.] The former, being made king at twelve
   years of age, gave that terrible and difficult judgment in the case of
   the two women concerning their children.^[40]20 The latter, coming to
   the throne when eight years old^[41]21 cast down the altars and temples
   [of the idols], and burned down the groves, for they were dedicated to
   demons, and not to God. And he slew the false priests, as the
   corrupters and deceivers of men, and not the worshippers of the Deity.
   Wherefore youth is not to be despised when it is devoted to God. But he
   is to be despised who is of a wicked mind, although he be old, and full
   of wicked days.^[42]22 Timothy the Christ-bearer was young, but hear
   what his teacher writes to him: "Let no man despise thy youth, but be
   thou an example of the believers in word and in conduct."^[43]23 It is
   becoming, therefore, that ye also should be obedient to your bishop,
   and contradict him in nothing; for it is a fearful thing to contradict
   any such person. For no one does [by such conduct] deceive him that is
   visible, but does [in reality] seek to mock Him that is invisible, who,
   however, cannot be mocked by any one. And every such act has respect
   not to man, but to God. For God says to Samuel, "They have not mocked
   thee, but Me."^[44]24 And Moses declares, "For their murmuring is not
   against us, but against the Lord God."^[45]25 No one of those has, [in
   fact, ] remained unpunished, who rose up against their superiors. For
   Dathan and Abiram did not speak against the law, but against
   Moses,^[46]26 and were cast down alive into Hades. Korah also,^[47]27
   and the two hundred and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron,
   were destroyed by fire. Absalom, again,^[48]28 who had slain his
   brother, became suspended on a tree, and had his evil-designing heart
   thrust through with darts. In like manner was Abeddadan^[49]29 beheaded
   for the same reason. Uzziah,^[50]30 when he presumed to oppose the
   priests and the priesthood, was smitten with leprosy. Saul also was
   dishonoured,^[51]31 because he did not wait for Samuel the high priest.
   It behoves you, therefore, also to reverence your superiors.
   Chapter IV.-Some Wickedly Act Independently of the Bishop.

   It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in
   reality: as some indeed give one the title of bishop, but do all things
   without him. Now such persons seem to me to be not possessed of a good
   conscience, seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together according
   to the commandment.

   It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in
   reality. For it is not the being called so, but the being really so,
   that renders a man blessed. To those who indeed talk of the bishop, but
   do all things without him, will He who is the true and first Bishop,
   and the only High Priest by nature, declare, "Why call ye Me Lord, and
   do not the things which I say? "^[52]32 For such persons seem to me not
   possessed of a good conscience, but to be simply dissemblers and
   hypocrites.
   Chapter V.-Death is the Fate of All Such.

   Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are
   simultaneously set before us-death and life; and every one shall go
   unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of coins, the one of
   God, the other of the world, and each of these has its special
   character stamped upon it, [so is it also here.]^[53]33 The unbelieving
   are of this world; but the believing have, in love, the character of
   God the Father by Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in readiness to
   die into His passion,^[54]34 His life is not in us.

   Seeing, then, all things have an end, and there is set before us life
   upon our observance [of God's precepts], but death as the result of
   disobedience, and every one, according to the choice he makes, shall go
   to his own place, let us flee from death, and make choice of life. For
   I remark, that two different characters are found among men-the one
   true coin, the other spurious. The truly devout man is the right kind
   of coin, stamped by God Himself. The ungodly man, again, is false coin,
   unlawful, spurious, counterfeit, wrought not by God, but by the devil.
   I do not mean to say that there are two different human natures, but
   that there is one humanity, sometimes belonging to God, and sometimes
   to the devil. If any one is truly religious, he is a man of God; but if
   he is irreligious, he is a man of the devil, made such, not by nature,
   but by his own choice. The unbelieving bear the image of the prince of
   wickedness. The believing possess the image of their Prince, God the
   Father, and Jesus Christ, through whom, if we are not in readiness to
   die for the truth into His passion,^[55]35 His life is not in us.
   Chapter VI.-Preserve Harmony.

   Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the
   whole multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do
   all things with a divine harmony,^[56]36 while your bishop presides in
   the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly of
   the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to me, and are
   entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father
   before the beginning of time,^[57]37 and in the end was revealed. Do ye
   all then, imitating the same divine conduct,^[58]38 pay respect to one
   another, and let no one look upon his neighbour after the flesh, but do
   ye continually love each other in Jesus Christ. Let nothing exist among
   you that may divide you ; but be ye united with your bishop, and those
   that preside over you, as a type and evidence of your
   immortality.^[59]39

   Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the
   whole multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do
   all things with a divine harmony,^[60]40 while your bishop presides in
   the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly of
   the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to me, and are
   entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ. He, being begotten by the
   Father before the beginning of time,^[61]41 was God the Word, the
   only-begotten Son, and remains the same for ever; for "of His kingdom
   there shall be no end,"^[62]42 says Daniel the prophet. Let us all
   therefore love one another in harmony, and let no one look upon his
   neighbour according to the flesh, but in Christ Jesus. Let nothing
   exist among you which may divide you; but be ye united with your
   bishop, being through him subject to God in Christ.
   Chapter VII.-Do Nothing Without the Bishop and Presbyters.

   As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to
   Him, neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so neither do ye anything
   without the bishop and presbyters. Neither endeavour that anything
   appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart; but being come
   together into the same place, let there be one prayer, one
   supplication, one mind, one hope, in love and in joy undefiled. There
   is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more excellent. Do ye
   therefore all run together as into one temple of God, as to one altar,
   as to one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and
   has gone to one.

   As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, "I
   can of mine own self do nothing,"^[63]43 so do ye, neither presbyter,
   nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without the bishop. Nor let
   anything appear commendable to you which is destitute of his
   approval.^[64]44 For every such thing is sinful, and opposed [to the
   will of] God. Do ye all come together into the same place for prayer.
   Let there be one common supplication, one mind, one hope, with faith
   unblameable in Christ Jesus, than which nothing is more excellent. Do
   ye all, as one man, run together into the temple of God, as unto one
   altar, to one Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the unbegotten God.
   Chapter VIII.-Caution Against False Doctrines.

   Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are
   unprofitable. For if we still live according to the Jewish law, we
   acknowledge that we have not received grace. For the divinest prophets
   lived according to Christ Jesus. On this account also they were
   persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully convince the
   unbelieving that there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus
   Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from
   silence,^[65]45 and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.

   Be not deceived with strange doctrines, "nor give heed to fables and
   endless genealogies,"^[66]46 and things in which the Jews make their
   boast. "Old things are passed away: behold, all things have become
   new."^[67]47 For if we still live according to the Jewish law, and the
   circumcision of the flesh, we deny that we have received grace. For the
   divinest prophets lived according to Jesus Christ. On this account also
   they were persecuted, being inspired by grace to fully convince the
   unbelieving that there is one God, the Almighty, who has manifested
   Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His Word, not spoken, but
   essential. For He is not the voice of an articulate utterance, but a
   substance begotten by divine power, who has in all things pleased Him
   that sent Him.^[68]48
   Chapter IX.-Let Us Live with Christ.

   If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of
   things^[69]49 have come to the possession of a new^[70]50 hope, no
   longer observing the Sabbath, but living in the observance^[71]51 of
   the Lord's Day, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and
   by His death-whom some deny, by which mystery we have obtained
   faith,^[72]52 and therefore endure, that we may be found the disciples
   of Jesus Christ, our only Master-how shall we be able to live apart
   from Him, whose disciples the prophets themselves in the Spirit did
   wait for Him as their Teacher? And therefore He whom they rightly
   waited for, being come, raised them from the dead.^[73]53

   If, then, those who were conversant with the ancient Scriptures came to
   newness of hope, expecting the coming of Christ, as the Lord teaches us
   when He says, "If ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed Me, for
   he wrote of Me; "^[74]54 and again, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to
   see My day, and he saw it, and was glad; for before Abraham was, I am;
   "^[75]55 how shall we be able to live without Him? The prophets were
   His servants, and foresaw Him by the Spirit, and waited for Him as
   their Teacher, and expected Him as their Lord and Saviour, saying, "He
   will come and save us."^[76]56 Let us therefore no longer keep the
   Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness; for
   "he that does not work, let him not eat."^[77]57 For say the [holy]
   oracles, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread."^[78]58
   But let every one of you keep the Sabbath after a spiritual manner,
   rejoicing in meditation on the law, not in relaxation of the body,
   admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things prepared the day
   before, nor using lukewarm drinks, and walking within a prescribed
   space, nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense
   in them.^[79]59 And after the observance of the Sabbath, let every
   friend of Christ keep the Lord's Day as a festival, the
   resurrection-day, the queen and chief of all the days [of the week].
   Looking forward to this, the prophet declared, "To the end, for the
   eighth day,"^[80]60 on which our life both sprang up again, and the
   victory over death was obtained in Christ, whom the children of
   perdition, the enemies of the Saviour, deny, "whose god is their belly,
   who mind earthly things,"^[81]61 who are "lovers of pleasure, and not
   lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power
   thereof."^[82]62 These make merchandise of Christ, corrupting His word,
   and giving up Jesus to sale: they are corrupters of women, and covetous
   of other men's possessions, swallowing up wealth^[83]63 insatiably;
   from whom may ye be delivered by the mercy of God through our Lord
   Jesus Christ!
   Chapter X.-Beware of Judaizing.

   Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to
   reward us according to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore,
   having become His disciples, let us learn to live according to the
   principles of Christianity.^[84]64 For whosoever is called by any other
   name besides this, is not of God. Lay aside, therefore, the evil, the
   old, the sour leaven, and be ye changed into the new leaven, which is
   Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among you should be
   corrupted, since by your savour ye shall be convicted. It is absurd to
   profess^[85]65 Christ Jesus, and to Judaize. For Christianity did not
   embrace^[86]66 Judaism, but Judaism Christianity, that so every tongue
   which believeth might be gathered together to God.

   Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to
   reward us according to our works, we should cease to be. For "if Thou,
   Lord, shalt mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? "^[87]67 Let us
   therefore prove ourselves worthy of that name which we have received.
   For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, he is not of
   God; for he has not received the prophecy which speaks thus concerning
   us: "The people shall be called by a new name, which the Lord shall
   name them, and shall be a holy people."^[88]68 This was first fulfilled
   in Syria; for "the disciples were called Christians at Antioch,"^[89]69
   when Paul and Peter were laying the foundations of the Church. Lay
   aside, therefore, the evil, the old, the corrupt leaven,^[90]70 and be
   ye changed into the new leaven of grace. Abide in Christ, that the
   stranger^[91]71 may not have dominion over you. It is absurd to speak
   of Jesus Christ with the tongue, and to cherish in the mind a Judaism
   which has now come to an end. For where there is Christianity there
   cannot be Judaism. For Christ is one, in whom every nation that
   believes, and every tongue that confesses, is gathered unto God. And
   those that were of a stony heart have become the children of Abraham,
   the friend of God;^[92]72 and in his seed all those have been
   blessed^[93]73 who were ordained to eternal life^[94]74 in Christ.
   Chapter XI.-I Write These Things to Warn You.

   These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you
   to be in such a state;^[95]75 but, as less than any of you, I desire to
   guard you beforehand, that ye fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine,
   but that ye attain to full assurance in regard to the birth, and
   passion, and resurrection which took place in the time of the
   government of Pontius Pilate, being truly and certainly accomplished by
   Jesus Christ, who is our hope,^[96]76 from which may no one of you ever
   be turned aside.

   These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I know any of you
   to be in such a state;^[97]77 but, as less than any of you, I desire to
   guard you beforehand, that ye fall not upon the hooks of vain doctrine,
   but that you may rather attain to a full assurance in Christ, who was
   begotten by the Father before all ages, but was afterwards born of the
   Virgin Mary without any intercourse with man. He also lived a holy
   life, and healed every kind of sickness and disease among the people,
   and wrought signs and wonders for the benefit of men; and to those who
   had fallen into the error of polytheism He made known the one and only
   true God, His Father, and underwent the passion, and endured the cross
   at the hands of the Christ-killing Jews, under Pontius Pilate the
   governor and Herod the king. He also died, and rose again, and ascended
   into the heavens to Him that sent Him, and is sat down at His right
   hand, and shall come at the end of the world, with His Father's glory,
   to judge the living and the dead, and to render to every one according
   to his works.^[98]78 He who knows these things with a full assurance,
   and believes them, is happy; even as ye are now the lovers of God and
   of Christ, in the full assurance of our hope, from which may no one of
   us^[99]79 ever be turned aside!
   Chapter XII.-Ye are Superior to Me.

   May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy! For though I am
   bound, I am not worthy to be compared to any of you that are at
   liberty. I know that ye are not puffed up, for ye have Jesus Christ in
   yourselves. And all the more when I commend you, I know that ye cherish
   modesty^[100]80 of spirit; as it is written, "The righteous man is his
   own accuser."^[101]81

   May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy! For though I am
   bound, I am not worthy to be compared to one of you that are at
   liberty. I know that ye are not puffed up, for ye have Jesus in
   yourselves. And all the more when I commend you, I know that ye cherish
   modesty^[102]82 of spirit; as it is written, "The righteous man is his
   own accuser; "^[103]83 and again, "Declare thou first thine iniquities,
   that thou mayest be justified; "^[104]84 and again, "When ye shall have
   done all things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
   servants; "^[105]85 "for that which is highly esteemed among men is
   abomination in the sight of God."^[106]86 For says [the Scripture],
   "God be merciful to me a sinner."^[107]87 Therefore those great ones,
   Abraham and Job,^[108]88 styled themselves "dust and ashes^[109]89
   before God. And David says, "Who am I before Thee, 0 Lord, that Thou
   hast glorified me hitherto? "^[110]90 And Moses, who was "the meekest
   of all men,"^[111]91 saith to God, "I am of a feeble voice, and of a
   slow tongue."^[112]92 Be ye therefore also of a humble spirit, that ye
   may be exalted; for "he that abaseth himself shall be exalted, and he
   that exalteth himself shall be abased."^[113]93 ]
   Chapter XIII.-Be Established in Faith and Unity.

   Study, therefore, to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and
   the apostles, that so all things, whatsoever ye do, may prosper both in
   the flesh and spirit; in faith and love; in the Son, and in the Father,
   and in the Spirit; in the beginning and in the end; with your most
   admirable bishop, and the well-compacted spiritual crown of your
   presbytery, and the deacons who are according to God. Be ye subject to
   the bishop, and to one another, as Jesus Christ to the Father,
   according to the flesh, and the apostles to Christ, and to the Father,
   and to the Spirit; that so there may be a union both fleshly and
   spiritual.

   Study, therefore, to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and
   the apostles, that so all things, whatsoever ye do, may prosper, both
   in the flesh and spirit, in faith and love, with your most admirable
   bishop, and the well-compacted^[114]94 spiritual crown of your
   presbytery, and the deacons who are according to God. Be ye subject to
   the bishop, and to one another, as Christ to the Father. that there may
   be a unity according to God among you.
   Chapter XIV.-Your Prayers Requested.

   Knowing as I do that ye are full of God, I have but briefly exhorted
   you. Be mindful of me in your prayers, that I may attain to God; and of
   the Church which is in Syria, whence I am not worthy to derive my name:
   for I stand in need of your united prayer in God, and your love, that
   the Church which is in Syria may be "deemed worthy of being
   refreshed^[115]95 by your Church.

   Knowing as I do that ye are full of all good, I have but briefly
   exhorted you in the love of Jesus Christ. Be mindful of me in your
   prayers, that I may attain to God; and of the Church which is in Syria,
   of whom I am not worthy to be called bishop. For I stand in need of
   your united prayer in God, and of your love, that the Church which is
   in Syria may be deemed worthy, by your good order, of being
   edified^[116]96 in Christ.
   Chapter XV.-Salutations.

   The Ephesians from Smyrna (whence I also write to you), who are here
   for the glory of God, as ye also are, who have in all things refreshed
   me, salute you, along with Polycarp, the bishop of the Smyrnaeans. The
   rest of the Churches, in honour of Jesus Christ, also salute you. Fare
   ye well in the harmony of God, ye who have obtained the inseparable
   Spirit, who is Jesus Christ.

   The Ephesians from Smyrna (whence I also write to you), who are here
   for the glory of God, as ye also are, who have in all things refreshed
   me, salute you, as does also Polycarp. The rest of the Churches, in
   honour of Jesus Christ, also salute you. Fare ye well in harmony, ye
   who have obtained the inseparable Spirit, in Christ Jesus, by the will
   of God.
