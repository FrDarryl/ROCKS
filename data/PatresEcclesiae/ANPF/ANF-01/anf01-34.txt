               The Epistle of Ignatius to St. John the Apostle

                                ------------
   Ignatius, and the brethren who are with him, John the holy presbyter.

   We are deeply grieved at thy delay in strengthening us by thy addresses
   and consolations. If thy absence be prolonged, it will disappoint many
   of us. Hasten then to come, for we believe that it is expedient. There
   are also many of our women here, who are desirous to see Mary [the
   mother] of Jesus, and wish day by day to run off from us to you, that
   they may meet with her, and touch those breasts of hers which nourished
   the Lord Jesus, and may inquire of her respecting some rather secret
   matters. But Salome also, [the daughter of Anna, ] whom thou lovest,
   who stayed with her five months at Jerusalem, and some other well-known
   persons, relate that she is full of all graces and all virtues, after
   the manner of a virgin, fruitful in virtue and grace. And, as they
   report, she is cheerful in persecutions and afflictions, free from
   murmuring in the midst of penury and want, grateful to those that
   injure her, and rejoices when exposed to troubles: she sympathizes with
   the wretched and the afflicted as sharing in their afflictions, and is
   not slow to come to their assistance. Moreover, she shines forth
   gloriously as contending in the fight of faith against the pernicious
   conflicts of vicious^[5]1 principles or conduct. She is the lady of our
   new religion and repentance,^[6]2 and the handmaid among the faithful
   of all works of piety. She is indeed devoted to the humble, and she
   humbles herself more devotedly than the devoted, and is wonderfully
   magnified by all, while at the same time she suffers detraction from
   the Scribes and Pharisees. Besides these points, many relate to us
   numerous other things regarding her. We do not, however, go so far as
   to believe all in every particular; nor do we mention such to thee.
   But, as we are informed by those who are worthy of credit, there is in
   Mary the mother of Jesus an angelic purity of nature allied with the
   nature of humanity.^[7]3 And such reports as these have greatly excited
   our emotions, and urge us eagerly to desire a sight of this (if it be
   lawful so to speak) heavenly prodigy and most sacred marvel. But do
   thou in haste comply with this our desire; and fare thou well. Amen.
