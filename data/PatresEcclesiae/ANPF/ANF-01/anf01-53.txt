            Introductory Note to the Martyrdom of Justin Martyr.

                                  --------

   Crescens, a cynic, has the ill-renown of stirring up the persecution in
   which Justin and his friends suffered for Christ. The story that he
   died by the hemlock seems to have originated among the Greeks, who
   naturally gave this turn to the sufferings of a philosopher.The
   following Introductory Notice of the translator supplies all that need
   be added.

   Though nothing is known as to the date or authorship of the following
   narrative, it is generally reckoned among the most trustworthy of the
   Martyria. An absurd addition was in some copies made to it, to the
   effect that Justin died by means of hemlock. Some have thought it
   necessary, on account of this story, to conceive of two Justins, one of
   whom, the celebrated defender of the Christian faith whose writings are
   given in this volume, died through poison, while the other suffered in
   the way here described, along with several of his friends. But the
   description of Justin given in the following account, is evidently such
   as compels us to refer it to the famous apologist and martyr of the
   second century.^[5]7
