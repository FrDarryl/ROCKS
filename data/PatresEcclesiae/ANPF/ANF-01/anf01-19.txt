                    The Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans

                         Shorter and Longer Versions

                                ------------
   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which has
       obtained mercy, through the majesty of the Most High Father, and
       Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son; the Church which is beloved
       and enlightened by the will of Him that willeth all things which
       are according to the love of Jesus Christ our God, which also
       presides in the place of the report of the Romans, worthy of God,
       worthy of honour, worthy of the highest happiness, worthy of
       praise, worthy of obtaining her every desire, worthy of being
       deemed holy,^[16]1 and which presides over love, is named from
       Christ, and from the Father, which I also salute in the name of
       Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father: to those who are united, both
       according to the flesh and spirit, to every one of His
       commandments; who are filled inseparably with the grace of God, and
       are purified from every strange taint, [I wish] abundance of
       happiness unblameably, in Jesus Christ our God.
       Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which has
       obtained mercy, through the majesty of the Most High God the
       Father, and of Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son; the Church
       which is sanctified and enlightened by the will of God, who formed
       all things that are according to the faith and love of Jesus
       Christ, our God and Saviour; the Church which presides in the place
       of the region of the Romans, and which is worthy of God, worthy of
       honour, worthy of the highest happiness, worthy of praise, worthy
       of credit,^[17]2 worthy of being deemed holy,^[18]3 and which
       presides over love, is named from Christ, and from the Father, and
       is possessed of the Spirit, which I also salute in the name of
       Almighty God, and of Jesus Christ His Son: to those who are united,
       both according to the flesh and spirit, to every one of His
       commandments, who are filled inseparably with all the grace of God,
       and are purified from every strange taint, [I wish] abundance of
       happiness unblameably, in God, even the Father, and our Lord Jesus
       Christ.
       Chapter I.-As a Prisoner, I Hope to See You.

   Through prayer^[19]4 to God I have obtained the privilege of seeing
   your most worthy faces,^[20]5 and have even^[21]6 been granted more
   than I requested; for I hope as a prisoner in Christ Jesus to salute
   you, if indeed it be the will of God that I be thought worthy of
   attaining unto the end. For the beginning has been well ordered, if I
   may obtain grace to cling to^[22]7 my lot without hindrance unto the
   end. For I am afraid of your love,^[23]8 lest it should do me an
   injury. For it is easy for you to accomplish what you please; but it is
   difficult for me to attain to God, if ye spare me.

   Through prayer to God I have obtained the privilege of seeing your most
   worthy faces,^[24]9 even as I earnestly begged might be granted me; for
   as a prisoner in Christ Jesus I hope to salute you, if indeed it be the
   will [of God] that I be thought worthy of attaining unto the end. For
   the beginning has been well ordered, if I may obtain grace to cling
   to^[25]10 my lot without hindrance unto the end. For I am afraid of
   your love,^[26]11 lest it should do me an injury. For it is easy for
   you to accomplish what you please; but it is difficult for me to attain
   to God, if ye do not spare me,^[27]12 under the pretence of carnal
   affection.
   Chapter II.-Do Not Save Me from Martyrdom.

   For it is not my desire to act towards you as a man-pleaser,^[28]13 but
   as pleasing God, even as also ye please Him. For neither shall I ever
   have such [another] opportunity of attaining to God; nor will ye, if ye
   shall now be silent, ever be entitled to^[29]14 the honour of a better
   work. For if ye are silent concerning me, I shall become God's; but if
   you show your love to my flesh, I shall again have to run my race.
   Pray, then, do not seek to confer any greater favour upon me than that
   I be sacrificed to God while the altar is still prepared; that, being
   gathered together in love, ye may sing praise to the Father, through
   Christ Jesus, that God has deemed me, the bishop of Syria, worthy to be
   sent for^[30]15 from the east unto the west. It is good to set from the
   world unto God, that I may rise again to Him.

   For it is not my desire that ye should please men, but God, even as
   also ye do please Him. For neither shall I ever hereafter have such an
   opportunity of attaining to God; nor will ye, if ye shall now be
   silent, ever be entitled to^[31]16 the honour of a better work. For if
   ye are silent concerning me, I shall become God's; but if ye show your
   love to my flesh, I shall again have to run my race. Pray, then, do not
   seek to confer any greater favour upon me than that I be sacrificed to
   God, while the altar is still prepared; that, being gathered together
   in love, ye may sing praise to the Father, through Christ Jesus, that
   God has deemed me, the bishop of Syria, worthy to be sent for^[32]17
   from the east unto the west, and to become a martyr^[33]18 in behalf of
   His own precious^[34]19 sufferings, so as to pass from the world to
   God, that I may rise again unto Him.
   Chapter III.-Pray Rather that I May Attain to Martyrdom.

   Ye have never envied any one; ye have taught others. Now I desire that
   those things may be confirmed [by your conduct], which in your
   instructions ye enjoin [on others]. Only request in my behalf both
   inward and outward strength, that I may not only speak, but [truly]
   will; and that I may not merely be called a Christian, but really be
   found to be one. For if I be truly found [a Christian], I may also be
   called one, and be then deemed faithful, when I shall no longer appear
   to the world. Nothing visible is eternal.^[35]20 "For the things which
   are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are
   eternal."^[36]21 For our God, Jesus Christ, now that He is with^[37]22
   the Father, is all the more revealed [in His glory]. Christianity is
   not a thing^[38]23 of silence only, but also of [manifest] greatness.

   Ye have never envied any one; ye have taught others. Now I desire that
   those things may be confirmed [by your conduct], which in your
   instructions ye enjoin [on others]. Only request in my behalf both
   inward and outward strength, that I may not only speak, but [truly]
   will, so that I may not merely be called a Christian, but really found
   to be one. For if I be truly found [a Christian], I may also be called
   one, and be then deemed faithful, when I shall no longer appear to the
   world. Nothing visible is eternal. "For the things which are seen are
   temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.^[39]24 The
   Christian is not the result^[40]25 of persuasion, but of power.^[41]26
   When he is hated by the world, he is beloved of God. For says [the
   Scripture], "If ye were of this world, the world would love its own;
   but now ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of it:
   continue in fellowship with me."^[42]27
   Chapter IV.-Allow Me to Fall a Prey to the Wild Beasts.

   I write to the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall
   willingly die for God, unless ye hinder me. I beseech of you not to
   show an unseasonable good-will towards me. Suffer me to become food for
   the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to
   attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth
   of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ.
   Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may
   leave nothing of my body; so that when I have fallen asleep [in death],
   I may be no trouble to any one. Then shall I truly be a disciple of
   Christ, when the world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ
   for me, that by these instruments^[43]28 I may be found a sacrifice [to
   God]. I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto you. They
   were apostles; I am but a condemned man: they were free,^[44]29 while I
   am, even until now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the
   freed-man of Jesus, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now,
   being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain.

   I write to all the Churches, and impress on them all, that I shall
   willingly die for God, unless ye hinder me. I beseech of you not to
   show an unseasonable good-will towards me. Suffer me to become food for
   the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to
   attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and am ground by the teeth of the
   wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of God. Rather entice
   the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of
   my body; so that when I have fallen asleep [in death], I may not be
   found troublesome to any one. Then shall I be a true disciple of Jesus
   Christ, when the world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat the
   Lord for me, that by these instruments^[45]30 I may be found a
   sacrifice to God. I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto
   you. They were apostles of Jesus Christ, but I am the very least [of
   believers]: they were free,^[46]31 as the servants of God; while I am,
   even until now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man
   of Jesus Christ, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now,
   being in bonds for Him, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain.
   Chapter V.-I Desire to Die.

   From Syria even unto Rome I fight with beasts,^[47]32 both by land and
   sea, both by night and day, being bound to ten leopards, I mean a band
   of soldiers, who, even when they receive benefits,^[48]33 show
   themselves all the worse. But I am the more instructed by their
   injuries [to act as a disciple of Christ]; "yet am I not thereby
   justified."^[49]34 May I enjoy the wild beasts that are prepared for
   me; and I pray they may be found eager to rush upon me, which also I
   will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me as with some,
   whom, out of fear, they have not touched. But if they be unwilling to
   assail me, I will compel them to do so. Pardon me [in this]: I know
   what is for my benefit. Now I begin to be a disciple. And let no one,
   of things visible or invisible, envy^[50]35 me that I should attain to
   Jesus Christ. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts;
   let tearings,^[51]36 breakings, and dislocations of bones; let cutting
   off of members; let shatterings of the whole body; and let all the
   dreadful^[52]37 torments of the devil come upon me: only let me attain
   to Jesus Christ.

   From Syria even unto Rome I fight with beasts,^[53]38 both by land and
   sea, both by night and day, being bound to ten leopards, I mean a band
   of soldiers, who, even when they receive benefits,^[54]39 show
   themselves all the worse. But I am the more instructed by their
   injuries [to act as a disciple of Christ]; "yet am I not thereby
   justified."^[55]40 May I enjoy the wild beasts that are prepared for
   me; and I pray that they may be found eager to rush upon me, which also
   I will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me as with some,
   whom, out of fear, they have not touched. But if they be unwilling to
   assail me, I will compel them to do so. Pardon me [in this] I know what
   is for my benefit. Now I begin to be a disciple, and have^[56]41 no
   desire after anything visible or invisible, that I may attain to Jesus
   Christ. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let
   breakings, tearings, and separations of bones; let cutting off of
   members; let bruising to pieces of the whole body; and let the very
   torment of the devil come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ.
   Chapter VI.-By Death I Shall Attain True Life.

   All the pleasures of the world, and all the kingdoms of this
   earth,^[57]42 shall profit me nothing. It is better for me to die in
   behalf of^[58]43 Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends of the
   earth. "For what shall a man be profited, if he gain the whole world,
   but lose his own soul? "^[59]44 Him I seek, who died for us: Him I
   desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the gain which is laid up
   for me. Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me from living, do not wish
   to keep me in a state of death;^[60]45 and while I desire to belong to
   God, do not ye give me over to the world. Suffer me to obtain pure
   light: when I have gone thither, I shall indeed be a man of God. Permit
   me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. If any one has Him
   within himself, let him consider what I desire, and let him have
   sympathy with me, as knowing how I am straitened.

   All the ends of the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth,^[61]46
   shall profit me nothing. It is better for me to die for the sake of
   Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends of the earth. "For what
   is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?
   "I long after the Lord, the Son of the true God and Father, even Jesus
   Christ. Him I seek, who died for us and rose again. Pardon me,
   brethren: do not hinder me in attaining to life; for Jesus is the life
   of believers. Do not wish to keep me in a state of death,^[62]47 for
   life without Christ is death. While I desire to belong to God, do not
   ye give me over to the world. Suffer me to obtain pure light: when I
   have gone thither, I shall indeed be a man of God. Permit me to be an
   imitator of the passion of Christ, my God. If any one has Him within
   himself, let him consider what I desire, and let him have sympathy with
   me, as knowing how I am straitened.
   Chapter VII.-Reason of Desiring to Die.

   The prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my
   disposition towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are [in Rome]
   help him; rather be ye on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not
   speak of Jesus Christ, and yet set your desires on the world. Let not
   envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present
   with you, exhort you to it, be ye persuaded to listen to me, but rather
   give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am
   alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My love^[63]48 has
   been crucified, and there is no fire in me desiring to be fed;^[64]49
   but there is within me a water that liveth and speaketh,^[65]50 saying
   to me inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible
   food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of God, the
   heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ,
   the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham;
   and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible
   love and eternal life.

   The prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my
   disposition towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are [in Rome]
   help him; rather be ye on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not
   speak of Jesus Christ, and yet prefer this world to Him. Let not envy
   find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with
   you, exhort you to it, be ye persuaded, but rather give credit to those
   things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to
   you, yet I am eager to die for the sake of Christ. My love^[66]51 has
   been crucified, and there is no fire in me that loves anything; but
   there is living water springing up in me,^[67]52 and which says to me
   inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food,
   nor in the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of God, the
   heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ,
   the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham;
   and I desire the drink, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love
   and eternal life.
   Chapter VIII.-Be Ye Favourable to Me.

   I no longer wish to live after the manner of men, and my desire shall
   be fulfilled if ye consent. Be ye willing, then, that ye also may have
   your desires fulfilled. I entreat you in this brief letter; do ye give
   credit to me. Jesus Christ will reveal these things to you, [so that ye
   shall know] that I speak truly. He^[68]53 is the mouth altogether free
   from falsehood, by which the Father has truly spoken. Pray ye for me,
   that I may attain [the object of my desire]. I have not written to you
   according to the flesh, but according to the will of God. If I shall
   suffer, ye have wished [well] to me; but if I am rejected, ye have
   hated me.

   I no longer wish to live after the manner of men, and my desire shall
   be fulfilled if ye consent. "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I
   live; yet no longer I, since Christ liveth in me."^[69]54 I entreat you
   in this brief letter: do not refuse me; believe me that I love Jesus,
   who was delivered [to death] for my sake. "What shall I render to the
   Lord for all His benefits towards me? "^[70]55 Now God, even the
   Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, shall reveal these things to you,
   [so that ye shall know] that I speak truly. And do ye pray along with
   me, that I may attain my aim in the Holy Spirit. I have not written to
   you according to the flesh, but according to the will of God. If I
   shall suffer, ye have loved me; but if I am rejected, ye have hated me.
   Chapter IX.-Pray for the Church in Syria.

   Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its
   shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it, and your
   love [will also regard it]. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted
   one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the very last of
   them, and one born out of due time.^[71]56 But I have obtained mercy to
   be somebody, if I shall attain to God. My spirit salutes you, and the
   love of the Churches that have received me in the name of Jesus Christ,
   and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were
   not^[72]57 near to me in the way, I mean according to the flesh,^[73]58
   have gone before me,^[74]59 city by city, [to meet me.]

   Remember in your prayers the Church which is in Syria, which, instead
   of me, has now for its shepherd the Lord, who says, "I am the good
   Shepherd." And He alone will oversee it, as well as your love towards
   Him. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for I am
   not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due
   time. But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to
   God. My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches which have
   received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passerby.
   For even those Churches which were not near to me in the way, have
   brought me forward, city by city.
   Chapter X.-Conclusion.

   Now I write these things to you from Smyrna by the Ephesians, who are
   deservedly most happy. There is also with me, along with many others,
   Crocus, one dearly beloved by me.^[75]60 As to those who have gone
   before me from Syria to Rome for the glory of God, I believe that you
   are acquainted with them; to whom, [then, ] do ye make known that I am
   at hand. For they are all worthy, both of God and of you; and it is
   becoming that you should refresh them in all things. I have written
   these things unto you, on the day before the ninth of the Kalends of
   September (that^[76]61 is, on the twenty-third day of August). Fare ye
   well to the end, in the patience of Jesus Christ. Amen.

   Now I write these things to you from Smyrna by the Ephesians, who are
