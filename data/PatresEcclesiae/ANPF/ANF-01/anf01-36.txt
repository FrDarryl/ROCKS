                 The Epistle of Ignatius to the Virgin Mary

                                ------------
   Her friend^[6]1 Ignatius to the Christ-bearing Mary.

   Thou oughtest to have comforted and consoled me who am a neophyte, and
   a disciple of thy [beloved] John. For I have heard things wonderful to
   tell respecting thy [son] Jesus, and I am astonished by such a report.
   But I desire with my whole heart to obtain information concerning the
   things which I have heard from thee, who wast always intimate and
   allied with Him, and who wast acquainted with [all] His secrets. I have
   also written to thee at another time, and have asked thee concerning
   the same things. Fare thou well; and let the neophytes who are with me
   be comforted of thee, and by thee, and in thee. Amen.
   Reply of the Blessed Virgin to This Letter.
       The lowly handmaid of Christ Jesus to Ignatius, her beloved
       fellow-disciple.

   The things which thou hast heard and learned from John concerning Jesus
   are true. Believe them, cling to them, and hold fast the profession of
   that Christianity which thou hast embraced, and conform thy habits and
   life to thy profession. Now I will come in company with John to visit
   thee, and those that are with thee. Stand fast in the faith,^[7]2 and
   show thyself a man; nor let the fierceness of persecution move thee,
   but let thy spirit be strong and rejoice in God thy Saviour.^[8]3 Amen.
