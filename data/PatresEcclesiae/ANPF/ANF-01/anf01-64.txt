                Fragments from the Lost Writings of Irenaeus

                                  --------

                                     I.

   I Adjure thee, who shalt transcribe this book,^[60]1 by our Lord Jesus
   Christ, and by His glorious appearing, when He comes to judge the
   living and the dead, that thou compare what thou hast transcribed, and
   be careful to set it right according to this copy from which thou hast
   transcribed; also, that thou in like manner copy down this adjuration,
   and insert it in the transcript.

                                     II.

   These^[61]2 opinions, Florinus, that I may speak in mild terms, are not
   of sound doctrine; these opinions are not consonant to the Church, and
   involve their votaries in the utmost impiety; these opinions, even the
   heretics beyond the Church's pale have never ventured to broach; these
   opinions, those presbyters who preceded us, and who were conversant
   with the apostles, did not hand down to thee. For, while I was yet a
   boy, I saw thee in Lower Asia with Polycarp, distinguishing thyself in
   the royal court,^[62]3 and endeavouring to gain his approbation. For I
   have a more vivid recollection of what occurred at that time than of
   recent events (inasmuch as the experiences of childhood, keeping pace
   with the growth of the soul, become incorporated with it); so that I
   can even describe the place where the blessed Polycarp used to sit and
   discourse-his going out, too, and his coming in-his general mode of
   life and personal appearance, together with the discourses which he
   delivered to the people; also how he would speak of his familiar
   intercourse with John, and with the rest of those who had seen the
   Lord; and how he would call their words to remembrance. Whatsoever
   things he had heard from them respecting the Lord, both with regard to
   His miracles and His teaching, Polycarp having thus received
   [information] from the eye-witnesses of the Word of life, would recount
   them all in harmony with the Scriptures. These things, through, God's
   mercy which was upon me, I then listened to attentively, and treasured
   them up not on paper, but in my heart; and I am continually, by God's
   grace, revolving these things accurately in my mind. And I can bear
   witness before God, that if that blessed and apostolical presbyter had
   heard any such thing, he would have cried out, and stopped his ears,
   exclaiming as he was wont to do: "O good God, for what times hast Thou
   reserved me, that I should endure these things? "And he would have fled
   from the very spot where, sitting or standing, he had heard such words.
   This fact, too, can be made clear, from his Epistles which he
   despatched, whether to the neighbouring Churches to confirm them, or to
   certain of the brethren, admonishing and exhorting them.

                                    III.

   For^[63]4 the controversy is not merely as regards the day, but also as
   regards the form itself of the fast.^[64]5 For some consider themselves
   hound to fast one day, others two days, others still more, while others
   [do so during] forty: the diurnal and the nocturnal hours they measure
   out together as their [fasting] day.^[65]6 And this variety among the
   observers [of the fasts] had not its origin in our time, but long
   before in that of our predecessors, some of whom probably, being not
   very accurate in their observance of it, handed down to posterity the
   custom as it had, through simplicity or private fancy, been [introduced
   among them]. And yet nevertheless all these lived in peace one with
   another, and we also keep peace together. Thus, in fact, the difference
   [in observing] the fast establishes the harmony of [our common]
   faith.^[66]7 And the presbyters preceding Sorer in the government of
   the Church which thou dost now rule-I mean, Anicetus and Pius, Hyginus
   and Telesphorus, and Sixtus-did neither themselves observe it [after
   that fashion], nor permit those with them^[67]8 to do so.
   Notwithstanding this, those who did not keep [the feast in this way]
   were peacefully disposed towards those who came to them from other
   dioceses in which it was [so] observed (although such observance was
   [felt] in more decided contrariety [as presented] to those who did not
   fall in with it; and none were ever cast out [of the Church] for this
   matter. On the contrary, those presbyters who preceded thee, and who
   did not observe [this custom], sent the Eucharist to those of other
   dioceses who did observe it.^[68]9 And when the blessed Polycarp was
   sojourning in Rome in the time of Anicetus, although a slight
   controversy had arisen among them as to certain other points, they were
   at once well inclined towards each other [with regard to the matter in
   hand], not willing that any quarrel should arise between them upon this
   head. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp to forego the
   observance [in his own way], inasmuch as these things had been always
   [so] observed by John the disciple of our Lord, and by other apostles
   with whom he had been conversant; nor, on the other hand, could
   Polycarp succeed in persuading Anicetus to keep [the observance in his
   way], for he maintained that he was bound to adhere to the usage of the
   presbyters who preceded him. And in this state of affairs they held
   fellowship with each other; and Anicetus conceded to Polycarp in the
   Church the celebration of the Eucharist, by way of showing him respect;
   so that they parted in peace one from the other, maintaining peace with
   the whole Church, both those who did observe [this custom] and those
   who did not.^[69]10

                                     IV.

   As^[70]11 long as any one has the means of doing good to his
   neighbours, and does not do so, he shall be reckoned a stranger to the
   love of the Lord.^[71]12

                                     V.

   The^[72]13 will and the energy of God is the effective and foreseeing
   cause of every time and place and age, and of every nature. The will is
   the reason (lo/goj) of the intellectual soul, which [reason] is within
   us, inasmuch as it is the faculty belonging to it which is endowed with
   freedom of action. The will is the mind desiring [some object], and an
   appetite possessed of intelligence, yearning after that thing which is
   desired.

                                     VI.

   Since^[73]14 God is vast, and the Architect of the world, and
   omnipotent, He created things that reach to immensity both by the
   Architect of the world and by an omnipotent will, and with a new
   effect, potently and efficaciously, in order that the entire fulness of
   those things which have been produced might come into being, although
   they had no previous existence-that is, whatever does not fall under
   [our] observation, and also what lies before our eyes. And so does He
   contain all things in particular, and leads them on to their own proper
   result, on account of which they were called into being and produced,
   in no way changed into anything else than what it (the end) had
   originally been by nature. For this is the property of the working of
   God, not merely to proceed to the infinitude of the understanding, or
   even to overpass [our] powers of mind, reason and speech, time and
   place, and every age; but also to go beyond substance, and fulness or
   perfection,

                                    VII.

   This^[74]15 [custom], of not bending the knee upon Sunday, is a symbol
   of the resurrection, through which we have been set free, by the grace
   of Christ, from sins, and from death, which has been put to death under
   Him. Now this custom took its rise from apostolic times, as the blessed
   Irenaeus, the martyr and bishop of Lyons, declares in his treatise On
   Easter, in which he makes mention of Pentecost also; upon which [feast]
   we do not bend the knee, because it is of equal significance with the
   Lord's day, for the reason already alleged concerning it.

                                    VIII.

   For^[75]16 as the ark [of the covenant] was glided within and without
   with pure gold, so was also the body of Christ pure and resplendent;
   for it was adorned within by the Word, and shielded without by the
   Spirit, in order that from both [materials] the splendour of the
   natures might be clearly shown forth.

                                     IX.

   Ever^[76]17 , indeed, speaking well of the deserving, but never ill of
   the undeserving, we also shall attain to the glory and kingdom of God.

                                     X.

   It is indeed proper to God, and befitting His character, to show mercy
   and pity, and to bring salvation to His creatures, even though they be
   brought under danger of destruction. "For with Him," says the
   Scripture, "is propitiation."^[77]18

                                     XI.

   The business of the Christian is nothing else than to be ever preparing
   for death (melepa=||n a0poqne/skein).

                                    XII.

   We therefore have formed the belief that [our] bodies also do rise
   again. For although they go to corruption, yet they do not perish; for
   the earth, receiving the remains, preserves them, even like fertile
   seed mixed with more fertile ground. Again, as a bare grain is sown,
   and, germinating by the command of God its Creator, rises again,
   clothed upon and glorious, but not before it has died and suffered
   decomposition, and become mingled with the earth; so [it is seen from
   this, that] we have not entertained a vain belief in the resurrection
   of the body. But although it is dissolved at the appointed time,
   because of the primeval disobedience, it is placed, as it were, in the
   crucible of the earth, to be recast again; not then as this corruptible
   [body], but pure, and no longer subject to decay: so that to each body
   its own soul shall be restored; and when it is clothed upon with this,
   it shall not experience sorrow, but shall rejoice, continuing
   permanently in a state of purity, having for its companion a just
   consort, not an insidious one, possessing in every respect the things
   pertaining to it, it shall receive these with perfect accuracy;^[78]19
   it shall not receive bodies diverse from what they had been, nor
   delivered from suffering or disease, nor as [rendered] glorious, but as
   they departed this life, in sins or in righteous actions: and such as
   they were, such shall they be clothed with upon resuming life; and such
   as they were in unbelief, such shall they be faithfully judged.

                                    XIII.

   For^[79]20 when the Greeks, having arrested the slaves of Christian
   catechumens, then used force against them, in order to learn from them
   some secret thing [practised] among Christians, these slaves, having
   nothing to say that would meet the wishes of their tormentors, except
   that they had heard from their masters that the divine communion was
   the body and blood of Christ, and imagining that it was actually flesh
   and blood, gave their inquisitors answer to that effect. Then these
   latter, assuming such to be the case with regard to the practices of
   Christians, gave information regarding it to other Greeks, and sought
   to compel the martyrs Sanctus and Blandina to confess, under the
   influence of torture, [that the allegation was correct]. To these men
   Blandina replied very admirably in these words: "How should those
   persons endure such [accusations], who, for the sake of the practice
   [of piety], did not avail themselves even of the flesh that was
   permitted [them to eat]? "

                                    XVI.

   How^[80]21 is it possible to say that the serpent, created by God dumb
   and irrational, was endowed with reason and speech? For if it had the
   power of itself to speak, to discern, to understand, and to reply to
   what was spoken by the woman, there would have been nothing to prevent
   every serpent from doing this also. If, however, they say again that it
   was according to the divine will and dispensation that this [serpent]
   spake with a human voice to Eve, they render God the author of sin.
   Neither was it possible for the evil demon to impart speech to a
   speechless nature, and thus from that which is not to produce that
   which is; for if that were the case, he never would have ceased (with
   the view of leading men astray) from conferring with and deceiving them
   by means of serpents, and beasts, and birds. From what quarter, too,
   did it, being a beast, obtain information regarding the injunction of
   God to the man given to him alone, and in secret, not even the woman
   herself being aware of it? Why also did it not prefer to make its
   attack upon the man instead of the woman? And if thou sayest that it
   attacked her as being the weaker of the two, [I reply that], on the
   contrary, she was the stronger, since she appears to have been the
   helper of the man in the transgression of the commandment. For she did
   by herself alone resist the serpent, and it was after holding out for a
   while and making opposition that she ate of the tree, being
   circumvented by craft; whereas Adam, making no fight whatever, nor
   refusal, partook of the fruit handed to him by the woman, which is an
   indication of the utmost imbecility and effeminacy of mind. And the
   woman indeed, having been vanquished in the contest by a demon, is
   deserving of pardon; but Adam shall deserve none, for he was worsted by
   a woman,-he who, in his own person, had received the command from God.
   But the woman, having heard of the command from Adam, treated it with
   contempt, either because she deemed it unworthy of God to speak by
   means of it, or because she had her doubts, perhaps even held the
   opinion that the command was given to her by Adam of his own accord.
   The serpent found her working alone, so that he was enabled to confer
   with her apart. Observing her then either eating or not eating from the
   trees, he put before her the fruit of the [forbidden] tree. And if he
   saw her eating, it is manifest that she was partaker of a body subject
   to corruption. "For everything going in at the mouth, is cast out into
   the draught."^[81]22 If then corruptible, it is obvious that she was
   also mortal. But if mortal, then there was certainly no curse; nor was
   that a [condemnatory] sentence, when the voice of God spake to the man,
   "For earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return,"^[82]23 as the
   true course of things proceeds [now and always]. Then again, if the
   serpent observed the woman not eating, how did he induce her to eat who
   never had eaten? And who pointed out to this accursed man-slaying
   serpent that the sentence of death pronounced against them by God would
   not take [immediate] effect, when He said, "For in the day that ye eat
   thereof, ye shall surely die? "And not this merely, but that along with
   the impunity^[83]24 [attending their sin] the eyes of those should be
   opened who had not seen until then? But with the opening [of their
   eyes] referred to, they made entrance upon the path of death.

                                     XV.

   When,^[84]25 in times of old, Balaam spake these things in parables, he
   was not acknowledged; and now, when Christ has appeared and fulfilled
   them, He was not believed. Wherefore [Balaam], foreseeing this, and
   wondering at it, exclaimed, "Alas! alas! who shall live when God brings
   these things to pass? "^[85]26

                                    XVI.

   Expounding again the law to that generation which followed those who
   were shin in the wilderness, he published Deuteronomy; not as giving to
   them a different law from that which had been appointed for their
   fathers, but as recapitulating this latter, in order that they, by
   hearing what had happened to their fathers, might fear God with their
   whole heart.

                                    XVII.

   By these Christ was typified, and acknowledged, and brought into the
   world; for He was prefigured in Joseph: then from Levi and Judah He was
   descended according to the flesh, as King and Priest; and He was
   acknowledged by Simeon in the temple: through Zebulon He was believed
   in among the Gentiles, as says the prophet, "the land of Zabulon;
   "^[86]27 and through Benjamin [that is, Paul] He was glorified, by
   being preached throughout all the world.^[87]28

                                   XVIII.

   And this was not without meaning; but that by means of the number of
   the ten men,^[88]29 he (Gideon) might appear as having Jesus for a
   helper, as [is indicated] by the compact entered into with them. And
   when he did not choose to partake with them in their idol-worship, they
   threw the blame upon him: for "Jerubbaal" signifies the judgment-seat
   of Baal.

                                    XIX.

   "Take unto thee Joshua ('Ihsou=n) the son of Nun."^[89]30 For it was
   proper that Moses should lead the people out of Egypt, but that Jesus
   (Joshua) should lead them into the inheritance. Also that Moses, as was
   the case with the law, should cease to be, but that Joshua ('Insou=n),
   as the word, and no untrue type of the Word made flesh
   (e0nupostata/tou), should be a preacher to the people. Then again, [it
   was fit] that Moses should give manna as food to the fathers, but
   Joshua wheat;^[90]31 as the first-fruits of life, a type of the body of
   Christ, as also the Scripture declares that the manna of the Lord
   ceased when the people had eaten wheat from the land.^[91]32

                                     XX.

   "And^[92]33 he laid his hands upon him."^[93]34 The countenance of
   Joshua was also glorified by the imposition of the hands of Moses, but
   not to the same degree [as that of Moses]. Inasmuch, then, as he had
   obtained a certain degree of grace, [the Lord] said, "And thou shall
   confer upon him of thy glory."^[94]35 For [in this case] the thing
   given does not cease to belong to the giver.

                                    XXI.

   But he does not give, as Christ did, by means of breathing, because he
   is not the fount of the Spirit.

                                    XXII.

   "Thou shall not go with them, neither shalt thou curse the
   people."^[95]36 He does not hint at anything with regard to the people,
   for they all lay before his view, but [he refers] to the mystery of
   Christ pointed out beforehand. For as He was to be born of the fathers
   according to the flesh, the Spirit gives instructions to the man
   (Balaam) beforehand, lest, going forth in ignorance, he might pronounce
   a curse upon the people.^[96]37 Not, indeed, that [his curse] could
   take any effect contrary to the will of God; but [this was done] as an
   exhibition of the providence of God which He exercised towards them on
   account of their forefathers.

                                   XXIII.

   "And he mounted upon his ass."^[97]38 The ass was the type of the body
   of Christ, upon whom all men, resting from their labours, are borne as
   in a chariot. For the Saviour has taken up the burden of our
   sins.^[98]39 Now the angel who appeared to Balaam was the Word Himself;
   and in His hand He held a sword, to indicate the power which He had
   from above.

                                    XXIV.

   "God is not as a man."^[99]40 He thus shows that all men are indeed
   guilty of falsehood, inasmuch as they change from one thing to another
   (metafero/menoi); but such is not the case with God, for He always
   continues true, perfecting whatever He wishes.

                                    XXV.

   "To inflict vengeance from the Lord on Midian."^[100]41 For this man
   (Balaam), when he speaks no longer in the Spirit of God, but contrary
   to God's law, by setting up a different law with regard to
   fornication,^[101]42 is certainly not then to be counted as a prophet,
   but as a soothsayer. For he who did not keep to the commandment of God,
   received the just recompense of his own evil devices.^[102]43

                                    XXVI.

   Know^[103]44 thou that every man is either empty or full. For if he has
   not the Holy Spirit, he has no knowledge of the Creator; he has not
   received Jesus Christ the Life; he knows not the Father who is in
   heaven; if he does not live after the dictates of reason, after the
   heavenly law, he is not a sober-minded person, nor does he act
   uprightly: such an one is empty. If, on the other hand, he receives
   God, who says, "I will dwell with them, and walk in them, and I will be
   their God,"^[104]45 such an one is not empty, but full.

                                   XXVII.

   The little boy, therefore, who guided Samson by the hand,^[105]46
   pre-typified John the Baptist, who showed to the people the faith in
   Christ. And the house in which they were assembled signifies the world,
   in which dwell the various heathen and unbelieving nations, offering
   sacrifice to their idols. Moreover, the two pillars are the two
   covenants. The fact, then, of Samson leaning himself upon the pillars,
   [indicates] this, that the people, when instructed, recognized the
   mystery of Christ.

                                   XXVIII.

   "And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the
   place. And he cut down a tree, and cast it in there, and the iron
   floated."^[106]47 This was a sign that souls should be borne aloft
   (a0nagwgh=syuxw=n) through the instrumentality of wood, upon which He
   suffered who can lead those souls aloft that follow His ascension. This
   event was also an indication of the fact, that when the holy soul of
   Christ descended [to Hades], many souls ascended and were seen in their
   bodies.^[107]48 For just as the wood, which is the lighter body, was
   submerged in the water; but the iron, the heavier one, floated: so,
   when the Word of God became one with flesh, by a physical and
   hypostatic union, the heavy and terrestrial [part], having been
   rendered immortal, was borne up into heaven, by the divine nature,
   after the resurrection.

                                    XXIX.

   The^[108]49 Gospel according to Matthew was written to the Jews. For
   they laid particular stress upon the fact that Christ [should be] of
   the seed of David. Matthew also, who had a still greater desire [to
   establish this point], took particular pains to afford them convincing
   proof that Christ is of the seed of David; and therefore he commences
   with [an account of] His genealogy.

                                XXX.^[109]50

   "The axe unto the root,"^[110]51 he says, urging us to the knowledge of
   the truth, and purifying us by means of fear, as well as preparing [us]
   to bring forth fruit in due season.

                                    XXXI.

   Observe^[111]52 that, by means of the grain of mustard seed in the
   parable, the heavenly doctrine is denoted which is sown like seed in
   the world, as in a field, [seed] which has an inherent force, fiery and
   powerful. For the Judge of the whole world is thus proclaimed, who,
   having been hidden in the heart of the earth in a tomb for three days,
   and having become a great tree, has stretched forth His branches to the
   ends of the earth. Sprouting out from Him, the twelve apostles, having
   become fair and fruitful boughs, were made a shelter for the nations as
   for the fowls of heaven, under which boughs, all having taken refuge,
   as birds flocking to a nest, have been made partakers of that wholesome
   and celestial food which is derived from them.

                               XXXII.^[112]53

   Josephus says, that when Moses had been brought up in the royal
   palaces, he was chosen as general against the Ethiopians; and having
   proved victorious, obtained in marriage the daughter of that king,
   since indeed, out of her affection for him, she delivered the city up
   to him.^[113]54

   Why was it, that when these two (Aaron and Miriam) had both acted with
   despite towards him (Moses), the latter alone was adjudged
   punishment?^[114]55 First, because the woman was the more culpable,
   since both nature and the law place the woman in a subordinate
   condition to the man. Or perhaps it was that Aaron was to a certain
   degree excusable, in consideration of his being the eider [brother],
   and adorned with the dignity of high priest. Then again, inasmuch as
   the leper was accounted by the law unclean, while at the same time the
   origin and foundation of the priesthood lay in Aaron, [the Lord] did
   not award a similar punishment to him, lest this stigma should attach
   itself to the entire [sacerdotal] race; but by means of his sister's
   [example] He awoke his fears, and taught him the same lesson. For
   Miriam'spunishment affected him to such an extent, that no sooner did
   she experience it, than he entreated Moses], who had been injured, that
   he would be his intercession do away with the affliction. And he did
   not neglect to do so, but at once poured forth his supplication. Upon
   this the Lord, who loves mankind, made him understand how He had not
   chastened her as a judge, but as a father; for He said, "If her father
   had spit in her face, should she not be ashamed? Let her be shut out
   from the camp seven days, and after that let her come in
   again."^[115]56

                                   XXXIII.

   Inasmuch^[116]57 as certain men, impelled by what considerations I know
   not, remove from God the half of His creative power, by asserting that
   He is merely the cause of quality resident in matter, and by
   maintaining that matter itself is uncreated, come now let us put the
   question, What is at any time ... is immutable. Matter, then, is
   immutable. But if matter be immutable, and the immutable suffers no
   change in regard to quality, it does not form the substance of the
   world. For which reason it seems to them superfluous, that God has
   annexed qualities to matter, since indeed matter admits of no possible
   alteration, it being in itself an uncreated thing. But further, if
   matter be uncreated, it has been made altogether according to a certain
   quality, and this immutable, so that it cannot be receptive of more
   qualifies, nor can it be the thing of which the world is made. But if
   the word be not made from it, [this theory] entirely excludes God from
   exercising power on the creation [of the world].

                                   XXXIV.

   "And^[117]58 dipped himself," says [the Scripture], "seven times in
   Jordan."^[118]59 It was not for nothing that Naaman of old, when
   suffering from leprosy, was purified upon his being baptized, but [it
   served] as an indication to us. For as we are lepers in sin, we are
   made clean, by means of the sacred water and the invocation of the
   Lord, from our old transgressions; being spiritually regenerated as
   new-born babes, even as the Lord has declared: "Except a man be born
   again through water and the Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom
   of heaven."^[119]60

                                    XXXV.

   If the corpse of Elisha raised a dead man,^[120]61 how much more shall
   God, when He has quickened men's dead bodies, bring them up for
   judgment?

                                   XXXVI.

   True^[121]62 knowledge, then, consists in the understanding of Christ,
   which Paul terms the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery, which "the
   natural man receiveth not,"^[122]63 the doctrine of the cross; of which
   if any man "taste,"^[123]64 he will not accede to the disputations and
   quibbles of proud and puffed-up men,^[124]65 who go into matters of
   which they have no perception.^[125]66 For the truth is unsophisticated
   (a0sxhma/tistoj); and "the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy
   heart,"^[126]67 as the same apostle declares, being easy of
   comprehension to those who are obedient. For it renders us like to
   Christ, if we experience "the power of his resurrection and the
   fellowship of His sufferings."^[127]68 For this is the affinity^[128]69
   of the apostolical teaching and the most holy "faith delivered unto
   us,"^[129]70 which the unlearned receive, and those of slender
   knowledge have taught, not "giving heed to endless
   genealogies,"^[130]71 but studying rather [to observe] a
   straightforward course of life; lest, having been deprived of the
   Divine Spirit, they fail to attain to the kingdom of heaven. For truly
   the first thing is to deny one's self and to follow Christ; and those
   who do this are borne onward to perfection, having fulfilled all their
   Teacher's will, becoming sons of God by spiritual regeneration, and
   heirs of the kingdom of heaven; those who seek which first shall not be
   forsaken.

                                   XXXVII.

   Those who have become acquainted with the secondary (i.e., under
   Christ) constitutions of' the apostles,^[131]72 are aware that the Lord
   instituted a new oblation in the new covenant, according to [the
   declaration of] Malachi the prophet. For, "from the rising of the sun
   even to the setting my name has been glorified among the Gentiles, and
   in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure sacrifice;
   "^[132]73 as John also declares in the Apocalypse: "The incense is the
   prayers of the saints."^[133]74 Then again, Paul exhorts us "to present
   our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your
   reasonable service."^[134]75 And again, "Let us offer the sacrifice of
   praise, that is, the fruit of the lips."^[135]76 Now those oblations
   are not according to the law, the handwriting of which the Lord took
   away from the midst by cancelling it;^[136]77 but they are according to
   the Spirit, for we must worship God "in spirit and in truth."^[137]78
   And therefore the oblation of the Eucharist is not a carnal one, but a
   spiritual; and in this respect it is pure. For we make an oblation to
   God of the bread and the cup of blessing, giving Him thanks in that He
   has commanded the earth to bring forth these fruits for our
   nourishment. And then, when we have perfected the oblation, we invoke
   the Holy Spirit, that He may exhibit this sacrifice, both the bread the
   body of Christ, and the cup the blood of Christ, in order that the
   receivers of these antitypes^[138]79 may obtain remission of sins and
   life eternal. Those persons, then, who perform these oblations in
   remembrance of the Lord, do not fall in with Jewish views, but,
   performing the service after a spiritual manner, they shall be called
   sons of wisdom.

                                  XXXVIII.

   The^[139]80 apostles ordained, that "we should not judge any one in
   respect to meat or drink, or in regard to a feast day, or the new
   moons, or the sabbaths."^[140]81 Whence then these contentions? whence
   these schisms? We keep the feast, but in the leaven of malice and
   wickedness, cutting in pieces the Church of God; and we preserve what
   belongs to its exterior, that we may cast away these better things,
   faith and love. We have heard from the prophetic words that these
   feasts and fasts are displeasing to the Lord.^[141]82

                                   XXXIX.

   Christ,^[142]83 who was called the Son of God before the ages, was
   manifested in the fulness of time, in order that He might cleanse us
   through His blood, who were under the power of sin, presenting us as
   pure sons to His Father, if we yield ourselves obediently to the
   chastisement of the Spirit. And in the end of time He shall come to do
   away with all evil, and to reconcile all things, in order that there
   may be an end of all impurities.

                                     XL.

   "And^[143]84 he found the jaw-bone of an ass."^[144]85 It is to be
   observed that, after [Samson had committed] fornication, the holy
   Scripture no longer speaks of the things happily accomplished by him in
   connection with the formula, "The Spirit of the Lord came upon
   him."^[145]86 For thus, according to the holy apostle, the sin of
   fornication is perpetrated against the body, as involving also sin
   against the temple of God.^[146]87

                                    XLI.

   This^[147]88 indicates the persecution against the Church set on foot
   by the nations who still continue in unbelief. But he (Samson) who
   suffered those things, trusted that there would be a retaliation
   against those waging this war. But retaliation through what means?
   First of all, by his betaking himself to the Rock^[148]89 not
   cognizable to the senses;^[149]90 secondly, by the finding of the
   jaw-bone of an ass. Now the type of the jaw-bone is the body of Christ.

                                    XLII.

   Speaking always well of the worthy, but never ill of the unworthy, we
   also shall attain to the glory and kingdom of God.

                                   XLIII.

   In^[150]91 these things there was signified by prophecy that the
   people, having become transgressors, shall be bound by the chains of
   their own sins. But the breaking of the bonds of their own accord
   indicates that, upon repentance, they shall be again loosed from the
   shackles of sin.

                                    XLIV.

   It^[151]92 is not an easy thing for a soul, under the influence Of
   error, to be persuaded of the contrary opinion.

                                    XLV.

   "And^[152]93 Balsam the son of Beor they slew with the sword."^[153]94
   For, speaking no longer by the Spirit of God, but setting up another
   law of fornication contrary to the law of God,^[154]95 this man shall
   no longer be reckoned as a prophet, but as a soothsayer. For, as he did
   not continue in the commandment of God, he received the just reward of
   his evil devices.

                                    XLVI.

   "The^[155]96 god of the world; "^[156]97 that is, Satan, who was
   designated God to those who believe not.

                                   XLVII.

   The^[157]98 birth of John [the Baptist] brought the dumbness of
   Zacharias to an end. For he did not burden his father, when the voice
   issued forth from silence; but as when not believed it rendered him
   tongue-tied, so did the voice sounding out clearly set his father free,
   to whom he had both been announced and born. Now the voice and the
   burning light^[158]99 were a precursor of the Word and the Light.

                                   XLVIII.

   As^[159]100 therefore seventy tongues are indicated by number, and
   from^[160]101 dispersion the tongues are gathered into one by means of
   their interpretation; so is that ark declared a type of the body of
   Christ, which is both pure and immaculate. For^[161]102 as that ark was
   gilded with pure gold both within and without, so also is the body of
   Christ pure and resplendent, being adorned within by the Word, and
   shielded on the outside by the Spirit, in order that from both
   [materials] the splendour of the natures might be exhibited together.

                                    XLIX.

   Now^[162]103 therefore, by means of this which has been already brought
   forth a long time since, the Word has assigned an interpretation. We
   are convinced that there exist [so to speak] two men in each one of us.
   The one is confessedly a hidden thing, while the other stands apparent;
   one is corporeal, the other spiritual; although the generation of both
   may be compared to that of twins. For both are revealed to the world as
   but one, for the soul was not anterior to the body in its essence; nor,
   in regard to its formation, did the body precede the soul: but both
   these were produced at one time; and their nourishment consists in
   purity and sweetness.

                                     L.

   For^[163]104 then there shall in truth be a common joy consummated to
   all those who believe unto life, and in each individual shall be
   confirmed the mystery of the Resurrection, and the hope of
   incorruption, and the commencement of the eternal kingdom, when God
   shall have destroyed death and the devil. For that human nature and
   flesh which has risen again from the dead shall die no more; but after
   it had been changed to incorruption, and made like to spirit, when the
   heaven was opened, [our Lord] full of glory offered it (the flesh) to
   the Father.

                                     LI.

   Now,^[164]105 however, inasmuch as the books of these men may possibly
   have escaped your observation, but have come under our notice, I call
   your attention to them, that for the sake of your reputation you may
   expel these writings from among you, as bringing disgrace upon you,
   since their author boasts himself as being one of your company. For
   they constitute a stumbling-block to many, who simply and unreservedly
   receive, as coming from a presbyter, the blasphemy which they utter
   against God. Just [consider] the writer of these things, how by means
   of them he does not injure assistants [in divine service] only, who
   happen to be prepared in mind for blasphemies against God, but also
   damages those among us, since by his books he imbues their minds with
   false doctrines concerning God.

                                    LII.

   The^[165]106 sacred books acknowledge with regard to Christ, that as He
   is the Son of man, so is the same Being not a [mere] man; and as He is
   flesh, so is He also spirit, and the Word of God, and God. And as He
   was born of Mary in the last times, so did He also proceed from God as
   the First-begotten of every creature; and as He hungered, so did He
   satisfy [others]; and as He thirsted, so did He of old cause the Jews
   to drink, for the "Rock was Christ"^[166]107 Himself: thus does Jesus
   now give to His believing people power to drink spiritual waters, which
   spring up to life eternal.^[167]108 And as He was the son of David, so
   was He also the Lord of David. And as He was from Abraham, so did He
   also exist before Abraham.^[168]109 And as He was the servant of God,
   so is He the Son of God, and Lord of the universe. And as He was spit
   upon ignominiously, so also did He breathe the Holy Spirit into His
   disciples.^[169]110 And as He was saddened, so also did He give joy to
   His people. And as He was capable of being handled and touched, so
   again did He, in a non-apprehensible form, pass through the midst of
   those who sought to injure Him,^[170]111 and entered without impediment
   through closed doors.^[171]112 And as He slept, so did He also rule the
   sea, the winds, and the storms. And as He suffered, so also is He
   alive, and life-giving, and healing all our infirmity. And as He died,
   so is He also the Resurrection of the dead. He suffered shame on earth,
   while He is higher than all glory and praise in heaven; who, "though He
   was crucified through weakness, yet He liveth by divine power;
   "^[172]113 who "descended into the lower parts of the earth," and who
   "ascended up above the heavens; "^[173]114 for whom a manger sufficed,
   yet who filled all things; who was dead, yet who liveth for ever and
   ever. Amen.

                                    LIII.

   With^[174]115 regard to Christ, the law and the prophets and the
   evangelists have proclaimed that He was born of a virgin, that He
   suffered upon a beam of wood, and that He appeared from the dead; that
   He also ascended to the heavens, and was glorified by the Father, and
   is the Eternal King; that He is the perfect Intelligence, the Word of
   God, who was begotten before the light; that He was the Founder of the
   universe, along with it (light), and the Maker of man; that He is All
   in all: Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the laws; Chief Priest
   among priests; Ruler among kings; the Prophet among prophets; the Angel
   among angels; the Man among men; Son in the Father; God in God; King to
   all eternity. For it is He who sailed [in the ark] along with Noah, and
   who guided Abraham; who was bound along with Isaac, and was a Wanderer
   with Jacob; the Shepherd of those who are saved, and the Bridegroom of
   the Church; the Chief also of the cherubim, the Prince of the angelic
   powers; God of God; Son of the Father; Jesus Christ; King for ever and
   ever. Amen.

                                    LIV.

   The^[175]116 law and the prophets and evangelists have declared that
   Christ was born of a virgin, and suffered on the cross; was raised also
   from the dead, and taken up to heaven; that He was glorified, and
   reigns for ever. He is Himself termed the Perfect Intellect, the Word
   of God. He is the First-begotten,^[176]117 after a transcendent manner,
   the Creator of man; All in all; Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in
   the law; the Priest among priests; among kings Prime Leader; the
   Prophet among the prophets; the Angel among angels; the Man among men;
   Son in the Father; God in God; King to all eternity. He was sold with
   Joseph, and He guided Abraham; was bound along with Isaac, and wandered
   with Jacob; with Moses He was Leader, and, respecting the people,
   Legislator. He preached in the prophets; was incarnate of a virgin;
   born in Bethlehem; received by John, and baptized in Jordan; was
   tempted in the desert, and proved to be the Lord. He gathered the
   apostles together, and preached the kingdom of heaven; gave light to
   the blind, and raised the dead; was seen in the temple, but was not
   held by the people as worthy of credit; was arrested by the priests,
   conducted before Herod, and condemned in the presence of Pilate; He
   manifested Himself in the body, was suspended upon a beam of wood, and
   raised from the dead; shown to the apostles, and, having been carried
   up to heaven, sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and has been
   glorified by Him as the Resurrection of the dead. Moreover, He is the
   Salvation of the lost, the Light to those dwelling in darkness, and
   Redemption to those who have been born; the Shepherd of the saved, and
   the Bridegroom of the Church; the Charioteer of the cherubim, the
   Leader of the angelic host; God of God; Jesus Christ our Saviour.

                                     LV.

   "Then^[177]118 drew near unto Him the mother of Zebedee's children,
   with her sons, worshipping, and seeking a certain thing from
   Him."^[178]119 These people are certainly not void of understanding,
   nor are the words set forth in that passage of no signification: being
   stated beforehand like a preface, they have some agreement with those
   points formerly expounded.

   "Then drew near." Sometimes virtue excites our admiration, not merely
   on account of the display which is given of it, but also of the
   occasion when it was manifested. I may refer, for example, to the
   premature fruit of the grape, or of the fig, or to any fruit
   whatsoever, from which, during its process [of growth], no man expects
   maturity or full development; yet, although any one may perceive that
   it is still somewhat imperfect, he does not for that reason despise as
   useless the immature grape when plucked, but he gathers it with
   pleasure as appearing early in the season; nor does he consider whether
   the grape is possessed of perfect sweetness; nay, he at once
   experiences satisfaction from the thought that this one has appeared
   before the rest. Just in the same way does God also, when He perceives
   the faithful possessing wisdom though still imperfect, and but a small
   degree of faith, overlook their defect in this respect, and therefore
   does not reject them; nay, but on the contrary, He kindly welcomes and
   accepts them as premature fruits, and honours the mind, whatsoever it
   may be, which is stamped with virtue, although not yet perfect. He
   makes allowance for it, as being among the harbingers of the
   vintage,^[179]120 and esteems it highly, inasmuch as, being of a
   readier disposition than the rest, it has forestalled, as it were, the
   blessing to itself.

   Abraham therefore, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers, are to be esteemed
   before all, since they did indeed afford us such early examples of
   virtue. How many martyrs can be compared to Daniel? How many martyrs, I
   ask, can rival the three youths in Babylon, although the memory of the
   former has not been brought before us so conspicuously as that of the
   latter? These were truly first-fruits, and indications of the
   [succeeding] fructification. Hence God has directed their life to be
   recorded, as a model for those who should come after.

   And that their virtue was thus accepted by God, as the first-fruits of
   the produce, hear what He has Himself declared: "As a grape," He says,
   "I have found Israel in the wilderness, and as first-ripe figs your
   fathers."^[180]121 Call not therefore the faith of Abraham merely
   blessed because he believed. Do you wish to look upon Abraham with
   admiration? Then behold how that one man alone professed piety when in
   the world six hundred had been contaminated with error. Dost thou wish
   Daniel to carry thee away to amazement? Behold that [city] Babylon,
   haughty in the flower and pride of impiousness, and its inhabitants
   completely given over to sin of every description. But he, emerging
   from the depth, spat out the brine of sins, and rejoiced to plunge into
   the sweet waters of piety. And now, in like manner, with regard to that
   mother of Zebedee's children, do not admire merely what she said, but
   also the time at which she uttered these words. For when was it that
   she drew near to the Redeemer? Not after the resurrection, nor after
   the preaching of His name, nor after the establishment of His kingdom;
   but it was when the Lord said, "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the
   Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and
   they shall kill Him, and on the third day He shall rise again."

   These things the Saviour told in reference to His sufferings and cross;
   to these persons He predicted His passion. Nor did He conceal the fact
   that it should be of a most ignominious kind, at the hands of the chief
   priests. This woman, however, had attached another meaning to the
   dispensation of His sufferings. The Saviour was foretelling death; and
   she asked for the glory of immortality. The Lord was asserting that He
   must stand arraigned before impious judges; but she, taking no note of
   that judgment, requested as of the judge: "Grant," she said, "that
   these my two sons may sit, one on the right hand, and the other on the
   left, in Thy glory." In the one case the passion is referred to, in the
   other the kingdom is understood. The Saviour was speaking of the cross,
   while she had in view the glory which admits no suffering. This woman,
   therefore, as I have already said, is worthy of our admiration, not
   merely for what she sought, but also for the occasion of her making the
   request.

   She did indeed suffer, not merely as a pious person, but also as a
   woman. For, having been instructed by His words, she considered and
   believed that it would come to pass, that the kingdom of Christ should
   flourish in glory, and walk in its vastness throughout the world, and
   be increased by the preaching of piety. She understood, as was [in
   fact] the case, that He who appeared in a lowly guise had delivered and
   received every promise. I will inquire upon another occasion, when I
   come to treat upon this humility, whether the Lord rejected her
   petition concerning His kingdom. But she thought that the same
   confidence would not be possessed by her, when, at the appearance of
   the angels, He should be ministered to by the angels, and receive
   service from the entire heavenly host. Taking the Saviour, therefore,
   apart in a retired place, she earnestly desired of Him those things
   which transcend every human nature.
