      Introductory Note to the Syriac Version of the Ignatian Epistles.

                                  --------

   When the Syriac version of the Ignatian Epistles was introduced to the
   English world in 1845, by Mr. Cureton, the greatest satisfaction was
   expressed by many, who thought the inveterate controversy about to be
   settled. Lord Russell made the learned divine a canon of Westminster
   Abbey, and the critical Chevalier Bunsen^[5]68 committed himself as its
   patron. To the credit of the learned, in general, the work was
   gratefully received, and studied with scientific conscientiousness by
   Lightfoot and others. The literature of this period is valuable; and
   the result is decisive as to the Curetonian versions at least, which
   are fragmentary and abridged, and yet they are a valuable contribution
   to the study of the whole case.

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:-

   Some account of the discovery of the Syriac version of the Ignatian
   Epistles has been already given. We have simply to add here a brief
   description of the mss. from which the Syriac text has been printed.
   That which is named a by Cureton, contains only the Epistle to
   Polycarp, and exhibits the text of that Epistle which, after him, we
   have followed. He fixes its age somewhere in the first half of the
   sixth century, or before the year 550. The second ms., which Cureton
   refers to as b, is assigned by him to the seventh or eighth century. It
   contains the three Epistles of Ignatius, and furnishes the text here
   followed in the Epistles to the Ephesians and Romans. The third ms.,
   which Cureton quotes as g, has no date, but, as he tells us, "belonged
   to the collection acquired by Moses of Nisibis in a.d. 931, and was
   written apparently about three or four centuries earlier." It contains
   the three Epistles to Polycarp, the Ephesians, and the Romans. The text
   of all these mss. is in several passages manifestly corrupt, and the
   translators appear at times to have mistaken the meaning of the Greek
   original.

   [N.B.-Bunsen is forced to allow the fact that the discovery of the lost
   work of Hippolytus "throws new light on an obscure point of the
   Ignatian controversy," i.e., the Sige in the Epistle to the Magnesians
   (cap. viii.); but his treatment of the matter is unworthy of a candid
   scholar.]
