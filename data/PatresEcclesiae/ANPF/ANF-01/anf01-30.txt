            The Epistle of Ignatius to Hero, a Deacon of Antioch

                                ------------

   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to Hero, the deacon of Christ,
   and the servant of God, a man honoured by God, and most dearly loved as
   well as esteemed, who carries Christ and the Spirit within him, and who
   is mine own son in faith and love: Grace, mercy, and peace from
   Almighty God, and from Christ Jesus our Lord, His only-begotten Son,
   "who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from the
   present evil world,"^[14]1 and preserve us unto His heavenly kingdom.
   Chapter I.-Exhortations to Earnestness and Moderation.

   I Exhort thee in God, that thou add [speed] to thy course, and that
   thou vindicate thy dignity. Have a care to preserve concord with the
   saints. Bear [the burdens of] the weak, that "thou mayest fulfil the
   law of Christ."^[15]2 Devote^[16]3 thyself to fasting and prayer, but
   not beyond measure, lest thou destroy thyself^[17]4 thereby. Do not
   altogether abstain from wine and flesh, for these things are not to be
   viewed with abhorrence, since [the Scripture] saith, "Ye shall eat the
   good things of the earth."^[18]5 And again, "Ye shall eat flesh even as
   herbs."^[19]6 And again, "Wine maketh glad the heart of man, and oil
   exhilarates, and bread strengthens him."^[20]7 But all are to be used
   with moderation, as being the gifts of God. "For who shall eat or who
   shall drink without Him? For if anything be beautiful, it is His; and
   if anything be good, it is His."^[21]8 Give attention to reading,^[22]9
   that thou mayest not only thyself know the laws, but mayest also
   explain them to others, as the earnest servant^[23]10 of God. "No man
   that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he
   may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier; and if a man also
   strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned except he strive
   lawfully."^[24]11 I that am in bonds pray that my soul may be in place
   of yours.
   Chapter II.-Cautions Against False Teachers.

   Every one that teaches anything beyond what is commanded, though he be
   [deemed] worthy of credit, though he be in the habit of fasting, though
   he live in continence, though he work miracles, though he have the gift
   of prophecy, let him be in thy sight as a wolf in sheep's
   clothing,^[25]12 labouring for the destruction of the sheep. If any one
   denies the cross, and is ashamed of the passion, let him be to thee as
   the adversary himself. "Though he gives all his goods to feed the poor,
   though he remove mountains, though he give his body to be
   burned,"^[26]13 let him be regarded by thee as abominable. If any one
   makes light of the law or the prophets, which Christ fulfilled at His
   coming, let him be to thee as antichrist. If any one says that the Lord
   is a mere man, he is a Jew, a murderer of Christ.
   Chapter III.-Exhortations as to Ecclesiastical Duties.

   "Honour widows that are widows indeed."^[27]14 Be the friend of
   orphans; for God is "the Father of the fatherless, and the Judge of the
   widows."^[28]15 Do nothing without the bishops; for they are priests,
   and thou a servant of the priests. They baptize, offer
   sacrifice,^[29]16 ordain, and lay on hands; but thou ministerest to
   them, as the holy Stephen did at Jerusalem to James and the presbyters.
   Do not neglect the sacred meetings^[30]17 [of the saints]; inquire
   after every one by name. "Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an
   example to the believers, both in word and conduct."^[31]18
   Chapter IV.-Servants and Women are Not to Be Despised.

   Be not ashamed of servants, for we possess the same nature in common
   with them. Do not hold women in abomination, for they have given thee
   birth, and brought thee up. It is fitting, therefore, to love those
   that were the authors of our birth (but only in the Lord), inasmuch as
   a man can produce no children without a woman. It is right, therefore,
   that we should honour those who have had a part in giving us birth.
   "Neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the
   man,"^[32]19 except in the case of those who were first formed. For the
   body of Adam was made out of the four elements, and that of Eve out of
   the side of Adam. And, indeed, the altogether peculiar birth of the
   Lord was of a virgin alone. [This took place] not as if the lawful
   union [of man and wife] were abominable, but such a kind of birth was
   fitting to God. For it became the Creator not to make use of the
   ordinary method of generation, but of one that was singular and
   strange, as being the Creator.
   Chapter V.-Various Relative Duties.

   Flee from haughtiness, "for the Lord resisteth the proud."^[33]20 Abhor
   falsehood, for says [the Scripture], "Thou shalt destroy all them that
   speak lies."^[34]21 Guard against envy, for its author is the devil,
   and his successor Cain, who envied his brother, and out of envy
   committed murder. Exhort my sisters to love God, and be content with
   their own husbands only. In like manner, exhort my brethren also to be
   content with their own wives. Watch over the virgins, as the precious
   treasures of Christ. Be long-suffering,^[35]22 that thou mayest be
   great in wisdom. Do not neglect the poor, in so far as thou art
   prosperous. For "by alms and fidelity sins are purged away."^[36]23
   Chapter VI-Exhortations to Purity and Caution.

   Keep thyself pure as the habitation of God. Thou art the temple of
   Christ. Thou art the instrument of the Spirit. Thou knowest in what way
   I have brought thee up. Though I am the least of men, do thou seek to
   follow me, be thou an imitator of my conduct. I do not glory in the
   world, but in the Lord. I exhort Hero, my son; "but let him that
   glorieth, glory in the Lord."^[37]24 May I have joy of thee, my dear
   son, whose guardian may He be who is the only unbegotten God, and the
   Lord Jesus Christ! Do not believe all persons, do not place confidence
   in all; nor let any man get the better of thee by flattery. For many
   are the ministers of Satan; and "he that is hasty to believe is light
   of heart."^[38]25
   Chapter VII.-Solemn Charge to Hero, as Future Bishop of Antioch.

   Keep God in remembrance, and thou shalt never sin. Be not
   double-minded^[39]26 in thy prayers; for blessed is he who doubteth
   not. For I believe in the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in His
   only-begotten Son, that God will show me, Hero, upon my throne. Add
   speed, therefore,^[40]27 to thy course. I charge thee before the God of
   the universe, and before Christ, and in the presence of the Holy
   Spirit, and of the ministering ranks [of angels], keep in safety that
   deposit which I and Christ have committed to thee, and do not judge
   thyself unworthy of those things which have been shown by God [to me]
   concerning thee. I hand over to thee the Church of Antioch. I have
   commended you to Polycarp in the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Chapter VIII.-Salutations.

   The bishops, Onesimus, Bitus, Damas, Polybius, and all they of Philippi
   (whence also I have written to thee), salute thee in Christ. Salute the
   presbytery worthy of God: salute my holy fellow-deacons, of whom may I
   have joy in Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit. Salute the
   people of the Lord, from the smallest to the greatest, every one by
   name; whom I commit to thee as Moses did [the Israelites] to Joshua,
   who was their leader after him. And do not reckon this which I have
   said presumptuous on my part; for although we are not such as they
   were, yet we at least pray that we may be so, since indeed we are the
   children of Abraham. Be strong, therefore, O Hero, like a hero, and
   like a man. For from henceforth thou shalt lead^[41]28 in and out the
   people of the Lord that are in Antioch, and so "the congregation of the
   Lord shall not be as sheep which have no shepherd."^[42]29
   Chapter IX.-Concluding Salutations and Instructions.

   Salute Cassian, my host, and his most serious-minded partner in life,
   and their very dear children, to whom may "God grant that they find
   mercy of the Lord in that day,"^[43]30 on account of their
   ministrations to us, whom also I commend to thee in Christ. Salute by
   name all the faithful in Christ that are at Laodicea. Do not neglect
   those at Tarsus, but look after them steadily, confirming them in the
   Gospel. I salute in the Lord, Maris the bishop of Neapolis, near
   Anazarbus. Salute thou also Mary my daughter, distinguished both for
   gravity and erudition, as also "the Church which is in her
   house."^[44]31 May my soul be in place of hers: she is the very pattern
   of pious women. May the Father of Christ, by His only-begotten Son,
   preserve thee in good health, and of high repute in all things, to a
   very old age, for the benefit of the Church of God! Farewell in the
   Lord, and pray thou that I may be perfected.
