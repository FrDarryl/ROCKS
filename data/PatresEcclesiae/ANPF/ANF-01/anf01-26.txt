              The Third Epistle of the Same St. Ignatius^[13]1

                                ------------

   Ignatius, who is [also called] Theophorus, to the Church which has
   received grace through the greatness of the Father Most High; to her
   who presideth in the place of the region of the Romans, who is worthy
   of God, and worthy of life, and happiness, and praise, and remembrance,
   and is worthy of prosperity, and presideth in love, and is perfected in
   the law of Christ unblameable: [wishes] abundance of peace.
   Chapter I.

   From of old have I prayed to God, that I might be counted worthy to
   behold your faces which are worthy of God: now, therefore, being bound
   in Jesus Christ, I hope to meet you and salute you, if it be the will
   [of God] that I should be accounted worthy to the end. For the
   beginning is well arranged, if I be counted worthy to attain to the
   end, that I may receive my portion, without hindrance, through
   suffering. For I am in fear of your love, lest it should injure me. As
   to you, indeed, it is easy for you to do whatsoever ye wish; but as to
   me, it is difficult for me to be accounted worthy of God, if indeed ye
   spare me not.
   Chapter II.

   For there is no other time such as this, that I should be accounted
   worthy of God; neither will ye, if ye be silent, [ever] be found in a
   better work than this. If ye let me alone, I shall be the word of God;
   but if ye love my flesh, again am I [only] to myself a voice. Ye cannot
   give me anything more precious than this, that I should be sacrificed
   to God, while the altar is ready; that ye may be in one concord in
   love, and may praise God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord,
   because He has deemed a bishop worthy to be God's, having called him
   from the east to the west. It is good that I should set from the world
   in God, that I may rise in Him to life.^[14]2
   Chapter III.

   Ye have never envied any man. Ye have taught others. Only pray ye for
   strength to be given to me from within and from without, that I may not
   only speak, but also may be willing, and that I may not merely be
   called a Christian, but also may be found to be [one]; for if I am
   found to be [so], I may then also be called [so]. Then [indeed] shall I
   be faithful, when I am no longer seen in the world. For there is
   nothing visible that is good. The work is not [a matter^[15]3 ] of
   persuasion; but Christianity is great when the world hateth it.
   Chapter IV.

   I write to all the Churches, and declare to all men, that I willingly
   die for the sake of God, if so be that ye hinder me not. I entreat of
   you not to be [affected] towards me with a love which is unseasonable.
   Leave me to become [the prey of] the beasts, that by their means I may
   be accounted worthy of God. I am the wheat of God, and by the teeth of
   the beasts I shall be ground,^[16]4 that I may be found the pure bread
   of God. Provoke ye greatly^[17]5 the wild beasts, that they may be for
   me a grave, and may leave nothing of my body, in order that, when I
   have fallen asleep, I may not be a burden upon any one. Then shall I be
   in truth a disciple of Jesus Christ, when the world seeth not even my
   body. Entreat of our Lord in my behalf, that through these instruments
   I may be found a sacrifice to God. I do not, like Peter and Paul, issue
   orders unto you. They are^[18]6 apostles, but I am one condemned; they
   indeed are free, but I am a slave, even until now. But if I suffer, I
   shall be the freed-man of Jesus Christ, and I shall rise in Him from
   the dead, free. And now being in bonds, I learn to desire nothing.
   Chapter V.

   From Syria, and even unto Rome, I am cast among wild beasts, by sea and
   by land, by night and by day, being bound between ten leopards, which
   are the band of soldiers, who, even when I do good to them, all the
   more do evil unto me. I, however, am the rather instructed by their
   injurious treatment;^[19]7 but not on this account am I justified to
   myself. I rejoice in the beasts which are prepared for me, and I pray
   that they may in haste be found for me; and I will provoke them
   speedily to devour me, and not be as those which are afraid of some
   other men,^[20]8 and will not approach them: even should they not be
   willing to approach me, I will go with violence against them. Know me
   from myself what is expedient for me.9^[21]9 Let no one^[22]10 envy me
   of those things which are seen and which are not seen, that I should be
   accounted worthy of Jesus Christ. Fire, and the cross, and the beasts
   that are prepared, cutting off of the limbs, and scattering of the
   hones, and crushing of the whole body, harsh torments of the devil-let
   these come upon me, but^[23]11 only let me be accounted worthy of Jesus
   Christ.
   Chapter VI.

   The pains of the birth stand over against me.^[24]12
   Chapter VII.

   And my love is crucified, and there is no fire in me for another love.
   I do not desire the food of corruption, neither the lusts of this
   world. I seek the bread of God, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ; and
   I seek His blood, a drink which is love incorruptible.
   Chapter IX.^[25]13

   My spirit saluteth you, and the love of the Churches which received me
   as the name of Jesus Christ; for those also who were near to [my] way
   in the flesh, preceded me in every city.

   ^[26]14 [Now therefore, being about to arrive shortly in Rome, I know
   many things in God; but I keep myself within measure, that I may not
   perish through boasting: for now it is needful for me to fear the more,
   and not pay regard to those who puff me up. For they who say such
   things to me scourge me; for I desire to suffer, but I do not know if I
   am worthy. For zeal is not visible to many, but with me it has war. I
   have need, therefore, of meekness, by which the prince of this world is
   destroyed. I am able to write to you of heavenly things, but I fear
   lest I should do you an injury. Know me from myself. For I am cautious
   lest ye should not be able to receive [such knowledge], and should be
   perplexed. For even I, not because I am in bonds, and am able to know
   heavenly things, and the places of angels, and the stations of the
   powers that are seen and that are not seen, am on this account a
   disciple; for I am far short of the perfection which is worthy of God.]
   Be ye perfectly strong^[27]15 in the patience of Jesus Christ our God.

   Here end the three Epistles of Ignatius, bishop and martyr.
