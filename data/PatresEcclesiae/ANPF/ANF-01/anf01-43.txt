                             Fragments of Papias

                                     I.
   From the Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord.^[16]1

   [The writings of Papias in common circulation are five in number, and
   these are called an Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord. Irenaeus
   makes mention of these as the only works written by him, in the
   following words: "Now testimony is borne to these things in writing by
   Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John, and a friend of
   Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books were composed by
   him." Thus wrote Irenaeus. Moreover, Papias himself, in the
   introduction to his books, makes it manifest that he was not himself a
   hearer and eye-witness of the holy apostles; but he tells us that he
   received the truths of our religion^[17]2 from those who were
   acquainted with them [the apostles] in the following words: ]

   But I shall not be unwilling to put down, along with my
   interpretations,^[18]3 whatsoever instructions I received with care at
   any time from the elders, and stored up with care in my memory,
   assuring you at the same time of their truth. For I did not, like the
   multitude, take pleasure in those who spoke much, but in those who
   taught the truth; nor in those who related strange commandments,^[19]4
   but in those who rehearsed the commandments given by the Lord to
   faith,^[20]5 and proceeding from truth itself. If, then, any one who
   had attended on the elders came, I asked minutely after their
   sayings,-what Andrew or Peter said, or what was said by Philip, or by
   Thomas, or by James, or by John, or by Matthew, or by any other of the
   Lord's disciples: which things^[21]6 Aristion and the presbyter John,
   the disciples of the Lord, say. For I imagined that what was to be got
   from books was not so profitable to me as what came from the living and
   abiding voice.

                                  II.^[22]7

   [The early Christians] called those who practised a godly
   guilelessness,^[23]8 children, [as is stated by Papias in the first
   book of the Lord's Expositions, and by Clemens Alexandrinus in his
   Paedagogue.]

                                 III.^[24]9

   Judas walked about in this world a sad^[25]10 example of impiety; for
   his body having swollen to such an extent that he could not pass where
   a chariot could pass easily, he was crushed by the chariot, so that his
   bowels gushed out.^[26]11

                                 IV.^[27]12

   [As the elders who saw John the disciple of the Lord remembered that
   they had heard from him how the Lord taught in regard to those times,
   and said]: "The days will come in which vines shall grow, having each
   ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in
   each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in every one of the shoots ten
   thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand
   grapes, and every grape when pressed will give five-and-twenty metretes
   of wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster,
   another shall cry out, `I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord
   through me.' In like manner, [He said] that a grain of wheat would
   produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear would have ten thousand
   grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds of clear, pure, fine
   flour; and that apples, and seeds, and grass would produce in similar
   proportions; and that all animals, feeding then only on the productions
   of the earth, would become peaceable and harmonious, and be in perfect
   subjection to man."^[28]13 [Testimony is borne to these things in
   writing by Papias, an ancient man, who was a hearer of John and a
   friend of Polycarp, in the fourth of his books; for five books were
   composed by him. And he added, saying, "Now these things are credible
   to believers. And Judas the traitor," says he, "not believing, and
   asking, `How shall such growths be accomplished by the Lord? 'the Lord
   said, `They shall see who shall come to them.' These, then, are the
   times mentioned by the prophet Isaiah: `And the wolf shall lie, down
   with the lamb, 'etc. (Isa. xi. 6 ff.)."]

                                  V.^[29]14

   As the presbyters say, then^[30]15 those who are deemed worthy of an
   abode in heaven shall go there, others shall enjoy the delights of
   Paradise, and others shall possess the splendour of the city;^[31]16
   for everywhere the Saviour will be seen, according as they shall be
   worthy who see Him. But that there is this distinction between the
   habitation of those who produce an hundred-fold, and that of those who
   produce sixty-fold, and that of those who produce thirty-fold; for the
   first will be taken up into the heavens, the second class will dwell in
   Paradise, and the last will inhabit the city; and that on this account
   the Lord said, "In my Father's house are many mansions: "^[32]17 for
   all things belong to God, who supplies all with a suitable
   dwelling-place, even as His word says, that a share is given to all by
   the Father,^[33]18 according as each one is or shall be worthy. And
   this is the couch^[34]19 in which they shall recline who feast, being
   invited to the wedding. The presbyters, the disciples of the apostles,
   say that this is the gradation and arrangement of those who are saved,
   and that they advance through steps of this nature; and that, moreover,
   they ascend through the Spirit to the Son, and through the Son to the
   Father; and that in due time the Son will yield up His work to the
   Father, even as it is said by the apostle, "For He must reign till He
   hath put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be
   destroyed is death."^[35]20 For in the times of the kingdom the just
   man who is on the earth shall forget to die. "But when He saith all
   things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is excepted which did
   put all things under Him. And when all things shall be subdued unto
   Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all
   things under Him, that God may be all in all."^[36]21

                                 VI.^[37]22

   [Papias, who is now mentioned by us, affirms that he received the
   sayings of the apostles from those who accompanied them, and he
   moreover asserts that he heard in person Aristion and the presbyter
   John.^[38]23 Accordingly he mentions them frequently by name, and in
   his writings gives their traditions. Our notice of these circumstances
   may not be without its use. It may also be worth while to add to the
   statements of Papias already given, other passages of his in which he
   relates some miraculous deeds, stating that he acquired the knowledge
   of them from tradition. The residence of the Apostle Philip with his
   daughters in Hierapolis has been mentioned above. We must now point out
   how Papias, who lived at the same time, relates that he had received a
   wonderful narrative from the daughters of Philip. For he relates that a
   dead man was raised to life in his day.^[39]24 He also mentions another
   miracle relating to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a
   deadly poison, and received no harm, on account of the grace of the
   Lord. The same person, moreover, has set down other things as coming to
   him from unwritten tradition, amongst these some strange parables and
   instructions of the Saviour, and some other things of a more fabulous
   nature.^[40]25 Amongst these he says that there will be a millennium
   after the resurrection from the dead, when the personal reign of Christ
   will be established on this earth. He moreover hands down, in his own
   writing, other narratives given by the previously mentioned Aristion of
   the Lord's sayings, and the traditions of the presbyter John. For
   information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the
   books themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add,
   as being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who
   wrote the Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words]:
   And the presbyter said this. Mark having become the interpreter of
   Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not,
   however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ.
   For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I
   said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the
   necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular
   narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus
   writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took
   especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put
   anything fictitious into the statements. [This is what is related by
   Papias regarding Mark; but with regard to Matthew he has made the
   following statements]: Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord]
   in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.
   [The same person uses proofs from the First Epistle of John, and from
   the Epistle of Peter in like manner. And he also gives another story of
   a woman^[41]26 who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which is
   to be found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews.]

                                 VII.^[42]27

   Papias thus speaks, word for word: To some of them [angels] He gave
   dominion over the arrangement of the world, and He commissioned them to
   exercise their dominion well. And he says, immediately after this: but
   it happened that their arrangement came to nothing.^[43]28

                                VIII.^[44]29

   With regard to the inspiration of the book (Revelation), we deem it
   superfluous to add another word; for the blessed Gregory Theologus and
   Cyril, and even men of still older date, Papias, Irenaeus, Methodius,
   and Hippolytus, bore entirely satisfactory testimony to it.

                                 IX.^[45]30

   Taking occasion from Papias of Hierapolis, the illustrious, a disciple
   of the apostle who leaned on the bosom of Christ, and Clemens, and
   Pantaenus the priest of [the Church] of the Alexandrians, and the wise
   Ammonius, the ancient and first expositors, who agreed with each other,
   who understood the work of the six days as referring to Christ and the
   whole Church.

                                  X.^[46]31

   (1.) Mary the mother of the Lord; (2.) Mary the wife of Cleophas or
   Alphaeus, who was the mother of James the bishop and apostle, and of
   Simon and Thaddeus, and of one Joseph; (3.) Mary Salome, wife of
   Zebedee, mother of John the evangelist and James; (4.) Mary Magdalene.
   These four are found in the Gospel. James and Judas and Joseph were
   sons of an aunt (2) of the Lord's. James also and John were sons of
   another aunt (3) of the Lord's. Mary (2), mother of James the Less and
   Joseph, wife of Alphaeus was the sister of Mary the mother of the Lord,
   whom John names of Cleophas, either from her father or from the family
   of the clan, or for some other reason. Mary Salome (3) is called Salome
   either from her husband or her village. Some affirm that she is the
   same as Mary of Cleophas, because she had two husbands.
