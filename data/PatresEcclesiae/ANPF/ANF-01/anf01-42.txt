                Introductory Note to the Fragments of Papias.

                                  --------

   [a.d. 70-155.] It seems unjust to the holy man of whose comparatively
   large contributions to early Christian literature such mere relics have
   been preserved, to set them forth in these versions, unaccompanied by
   the copious annotations of Dr. Routh. If even such crumbs from his
   table are not by any means without a practical value, with reference to
   the Canon and other matters, we may well credit the testimony (though
   disputed) of Eusebius, that he was a learned man, and well versed in
   the Holy Scripture.^[5]286 All who name poor Papias are sure to do so
   with the apologetic qualification of that historian, that he was of
   slender capacity. Nobody who attributes to him the millenarian fancies,
   of which he was but a narrator, as if these were the characteristics
   rather than the blemishes of his works, can fail to accept this
   estimate of our author. But more may be said when we come to the great
   name of Irenaeus, who seems to make himself responsible for
   them.^[6]287

   Papias has the credit of association with Polycarp, in the friendship
   of St. John himself, and of "others who had seen the Lord." He is said
   to have been bishop of Hierapolis, in Phrygia, and to have died about
   the same time that Polycarp suffered; but even this is questioned. So
   little do we know of one whose lost books, could they be recovered,
   might reverse the received judgment, and establish his claim to the
   disputed tribute which makes him, like Apollos, "an eloquent man, and
   mighty in the Scriptures."

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:-

   The principal information in regard to Papias is given in the extracts
   made among the fragments from the works of Irenaeus and Eusebius. He
   was bishop of the Church in Hierapolis, a city of Phrygia, in the first
   half of the second century. Later writers affirm that he suffered
   martyrdom about a.d. 163; some saying that Rome, others that Pergamus,
   was the scene of his death.He was a hearer of the Apostle John, and was
   on terms of intimate intercourse with many who had known the Lord and
   His apostles. From these he gatherer! the floating traditions in regard
   to the sayings of our Lord, and wove them into a production divided
   into five books. This work does not seem to have been confined to an
   exposition of the sayings of Christ, but to have contained much
   historical information.

   Eusebius^[7]288 speaks of Papias as a man most learned in all things,
   and well acquainted with the Scriptures. In another passage he
   describes him as of small capacity. The fragments of Papias are
   translated from the text given in Routh's Reliquiae Sacrae, vol. i.
