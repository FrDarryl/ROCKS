            The Second Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians^[14]1

                                ------------

   Ignatius, who is [also called] Theophorus, to the Church which is
   blessed in the greatness of God the Father, and perfected; to her who
   was selected^[15]2 from eternity, that she might be at all times for
   glory, which abideth, and is unchangeable, and is perfected and chosen
   in the purpose of truth by the will of the Father of Jesus Christ our
   God; to her who is worthy of happiness; to her who is at Ephesus, in
   Jesus Christ, in joy which is unblameable: [wishes] abundance of
   happiness.
   Chapter I.

   Inasmuch as your name, which is greatly beloved, is acceptable to me in
   God, [your name] which ye have acquired by nature, through a right and
   just will, and also by the faith and love of Jesus Christ our Saviour,
   and ye are imitators of God, and are fervent in the blood of God, and
   have speedily completed a work congenial to you; [for] when ye heard
   that I was bound,^[16]3 so as to be able to do nothing for the sake of
   the common name and hope (and I hope, through your prayers, that I may
   be devoured by beasts at Rome, so that by means of this of which I have
   been accounted worthy, I may be endowed with strength to be a disciple
   of God), ye were diligent to come and see me. Seeing, then, that we
   have become acquainted with your multitude^[17]4 in the name of God, by
   Onesimus, who is your bishop, in love which is unutterable, whom I pray
   that ye love in Jesus Christ our Lord, and that all of you imitate his
   example,^[18]5 for blessed is He who has given you such a bishop, even
   as ye deserve [to have].^[19]6
   Chapter III.^[20]7

   But inasmuch as love does not permit me to be silent in regard to you,
   on this account I have been forward to entreat of you that ye would be
   diligent in the will of God.
   Chapter VIII.^[21]8

   For, so long as there is not implanted in you any one lust which is
   able to torment you, behold, ye live in God. I rejoice in you, and
   offer supplication^[22]9 on account of you, Ephesians, a Church which
   is renowned in all ages. For those who are carnal are not able to do
   spiritual things, nor those that are spiritual carnal things; in like
   manner as neither can faith [do] those things which are foreign to
   faith, nor want of faith [do] what belongs to faith. For those things
   which ye have done in the flesh, even these are spiritual, because ye
   have done everything in Jesus Christ.
   Chapter IX.

   And ye are prepared for the building of God the Father, and ye are
   raised up on high by the instrument of Jesus Christ, which is the
   cross; and ye are drawn by the rope, which is the Holy Spirit; and your
   pulley is your faith, and your love is the way which leadeth up on high
   to God.
   Chapter X.

   Pray for all men; for there is hope of repentance for them, that they
   may be counted worthy of God. By your works especially let them be
   instructed. Against their harsh words be ye conciliatory, by meekness
   of mind and gentleness. Against their blasphemies do ye give yourselves
   to prayer; and against their error be ye armed with faith. Against
   their fierceness be ye peaceful and quiet, and be ye not astounded by
   them. Let us, then, be imitators of our Lord in meekness, and strive
   who shall more especially be injured, and oppressed, and defrauded.
   Chapter XIV.^[23]10

   The work is not of promise,^[24]11 unless a man be found in the power
   of faith, even to the end.
   Chapter XV.

   It is better that a man should be silent while he is something, than
   that he should be talking when he is not; that by those things which be
   speaks he should act, and by those things of which he is silent he
   should be known.
   Chapter XVIII.^[25]12

   My spirit bows in adoration to the cross, which is a stumbling-block to
   those who do not believe, but is to you for salvation and eternal life.
   Chapter XIX.

   There was concealed from the ruler of this world the virginity of Mary
   and the birth of our Lord, and the three renowned mysteries^[26]13
   which were done in the tranquillity of God from the star. And here, at
   the manifestation of the Son, magic began to be destroyed, and all
   bonds were loosed; and the ancient kingdom and the error of evil was
   destroyed. Henceforward all things were moved together, and the
   destruction of death was devised, and there was the commencement of
   that which was perfected in God.^[27]14
