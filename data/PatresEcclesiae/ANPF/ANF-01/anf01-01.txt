                                   Preface

   This volume, containing the equivalent of three volumes of the
   Edinburgh series of the Ante-Nicene Fathers, will be found a library
   somewhat complete in itself. The Apostolic Fathers and those associated
   with them in the third generation, are here placed together in a
   handbook, which, with the inestimable Scriptures, supplies a succinct
   autobiography of the Spouse of Christ for the first two centuries. No
   Christian scholar has ever before possessed, in faithful versions of
   such compact form, a supplement so essential to the right understanding
   of the New Testament itself. It is a volume indispensable to all
   scholars, and to every library, private or public, in this country.

   The American Editor has performed the humble task of ushering these
   works into American use, with scanty contributions of his own. Such was
   the understanding with the public: they were to be presented with the
   Edinburgh series, free from appreciable colour or alloy. His duty was
   (1) to give historic arrangement to the confused mass of the original
   series; (2) to supply, in continuity, such brief introductory notices
   as might slightly popularize what was apparently meant for scholars
   only, in the introductions of the translators; (3) to supply a few
   deficiencies by short notes and references; (4) to add such references
   to Scripture, or to authors of general repute, as might lend additional
   aid to students, without clogging or overlaying the comments of the
   translators; and (5) to note such corruptions or distortions of
   Patristic testimony as have been circulated, in the spirit of the
   forged Decretals, by those who carry on the old imposture by means
   essentially equivalent. Too long have they been allowed to speak to the
   popular mind as if the Fathers were their own; while, to every candid
   reader, it must be evident that, alike, the testimony, the arguments,
   and the silence of the Ante-Nicene writers confound all attempts to
   identify the ecclesiastical establishment of "the Holy Roman Empire,"
   with "the Holy Catholic Church" of the ancient creeds.

   In performing this task, under the pressure of a virtual obligation to
   issue the first volume in the first month of the new year, the Editor
   has relied upon the kindly aid of an able friend, as typographical
   corrector of the Edinburgh sheets. It is only necessary to add, that he
   has bracketed all his own notes, so as to assume the responsibility for
   them; but his introductions are so separated from those of the
   translators, that, after the first instance, he has not thought it
   requisite to suffix his initials to these brief contributions. He
   regrets that the most important volume of the series is necessarily the
   experimental one, and comes out under disadvantages from which it may
   be expected that succeeding issues will be free. May the Lord God of
   our Fathers bless the undertaking to all my fellow-Christians, and make
   good to them the promise which was once felicitously chosen for the
   motto of a similar series of publications: "Yet shall not thy teachers
   be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy
   teachers."

   N.B.-The following advertisement of the original editors will be useful
   here:-

   The Ante-Nicene Christian Library is meant to comprise translations
   into English of all the extant works of the Fathers down to the date of
   the first General Council held at Nice in a.d. 325. The sole
   provisional exception is that of the more bulky writings of Origen. It
   is intended at present only to embrace in the scheme the Contra Celsum
   and the De Principiis of that voluminous author; but the whole of his
   works will be included should the undertaking prove successful.

   The present volume has been translated by the Editors.^[5]1 Their
   object has been to place the English reader as nearly as possible on a
   footing of equality with those who are able to read the original. With
   this view they have for the most part leaned towards literal exactness;
   and wherever any considerable departure from this has been made, a
   verbatim rendering has been given at the foot of the page. Brief
   introductory notices have been prefixed, and short notes inserted, to
   indicate varieties of reading, specify references, or elucidate any
   obscurity which seemed to exist in the text.

   Edinburgh, 1867
