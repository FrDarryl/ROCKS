                                 Postscript.

   The American editor omitted in the proper place (p. 315, note 4, after
   what is said by the translator) to insert this important note: viz.,-

   [On this matter of quotations from anonymous authors of the apostolic
   times, not infrequently made by Irenaeus, consult the importatnt
   tractate of Dr. Routh, in his Reliquiae Sacrae, vol. i. 45-68.]
