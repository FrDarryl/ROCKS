                  The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans

                        Shorter and Longer Versions.

                                ------------
   Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of God the
       Father, and of the beloved Jesus Christ, which has through mercy
       obtained every kind of gift, which is filled with faith and love,
       and is deficient in no gift, most worthy of God, and adorned with
       holiness:^[19]1 the Church which is at Smyrna, in Asia, wishes
       abundance of happiness, through the immaculate Spirit and word of
       God.
       Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church of God the
       most high Father, and His beloved Son Jesus Christ, which has
       through mercy obtained every kind of gift, which is filled with
       faith and love, and is deficient in no gift, most worthy of God,
       and adorned with holiness:^[20]2 the Church which is at Smyrna, in
       Asia, wishes abundance of happiness, through the immaculate Spirit
       and word of God.
       Chapter I.-Thanks to God for Your Faith.

   I Glorify God, even Jesus Christ, who has given you such wisdom. For I
   have observed that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye
   were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh
   and in the spirit, and are established in love through the blood of
   Christ, being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was
   truly of the seed of David according to the flesh,^[21]3 and the Son of
   God according to the will and power^[22]4 of God; that He was truly
   born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all righteousness
   might be fulfilled^[23]5 by Him; and was truly, under Pontius Pilate
   and Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh. Of
   this fruit^[24]6 we are by His divinely-blessed passion, that He might
   set up a standard^[25]7 for all ages, through His resurrection, to all
   His holy and faithful [followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in
   the one body of His Church.

   I Glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by Him has
   given you such wisdom. For I have observed that ye are perfected in an
   immoveable faith, as if ye were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in
   love through the blood of Christ, being fully persuaded, in very truth,
   with respect to our Lord Jesus Christ, that He was the Son of God, "the
   first-born of every creature,"^[26]8 God the Word, the only-begotten
   Son, and was of the seed of David according to the flesh,^[27]9 by the
   Virgin Mary; was baptized by John, that all righteousness might be
   fulfilled^[28]10 by Him; that He lived a life of holiness without sin,
   and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to
   the cross] for us in His flesh. From whom we also derive our
   being,^[29]11 from His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a
   standard for the ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and
   faithful [followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body
   of His Church.
   Chapter II.-Christ's True Passion.

   Now, He suffered all these things for our sakes, that we might be
   saved. And He suffered truly, even as also He truly raised up Himself,
   not, as certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer, as
   they themselves only seem to be [Christians]. And as they believe, so
   shall it happen unto them, when they shall be divested of their bodies,
   and be mere evil spirits.^[30]12

   Now, He suffered all these things for us; and He suffered them really,
   and not in appearance only, even as also He truly rose again. But not,
   as some of the unbelievers, who are ashamed of the formation of man,
   and the cross, and death itself, affirm, that in appearance only, and
   not in truth, He took a body of the Virgin, and suffered only in
   appearance, forgetting, as they do, Him who said, "The Word was made
   flesh; "^[31]13 and again, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I
   will raise it up; "^[32]14 and once more, "If I be lifted up from the
   earth, I will draw all men unto Me."^[33]15 The Word therefore did
   dwell in flesh, for "Wisdom built herself an house."^[34]16 The Word
   raised up again His own temple on the third day, when it had been
   destroyed by the Jews fighting against Christ. The Word, when His flesh
   was lifted up, after the manner of the brazen serpent in the
   wilderness, drew all men to Himself for their eternal salvation.^[35]17
   Chapter III.-Christ Was Possessed of a Body After His Resurrection.

   For I know that after His resurrection also He was still possessed of
   flesh,^[36]18 and I believe that He is so now. When, for instance, He
   came to those who were with Peter, He said to them, "Lay hold, handle
   Me, and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit."^[37]19 And
   immediately they touched Him, and believed, being convinced both by His
   flesh and spirit. For this cause also they despised death, and were
   found its conquerors.^[38]20 And after his resurrection He did eat and
   drink with them, as being possessed of flesh, although spiritually He
   was united to the Father.

   And I know that He was possessed of a body not only in His being born
   and crucified, but I also know that He was so after His resurrection,
   and believe that He is so now. When, for instance, He came to those who
   were with Peter, He said to them, "Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I
   am not an incorporeal spirit."^[39]21 "For a spirit hath not flesh and
   bones, as ye see Me have."^[40]22 And He says to Thomas, "Reach hither
   thy finger into the print of the nails, and reach hither thy hand, and
   thrust it into My side; "^[41]23 and immediately they believed that He
   was Christ. Wherefore Thomas also says to Him, "My Lord, and my
   God."^[42]24 And on this account also did they despise death, for it
   were too little to say, indignities and stripes. Nor was this all; but
   also after He had shown Himself to them, that He had risen indeed, and
   not in appearance only, He both ate and drank with them during forty
   entire days. And thus was He, with the flesh, received up in their
   sight unto Him that sent Him, being with that same flesh to come again,
   accompanied by glory and power. For, say the [holy] oracles, "This same
   Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like
   manner as ye have seen Him go unto heaven."^[43]25 But if they say that
   He will come at the end of the world without a body, how shall those
   "see Him that pierced Him,"^[44]26 and when they recognise Him, "mourn
   for themselves? "^[45]27 For incorporeal beings have neither form nor
   figure, nor the aspect^[46]28 of an animal possessed of shape, because
   their nature is in itself simple.
   Chapter IV.-Beware of These Heretics.

   I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the
   same opinions [as I do]. But I guard you beforehand from those beasts
   in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be
   possible, not even meet with; only you must pray to God for them, if by
   any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be
   very difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power
   of [effecting] this. But if these things were done by our Lord only in
   appearance, then am I also only in appearance bound. And why have I
   also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild
   beasts? But, [in fact, ] he who is near to the sword is near to God; he
   that is among the wild beasts is in company with God; provided only he
   be so m the name of Jesus Christ. I undergo all these things that I may
   suffer together with Him,^[47]29 He who became a perfect man inwardly
   strengthening me.^[48]30

   I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the
   same opinions [as I do]. But I guard you beforehand from these beasts
   in the shape of men, from whom you must not only turn away, but even
   flee from them. Only you must pray for them, if by any means they may
   be brought to repentance. For if the Lord were in the body in
   appearance only, and were crucified in appearance only, then am I also
   bound in appearance only. And why have I also surrendered myself to
   death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But, [in fact, ] I
   endure all things for Christ, not in appearance only, but in reality,
   that I may suffer together with Him, while He Himself inwardly
   strengthens me; for of myself I have no such ability.
   Chapter V.-Their Dangerous Errors.

   Some ignorantly^[49]31 deny Him, or rather have been denied by Him,
   being the advocates of death rather than of the truth. These persons
   neither have the prophets persuaded, nor the law of Moses, nor the
   Gospel even to this day, nor the sufferings we have individually
   endured. For they think also the same thing regarding us.^[50]32 For
   what does any one profit me, if he commends me, but blasphemes my Lord,
   not confessing that He was [truly] possessed of a body?^[51]33 But he
   who does not acknowledge this, has in fact altogether denied Him, being
   enveloped in death.^[52]34 I have not, however, thought good to write
   the names of such persons, inasmuch as they are unbelievers. Yea, far
   be it from me to make any mention of them, until they repent and return
   to [a true belief in] Christ's passion, which is our resurrection.

   Some have ignorantly denied Him, and advocate falsehood rather than the
   truth. These persons neither have the prophecies persuaded, nor the law
   of Moses, nor the Gospel even to this day, nor the sufferings we have
   individually endured. For they think also the same thing regarding us.
   For what does it profit, if any one commends me, but blasphemes my
   Lord, not owning Him to be God incarnate?^[53]35 He that does not
   confess this, has in fact altogether denied Him, being enveloped in
   death. I have not, however, thought good to write the names of such
   persons, inasmuch as they are unbelievers; and far be it from me to
   make any mention of them, until they repent.
   Chapter VI-Unbelievers in the Blood of Christ Shall Be Condemned.

   Let no man deceive himself. Both the things which are in heaven, and
   the glorious angels,^[54]36 and rulers, both visible and invisible, if
   they believe not in the blood of Christ, shall, in consequence, incur
   condemnation.^[55]37 "He that is able to receive it, let him receive
   it."^[56]38 Let not [high] place puff any one up: for that which is
   worth all is^[57]39 faith and love, to which nothing is to be
   preferred. But consider those who are of a different opinion with
   respect to the grace of Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they
   are to the will of God. They have no regard for love; no care for the
   widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed; of the bond, or of the free; of
   the hungry, or of the thirsty.

   Let no man deceive himself. Unless he believes that Christ Jesus has
   lived in the flesh, and shall confess His cross and passion, and the
   blood which He shed for the salvation of the world, he shall not obtain
   eternal life, whether he be a king, or a priest, or a ruler, or a
   private person, a master or a servant, a man or a woman. "He that is
   able to receive it, let him receive it."^[58]40 Let no man's place, or
   dignity, or riches, puff him up; and let no man's low condition or
   poverty abase him. For the chief points are faith towards God, hope
   towards Christ, the enjoyment of those good things for which we look,
   and love towards God and our neighbour. For, "Thou shall love the Lord
   thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself."^[59]41 And
   the Lord says, "This is life eternal, to know the only true God, and
   Jesus Christ whom He has sent."^[60]42 And again, "A new commandment
   give I unto you, that ye love one another. On these two commandments
   hang all the law and the prophets."^[61]43 Do ye, therefore, notice
   those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of
   Christ cannot be known, and how they exhibit enmity and deceit in their
   dealings with one another. They have no regard for love; they despise
   the good things we expect hereafter; they regard present things as if
   they were durable; they ridicule him that is in affliction; they laugh
   at him that is in bonds.
   Chapter VII.-Let Us Stand Aloof from Such Heretics.

   They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer,^[62]44 because they
   confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
   which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness,
   raised up again. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift of God,
   incur death^[63]45 in the midst of their disputes. But it were better
   for them to treat it with respect,^[64]46 that they also might rise
   again. It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such
   persons, and not to speak of^[65]47 them either in private or in
   public, but to give heed to the prophets, and above all, to the Gospel,
   in which the passion [of Christ] has been revealed to us, and the
   resurrection has been fully proved.^[66]48 But avoid all divisions, as
   the beginning of evils.

   They are ashamed of the cross; they mock at the passion; they make a
   jest of the resurrection. They are the offspring of that spirit who is
   the author of all evil, who led Adam,^[67]49 by means of his wife, to
   transgress the commandment, who slew Abel by the hands of Cain, who
   fought against Job, who was the accuser of Joshua^[68]50 the son of
   Josedech, who sought to "sift the faith"^[69]51 of the apostles, who
   stirred up the multitude of the Jews against the Lord, who also now
   "worketh in the children of disobedience;^[70]52 from whom the Lord
   Jesus Christ will deliver us, who prayed that the faith of the apostles
   might not fail,^[71]53 not because He was not able of Himself to
   preserve it, but because He rejoiced in the pre-eminence of the Father.
   It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such persons,
   and neither in private nor in public to talk with^[72]54 them; but to
   give heed to the law, and the prophets, and to those who have preached
   to you the word of salvation. But flee from all abominable heresies,
   and those that cause schisms, as the beginning of evils.
   Chapter VIII.-Let Nothing Be Done Without the Bishop.

   See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the
   Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the
   deacons, as being the institution^[73]55 of God. Let no man do anything
   connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a
   proper^[74]56 Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop,
   or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall
   appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as,
   wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not
   lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a
   love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing
   to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid.^[75]57

   See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Christ Jesus does the
   Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles. Do ye also
   reverence the deacons, as those that carry out [through their office]
   the appointment of God. Let no man do anything connected with the
   Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper^[76]58
   Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to
   whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let
   the multitude [of the people] also be; even as where Christ is, there
   does all the heavenly host stand by, waiting upon Him as the Chief
   Captain of the Lord's might, and the Governor of every intelligent
   nature. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize, or to
   offer, or to present sacrifice, or to celebrate a love-feast.^[77]59
   But that which seems good to him, is also well-pleasing to God, that
   everything ye do may be secure and valid.
   Chapter IX.-Honour the Bishop.

   Moreover,^[78]60 it is in accordance with reason that we should return
   to soberness [of conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise
   repentance towards God. It is well to reverence^[79]61 both God and the
   bishop. He who honours the bishop has been honoured by God; he who does
   anything without the knowledge of the bishop, does [in reality] serve
   the devil. Let all things, then, abound to you through grace, for ye
   are worthy. Ye have refreshed me in all things, and Jesus Christ [shall
   refresh] you. Ye have loved me when absent as well as when present. May
   God recompense you, for whose sake, while ye endure all things, ye
   shall attain unto Him.

   Moreover, it is in accordance with reason that we should return to
   soberness [of conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise
   repentance towards God. For "in Hades there is no one who can confess
   his sins."^[80]62 For "behold the man, and his work is before
   him."^[81]63 And [the Scripture saith], "My son, honour thou God and
   the king."^[82]64 And say I, Honour thou God indeed, as the Author and
   Lord of all things, but the bishop as the high-priest, who bears the
   image of God-of God. inasmuch as he is a ruler, and of Christ, in his
   capacity of a priest. After Him, we must also honour the king. For
   there is no one superior to God, or even like to Him, among all the
   beings that exist. Nor is there any one in the Church greater than the
   bishop, who ministers as a priest to God for the salvation of the whole
   world. Nor, again, is there any one among rulers to be compared with
   the king, who secures peace and good order to those over whom he rules.
   He who honours the bishop shall be honoured by God, even as he that
   dishonours him shall be punished by God. For if he that rises up
   against kings is justly held worthy of punishment, inasmuch as he
   dissolves public order, of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall
   he be thought worthy,^[83]65 who presumes to do anything without the
   bishop, thus both destroying the [Church's] unity, and throwing its
   order into confusion? For the priesthood is the very highest point of
   all good things among men, against which whosoever is mad enough to
   strive, dishonours not man, but God, and Christ Jesus, the First-born,
   and the only High Priest, by nature, of the Father. Let all things
   therefore be done by you with good order in Christ. Let the laity be
   subject to the deacons; the deacons to the presbyters; the presbyters
   to the bishop; the bishop to Christ, even as He is to the Father. As
   ye, brethren, have refreshed me, so will Jesus Christ refresh you. Ye
   have loved me when absent, as well as when present. God will recompense
   you, for whose sake ye have shown such kindness towards His prisoner.
   For even if I am not worthy of it, yet your zeal [to help me] is an
   admirable^[84]66 thing. For "he who honours a prophet in the name of a
   prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward."^[85]67 It is manifest also,
   that he who honours a prisoner of Jesus Christ shall receive the reward
   of the martyrs.
   Chapter X.-Acknowledgment of Their Kindness.

   Ye have done well in receiving Philo and Rheus Agathopus as
   servants^[86]68 of Christ our God, who have followed me for the sake of
   God, and who give thanks to the Lord in your behalf, because ye have in
   every way refreshed them. None of these things shall be lost to you.
   May my spirit be for you,^[87]69 and my bonds, which ye have not
   despised or been ashamed of; nor shall Jesus Christ, our perfect hope,
   be ashamed of you.

   Ye have done well in receiving Philo, and Gaius, and Agathopus, who,
   being the servants^[88]70 of Christ, have followed me for the sake of
   God, and who greatly bless the Lord in your behalf, because ye have in
   every way refreshed them. None of those things which ye have done to
   them shall be passed by without being reckoned unto you. "The Lord
   grant" to you "that ye may find mercy of the Lord in that day!"^[89]71
   May my spirit be for you,^[90]72 and my bonds, which ye have not
   despised or been ashamed of. Wherefore, neither shall Jesus Christ, our
   perfect hope, be ashamed of you.
   Chapter XI.-Request to Them to Send a Messenger to Antioch.

   Your prayer has reached to the Church which is at Antioch in Syria.
   Coming from that place bound with chains, most acceptable to
   God,^[91]73 I salute all; I who am not worthy to be styled from thence,
   inasmuch as I am the least of them. Nevertheless, according to the will
   of God, I have been thought worthy [of this honour], not that I have
   any sense^[92]74 [of having deserved it], but by the grace of God,
   which I wish may be perfectly given to me, that through your prayers I
   may attain to God. In order, therefore, that your work may be complete
   both on earth and in heaven, it is fitting that, for the honour of God,
   your Church should elect some worthy delegate;^[93]75 so that he,
   journeying into Syria, may congratulate them that they are [now] at
   peace, and are restored to^[94]76 their proper greatness, and that
   their proper constitution^[95]77 has been re-established among them. It
   seems then to me a becoming thing, that you should send some one of
   your number with an epistle, so that, in company with them, he may
   rejoice^[96]78 over the tranquility which, according to the will of
   God, they have obtained, and because that, through your prayers, they
   have now reached the harbour. As persons who are perfect, ye should
   also aim at^[97]79 those things which are perfect. For when ye are
   desirous to do well, God is also ready to assist you.

   Your prayers have reached to the Church of Antioch, and it is at peace.
   Coming from that place bound, I salute all; I who am not worthy to be
   styled from thence, inasmuch as I am the least of them. Nevertheless,
   according to the will of God, I have been thought worthy [of this
   honour], not that I have any senses [of having deserved it], but by the
   grace of God, which I wish may be perfectly given to me, that through
   your prayers I may attain to God. In order, therefore, that your work
   may be complete both on earth and in heaven, it is fitting that, for
   the honour of God, your Church should elect some worthy
   delegate;^[98]80 so that he, journeying into Syria, may congratulate
   them that they are [now] at peace, and are restored to their proper
   greatness, and that their proper constitution^[99]81 has been
   re-established among them. What appears to me proper to be done is
   this, that you should send some one of your number with an epistle, so
   that, in company with them, he may rejoice over the tranquillity which,
   according to the will of God, they have obtained, and because that,
   through your prayers, I have secured Christ as a safe harbour. As
   persons who are perfect, ye should also aim at^[100]82 those things
   which are perfect. For when ye are desirous to do well, God is also
   ready to assist you.
   Chapter XII.-Salutations.

   The love of the brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I write to
   you by Burrhus, whom ye sent with me, together with the Ephesians, your
   brethren, and who has in all things refreshed me. And I would that all
   may imitate him, as being a pattern of a minister^[101]83 of God. Grace
   will reward him in all things. I salute your most worthy^[102]84
   bishop, and your very venerable^[103]85 presbytery, and your deacons,
   my fellow-servants, and all of you individually, as well as generally,
   in the name of Jesus Christ, and in His flesh and blood, in His passion
   and resurrection, both corporeal and spiritual, in union with God and
   you.^[104]86 Grace, mercy, peace, and patience, be with you for
   evermore!

   The love of your brethren at Troas salutes you; whence also I write to
   you by Burgus, whom ye sent with me, together with the Ephesians, your
   brethren, and who has in all things refreshed me. And I would that all
   may imitate him, as being a pattern of a minister of God. The grace of
   the Lord will reward him in all things. I salute your most worthy
   bishop Polycarp, and your venerable presbytery, and your Christ-bearing
   deacons, my fellow-servants, and all of you individually, as well as
   generally, in the name of Christ Jesus, and in His flesh and blood, in
   His passion and resurrection, both corporeal and spiritual, in union
   with God and you. Grace, mercy, peace, and patience, be with you in
   Christ for evermore!
   Conclusion.

   I salute the families of my brethren, with their wives and children,
   and the virgins who are called widows.^[105]87 Be ye strong, I pray, in
   the power of the Holy Ghost. Philo, who is with me, greets you. I
   salute the house of Tavias, and pray that it may be confirmed in faith
   and love, both corporeal and spiritual. I salute Alce, my
   well-beloved,^[106]88 and the incomparable Daphnus, and Eutecnus, and
   all by name. Fare ye well in the grace of God.

   Lord Jesus Christ, being filled with the Holy Spirit, and divine and
   sacred wisdom.
