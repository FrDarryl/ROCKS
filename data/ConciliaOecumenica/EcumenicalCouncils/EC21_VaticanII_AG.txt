Decree Ad Gentes

   On the Missionary Activity of the Church

                                   PREFACE

   1. Divinely sent to the nations of the world to be unto them "a
   universal sacrament of salvation,"(1) the Church, driven by the inner
   necessity of her own catholicity, and obeying the mandate of her
   Founder (cf. Mark 16:16), strives ever to proclaim the Gospel to all
   men. The Apostles themselves, on whom the Church was founded, following
   in the footsteps of Christ, "preached the word of truth and begot
   churches."(2) It is the duty of their successors to make this task
   endure "so that the word of God may run and be glorified (2 Thess. 3:1)
   and the kingdom of God be proclaimed and established throughout the
   world.

   In the present state of affairs, out of which there is arising a new
   situation for mankind, the Church, being the salt of the earth and the
   light of the world (cf. Matt. 5:13-14), is more urgently called upon to
   save and renew every creature, that all things may be restored in
   Christ and all men may constitute one family in Him and one people of
   God.

   Therefore, this sacred synod, while rendering thanks to God for the
   excellent results that have been achieved through the whole Church's
   great - hearted endeavor, desires to sketch the principles of
   missionary activity and to rally the forces of all the faithful in
   order that the people of God, marching along the narrow way of the
   Cross, may spread everywhere the reign of Christ, Lord and overseer: of
   the ages (cf. Ecc. 36:19), and may prepare the way for his coming.

CHAPTER I

                           PRINCIPLES OF DOCTRINE

   2. The pilgrim Church is missionary by her very nature, since it is
   from the mission of the Son and the mission of the Holy Spirit that she
   draws her origin, in accordance with the decree of God the Father.(1)

   This decree, however, flows from the "fount - like love" or charity of
   God the Father who, being the "principle without principle" from whom
   the Son is begotten and Holy Spirit proceeds through the Son, freely
   creating us on account of His surpassing and merciful kindness and
   graciously calling us moreover to share with Him His life and His cry,
   has generously poured out, and does not cease to pour out still, His
   divine goodness. Thus He who created all things may at last be "all in
   all" (1 Cor. 15:28), bringing about at one and the same time His own
   glory and our happiness. But it pleased God to call men to share His
   life, not just singly, apart from any mutual bond, but rather to mold
   them into a people in which His sons, once scattered abroad might be
   gathered together (cf. John 11:52).

   3. This universal design of God for the salvation of the human race is
   carried out not only, as it were, secretly in the soul of a man, or by
   the attempts (even religious ones by which in diverse ways it seeks
   after God) if perchance it may contact Him or find Him, though He be
   not far from anyone of us (cf. Acts 17:27). For these attempts need to
   be enlightened and healed; even though, through the kindly workings of
   Divine Providence, they may sometimes serve as leading strings toward
   God, or as a preparation for the Gospel.(2) Now God, in order to
   establish peace or the communion of sinful human beings with Himself,
   as well as to fashion them into a fraternal community, did ordain to
   intervene in human history in a way both new and finally sending His
   Son, clothed in our flesh, in order that through Him He might snatch
   men from the power of darkness and Satan (cf. Col. 1:13; Acts 10:38)
   and reconcile the world to Himself in Him (cf. 2 Cor. 5:19). Him, then,
   by whom He made the world,(3) He appointed heir of all things, that in
   Him He might restore all (cf. Eph. 1:10).

   For Jesus Christ was sent into the world as a real mediator between God
   and men. Since He is God, all divine fullness dwells bodily in Him
   (Gal. 2:9). According to His human nature, on the other hand, He is the
   new Adam, made head of a renewed humanity, and full of grace and of
   truth (John 1:14). Therefore the Son of God walked the ways of a true
   Incarnation that He might make men sharers in the nature of God: made
   poor for our sakes, though He had been rich, in order that His poverty
   might enrich us (2 Cor. 8:9). The Son of Man came not that He might be
   served, but that He might be a servant, and give His life as a ransom
   for the many - that is, for all (cf. Mark 10:45). The Fathers of the
   Church proclaim without hesitation that what has not been taken up by
   Christ is not made whole.(4) Now, what He took up was our entire human
   nature such as it is found among us poor wretches, save only sin (cf.
   Heb. 4:15; 9.28). For Christ said concerning Himself, He whom the
   Father sanctified and sent into the world (cf. John 10:36): the Spirit
   of the Lord is upon me, because He anointed me; to bring good news to
   the poor He sent me, to heal the broken - hearted, to proclaim to the
   captives release, and sight to the blind" (Luke 4:18). And again: "The
   Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost" (Luke 19:10).

   But what the Lord preached that one time, or what was wrought in Him
   for the saving of the human race, must be spread abroad and published
   to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8), beginning from Jerusalem (cf. Luke
   24:27), so that what He accomplished at that one time for the salvation
   of all, may in the course of time come to achieve its effect in all.

   4. To accomplish this, Christ sent from the Father His Holy Spirit, who
   was to carry on inwardly His saving work and prompt the Church to
   spread out. Doubtless, the Holy Spirit was already at work in the world
   before Christ was glorified.(5) Yet on the day of Pentecost, He came
   down upon the disciples to remain with them forever (cf. John 14:16).
   The Church was publicly displayed to the multitude, the Gospel began to
   spread among the nations by means of preaching, and there was presaged
   that union of all peoples in the catholicity of the faith by means of
   the Church of the New Covenant, a Church which speaks all tongues,
   understands and accepts all tongues in her love, and so supersedes the
   divisiveness of Babel.(6) For it was from Pentecost that the "Acts of
   the Apostles" took again, just as Christ was - conceived when the Holy
   Spirit came upon the Virgin Mary, and just as Christ was impelled to
   the work of His ministry by the same Holy Spirit descending upon Him
   while He prayed.(7)

   Now, the Lord Jesus, before freely giving His life for the world, did
   so arrange the Apostles' ministry and promise to send the Holy Spirit
   that both they and the Spirit might be associated in effecting the work
   of salvation always and everywhere.(8) Throughout all ages, the Holy
   Spirit makes the entire Church "one in communion and in ministering; He
   equips her with various gifts of a hierarchical and charismatic
   nature," a giving life, soul - like, to ecclesiastical institutions(10)
   and instilling into the hearts of the faithful the same mission spirit
   which impelled Christ Himself. Sometimes He even visibly anticipates
   the Apostles' acting,(11) just as He unceasingly accompanies and
   directs it in different ways.(12)

   5. From the very beginning, the Lord Jesus "called to Himself those
   whom He wished; and He caused twelve of them to be with Him, and to be
   sent out preaching (Mark 3:13; cf. Matt. 10:1-42). Thus the Apostles
   were the first budding - forth of the New Israel, and at the same time
   the beginning of the sacred hierarchy. Then, when He had by His death
   and His resurrection completed once for all in Himself the mysteries of
   our salvation and the renewal of all things, the Lord, having now
   received all power in heaven and on earth (cf. Matt. 28 18), before He
   was taken up into heaven (cf. Acts 1:11), founded His Church as the
   sacrament of salvation and sent His Apostles into all the world just as
   He Himself had been sent by His Father (cf. John 20:21), commanding
   them: "Go, therefore, and make disciples of a nations, baptizing them
   in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit;
   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matt. 28:19
   ff.). "Go into the whole world, preach the Gospel to every creature. He
   who believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he who does not
   believe, shall be condemned" (Mark 16:15ff.). Whence the duty that lies
   on the Church of spreading the faith and the salvation of Christ, not
   only in virtue of the express command which was inherited from the
   Apostles by the order of bishops, assisted by the priests, together
   with the successor of Peter and supreme shepherd of the Church, but
   also in virtue of that life which flows from Christ into His members;
   "From Him the whole body, being closely joined and knit together
   through every joint of the system, according to the functioning in due
   measure of each single part, derives its increase to the building up of
   itself in love" (Eph. 4:16). The mission of the Church, therefore, is
   fulfilled by that activity which makes her, obeying the command of
   Christ and influenced by the grace and love of the Holy Spirit, fully
   present to all men or nations, in order that, by the example of her
   life and by her preaching, by the sacraments and other means of grace,
   she may lead them to the faith, the freedom and the peace of Christ;
   that thus there may lie open before them a firm and free road to full
   participation in the mystery of Christ.

   Since this mission goes on and in the course of history unfolds the
   mission of Christ Himself, who was sent to preach the Gospel to the
   poor, the Church, prompted by the Holy Spirit, must walk in the same
   path on which Christ walked: a path of poverty and obedience, of
   service and self - sacrifice to the death, from which death He came
   forth a victor by His resurrection. For thus did all the Apostles walk
   in hope, and by many trials and sufferings they filled up those things
   wanting to the Passion of Christ for His body which is the Church (cf.
   Col. 1:24). For often, the blood of Christians was like a seed.(13)

   6. This duty, to be fulfilled by the order of bishops, under the
   successor of Peter and with the prayers and help of the whole Church,
   is one and the same everywhere and in every condition, even though it
   may be carried out differently according to circumstances. Hence, the
   differences recognizable in this, the Church's activity, are not due to
   the inner nature of the mission itself, but rather to the circumstances
   in which this mission is exercised.

   These circumstances in turn depend sometimes on the Church, sometimes
   on the peoples or groups or men to whom the mission is directed. For
   the Church, although of itself including the totality or fullness of
   the means of salvation, does not and cannot always and instantly bring
   them all into action. Rather, she experiences beginnings and degrees in
   that action by which she strives to make God's plan a reality. In fact,
   there are times when, after a happy beginning, she must again lament a
   setback, or at least must linger in a certain state of unfinished
   insufficiency. As for the men, groups and peoples concerned, only by
   degrees does she touch and pervade them, and thus take them up into
   full catholicity. The right sort of means and actions must be suited to
   any state or situation.

   "Missions" is the term usually given to those particular undertakings
   by which the heralds of the Gospel, sent out by the Church and going
   forth into the whole world, carry out the task of preaching the Gospel
   and planting the Church among peoples or groups who do not yet believe
   in Christ. These undertakings are brought to completion by missionary
   activity and are mostly exercised in certain territories recognized by
   the Holy See. The proper purpose of this missionary activity is
   evangelization, and the planting of the Church among those peoples and
   groups where it has not yet taken root.(14) Thus from the seed which is
   the word of God, particular autochthonous churches should be
   sufficiently established and should grow up all over the world, endowed
   with their own maturity and vital forces. Under a hierarchy of their
   own, together with the faithful people, and adequately fitted out with
   requisites for living a full Christian life, they should make their
   contribution to the good of the whole Church. The chief means of the
   planting referred to is the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. To
   preach this Gospel the Lord sent forth His disciples into the whole
   world, that being reborn by the word of God (cf. 1 Peter 1:23), men
   might be joined to the Church through baptism - that Church which, as
   the body of the Word Incarnate, is nourished and lives by the word of
   God and by the eucharistic bread (cf. Acts 2:43).

   In this missionary activity of the Church various stages sometimes are
   found side by side: first, that of the beginning or planting, then that
   of newness or youth. When these have passed, the Church's missionary
   activity does not cease, but there lies upon the particular churches
   already set up the duty of continuing this activity and of preaching
   the Gospel to those still outside.

   Moreover, the groups among which the Church dwells are often radically
   changed, for one reason or other, so that an entirely new set of
   circumstances may arise. Then the Church must deliberate whether these
   conditions might again call for her missionary activity. Besides,
   circumstances are sometimes such that, for the time being, there is no
   possibility of expounding the Gospel directly and forthwith. Then, of
   course, missionaries can and must at least bear witness to Christ by
   charity and by works of mercy, with all patience, prudence and great
   confidence. Thus they will prepare the way for the Lord and make Him
   somehow present.

   Thus it is plain that missionary activity wells up from the Church's
   inner nature and spreads abroad her saving Faith. It perfects her
   Catholic unity by this expansion. It is sustained by her apostolicity.
   It exercises the collegial spirit of her hierarchy. It bears witness to
   her sanctity while spreading and promoting it. Thus, missionary
   activity among the nations differs from pastoral activity exercised
   among the faithful as well as from undertakings aimed at restoring
   unity among Christians. And yet these two ends are most closely
   connected with the missionary zeal(15) because the division among
   Christians damages the most holy cause of preaching the Gospel to every
   creature(16) and blocks the way to the faith for many. Hence, by the
   very necessity of mission, all the baptized are called to gather into
   one flock, and thus they will be able to bear unanimous witness before
   the nations to Christ their Lord. And if they are not yet capable of
   bearing witness to the same faith, they should at least be animated by
   mutual love and esteem.

   7. This missionary activity derives its reason from the will of God,
   "who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
   truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
   Himself a man, Jesus Christ, who gave Himself as a ransom for all" (1
   Tim. 2:45), "neither is there salvation in any other" (Acts 4:12).
   Therefore, all must be converted to Him, made known by the Church's
   preaching, and all must be incorporated into Him by baptism and into
   the Church which is His body. For Christ Himself "by stressing in
   express language the necessity of faith and baptism (cf. Mark 16:16;
   John 3:5), at the same time confirmed the necessity of the Church, into
   which men enter by baptism, as by a door. Therefore those men cannot be
   saved, who though aware that God, through Jesus Christ founded the
   Church as something necessary, still do not wish to enter into it, or
   to persevere in it."(17) Therefore though God in ways known to Himself
   can lead those inculpably ignorant of the Gospel to find that faith
   without which it is impossible to please Him (Heb. 11:6), yet a
   necessity lies upon the Church (1 Cor. 9:16), and at the same time a
   sacred duty, to preach the Gospel. And hence missionary activity today
   as always retains its power and necessity.

   By means of this activity, the Mystical Body of Christ unceasingly
   gathers and directs its forces toward its own growth (cf. Eph.
   4:11-16). The members of the Church are impelled to carry on such
   missionary activity by reason of the love with which they love God and
   by which they desire to share with all men the spiritual goods of both
   its life and the life to come.

   Finally, by means of this missionary activity, God is fully glorified,
   provided that men fully and consciously accept His work of salvation,
   which He has accomplished in Christ. In this way and by this means, the
   plan of God is fulfilled - that plan to which Christ conformed with
   loving obedience for the glory of the Father who sent Him,(18) that the
   whole human race might form one people of God and be built up into one
   temple of the Holy Spirit which, being the expression of brotherly
   harmony, corresponds with the inmost wishes of all men. And so at last,
   there will be realized the plan of our Creator who formed man to His
   own image and likeness, when all who share one human nature,
   regenerated in Christ through the Holy Spirit and beholding the glory
   of God, will be able to say with one accord: "Our Father."(19)

   8. Missionary activity is closely bound up even with human nature
   itself and its aspirations. For by manifesting Christ the Church
   reveals to men the real truth about their condition and their whole
   calling, since Christ is the source and model of that redeemed
   humanity, imbued with brotherly love, sincerity and a peaceful spirit,
   to which they all aspire. Christ and the Church, which bears witness to
   Him by preaching the Gospel, transcend every peculiarity of race or
   nation and therefore cannot be considered foreign anywhere or to
   anybody.(20) Christ Himself is the way and the truth, which the
   preaching of the Gospel opens to all in proclaiming in the hearing of
   all these words of Christ: "Repent, and believe the Gospel" (Mark
   1:15). Now, since he who does not believe is already judged (cf. John
   3:18), the words of Christ are at one and the same time words of
   judgment and of grace, of death and of life. For it is only by putting
   to death what is old that we are able to approach the newness of life.
   This is true first of all about persons, but it holds also for the
   various goods of this world which bear the mark both of man's sin and
   of God's blessing: "For all have sinned and have need of the glory of
   God" (Rom. 3:23). No one is freed from sin by himself and by his own
   power, no one is raised above himself, no one is completely rid of his
   sickness or his solitude or his servitude.(21) On the contrary, all
   stand in need of Christ, their model, their mentor, their liberator,
   their Savior, their source of life. The Gospel has truly been a leaven
   of liberty and progress in human history, even in the temporal sphere,
   and always proves itself a leaven of brotherhood, of unity and of
   peace. Not without cause is Christ hailed by the faithful as "the
   expected of the nations, and their Savior."(22)

   9. And so the time for missionary activity extends between the first
   coming of the Lord and the second, in which latter the Church will be
   gathered from the four winds like a harvest into the kingdom of
   God.(23) For the Gospel must be preached to all nations before the Lord
   shall come (cf. Mark 13:10).

   Missionary activity is nothing else and nothing less than an epiphany,
   or a manifesting of God's decree, and its fulfillment in the world and
   in world history, in the course of which God, by means of mission,
   manifestly works out the history of salvation. By the preaching of the
   word and by the celebration of the sacraments, the center and summit of
   which is the most holy Eucharist, He brings about the presence of
   Christ, the author of salvation. But whatever truth and grace are to be
   found among the nations, as a sort of secret presence of God, He frees
   from all taint of evil and restores to Christ its maker, who overthrows
   the devil's domain and wards off the manifold malice of vice. And so,
   whatever good is found to be sown in the hearts and minds of men, or in
   the rites and cultures peculiar to various peoples, not only is not
   lost, but is healed, uplifted, and perfected for the glory of God, the
   shame of the demon, and the bliss of men.(24) Thus, missionary activity
   tends toward eschatological fullness.(25) For by it the people of God
   is increased to that measure and time which the Father has fixed in His
   power(cf. Acts 1:7). To this people it was said in prophecy: "Enlarge
   the space for your tent, and spread out your tent cloths unsparingly"
   (Is. 54:2).(26) By missionary activity, the mystical body grows to the
   mature measure of the fullness of Christ (cf. Eph. 4:13); and the
   spiritual temple, where God is adored in spirit and in truth (cf. John
   4:23), grows and is built up upon the foundation of the Apostles and
   prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the supreme corner stone (Eph.
   2:20).

CHAPTER II

                             MISSION WORK ITSELF

   10. The Church, sent by Christ to reveal and to communicate the love of
   God to all men and nations, is aware that there still remains a
   gigantic missionary task for her to accomplish. For the Gospel message
   has not yet, or hardly yet, been heard by two million human beings (and
   their number is increasing daily), who are formed into large and
   distinct groups by permanent cultural ties, by ancient religious
   traditions, and by firm bonds of social necessity. Some of these men
   are followers of one of the great religions, but others remain
   strangers to the very knowledge of God, while still others expressly
   deny His existence, and sometimes even attack it. The Church, in order
   to be able to offer all of them the mystery of salvation and the life
   brought by God, must implant herself into these groups for the same
   motive which led Christ to bind Himself, in virtue of His Incarnation,
   to certain social and cultural conditions of those human beings among
   whom He dwelt.

ARTICLE 1: Christian Witness

   11. The Church must be present in these groups through her children,
   who dwell among them or who are sent to them. For all Christians,
   wherever they live, are bound to show forth, by the example of their
   lives and by the witness of the word, that new man put on at baptism
   and that power of the Holy Spirit by which they have been strengthened
   at Conformation. Thus other men, observing their good works, can
   glorify the Father (cf. Matt. ES:16) and can perceive more fully the
   real meaning of human life and the universal bond of the community of
   mankind.

   In order that they may be able to bear more fruitful witness to Christ,
   let them be joined to those men by esteem and love; let them
   acknowledge themselves to be members of the group of men among whom
   they live; let them share in cultural and social life by the various.
   undertakings and enterprises of human living; let them be familiar with
   their national and religious traditions; let them gladly and reverently
   lay bare the seeds of the Word which lie hidden among their fellows. At
   the same time, however, let them look to the: profound changes which
   are taking place among nations, and let them exert themselves to keep
   modern man, intent as he is on the science and technology of today's
   world from becoming a stranger to things divine; rather, let them
   awaken in him a yearning for that truth and:charity which God has
   revealed. Even as Christ Himself searched the hearts of men, and led
   them to divine light, so also His disciples, profoundly penetrated by
   the Spirit of Christ, should show the people among whom they live, and
   should converse with them, that they themselves may learn by sincere
   and patient dialogue what treasures a generous God has distributed
   among the nations of the earth. But at the same time, let them try to
   furbish these treasures, set them free, and bring them under the
   dominion of God their Savior.

   12. The presence of the Christian faithful in these human groups should
   be inspired by that charity with which God has loved us, and with which
   He wills that we should love one another (cf. 1 John 4:11). Christian
   charity truly extends to all, without distinction of race, creed, or
   social condition: it looks for neither gain nor gratitude. For as God
   loved us with an unselfish love, so also the faithful should in their
   charity care for the human person himself, loving him with the same
   affection with which God sought out man. Just as Christ, then, went
   about all the towns and villages, curing every kind of disease and
   infirmity as a sign that the kingdom of God had come (cf. Matt. 9:35ff;
   Acts 10:38), so also the Church, through her children, is one with men
   of every condition, but especially with the poor and the afflicted. For
   them, she gladly spends and is spent (cf. 2 Cor. 12:15), sharing in
   their joys and sorrows, knowing of their longings and problems,
   suffering with them in death's anxieties. To those in quest of peace,
   she wishes to answer in fraternal dialogue, bearing them the peace and
   the light of the Gospel.

   Let Christians labor and collaborate with others in rightly regulating
   the affairs of social and economic life. With special care, let them
   devote themselves to the education of children and young people by
   means of different kinds of schools, which should be considered not
   only as the most excellent means of forming and developing Christian
   youth, but also as a valuable public service, especially in the
   developing nations, working toward the uplifting of human dignity, and
   toward better living conditions. Furthermore, let them take part in the
   strivings of those peoples who, waging war on famine, ignorance, and
   disease, are struggling to better their way of life and to secure peace
   in the world. In this activity, the faithful should be eager to offer
   prudent aid to projects sponsored by public and private organizations,
   by governments, by various Christian communities, and even by non -
   Christian religions.

   However, the Church has no desire at all to intrude itself into the
   government of the earthly city. It claims no other authority than that
   of ministering to men with the help of God, in a spirit of charity and
   faithful service (cf. Matt. 20:26; 23:11).(1)

   Closely united with men in their life and work, Christ's disciples hope
   to render to others true witness of Christ, and to work for their
   salvation, even where they are not able to announce Christ fully. For
   they are not seeking a mere material progress and prosperity for men,
   but are promoting their dignity and brotherly union, teaching those
   religious and moral truths which Christ illumined with His light; and
   in this way, they are gradually opening up a fuller approach to God.
   Thus they help men to attain to salvation by love for God and neighbor,
   and the mystery of Christ begins to shine forth, in which there appears
   the new man, created according to God (cf. Eph. 4:24), and in which the
   charity of God is revealed.

ARTICLE 2: Preaching the Gospel and Gathering together the People of God

   13. Wherever God opens a door of speech for proclaiming the mystery of
   Christ (cf. Col. 4:3), there is announced to all men (cf. Mark 16:15; 1
   Cor. 9:15; Rom. 10:14) with confidence and constancy (cf. Acts 4:13,
   29, 31; 9:27, 28; 13:46; 14:3; 19:8; 26:26; 28:31; 1 Thess. 2:2; 2 Cor.
   3:12; 7:4; Phil. 1:20; Eph. 3:12; 6:19, 20) the living God, and He Whom
   He has sent for the salvation of all, Jesus Christ (cf. 1 Thess.
   1:9-10; 1 Cor. 1:18-21; Gal. 1:31; Acts 14:15-17, 17:22-31), in order
   that non - Christians, when the Holy Spirit opens their heart (cf. Acts
   16:14), may believe and be freely converted to the Lord, that they may
   cleave sincerely to Him Who, being the "way, the truth, and the life"
   (John 14:6), fulfills all their spiritual expectations, and even
   infinitely surpasses them.

   This conversion must be taken as an initial one, yet sufficient to make
   a man realize that he has been snatched away from sin and led into the
   mystery of God's love, who called him to enter into a personal
   relationship with Him in Christ. For, by the workings of divine grace,
   the new convert sets out on a spiritual journey, by means of which,
   already sharing through faith in the mystery of Christ's Death and
   Resurrection, he passes from the old man to the new one, perfected in
   Christ (cf. Col. 3:5-10; Eph. 4:20-24). This bringing with it a
   progressive change of outlook and morals, must become evident with its
   social consequences, and must be gradually developed during the time of
   the catechumenate. Since the Lord he believes in is a sign of
   contradiction (cf. Luke 2:34; Matt. 10:34-39), the convert often
   experiences an abrupt breaking off of human ties, but he also tastes
   the joy which God gives without measure (cf. 1 Thess. 1:6).

   The Church strictly forbids forcing anyone to embrace the Faith, or
   alluring or enticing people by worrisome wiles. By the same token, she
   also strongly insists on this right, that no one be frightened away
   from the Faith by unjust vexations on the part of others.(2)

   In accord with the Church's ancient custom, the convert's motives
   should be looked into, and if necessary, purified.

   14. Those who, through the Church, have accepted from God a belief in
   Christ(3) are admitted to the catechumenate by liturgical rites. The
   catechumenate is not a mere expounding of doctrines and precepts, but a
   training period in the whole Christian life, and an apprenticeship duty
   drawn out, during which disciples are joined to Christ their Teacher.
   Therefore, catechumens should be properly instructed in the mystery of
   salvation and in the practice of Gospel morality, and by sacred rites
   which are to be held at successive intervals,(4) they should be
   introduced into the life of faith, of liturgy, and of love, which is
   led by the People of God.

   Then, when the sacraments of Christian initiation have freed them from
   the power of darkness (cf. Col. 1:13),(5) having died with Christ been
   buried with Him and risen together with Him (cf. Rom. 6:4-11; Col.
   2:12-13; 1 Peter 3:21-22; Mark 16:16), they receive the Spirit (cf. 1
   Thess. 3:5-7; Acts 8:14-17) of adoption of sons and celebrate the
   remembrance of the Lord's death and resurrection together with the
   whole People of God.

   It is to be desired that the liturgy of the Lenten and Paschal seasons
   should be restored in such a way as to dispose the hearts of the
   catechumens to celebrate the Easter mystery at whose solemn ceremonies
   they are reborn to Christ through baptism.

   But this Christian initiation in the catechumenate should be taken care
   of not only by catechists or priests, but by the entire community of
   the faithful, so that right from the outset the catechumens may feel
   that they belong to the people of God. And since the life of the Church
   is an apostolic one, the catechumens also should learn to cooperate
   wholeheartedly, by the witness of their lives and by the profession of
   their faith, in the spread of the Gospel and in the building up of the
   Church.

   Finally, the juridic status of catechumens should be clearly defined in
   the new code of Canon law. For since they are joined to the Church,
   they are already of the household of Christ,(7) and not seldom they are
   already leading a life of faith, hope, and charity.

ARTICLE 3: Forming a Christian Community

   15. The Holy Spirit, who calls all men to Christ by the seeds of the
   Lord and by the preaching of the Gospel, stirs up in their: hearts a
   submission to the faith Who in the womb of the baptismal font, He
   begets to a new life those who believe in Christ, He gathers them into
   the one People of God which is "a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a
   holy nation, a purchased people" (1 Peter 2:9).(8)

   Therefore, let the missionaries, God's coworkers, ( cf. 1 Cor. 3:9),
   raise up congregations of the faithful such that, walking worthy of the
   vocation to which they have been called (cf. Eph. 4:1), they may
   exercise the priestly, prophetic, and royal office which God has
   entrusted to them. In this way, the Christian community will be a sign
   of God's presence in the world: for by reason of the eucharistic
   sacrifice, this community is ceaselessly on the way with Christ to the
   Father;(9) carefully nourished on the word of God(10) it bears witness
   to Christ;(11) and finally, it walks in charity and is fervent with the
   apostolic spirit.(12)

   The Christian community should from the very start be so formed that it
   call provide nor its necessities insofar as this is possible.

   This congregation of the faithful, endowed with the riches of its own
   nation's culture, should be deeply rooted in the people. Let families
   flourish which are imbued with the spirit of the Gospel(13) and let
   them be assisted by good schools; let associations and groups be
   organized by means of which the lay apostolate will be able to permeate
   the whole of society with the spirit of the Gospel. Lastly, let charity
   shine out between Catholics of different rites.(14)

   The ecumenical spirit should be nurtured in the neophytes, who should
   take into account that the brethren who believe in Christ are Christ's
   disciples, reborn in baptism, sharers with the People of God in very
   many good things. Insofar as religious conditions allow, ecumenical
   activity - should be furthered in such a way that, excluding any
   appearance of indifference or confusion on the one hand, or of
   unhealthy rivalry on the other, Catholics should cooperate in a
   brotherly spirit with their separated brethren, among to the norms of
   the Decree on Ecumenism, making before the nations a common profession
   of faith, insofar as their beliefs are common, in God and in Jesus
   Christ, and cooperating in social and in technical projects as well as
   in cultural and religious ones. Let them cooperate especially for the
   sake of Christ, their common Lord: let His Name be the bond that unites
   them! This cooperation should be undertaken not only among private
   persons, but also, subject to approval by the local Ordinary, among
   churches or ecclesial communities and their works.

   The Christian faithful gathered together out of all nations into the
   Church "are not marked off from the rest of men by their government,
   nor by their language, nor by their political institutions,"(15) and so
   they should live for God and Christ in a respectable way of their own
   national life. As good citizens, they should be true and effective
   patriots, all together avoiding racial prejudice and hypernationalism,
   and should foster a universal love for man.

   To obtain all these things, the most important and therefore worthy of
   special attention are the Christian laity: namely, those who have been
   incorporated into Christ and live in the world. For it is up to them,
   imbued with the spirit of Christ, to be a leaven working on the
   temporal order from within, to dispose it always in accordance with
   Christ.(16)

   But it is not enough that the Christian people be present and be
   organized in a given nation, nor is it enough to carry out an
   apostolate by way of example. They are organized for this purpose, they
   are present for this, to announce Christ to their non - Christian
   fellow - citizens by word and example, and to aid them toward the full
   reception of Christ.

   Now, in order to plant the Church and to make the Christian community
   grow, various ministries are needed, which are raised up by divine
   calling from the midst of the faithful congregation, and are to be
   carefully fostered and tended to by all. Among these are the offices of
   priests, of deacons, and of catechists, and Catholic action. Religious
   men and women likewise, by their prayers and by their active work, play
   an indispensable role in rooting and strengthening the Kingdom of
   Christ in souls, and in causing it to be spread.

   16. Joyfully the Church gives thanks for the priceless gift of the
   priestly calling which God has granted to so many youths among those
   nations but recently converted to Christ. For the Church drives deeper
   roots in any given sector of the human family when the various faithful
   communities all have, from among their members, their own ministers of
   salvation in the order of bishops, priests, and deacons, serving their
   own brethren, so that the young churches gradually acquire a diocesan
   structure with their own clergy.

   What this council has decreed concerning priestly vocations and
   formation, should be religiously observed where the Church is first
   planted, and among the young churches. Of great importance are the
   things which are said about closely joining spiritual formation with
   the doctrinal and pastoral; about living a life patterned after the
   Gospel without looking out for ones own comfort or that of one's
   family; about cultivating a deep appreciation of the mystery of the
   Church. From all this, they will be well taught to dedicate themselves
   wholly to the service of the Body of Christ and to the work of the
   Gospel, to cleave to their own bishop as his faithful co - workers, and
   to cooperate with their colleagues.(17)

   To attain this general end, the whole training of the students should
   be planned in the light of the mystery of salvation as it is revealed
   in the Scriptures. This mystery of Christ and of man's salvation they
   can discover and live in the liturgy.(18)

   These common requirements of priestly training, including the pastoral
   and practical ones prescribed by the council(19) should be combined
   with an attempt to make contact with their own particular national way
   of thinking and acting. Therefore, let the minds of the students be
   kept open and attuned to an acquaintance and an appreciation of their
   own nation's culture. In their philosophical and theological studies,
   let them consider the points of contact which mediate between the
   traditions and religion of their homeland on the one hand and the
   Christian religion on the other.(20) Likewise, priestly training should
   have an eye to the pastoral needs of that region; and the students
   should learn the history, aim, and method of the Church's missionary
   activity, and the special social, economic, and cultural conditions of
   their own people. Let them be educated in the ecumenical spirit, and
   duly prepared for fraternal dialogue with non - Christians.(21) All
   this demands that studies for the priesthood be undertaken, so far as
   possible, in association and living together with their own people.(22)
   Finally, let care be taken that students are trained in ordinary
   ecclesiastical and financial administration.

   Moreover, suitable priests should be chosen, after a little pastoral
   practice, to pursue higher studies in universities, even abroad and
   especially in Rome as well as in other institutes of learning. In this
   way the young churches will have at hand men from among the local
   clergy equipped with the learning and skill needed for discharging more
   difficult ecclesiastical duties.

   Where episcopal conferences deem it opportune, the order of the
   diaconate should be restored as a permanent state of life according to
   the norms of the Constitution "De Ecclesia."(23) For there are men who
   actually carry out the functions of the deacon's office, either
   preaching the word of God as catechists, or presiding over scattered
   Christian communities in the name of the pastor and the bishop, or
   practicing charity in social or relief work. It is only right to
   strengthen them by the imposition of hands which has come down from the
   Apostles, and to bind them more closely to the altar, that they may
   carry out their ministry more effectively because of the sacramental
   grace of the diaconate.

   17. Likewise worthy of praise are the ranks of men and women
   catechists, well deserving of missionary work to the nations. Imbued
   with the apostolic spirit, they labor much to make an outstanding and
   altogether necessary contribution to the spread of the Faith and of the
   Church.

   In our time, when there are so few clerics to preach the Gospel to such
   great numbers and to exercise the pastoral ministry, the position of
   catechists is of great importance. Therefore their training must be so
   accomplished and so adapted to advances on the cultural level that as
   reliable coworkers of the priestly order, they may perform their task
   well, though it be weighed down with new and greater burdens.

   There should therefore be an increase in the number of schools, both on
   the diocesan and on the regional levels, wherein future catechists may
   study Catholic doctrine, especially in the fields of Scripture and the
   liturgy, as well as catechetical method and pastoral practice; schools
   wherein they can develop in themselves a Christian character, and
   wherein they can devote themselves tirelessly to cultivating piety and
   sanctity of life. Moreover, conventions or courses should be held in
   which at certain times catechists could he refreshed in the disciplines
   and skills useful for their ministry and in which their spiritual life
   could be nourished and strengthened. In addition, for those who devote
   themselves entirely to this work, a decent standard of living should be
   provided, and social security, by paying them a just wage.(24)

   It would be desirable for the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation
   of the Faith to provide special funds for the due training and support
   of catechists. If it seems necessary and fitting, let a special "Opus
   pro Catechists" be founded.

   Moreover, the churches should gratefully acknowledge the noble work
   being done by auxiliary catechists, whose help they will need. These
   preside over the prayers in their communities and teach sacred
   doctrine. Something suitable should be done for their doctrinal and
   spiritual training. Besides, it is to be hoped that, where it seems
   opportune, catechists who are duly trained should receive a "missio
   canonica" in a publicly celebrated liturgical ceremony, so that in the
   eyes of the people they may serve the Faith with greater authority.

   18. Right from the planting stage of the Church, the religious life
   should be carefully fostered. This not only offers precious and
   absolutely necessary assistance to missionary activity, but by a more
   inward consecration made to God in the Church, it also clearly
   manifests and signifies the inner nature of the Christian calling.(25)

   Religious institutes, working to plant the Church, and thoroughly
   Imbued with mystic treasures with which the Church's religious
   tradition is adorned, should strive to give expression to them and to
   hand them on, according to the nature and the genius of each nation.
   Let them reflect attentively on how Christian religious life might be
   able to assimilate the ascetic and contemplative traditions, whose
   seeds were sometimes planted by God in ancient cultures already prior
   to the preaching of the Gospel.

   Various forms of religious life are to be cultivated in the young
   churches, in order that they may display various aspects of the mission
   of Christ and of the life of the Church, and may devote themselves to
   various pastoral works, and prepare their members to exercise them
   rightly. On the other hand, the bishops in their conference should see
   to it that congregations pursuing the same apostolic aims are not
   multiplied to the detriment of the religious life and of the
   apostolate.

   Worthy of special mention are the various projects for causing the
   contemplative life to take root. There are those who in such an attempt
   have kept the essential element of a monastic institution, and are bent
   on implanting the rich tradition of their order; there are others again
   who are returning to the simpler forms of ancient monasticism. But all
   are studiously looking for a genuine adaptation to local conditions.
   Since the contemplative life belongs to the fullness of the Church's
   presence, let it be put into effect everywhere.

CHAPTER III

                             PARTICULAR CHURCHES

   19. The work of planting the Church in a given human community reaches
   a certain goal when the congregation of the faithful already rooted in
   social life and somewhat conformed to the local culture, enjoys a
   certain firmness and stability. That is to say, it is already equipped
   with its own supple (perhaps still insufficient) of local priests,
   Religious, and lay men, and is endowed with these institutions and
   ministries which are necessary for leading and expanding the life of
   the people of God under the guidance of their own bishop.

   In such new churches, the life of the People of God must mature in all
   those fields of Christian life which are to be reformed by the norms of
   this council. The congregations of the faithful become daily more aware
   of their status as communities of faith, liturgy, and love. The laity
   strive by their civic and apostolic activity to set up a public order
   based on justice and love. The means of social communication are put to
   wise use at the opportune time. By a truly Christian life, families
   become seedbeds of the lay apostolate and of vocations to the
   priesthood and the Religious life. Finally, the Faith is taught by an
   adequate catechesis; it is celebrated in a liturgy in harmony with the
   genius of the people, and by suitable canonical legislation, it is
   introduced into upright institutions and local customs.

   The bishops, in turn, each one together with his own college of
   priests, being more and more imbued with the mind of Christ and of the
   Church, feel and live along with the universal Church. Let the young
   church keep up an intimate communion with the whole Church, whose
   tradition they should link to their own culture, in order to increase,
   by a certain mutual exchange of forces, the life of the Mystical
   Body.(1) Hence, stress should be laid on those theological,
   psychological, and human elements which can contribute to fostering
   this sense of communion with the universal Church.

   But these churches, very often located in the poorer portions of the
   globe, are mostly suffering from a very serious lack of priests and of
   material support. Therefore, they are badly in need of the continued
   missionary activity of the whole Church to furnish them with those
   subsidies which serve for the growth of the local Church, and above all
   for the maturity of Christian life. This mission action should also
   furnish help to those churches, founded long since, which are in a
   certain state of regression or weakness.

   Yet these churches should launch a common pastoral effort and suitable
   works to increase the number of vocations to the diocesan clergy and to
   religious institutes, to discern them more readily, and to train them
   more efficiently,(2) so that little by little these churches may be
   able to provide for themselves and to bring aid to others.

   20. Since the particular church is bound to represent the universal
   Church as perfectly as possible, let it realize that it has been sent
   to those also who are living in the same territory with it, and who do
   not yet believe in Christ. By the life witness of each one of the
   faithful and of the whole community, let the particular church be a
   sign which points out Christ to others.

   Furthermore, there is need of the ministry of the word, so that the
   Gospel may reach all. The bishop should be first and foremost a herald
   of the Faith, who leads new disciples to Christ.(3) In order that he
   may properly fulfill this noble task, let him thoroughly study both the
   conditions of his flock, and the private opinions of his countrymen
   concerning God, taking careful note also of those changes which
   urbanization, migrations, and religious indifferentism have introduced.

   The local priests in the young churches should zealously address
   themselves to the work of spreading the Gospel, and join forces with
   the foreign missionaries who form with them one college of priests,
   united under the authority of the bishop. They should do this, not only
   with a view to the feeding the faithful flock, and to the celebrating
   of divine worship, but also to the preaching of the Gospel to those
   outside, let them show themselves ready, and when the occasion presents
   itself, let them with a willing heart offer the bishop their services
   for missionary work in distant and forsaken areas of their own diocese
   or of other dioceses.

   Let religious men and women, and the laity too, show the same fervent
   zeal toward their countrymen, especially toward the poor.

   Episcopal conferences should see to it that biblical, theological,
   spiritual and pastoral refresher courses are held at stated intervals
   with this intention, that amid all vicissitudes and changes the clergy
   may acquire a fuller knowledge of the theological sciences and of
   pastoral methods.

   For the rest, those things which this council has laid down,
   particularly in the Decree on the Life and Work of Priests, should be
   religiously observed.

   In order that this missionary work of the particular church may be
   performed, there is need of qualified ministers, who are to be prepared
   in due time in a way suited to the conditions of each church. Now since
   men are more and more banding together into associations, it is very
   fitting that episcopal conferences should form a common plan concerning
   the dialogue to be held with such associations. But if perchance in
   certain regions, groups of men are to be found who are kept away from
   embracing the Catholic Faith because they cannot adapt themselves to
   the peculiar form which the church has taken in there, it is hoped that
   this condition will be provided for in a special way,(4) until such
   time as all Christians can gather together in one community.
   Let..individual bishops call to their dioceses the missionaries whom
   the Holy See may have on hand for this purpose; or let them receive
   such missionaries glad]y, and support their undertakings effectively.

   In order that this missionary zeal may flourish among those in their
   own homeland, it is very fitting that the young churches should
   participate as soon as possible in the universal missionary work of the
   Church, and send their own missionaries to proclaim the Gospel all over
   the world, even though they themselves are suffering from a shortage of
   clergy. For their communion with the universal Church will be somehow
   brought to perfection when they themselves take an active part in
   missionary zeal toward other nations.

   21. The church has not been really founded, and is not yet fully alive,
   nor is it a perfect sign of Christ among men, unless there is a laity
   worthy of the name working along with the hierarchy. For the Gospel
   cannot be deeply grounded in the abilities, life and work of any people
   without the active presence of laymen. Therefore, even at the very
   founding of a Church, great attention is to be paid to establishing a
   mature, Christian laity.

   For the lay faithful fully belong at one and the same time both to the
   People of God and to civil society: they belong to the nation in which
   they were born; they have begun to share in its cultural treasures by
   means of their education; they are joined to its life by manifold
   social ties; they are cooperating in its progress by their efforts,
   each in his own profession; they feel its problems to be their very
   own, and they are trying to solve them. They also belong to Christ,
   because they were regenerated in the Church by faith and by baptism, so
   that they are Christ's in newness of life and work (cf. 1 Cor. 15:23),
   in order that in Christ, all things may be made subject to God, and
   finally God will be all in all (cf. Cor. 15:28).

   Their main duty, whether they are men or women, is the witness which
   they are bound to bear to Christ by their life and works in the home,
   in their social milieu, and in their own professional circle. In them,
   there must appear the new man created according to God in justice and
   true holiness (cf. Eph. 4:24). But they must give expression to this
   newness of life in the social and cultural framework of their own
   homeland, according to their own national traditions. They must be
   acquainted with this culture; they must heal it and preserve it; they
   must develop it in accordance with modern conditions, and finally
   perfect it in Christ, so that the Faith of Christ and the life of the
   Church are no longer foreign to the society in which they live, but
   begin to permeate and to transform it. Let them be one with their
   fellow countrymen in sincere charity, so that there appears in their
   way of life a new bond of unity and of universal solidarity, which is
   drawn from the mystery of Christ. Let them also spread the Faith of
   Christ among those with whom they live or have professional connections
   - an obligation which is all the more urgent, because very many men can
   hear of Christ and of the Gospel only by means of the laity who are
   their neighbors. In fact, wherever possible, the laity should be
   prepared, in more immediate cooperation with the hierarchy, to fulfill
   a special mission of proclaiming the Gospel and communicating Christian
   teachings, so that they may add vigor to the nascent Church.

   Let the clergy highly esteem the arduous apostolate of the laity. Let
   them train the laity to become conscious of the responsibility which
   they as members of Christ have for all men; let them instruct them
   deeply in the mystery of Christ, introduce them to practical methods,
   and be at their side in difficulties, according to the tenor of the
   Constitution Lumen Gentium and the Decree Apostolicam Actuositatem.

   While pastors and laymen, then, retain each their own state of life and
   their own responsibilities, let the whole young church render one firm
   and vital witness to Christ, and become a shining beacon of the
   salvation which comes to us in Christ.

   22. The seed which is the word of God, watered by divine dew, sprouts
   from the good ground and draws from thence its moisture, which it
   transforms and assimilates into itself, and finally bears much fruit.
   In harmony with the economy of the Incarnation, the young churches,
   rooted in Christ and built up on the foundation of the Apostles, take
   to themselves in a wonderful exchange all the riches of the nations
   which were given to Christ as an inheritance (cf Ps. 2:8). They borrow
   from the customs and traditions of their people, from their wisdom and
   their learning, from their arts and disciplines, all those things which
   can contribute to the glory of their Creator, or enhance the grace of
   their Savior, or dispose Christian life the way it should be.(5)

   To achieve this goal, it is necessary that in each major socio -
   cultural area, such theological speculation should be encouraged, in
   the light of the universal Church's tradition, as may submit to a new
   scrutiny the words and deeds which God has revealed, and which have
   been set down in Sacred Scripture and explained by the Fathers and by
   the magisterium.

   Thus it will be more clearly seen in what ways faith may seek for
   understanding, with due regard for the philosophy and wisdom of these
   peoples; it will be seen in what ways their customs, views on life, and
   social order, can be reconciled with the manner of living taught by
   divine revelation. From here the way will be opened to a more profound
   adaptation in the whole area of Christian life. By this manner of
   acting, every appearance of syncretism and of false particularism will
   be excluded, and Christian life will be accommodated to the genius and
   the dispositions of each culture.(6) Particular traditions, together
   with the peculiar patrimony of each family of nations, illumined by the
   light of the Gospel, can then be taken up into Catholic unity. Finally,
   the young particular churches, adorned with their own traditions, will
   have their own place in the ecclesiastical communion, saving always the
   primacy of Peter's See, which presides over the entire assembly of
   charity.(7)

   And so, it is to be hoped that episcopal conferences within the limits
   of each major socio - cultural territory will so coordinate their
   efforts that they may be able to pursue this proposal of adaptation
   with one mind and with a common plan.

CHAPTER IV

                                MISSIONARIES

   23. Although every disciple of Christ, as far in him lies, has the duty
   of spreading the Faith,(1) Christ the Lord always calls whomever He
   will from among the number of His disciples, to be with Him and to be
   sent by Him to preach to the nations (cf. Mark 3:13). Therefore, by the
   Holy Spirit, who distributes the charismata as He wills for the common
   good (1 Cor. 12:11), He inspires the missionary vocation in the hearts
   of individuals, and at the same time He raises up in the Church certain
   institutes(2) which take as their own special task the duty of
   preaching the Gospel, a duty belonging to the whole Church.

   They are assigned with a special vocation who, being endowed with a
   suitable natural temperament, and being fit as regards talent and other
   qualities, have been trained to undertake mission work;(3) or be they
   autochthonous or be they foreigners: priests, Religious, or laymen.
   Sent by legitimate authority, they go out in faith and obedience to
   those who are far from Christ. They are set apart for the work for
   which they have been taken up (cf. Acts 13:2), as ministers of the
   Gospel, "that the offering up of the Gentiles may become acceptable,
   being sanctified by the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 15:16).

   24. Yet man must respond to God Who calls, and that in such a way, that
   without taking counsel with flesh and blood (Gal. 1:16), he devotes
   himself wholly to the work of the Gospel. This response, however can
   only be given when the Holy Spirit gives His inspiration and His power.
   For he who is sent enters upon the life and mission of Him Who "emptied
   Himself, taking the nature of a slave" (Phil. 2:7). Therefore, he must
   be ready to stay at his vocation for an entire lifetime, and to
   renounce himself and all those whom he thus far considered as his own,
   and instead to "make himself all things to all men" (1 Cor. 9:22).

   Announcing the Gospel to all nations, he confidently makes known the
   mystery of Christ, whose ambassador he is, so that in him he dares to
   speak as he ought (cf. Eph. 6:19; Acts 4:31), not being ashamed of the
   scandal of the Cross. Following in his Master's footsteps, meek and
   humble of heart, he proves that His yoke is easy and His burden light
   (Matt. 11:29ff.) By a truly evangelical life,(4) in much patience, in
   long - suffering, in kindness, in unaffected love (cf. 2 Cor. 6:4ff.),
   he bears witness to his Lord, if need be to the shedding of his blood.
   He will ask of God the power and strength, that he may know that there
   is an overflowing of joy amid much testing of tribulation and deep
   poverty (2 Cor. 8:2). Let him be convinced that obedience is the
   hallmark of the servant of Christ, who redeemed the human race by His
   obedience.

   The heralds of the Gospel lest they neglect the grace which is in them,
   should be renewed day by day in the spirit of their mind (cf. 1 Tim.
   4:14; Eph. 4:23; 2 Cor. 4:16). Their Ordinaries and superiors should
   gather the missionaries together from time to time, that they be
   strengthened in the hope of their calling and may be renewed in the
   apostolic ministry, even in houses expressly set up for this purpose.

   25. For such an exalted task, the future missionary is to be prepared
   by a special spiritual and moral training.(5) For he must have the
   spirit of initiative in beginning, as well as that of constancy in
   carrying through what he has begun; he must be persevering in
   difficulties, patient and strong of heart in bearing with solitude,
   fatigue, and fruitless labor. He will encounter men with an open mind
   and a wide heart; he will gladly take up the duties which are entrusted
   to him; he will with a noble spirit adapt himself to the people's
   foreign way of doing things and to changing circumstances; while in the
   spirit of harmony and mutual charity, he will cooperate with his
   brethren and all who dedicate themselves to the same task, so that
   together with the faithful, they will be one heart and one soul (cf.
   Acts 2:42; 4:32)(7) in imitation of the apostolic community.

   These habits of mind should be earnestly exercised already in his time
   of training; they should be cultivated, and should be uplifted and
   nourished by the spiritual life. Imbued with a living faith and a hope
   that never fails, the missionary should be a man of prayer. Let him
   have an ardent spirit of power and of love and of prudence (cf. 2 Tim.
   1:7). Let him learn to be self - sufficing in whatever circumstances
   (Phil. 4:11); always bearing about in himself the dying of Jesus, so
   that the life of Jesus may work in those to whom he is sent (2 Cor.
   4:10ff.), out of zeal of souls, let him gladly spend all and be spent
   himself for souls (cf. 2 Cor. 12:15ff.), so that "by the daily practice
   of his duty he may grow in the love of God and neighbor."(8) Thus
   obedient to the will of the Father together with Christ, he will
   continue His mission under the hierarchical authority of the Church.

   26. Those who are sent to different nations in order to be good
   ministers of Christ, should he nourished with the "words of faith and
   with good doctrine" (1 Tim. 4:6), which they should draw principally
   from the Sacred Scriptures, studying the mystery of Christ, whose
   heralds and witnesses they will be.

   Therefore, all missionaries - priests, Brothers, Sisters, and lay folk
   - each according to their own state, should be prepared and trained,
   lest they be found unequal to the demands of their future work.(9) From
   the very beginning, their doctrinal training should be so planned that
   it takes in both the universality of the Church and the diversity of
   the world's nations. This holds for all of their studies by which they
   are prepared for the exercise of the ministry, as also for the other
   studies which it would be useful for them to learn, that they may have
   a general knowledge of the peoples, cultures, and religions; not only a
   knowledge that looks to the past, but one that considers the present
   time. For anyone who is going to encounter another people should have a
   great esteem for their patrimony and their language and their customs.
   It is very necessary for the future missionary to devote himself to
   missiological studies: that is, to know the teachings and norms of the
   Church concerning missionary activity, to know along what roads the
   heralds of the Gospel have run in the course of the centuries, and also
   what is the present condition of the missions, and what methods are
   considered more effective at the present time.(8)

   But even though this entire training program is imbued with pastoral
   solicitude, a special and organized apostolic training ought to be
   given, by means of both teaching and practical exercises.(9)

   Brothers and Sisters, in great numbers, should be well instructed and
   prepared in the catechetical art, that they may collaborate still
   better in the apostolate.

   Even those who take part in missionary activity only for a time have to
   be given a training which is suited to their condition.

   All these different kinds of formation should be completed in the lands
   to which they are sent, so that the missionaries may have a more
   thorough knowledge of the history, social structures, and customs of
   the people; that they may have an insight into their moral order and
   their religious precepts, and into the secret notions which, according
   to their sacred tradition, they have formed concerning God, the world
   and man.(10) Let the missionaries learn the languages to such a degree
   that they can use them in a fluent and polished manner, and so find
   more easy access to the minds and the hearts of men. (11) Furthermore,
   they should be properly introduced into special pastoral problems.

   Some should be more thoroughly prepared in missiological institutes or
   in other faculties or universities, so that they may be able to
   discharge special duties more effectively(12) and be a help, by their
   learning, to other missionaries in carrying on the mission work, which
   especially in our time presents so many difficulties and opportunities.
   It is moreover highly desirable that the regional episcopal conferences
   should have available an abundance of such experts, and that they
   should make fruitful use of their knowledge and experience in the
   necessities of their office. Nor should there be wanting some who are
   perfectly skilled in the use of practical instruments and the means of
   social communication, the importance of which should be highly
   appreciated by all.

   27. All these things, though necessary for everyone who is sent to the
   nations, can scarcely be attained to in reality by individual
   missionaries. Since even mission work itself, as experience teaches,
   cannot be accomplished by lone individuals, a common calling has
   gathered these individuals together into institutes, in which, with
   united efforts, they are properly trained and might carry out this work
   in the name of the Church and under the direction of the hierarchy. For
   many centuries, these institutes have borne the burden of the day and
   the heat, devoting themselves to missionary labor either entirely or in
   part. Often vast territories were committed to them by the Holy See for
   evangelization, and there they gathered together a new people for God,
   a local church clinging to their own shepherds. With their zeal and
   experience, they will serve, by fraternal cooperation either in the
   care of souls or in rendering special services for the common good,
   those churches which were founded at the cost of their sweat and even
   of their blood.

   Sometimes, throughout the entire extent of some region, they will take
   certain tasks upon themselves; e.g., the evangelization of groups of
   peoples who perhaps for special reasons have not yet accepted the
   Gospel message, or who have thus far resisted it.(13)

   If need be, let them be on hand to help and train, out of their own
   experience, those who will devote themselves to missionary activity for
   a time.

   For these reasons, and since there are still many nations to be led to
   Christ, the institutes remain extremely necessary.

CHAPTER V

                        PLANNING MISSIONARY ACTIVITY

   28. The Christian faithful, having different gifts (cf. Rom. 12:6),
   according to each one's opportunity, ability, charisms and ministry
   (cf. 1 Cor. 3:10) must all cooperate in the Gospel. Hence all alike,
   those who sow and those who reap (cf. John 4:37), those who plant and
   those who irrigate, must be one (cf. 1 Cor. 3:8), so that "in a free
   and orderly fashion cooperating toward the same end,"(1) they may spend
   their forces harmoniously for the building up of the Church.

   Wherefore, the labors of the Gospel heralds and the help given by the
   rest of the Christian faithful must be so directed and intertwined that
   "all may be done in order" (1 Cor. 14:40) in all fields of missionary
   activity and cooperation.

   29. Since the charge of proclaiming the Gospel in the whole world falls
   primarily on the body of bishops,(2) the synod of bishops or that
   "stable Council of bishops for the entire Church,"(3) among the affairs
   of general concern,(4) should give special consideration to missionary
   activity, which is the greatest and holiest task of the Church.(5)

   For all missions and for the whole of missionary activity there should
   be only one competent office, namely that of the "Propagation of the
   Faith," which should direct and coordinate, throughout the world, both
   missionary work itself and missionary cooperation. However, the law of
   the Oriental Churches is to remain untouched.(6)

   Although the Holy Spirit in diverse manners arouses the mission spirit
   in the Church of God, and oft times anticipates the action of those
   whose task it is to rule the life of the Church, yet for its part, this
   office should promote missionary vocations and missionary spirituality,
   zeal and prayer for the missions, and should put out authentic and
   adequate reports about them. Let it raise up missionaries and
   distribute them according to the more urgent needs of various areas.
   Let it arrange for an orderly plan of action, issue directives and
   principles adapted to evangelization, and give the impetus. Let it take
   care of stimulating and coordinating an effective collection of funds,
   which are to be distributed according to reasons of necessity and
   usefulness, the extent of the territory in question, the number of
   believers and non - believers, of undertakings and institutes, of
   ministers and missionaries.

   In coordination with the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity, let
   it search out ways and means for bringing about and directing fraternal
   cooperation as well as harmonious living with missionary undertaking of
   other Christian communities, that as far as possible the scandal of
   division may be removed.

   Therefore, this office must be both an instrument of administration and
   an organ of dynamic direction, which makes use of scientific methods
   and means suited to the conditions of modern times, always taking into
   consideration present - day research in matters of theology, of
   methodology and missionary pastoral procedure.

   In the direction of this office, an active role with a deliberative
   vote should be had by selected representatives of all those who
   cooperate in missionary work: that is, the bishops of the whole world
   (the episcopal conferences should be heard from in this regard), as
   well as the moderators of pontifical institutes and works, in ways and
   under conditions to be fixed by the Roman Pontiff. All these, being
   called together at stated times, will exercise supreme control of all
   mission work under the authority of the Supreme Pontiff. This office
   should have available a permanent group of expert consultors, of proven
   knowledge and experience, whose duty it will be, among other things to
   gather pertinent information about local conditions in various regions,
   and about the thinking of various groups of men) as well as about the
   means of evangelization to be used. They will then propose
   scientifically based conclusions for mission work and cooperation.

   Institutes of religious women, regional undertakings for the mission
   cause, and organizations of laymen (especially international ones)
   should be suitably represented.

   30. In order that the proper goals and results may be obtained, all
   missionary workers should have but "one heart and one soul" (Acts 4:32)
   in the actual carrying out of mission work itself.

   It is the bishop's role, as the ruler and center of unity in the
   diocesan apostolate, to promote missionary activity, to direct it and
   to coordinate it but always in such a way that the zeal and spontaneity
   of those who share in the work may be preserved and fostered. All
   missionaries, even exempt Religious, are subject to his power in the
   various works which refer to the exercise of the sacred apostolate.(7)
   To improve coordination, let the bishop set up, insofar as possible, a
   pastoral council, in which clergy, Religious, and laity may have a
   part, through the medium of selected delegates. Moreover let them take
   care that apostolic activity be not limited to those only who have
   already been converted. A fair proportion of personnel and funds should
   be assigned to the evangelization of non - Christians.

   31. Episcopal conferences should take common counsel to deal with
   weightier questions and urgent problems, without however neglecting
   local differences.(8) Lest the already insufficient supply of men and
   means be further dissipated, or lest projects be multiplied without
   necessity, it is recommended that they pool their resources to found
   projects which will serve the good of all as for instance, seminaries;
   technical schools and schools of higher learning; pastoral,
   catechetical, and liturgical centers; as well as the means of social
   communication.

   Such cooperation, when indicated, should also be initiated between
   several different episcopal conferences.

   32. It would also be good to coordinate the activities which are being
   carried on by ecclesiastical institutes and associations. All these, of
   whatever kind, should defer to the local Ordinary in all that concerns
   missionary activity itself. Therefore, it will be very helpful to, draw
   up contracts to regulate relations between local Ordinaries and the
   moderator of the institute.

   When a territory has been committed to a certain institute, both the
   ecclesiastical superior and the institute will be concerned to direct
   everything to this end, that the new Christian community may grow into
   a local church, which in due time will be governed by its own pastor
   with his clergy.

   When the commission of a certain territory expires, a new state of
   affairs begins. Then the episcopal conference and the institutes in
   joint deliberation should lay down norms governing the relations
   between local Ordinaries and the institutes.(9) It will be the role of
   Holy See to outline the general principles according to which regional
   and even particular contracts are to be drawn up.

   Although the institutes will be prepared to continue the work which
   they have begun, cooperating in the ordinary ministry of the care of
   souls, yet when the local clergy grows numerous, it will be provided
   that the institute, insofar as this is in agreement with its purpose,
   should remain faithful to the diocese, generously taking over special
   works or some area in it.

   33. The institutes engaged in missionary activity in the same territory
   should find ways and means of coordinating their work. Therefore, it
   will be very useful to have conferences of Religious men and unions of
   Religious women, in which institutes of the same country or region
   should take part. These conferences should ask what things can be done
   by combined efforts, and they should be in close touch with the
   episcopal conferences.

   All these things, with equal reason, should be extended to include the
   cooperation of missionary institutes in the home lands, so that
   questions and joint projects can be settled with less expense, as for
   instance the formation of future missionaries, as well as courses for
   missionaries, relations with public authorities and with international
   or supranational organizations.

   34. Since the right and methodical exercise of missionary activity
   requires that those who labor for the Gospel should be scientifically
   prepared for their task, and especially for dialogue with non -
   Christian religions and cultures, and also that they should be
   effectively assisted in the carrying out of this task, it is desired
   that, for the sake of the missions, there should be fraternal and
   generous collaboration on the part of scientific institutes which
   specialize in missiology and in other arts and disciplines useful for
   the missions, such as ethnology and linguistics, the history and
   science of religions, sociology, pastoral skills and the like.

CHAPTER VI

                                 COOPERATION

   35. Since the whole Church is missionary, and the work of
   evangelization is a basic duty of the People of God, this sacred synod
   invites all to a deep interior renewal; so that, having a vivid
   awareness of their own responsibility for spreading the Gospel, they
   may do their share in missionary work among the nations.

   36. As members of the living Christ, incorporated into Him and made
   like unto Him through baptism and through confirmation and the
   Eucharist, all the faithful are duty - bound to cooperate in the
   expansion and spreading out of His Body, to bring it to fullness as
   soon as may be (Eph. 4:13).

   Therefore, all sons of the Church should have a lively awareness of
   their responsibility to the world; they should foster in themselves a
   truly catholic spirit; they should spend their forces in the work of
   evangelization. And yet, let everyone know that their first and most
   important obligation for the spread of the Faith is this: to lead a
   profoundly Christian life. For their fervor in the service of God and
   their charity toward others will cause a new spiritual wind to blow for
   the whole Church, which will then appear as a sign lifted up among the
   nations (cf. Is. 11:12), "the light of the world" (Matt. 5:14) and "the
   salt of the earth" (Matt. 5:13). This testimony of a good life will
   more easily have its effect if it is given in unison with other
   Christian communities, according to the norms of the Decree on
   Ecumenism, 12.(1) From this renewed spirit, prayer and works of penance
   will be spontaneously offered to God that He may fructify the
   missionaries' work with His grace; and then there will be missionary
   vocations, and the material subsidies which the missions need will be
   forthcoming.

   But in order that each and every one of the Christian faithful may he
   fully acquainted with the present condition of the Church in the world,
   and may hear the voice of the multitudes who cry "Help us!" (cf. Acts
   16:9), modern means of social communication should be used to furnish
   such mission information that the faithful may feel this mission work
   to be their very own, and may open their hearts to such vast and
   profound human needs, and may come to their assistance.

   It is also necessary to coordinate the information, and to cooperate
   with national and international agencies.

   37. But since the People of God lives in communities, especially in
   dioceses and parishes, and becomes somehow visible in them, it is also
   up to these to witness Christ before the nations.

   The grace of renewal cannot grow in communities unless each of these
   extends the range of its charity to the ends of the earth, and devotes
   the same care to those afar off as it does to those who are its own
   members.

   Thus the whole community prays, works together, and exercises its
   activity among the nations through those of its sons whom God has
   chosen for this most excellent task.

   It will be very useful, provided the universal scope of mission work is
   not thereby neglected, to keep in contact with missionaries who are
   from one's own community, or with some parish or diocese in the
   missions, so that the communion between the communities may be made
   visible, and serve for their mutual edification.

   38. All bishops, as members of the body of bishops succeeding to the
   College of Apostles, are consecrated not just for some one diocese, but
   or the salvation of the entire world. The mandate of Christ to preach
   the Gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15) primarily and immediately
   concerns them, with Peter and under Peter. Whence there arises that
   communion and cooperation of churches which is so necessary today for
   carrying on the work of evangelization. In virtue of this communion,
   the individual churches bear the burden of care for them all, and make
   their necessities known to one another, and exchange mutual
   communications regarding their affairs, since the extension of the Body
   of Christ is the duty of the whole College of Bishops.(2)

   In his own diocese, with which he constitutes one unit the bishop,
   stimulating, promoting and directing the work for the missions, makes
   the mission spirit and zeal of the People of God present and as it were
   visible, so that the whole diocese becomes missionary.

   It will be the bishop's task to raise up from among his own people,
   especially the sick and those oppressed by hardship, some souls to
   offer prayers and penance to God with a wide - open heart for the
   evangelization of the world. The bishop will also gladly encourage
   youths and clerics who have vocations to mission institutes, accepting
   it with a grateful spirit if God should call some of them to be
   employed in the missionary activity of the Church. The bishop will
   exhort and help the diocesan congregations to play a role of their own
   in the missions; he will promote the works of mission institutes among
   his own faithful, but most especially the papal mission works. For it
   is only right to give these works pride of place, since they are the
   means of imbuing Catholics from their very infancy with a real
   universal and missionary outlook; and they are also the means of making
   an effective collection of funds to subsidize all missions, each
   according to its needs.(3)

   But since the need for workers in the vineyard of the Lord is growing
   from day to day, and diocesan priests have expressed the wish to play
   an ever greater part in the evangelization of the world, this sacred
   synod desires that the bishops considering the very serious dearth of
   priests which is hindering the evangelization of many areas, should
   send some of their better priests, who offer themselves for mission
   work and have received a suitable preparation, to those dioceses which
   are lacking in clergy, where at least for a time they will exercise
   their missionary ministry in a spirit of service.(4)

   But in order that the missionary activity of the bishops may be
   exercised more effectively for the good of the whole Church, it would
   be expedient for the episcopal conferences to take charge of those
   affairs which concern the orderly cooperation of their own region.

   In their own conference, the bishops should deliberate about dedicating
   to the evangelization of the nations some priests from among the
   diocesan clergy; they should decide what definite offering each diocese
   should be obliged to set aside annually for the work of the missions,
   in proportion to its own budget;(5) they should consider how to direct
   and control the ways and means by which the missions receive direct
   help; they should deal with assisting and if need be, founding,
   missionary institutes and seminaries for diocesan mission clergy, and
   the promoting of closer relations between such institutes and the
   dioceses.

   It also pertains to the episcopal conferences to found and promote
   works for the brotherly reception and due pastoral care of those who
   immigrate from mission lands for the sake of studying or finding work.
   For through them, far - away peoples are sometimes made near; and an
   excellent opportunity is offered to communities which have long been
   Christian to converse with nations which have not yet heard the Gospel,
   and to show them in their own dutiful love and aid, the genuine face of
   Christ.(6)

   39. Priests personally represent Christ, and are collaborators of the
   order of bishops in that threefold sacred task which by its very nature
   belongs to the mission of the Church.(7) Therefore, they should fully
   understand that their life is also consecrated to the service of the
   missions. Now because by means of their own ministry - which consists
   principally in the Eucharist which perfects the Church - they are in
   communion with Christ the Head and are leading others to this
   communion, they cannot help but feel how much is yet wanting to the
   fullness of that Body, and how much therefore must be done that it may
   grow from day to day. They shall therefore plan their pastoral care in
   such a way that it will serve to spread the Gospel among non -
   Christians.

   In their pastoral activities, priests should stir up and preserve amid
   the faithful a zeal for the evangelization of the world, by instructing
   them in sermons and in Christian doctrine courses about the Church's
   task of announcing Christ to all nations; by enlightening Christian
   families about the necessity and the honor of fostering missionary
   vocations among their own sons and daughters, by promoting mission
   fervor in young people from the schools and Catholic associations so
   that among them there may arise future heralds of the Gospel. Let
   priests teach the faithful to pray for the missions, and let them not
   be ashamed to ask alms of them for this purpose, becoming like beggars
   for Christ and for the salvation of souls.

   Professors in seminaries and universities will teach young people the
   true state of the world and of the Church, so that the necessity of a
   more intense evangelization of non - Christians will become clear to
   them and will nurture their zeal. In teaching the dogmatic, biblical,
   moral, and historical branches, they should focus attention on the
   missionary elements therein contained, so that in this way a
   missionary, awareness may be formed in future priests.

   40. Religious institutes of the contemplative and of the active life
   have so far played, and still do play, the main role in the
   evangelization of the world. This sacred synod gladly acknowledges
   their merits and thanks God for all that they have expended for the
   glory of God and the service of souls while exhorting them to go on
   untiringly in the work which they have begun, since they know that the
   virtue of charity, which by reason of their vocation they are bound to
   practice with greater perfection, obliges and impels them to a truly
   catholic spirit and work.(9)

   Institutes of the contemplative life, by their prayers, sufferings, and
   works of penance have a very great importance in the conversion of
   souls, because it is God who sends workers into His harvest when He is
   asked to do so (cf. Matt. 9:38) God who opens the minds of non -
   Christians to hear the Gospel (cf. Acts 16:14), and God who fructifies
   the word of salvation in their hearts (cf. 1 C,or. 3:7). In fact, these
   institutes are asked to found houses in mission areas, as not a few of
   them have already done, so that there, living out their lives in a way
   accommodated to the truly religious traditions of the people, they can
   bear excellent witness among non - Christians to the majesty and love
   of God, as well as to our union in Christ.

   Institutes of the active life, whether they pursue a strictly mission
   ideal or not, should ask themselves sincerely in the presence of God,
   whether they would not be able to extend their activity for the
   expansion of the Kingdom of God among the nations; whether they could
   possibly leave certain ministries to others so that they themselves
   could expend their forces for the missions, whether they could possibly
   undertake activity in the missions, adapting their constitutions if
   necessary, but according to the spirit of their founder; whether their
   members are involved as totally as possible in the mission effort; and
   whether their type of life is a witness to the Gospel accommodated to
   the character and condition of the people.

   Now since, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, secular institutes
   are daily increasing in the Church, their activity, under the authority
   of the bishop, could be fruitful in the missions in many ways as a sign
   of complete dedication to the evangelization of the world.

   41. Laymen cooperate in the Church's work of evangelization; as
   witnesses and at the same time as living instruments, they share in her
   saving mission;(10) especially if they have been called by God and have
   been accepted by the bishop for this work.

   In those lands which are already Christian, laymen cooperate in the
   work of evangelization by nurturing in themselves and in others a
   knowledge and love of the missions; by stimulating vocations in their
   own family, in Catholic associations, and in the schools; by offering
   subsidies of every kind, that they may offer to others that gift of
   Faith which they have received gratis.

   But in mission lands, let laymen, whether foreigners or autochthonous,
   teach in schools, administer temporal goods cooperate in parish and
   diocesan activities, and organize and promote various forms of the lay
   apostolate, in order that the faithful of the young churches may be
   able to take part as soon as possible in the life of the Church.(11)

   Lastly, let laymen gladly offer socio - economic cooperation to peoples
   on the way of development. This cooperation is all the more to be
   praised, the more it concerns itself with founding institutes which
   touch on the basic structures of social life, or which are oriented to
   the training of those who bear the responsibility for the government.

   Worthy of special praise are those laymen who, in universities or in
   scientific institutes, promote by their historical and scientific
   religious research the knowledge of peoples and of religions; thus
   helping the heralds of the Gospel, and preparing for the dialogue with
   non - Chistians.

   They should cooperate in a brotherly spirit with other Christians, with
   non - Christians, and with members of international organizations,
   aways having before their eyes the fact that "the building up of the
   earthly city should have its foundation in the Lord, and should be
   directed towards Him."(12)

   To be equal to all these tasks, laymen need the necessary technical and
   spiritual preparation, which should be given in institutes destined for
   this; so that their lives may be a witness for Christ among non -
   Christians, according to the words of the Apostle: "Do not be a
   stumbling - block to Jews and Greeks and to the Church of God, even as
   I myself in all things please all men, not seeking what is profitable
   to myself but to the many, that they may be saved." (1 Cor. 10:32-33).
