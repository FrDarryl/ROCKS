The General Council of Chalcedon, 451

Introduction

   It was the emperor Marcian who, after the "robber" council of Ephesus
   (449), commanded this council to meet. Pope Leo I was opposed to it.
   His view was that all the bishops should repent of their ways and
   individually sign his earlier dogmatic letter to Flavian, patriarch of
   Constantinople, and so avoid a new round of argument and debate.
   Moreover, the provinces of the West were being laid waste by Attila's
   invasions. But before the pope's view became known, the emperor Marcian
   had, by an edict of 17 May 451, convoked the council for 1 September
   451. Although the pope was displeased, he sent legates: Paschasinus
   bishop of Lilybaeum, Bishop Lucentius, the priests Boniface and Basil,
   and Bishop Julian of Cos. No doubt Leo thought that the council would
   cause people to leave the church and go into schism. So he wanted it to
   be postponed for a time, and he implored the emperor that the faith
   handed down from ancient times should not become the subject of debate.
   The only business should be the restoration of the exiled bishops to
   their former positions.
   The council was convoked at Nicaea but later transferred to Chalcedon,
   so as to be close to Constantinople and the emperor. It began on 8
   October 451. The legates Paschasinus, Bishop Lucentius and the priest
   Boniface presided, while Julian of Cos sat among the bishops. By their
   side were the imperial commissars and those serving on the Senate,
   whose responsibility was simply to keep order in the council's
   deliberations.
   The lists we have of those present are unsatisfactory. According to Leo
   there were 600 bishops at the council, whereas according to a letter to
   him there were 500.
   The "Definition of the faith" was passed at the council's fifth
   session, and was solemnly promulgated at the sixth session in the
   presence of the emperor and the imperial authorities. The formula
   accepted in the decree is: Christ is one in two natures. This is in
   agreement with Leo's letter to Flavian of Constantinople, and Leo's
   letter is expressly mentioned in the Definition of the faith .
   The council also issued 27 disciplinary canons (it is unclear at which
   session).
   What is usually called canon 28 (on the honour to be accorded the see
   of Constantinople) is in fact a resolution passed by the council at the
   16th session. It was rejected by the Roman legates.
   In the ancient Greek collections, canons 29 and 30 are also attributed
   to the council:
     * canon 29 is an extract from the minutes of the 19th session; and
     * canon 30 is an extract from the minutes of the 4th session.

   Because of canon 28, which the Roman legates had opposed, the emperor
   Marcian and Anatolius, patriarch of Constantinople, sought approval for
   the council from the pope. This is clear from a letter of Anatolius
   which tries to defend the canon, and especially from a letter of
   Marcian which explicitly requests confirmation. Because heretics were
   misinterpreting his withholding approval, the pope ratified the
   doctrinal decrees on 21 March 453, but rejected canon 28 since it ran
   counter to the canons of Nicaea and to the privileges of particular
   churches.
   The imperial promulgation was made by Emperor Marcian in 4 edicts of
   February 452.
   Apart from Pope Leo's letter to Flavian, which is in Latin, the English
   translation is from the Greek text, since this is the more
   authoritative version.

The letter of Pope Leo to Flavian, bishop of Constantinople, about Eutyches

   Surprised as we were at the late arrival of your charity's letter, we
   read it and examined the account of what the bishops had done. We now
   see what scandal against the integrity of the faith had reared its head
   among you. What had previously been kept secret now became clearly
   revealed to us. Eutyches, who was considered a man of honour because he
   had the title of priest, is shown to be very rash and extremely
   ignorant. What the prophet said can be applied to him: He did not want
   to understand and do good: he plotted evil in his bed. What can be
   worse than to have an irreligious mind and to pay no heed to those who
   are wiser and more learned? The people who fall into this folly are
   those in whom knowledge of the truth is blocked by a kind of dimness.
   They do not refer to
     * the sayings of the prophets, nor to
     * to the letters of the apostles, nor even to
     *

   the authoritative words of the gospels, but to themselves. By not being
   pupils of the truth, they turn out to be masters of error. A man who
   has not the most elementary understanding even of the creed itself can
   have learnt nothing from the sacred texts of the New and Old
   Testaments. This old man has not yet taken to heart what is pronounced
   by every baptismal candidate the world over!
   He had no idea how he ought to think about the incarnation of the Word
   of God; and he had no desire to acquire the light of understanding by
   working through the length and breadth of the holy scriptures. So at
   least he should have listened carefully and accepted the common and
   undivided creed by which the whole body of the faithful confess that
   they believe in
    1. God the Father almighty
    2. and in Jesus Christ his only Son, our Lord,
    3. who was born of the holy Spirit and the virgin Mary.

   These three statements wreck the tricks of nearly every heretic. When
   God is believed to be both almighty and Father, the Son is clearly
   proved to be co-eternal with him, in no way different from the Father,
   since he was born God from God, almighty from the Almighty, co-eternal
   from the Eternal, not later in time, not lower in power, not unlike in
   glory, not distinct in being. The same eternal, only-begotten of the
   eternal begetter was born of the holy Spirit and the virgin Mary. His
   birth in time in no way subtracts from or adds to that divine and
   eternal birth of his: but its whole purpose is to restore humanity, who
   had been deceived, so that it might defeat death and, by its power,
   destroy the devil who held the power of death. Overcoming the
   originator of sin and death would be beyond us, had not he whom sin
   could not defile, nor could death hold down, taken up our nature and
   made it his own. He was conceived from the holy Spirit inside the womb
   of the virgin mother. Her virginity was as untouched in giving him
   birth as it was in conceiving him.
   But if it was beyond Eutyches to derive sound understanding from this,
   the purest source of the christian faith, because the brightness of
   manifest truth had been darkened by his own peculiar blindness, then he
   should have subjected himself to the teaching of the gospels. When
   Matthew says, The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David,
   son of Abraham, Eutyches should have looked up the further development
   in the apostolic preaching. When he read in the letter to the Romans,
   Paul, the servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart
   for God's gospel, which he had formerly promised through his prophets
   in the holy writings which refer to his Son, who was made for him of
   David's seed according to the flesh, he should have paid deep and
   devout attention to the prophetic texts. And when he discovered God
   making the promise to Abraham that in your seed shall all nations be
   blessed, he should have followed the apostle, in order to eliminate any
   doubt about the identity of this seed, when he says, The promises were
   spoken to Abraham and his seed . He does not say "to his seeds"--as if
   referring to a multiplicity--but to a single one, "and to thy seed "
   which is Christ. His inward ear should also have heard Isaiah preaching
   Behold, a virgin will receive in the womb and will bear a son, and they
   will call his name Emmanuel, which is translated "God is with us". With
   faith he should have read the same prophet's words, A child is born to
   us, a son is given to us. His power is on his shoulders. They will call
   his name "Angel of great counsel, mighty God, prince of peace, father
   of the world to come". Then he would not deceive people by saying that
   the Word was made flesh in the sense that he emerged from the virgin's
   womb having a human form but not having the reality of his mother's
   body.
   Or was it perhaps that he thought that our lord Jesus Christ did not
   have our nature because the angel who was sent to the blessed Mary
   said, The holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most High
   will overshadow you, and so that which will be born holy out of you
   will be called Son of God, as if it was because the conception by the
   virgin was worked by God that the flesh of the one conceived did not
   share the nature of her who conceived it? But uniquely wondrous and
   wondrously unique as that act of generation was, it is not to be
   understood as though the proper character of its kind was taken away by
   the sheer novelty of its creation. It was the holy Spirit that made the
   virgin pregnant, but the reality of the body derived from body. As
   Wisdom built a house for herself, the Word was made flesh and dwelt
   amongst us: that is, in that flesh which he derived from human kind and
   which he animated with the spirit of a rational life.
   So the proper character of both natures was maintained and came
   together in a single person. Lowliness was taken up by majesty,
   weakness by strength, mortality by eternity. To pay off the debt of our
   state, invulnerable nature was united to a nature that could suffer; so
   that in a way that corresponded to the remedies we needed, one and the
   same mediator between God and humanity the man Christ Jesus, could both
   on the one hand die and on the other be incapable of death. Thus was
   true God born in the undiminished and perfect nature of a true man,
   complete in what is his and complete in what is ours. By "ours" we mean
   what the Creator established in us from the beginning and what he took
   upon himself to restore. There was in the Saviour no trace of the
   things which the Deceiver brought upon us, and to which deceived
   humanity gave admittance. His subjection to human weaknesses in common
   with us did not mean that he shared our sins. He took on the form of a
   servant without the defilement of sin, thereby enhancing the human and
   not diminishing the divine. For that self-emptying whereby the
   Invisible rendered himself visible, and the Creator and Lord of all
   things chose to join the ranks of mortals, spelled no failure of power:
   it was an act of merciful favour. So the one who retained the form of
   God when he made humanity, was made man in the form of a servant. Each
   nature kept its proper character without loss; and just as the form of
   God does not take away the form of a servant, so the form of a servant
   does not detract from the form of God.
   It was the devil's boast that humanity had been deceived by his
   trickery and so had lost the gifts God had given it; and that it had
   been stripped of the endowment of immortality and so was subject to the
   harsh sentence of death. He also boasted that, sunk as he was in evil,
   he himself derived some consolation from having a partner in crime; and
   that God had been forced by the principle of justice to alter his
   verdict on humanity, which he had created in such an honourable state.
   All this called for the realisation of a secret plan whereby the
   unalterable God, whose will is indistinguishable from his goodness,
   might bring the original realisation of his kindness towards us to
   completion by means of a more hidden mystery, and whereby humanity,
   which had been led into a state of sin by the craftiness of the devil,
   might be prevented from perishing contrary to the purpose of God.
   So without leaving his Father's glory behind, the Son of God comes down
   from his heavenly throne and enters the depths of our world, born in an
   unprecedented order by an unprecedented kind of birth. In an
   unprecedented order, because one who is invisible at his own level was
   made visible at ours. The ungraspable willed to be grasped. Whilst
   remaining pre-existent, he begins to exist in time. The Lord of the
   universe veiled his measureless majesty and took on a servant's form.
   The God who knew no suffering did not despise becoming a suffering man,
   and, deathless as he is, to be subject to the laws of death. By an
   unprecedented kind of birth, because it was inviolable virginity which
   supplied the material flesh without experiencing sexual desire. What
   was taken from the mother of the Lord was the nature without the guilt.
   And the fact that the birth was miraculous does not imply that in the
   lord Jesus Christ, born from the virgin's womb, the nature is different
   from ours. The same one is true God and true man.
   There is nothing unreal about this oneness, since both the lowliness of
   the man and the grandeur of the divinity are in mutual relation. As God
   is not changed by showing mercy, neither is humanity devoured by the
   dignity received. The activity of each form is what is proper to it in
   communion with the other: that is, the Word performs what belongs to
   the Word, and the flesh accomplishes what belongs to the flesh. One of
   these performs brilliant miracles the other sustains acts of violence.
   As the Word does not lose its glory which is equal to that of the
   Father, so neither does the flesh leave the nature of its kind behind.
   We must say this again and again: one and the same is truly Son of God
   and truly son of man. God, by the fact that in the beginning was the
   Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; man, by the fact
   that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. God, by the fact that
   all things were made through him, and nothing was made without him,
   man, by the fact that he was made of a woman, made under the law. The
   birth of flesh reveals human nature; birth from a virgin is a proof of
   divine power. A lowly cradle manifests the infancy of the child;
   angels' voices announce the greatness of the most High. Herod evilly
   strives to kill one who was like a human being at the earliest stage
   the Magi rejoice to adore on bended knee one who is the Lord of all.
   And when he came to be baptised by his precursor John, the Father's
   voice spoke thunder from heaven, to ensure that he did not go unnoticed
   because the divinity was concealed by the veil of flesh: This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Accordingly, the same one whom
   the devil craftily tempts as a man, the angels dutifully wait on as
   God. Hunger, thirst, weariness, sleep are patently human. But to
   satisfy five thousand people with five loaves; to dispense living water
   to the Samaritan woman, a drink of which will stop her being thirsty
   ever again; to walk on the surface of the sea with feet that do not
   sink; to rebuke the storm and level the mounting waves; there can be no
   doubt these are divine.
   So, if I may pass over many instances, it does not belong to the same
   nature to weep out of deep-felt pity for a dead friend, and to call him
   back to life again at the word of command, once the mound had been
   removed from the four-dayold grave; or to hang on the cross and, with
   day changed into night, to make the elements tremble; or to be pierced
   by nails and to open the gates of paradise for the believing thief.
   Likewise, it does not belong to the same nature to say I and the Father
   are one, and to say The Father is greater than I. For although there is
   in the Lord Jesus Christ a single person who is of God and of man, the
   insults shared by both have their source in one thing, and the glory
   that is shared in another. For it is from us that he gets a humanity
   which is less than the Father; it is from the Father that he gets a
   divinity which is equal to the Father.
   So it is on account of this oneness of the person, which must be
   understood in both natures, that we both read that the son of man came
   down from heaven, when the Son of God took flesh from the virgin from
   whom he was born, and again that the Son of God is said to have been
   crucified and buried, since he suffered these things not in the
   divinity itself whereby the Only-begotten is co-eternal and
   consubstantial with the Father, but in the weakness of the human
   nature. That is why in the creed, too, we all confess that the
   only-begotten Son of God was crucified and was buried, following what
   the apostle said, If they had known, they would never have crucified
   the Lord of majesty. And when our Lord and Saviour himself was
   questioning his disciples and instructing their faith, he says, Who do
   people say 1, the son of man, am? And when they had displayed a variety
   of other people's opinions, he says, Who do you say I am ? --in other
   words, I who am the son of man and whom you behold in the form of a
   servant and in real flesh: Who do you say I am? Whereupon the blessed
   Peter, inspired by God and making a confession that would benefit all
   future peoples, says, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. He
   thoroughly deserved to be declared "blessed" by the Lord. He derived
   the stability of both his goodness and his name from the original Rock,
   for when the Father revealed it to him, he confessed that the same one
   is both the Son of God and also the Christ. Accepting one of these
   truths without the other was no help to salvation; and to have believed
   that the Lord Jesus Christ was either only God and not man, or solely
   man and not God, was equally dangerous.
   After the Lord's resurrection--which was certainly the resurrection of
   a real body, since the one brought back to life is none other than the
   one who had been crucified and had died--the whole point of the
   forty-day delay was to make our faith completely sound and to cleanse
   it of all darkness. Hence he talked to his disciples and lived and ate
   with them, and let himself be touched attentively and carefully by
   those who were in the grip of doubt; he would go in among his disciples
   when the doors were locked, and impart the holy Spirit by breathing on
   them, and open up the secrets of the holy scriptures after enlightening
   their understanding; again, he would point out the wound in his side,
   the holes made by the nails, and all the signs of the suffering he had
   just recently undergone, saying, Look at my hands and feet--it is I.
   Feel and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see
   that I have. All this was so that it would be recognised that the
   proper character of the divine and of the human nature went on existing
   inseparable in him; and so that we would realise that the Word is not
   the same thing as the flesh, but in such a way that we would confess
   belief in the one Son of God as being both Word and flesh.
   This Eutyches must be judged to be extremely destitute of this mystery
   of the faith. Neither the humility of the mortal life nor the glory of
   the resurrection has made him recognise our nature in the only-begotten
   of God. Nor has even the statement of the blessed apostle and
   evangelist John put fear into him: Every spirit which confesses that
   Jesus Christ came in the flesh is from God, and every spirit which puts
   Jesus asunder is not from God, and this is Antichrist. But what does
   putting Jesus as under consist in if not in separating his human nature
   from him, and in voiding, through the most barefaced fictions, the one
   mystery by which we have been saved? Once in the dark about the nature
   of Christ's body, it follows that the same blindness leads him into
   raving folly about his suffering too. If he does not think that the
   Lord's cross was unreal and if he has no doubt that the suffering
   undergone for the world's salvation was real, then let him acknowledge
   the flesh of the one whose death he believes in. And let him not deny
   that a man whom he knows to have been subject to suffering had our kind
   of body, for to deny the reality of the flesh is also to deny the
   bodily suffering. So if he accepts the christian faith and does not
   turn a deaf ear to the preaching of the gospel, let him consider what
   nature it was that hung, pierced with nails, on the wood of the cross.
   With the side of the crucified one laid open by the soldier's spear,
   let him identify the source from which blood and water flowed, to bathe
   the church of God with both font and cup.
   Let him heed what the blessed apostle Peter preaches, that
   sanctification by the Spirit is effected by the sprinkling of Christ's
   blood; and let him not skip over the same apostle's words, knowing that
   you have been redeemed from the empty way of life you inherited from
   your fathers, not with corruptible gold and silver but by the precious
   blood of Jesus Christ, as of a lamb without stain or spot. Nor should
   he withstand the testimony of blessed John the apostle: and the blood
   of Jesus, the Son of God, purifies us from every sin; and again, This
   is the victory which conquers the world, our faith. Who is there who
   conquers the world save one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ?
   It is he, Jesus Christ who has come through water and blood, not in
   water only, but in water and blood. And because the Spirit is truth, it
   is the Spirit who testifies. For there are three who give
   testimony--Spirit and water and blood. And the three are one. In other
   words, the Spirit of sanctification and the blood of redemption and the
   water of baptism. These three are one and remain indivisible. None of
   them is separable from its link with the others. The reason is that it
   is by this faith that the catholic church lives and grows, by believing
   that neither the humanity is without true divinity nor the divinity
   without true humanity.
   When you cross-examined Eutyches and he replied, "I confess that our
   Lord was of two natures before the union, but I confess one nature
   after the union", I am amazed that such an absurd and corrupt
   declaration of faith was not very severely censured by the judges; and
   that an extremely foolish statement was disregarded, as if nothing
   whatever offensive had been heard. It is just as wicked to say that the
   only-begotten Son of God was of two natures before the incarnation as
   it is abominable to claim that there was a single nature in him after
   the Word was made flesh. Eutyches must not suppose that what he said
   was either correct or tolerable just because no clear statement of
   yours refuted it. So we remind you, dearest brother, of your charity's
   responsibility to see to it that if through God's merciful inspiration
   the case is ever settled, the rash and ignorant fellow is also purged
   of what is blighting his mind. As the minutes have made clear, he made
   a good start at abandoning his opinion when, under pressure from your
   statement, he professed to say what he had not previously said, and to
   find satisfaction in the faith to which he had previously been a
   stranger. But when he had refused to be party to the anathematising of
   his wicked doctrine, your fraternity would have realised that he was
   persisting in his false belief and that he deserved a verdict of
   condemnation. If he is honestly and suitably sorry about this, and
   acknowledges even at this late stage how rightly episcopal authority
   was set in motion, or if, to make full amends, he condemns every wrong
   thought he had by word of mouth and by his actual signature, then no
   amount of mercy towards one who has reformed is excessive. Our Lord,
   the true and good shepherd who laid down his life for his sheep, and
   who came not to destroy but to save the souls of men and women, wants
   us to be imitators of his goodness, so that whilst justice represses
   sinners, mercy does not reject the converted. The defence of the true
   faith is never so productive as when false opinion is condemned even by
   its adherents.
   In place of ourself, we have arranged for our brothers, Bishop Julius
   and the priest Renatus of the church of St Clement, and also my son,
   the deacon Hilary, to ensure a good and faithful conclusion to the
   whole case. To their company we have added our notary Dulcitius, of
   proven loyalty to us. We trust that with God's help he who has fallen
   into error might condemn the wickedness of his own mind and find
   salvation.
   God keep you safe, dearest brother.

Definition of the faith

   The sacred and great and universal synod by God's grace and by decree
   of your most religious and Christ-loving emperors Valentinian Augustus
   and Marcian Augustus assembled in Chalcedon, metropolis of the province
   of Bithynia, in the shrine of the saintly and triumphant martyr
   Euphemia, issues the following decrees.
   In establishing his disciples in the knowledge of the faith, our lord
   and saviour Christ said: "My peace I give you, my peace I leave to
   you"', so that no one should disagree with his neighbour regarding
   religious doctrines but that the proclamation of the truth would be
   uniformly presented. But the evil one never stops trying to smother the
   seeds of religion with his own tares and is for ever inventing some
   novelty or other against the truth; so the Master, exercising his usual
   care for the human race, roused this religious and most faithful
   emperor to zealous action, and summoned to himself the leaders of the
   priesthood from everywhere, so that through the working of the grace of
   Christ, the master of all of us, every injurious falsehood might be
   staved off from the sheep of Christ and they might be fattened on fresh
   growths of the truth.
   This is in fact what we have done. We have driven off erroneous
   doctrines by our collective resolution and we have renewed the unerring
   creed of the fathers. We have proclaimed to all the creed of the 318;
   and we have made our own those fathers who accepted this agreed
   statement of religion -- the 150 who later met in great Constantinople
   and themselves set their seal to the same creed.
   Therefore, whilst we also stand by
     * the decisions and all the formulas relating to the creed from the
       sacred synod which took place formerly at Ephesus,
          + whose leaders of most holy memory were Celestine of Rome and
            Cyril of Alexandria

   we decree that
     * pre-eminence belongs to the exposition of the right and spotless
       creed of the 318 saintly and blessed fathers who were assembled at
       Nicaea when Constantine of pious memory was emperor: and that
     * those decrees also remain in force which were issued in
       Constantinople by the 150 holy fathers in order to destroy the
       heresies then rife and to confirm this same catholic and apostolic
       creed.
          + The creed of the 318 fathers at Nicaea.
          + And the same of the 150 saintly fathers assembled in
            Constantinople.

   This wise and saving creed, the gift of divine grace, was sufficient
   for a perfect understanding and establishment of religion. For its
   teaching about the Father and the Son and the holy Spirit is complete,
   and it sets out the Lord's becoming human to those who faithfully
   accept it.
   But there are those who are trying to ruin the proclamation of the
   truth, and through their private heresies they have spawned novel
   formulas:
     * some by daring to corrupt the mystery of the Lord's economy on our
       behalf, and refusing to apply the word "God-bearer" to the Virgin;
       and
     * others by introducing a confusion and mixture, and mindlessly
       imagining that there is a single nature of the flesh and the
       divinity, and fantastically supposing that in the confusion the
       divine nature of the Only-begotten is passible.

   Therefore this sacred and great and universal synod, now in session, in
   its desire to exclude all their tricks against the truth, and teaching
   what has been unshakeable in the proclamation from the beginning,
     * decrees that the creed of the 318 fathers is, above all else, to
       remain inviolate. And because of those who oppose the holy Spirit,
       it
     * ratifies the teaching about the being of the holy Spirit handed
       down by the 150 saintly fathers who met some time later in the
       imperial city
          + the teaching they made known to all,
     * not introducing anything left out by their predecessors, but
       clarifying their ideas about the holy Spirit by the use of
       scriptural testimonies against those who were trying to do away
       with his sovereignty.

   And because of those who are attempting to corrupt the mystery of the
   economy and are shamelessly and foolishly asserting that he who was
   born of the holy virgin Mary was a mere man, it has accepted
     * the synodical letters of the blessed Cyril, [already accepted by
       the Council of Ephesus] pastor of the church in Alexandria, to
       Nestorius and to the Orientals, as being well-suited to refuting
       Nestorius's mad folly and to providing an interpretation for those
       who in their religious zeal might desire understanding of the
       saving creed.

   To these it has suitably added, against false believers and for the
   establishment of orthodox doctrines
     * the letter of the primate of greatest and older Rome, the most
       blessed and most saintly Archbishop Leo, written to the sainted
       Archbishop Flavian to put down Eutyches's evil-mindedness, because
       it is in agreement with great Peter's confession and represents a
       support we have in common.

   It is opposed to those who attempt to tear apart the mystery of the
   economy into a duality of sons; and
     * it expels from the assembly of the priests those who dare to say
       that the divinity of the Only-begotten is passible, and
     * it stands opposed to those who imagine a mixture or confusion
       between the two natures of Christ;
     * and it expels those who have the mad idea that the servant-form he
       took from us is of a heavenly or some other kind of being; and it
       anathematises those who concoct two natures of the Lord before the
       union but imagine a single one after the union.

   So, following the saintly fathers, we all with one voice teach the
   confession of one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: the same
   perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, the same truly God and
   truly man, of a rational soul and a body; consubstantial with the
   Father as regards his divinity, and the same consubstantial with us as
   regards his humanity; like us in all respects except for sin; begotten
   before the ages from the Father as regards his divinity, and in the
   last days the same for us and for our salvation from Mary, the virgin
   God-bearer as regards his humanity; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord,
   only-begotten, acknowledged in two natures which undergo no confusion,
   no change, no division, no separation; at no point was the difference
   between the natures taken away through the union, but rather the
   property of both natures is preserved and comes together into a single
   person and a single subsistent being; he is not parted or divided into
   two persons, but is one and the same only-begotten Son, God, Word, Lord
   Jesus Christ, just as the prophets taught from the beginning about him,
   and as the Lord Jesus Christ himself instructed us, and as the creed of
   the fathers handed it down to us.
   Since we have formulated these things with all possible accuracy and
   attention, the sacred and universal synod decreed that no one is
   permitted to produce, or even to write down or compose, any other creed
   or to think or teach otherwise. As for those who dare either to compose
   another creed or even to promulgate or teach or hand down another creed
   for those who wish to convert to a recognition of the truth from
   Hellenism or from Judaism, or from any kind of heresy at all: if they
   be bishops or clerics, the bishops are to be deposed from the
   episcopacy and the clerics from the clergy; if they be monks or
   layfolk, they are to be anathematised.

CANONS

Canon 1.

   We have deemed it right that the canons hitherto issued by the saintly
   fathers at each and every synod should remain in force.

Canon 2.

   If any bishop performs an ordination for money and puts the unsaleable
   grace on sale, and ordains for money a bishop, a chorepiscopus, a
   presbyter or a deacon or some other of those numbered among the clergy;
   or appoints a manager, a legal officer or a warden for money, or any
   other ecclesiastic at all for personal sordid gain; led him who has
   attempted this and been convicted stand to lose his personal rank; and
   let the person ordained profit nothing from the ordination or
   appointment he has bought; but let him be removed from the dignity or
   responsibility which he got for money. And if anyone appears to have
   acted even as a go-between in such disgraceful and unlawful dealings,
   let him too, if he is a cleric, be demoted from his personal rank, and
   if he is a lay person or a monk, let him be anathematised.

Canon 3.

   It has come to the notice of the sacred synod that some of those
   enrolled in the clergy are, for sordid gain, acting as hired managers
   of other people's property, and are involving themselves in worldly
   business, neglecting the service of God, frequenting the houses of
   worldly persons and taking over the handling of property out of
   avarice. So the sacred and great synod has decreed that in future no
   one, whether a bishop, a cleric or a monk, should either manage
   property or involve himself as an administrator of worldly business,
   unless he is legally and unavoidably summoned to take care of minors,
   or the local bishop appoints him to attend, out of fear of the Lord, to
   ecclesiastical business or to orphans and unprovided widows and persons
   in special need of ecclesiastical support. If in future anyone attempts
   to transgress these decrees, he must be subject to ecclesiastical
   penalties.

Canon 4.

   Those who truly and sincerely live the monastic life should be accorded
   appropriate recognition. But since there are some who don the monastic
   habit and meddle with the churches and in civil matters, and circulate
   indiscriminately in the cities and even are involved in founding
   monasteries for themselves, it has been decided that no one is to build
   or found a monastery or oratory anywhere against the will of the local
   bishop; and that monks of each city and region are to be subject to the
   bishop, are to foster peace and quiet, and attend solely to fasting and
   prayer, staying set apart in their places. They are not to abandon
   their own monasteries and interfere, or take part, in ecclesiastical or
   secular business unless they are perhaps assigned to do so by the local
   bishop because of some urgent necessity. No slave is to be taken into
   the monasteries to become a monk against the will of his own master. We
   have decreed that anyone who transgresses this decision of ours is to
   be excommunicated, lest God's name be blasphemed. However, it is for
   the local bishop to exercise the care and attention that the
   monasteries need.

Canon 5.

   In the matter of bishops or clerics who move from city to city, it has
   been decided that the canons issued by the holy fathers concerning them
   should retain their proper force.

Canon 6.

   No one, whether presbyter or deacon or anyone at all who belongs to the
   ecclesiastical order, is to be ordained without title, unless the one
   ordained is specially assigned to a city or village church or to a
   martyr's shrine or a monastery. The sacred synod has decreed that the
   ordination of those ordained without title is null, and that they
   cannot operate anywhere, because of the presumption of the one who
   ordained them.

Canon 7.

   We decree that those who have once joined the ranks of the clergy or
   have become monks are not to depart on military service or for secular
   office. Those who dare do this, and do not repent and return to what,
   in God, they previously chose, are to be anathematised.

Canon 8.

   Clerics in charge of almshouses and monasteries and martyrs' shrines
   are, in accordance with the tradition of the holy fathers, to remain
   under the jurisdiction of the bishop in each city. They are not to be
   self-willed and rebellious towards their own bishop. Those who dare to
   break a rule of this kind in any way whatever, and are not obedient to
   their own bishop, are, if they are clerics, to be subject to the
   canonical penalties; and if they are monks or layfolk they are to be
   made excommunicate.

Canon 9.

   If any cleric has a case to bring against a cleric, let him not leave
   his own bishop and take himself off to the secular courts, but let him
   first air the problem before his own bishop, or at least, with the
   permission of the bishop himself, before those whom both parties are
   willing to see act as arbiters of their lawsuit. If anyone acts in a
   contrary fashion, let him be subject to canonical penalties. If a
   cleric has a case to bring either against his own or against another
   bishop, let him bring the case to the synod of the province. If a
   bishop or a cleric is in dispute with the metropolitan of the same
   province, let him engage either the exarch of the diocese or the see of
   imperial Constantinople, and let him bring his case before him.

Canon 10.

   A cleric is not allowed to be appointed to churches in two cities at
   the same time: to the one where he was originally ordained, and to
   another more important one to which he has betaken himself out of
   desire to increase a baseless reputation. Those who do this are to be
   sent back to their own church in which they were ordained at the
   beginning, and only there are they to serve. But if some have already
   been transferred from one church to another, they are not to take part
   in any of the affairs of their former church, or of the martyrs'
   shrines or almshouses or hospices that come under it. The sacred synod
   has decreed that those who, subsequent to this decree of this great and
   universal synod, dare to do anything that is now forbidden are to lose
   their personal rank.

Canon 11.

   We have decreed that, subject to examination, all paupers and needy
   persons are to travel with ecclesiastical letters or letters of peace
   only, and not of commendation, since it befits only reputable persons
   to be provided with letters of commendation.

Canon 12.

   It has come to our notice that, contrary to the ecclesiastical
   regulations, some have made approaches to the civil authorities and
   have divided one province into two by official mandate, with the result
   that there are two metropolitans in the same province. The sacred synod
   therefore decrees that in future no bishop should dare do such a thing,
   since he who attempts it stands to lose his proper station. Such places
   as have already been honoured by imperial writ with the title of
   metropolis must treat it simply as honorary, and that goes also for the
   bishop who is in charge of the church there, without prejudice of
   course to the proper rights of the real metropolis.

Canon 13.

   Foreign clerics and readers without letters of commendation from their
   own bishop are absolutely forbidden to serve in another city.

Canon 14.

   Since in certain provinces readers and cantors have been allowed to
   marry, the sacred synod decrees that none of them is permitted to marry
   a wife of heterodox views. If those thus married have already had
   children, and if they have already had the children baptised among
   heretics, they are to bring them into the communion of the catholic
   church. If they have not been baptised, they may no longer have them
   baptised among heretics; nor indeed marry them to a heretic or a Jew or
   a Greek, unless of course the person who is to be married to the
   orthodox party promises to convert to the orthodox faith. If anyone
   transgresses this decree of the sacred synod, let him be subject to
   canonical penalty.

Canon 15.

   No woman under forty years of age is to be ordained a deacon, and then
   only after close scrutiny. If after receiving ordination and spending
   some time in the ministry she despises God's grace and gets married,
   such a person is to be anathematised along with her spouse.

Canon 16.

   It is not permitted for a virgin who has dedicated herself to the Lord
   God, or similarly for a monk, to contract marriage. If it is discovered
   that they have done so, let them be made excommunicate. However, we
   have decreed that the local bishop should have discretion to deal
   humanely with them.

Canon 17.

   Rural or country parishes belonging to a church are to stay firmly tied
   to the bishops who have possession of them, and especially if they have
   continually and peacefully administered them over a thirty-year period.
   If, however, within the thirty years any dispute about them has arisen,
   or should arise, those who are claiming to be wronged are permitted to
   bring the case before the provincial synod. If there are any who are
   wronged by their own metropolitan, let their case be judged either by
   the exarch of the diocese or by the see of Constantinople, as has
   already been said. If any city has been newly erected, or is erected
   hereafter, by imperial decree, let the arrangement of ecclesiastical
   parishes conform to the civil and public regulations.

Canon 18.

   The crime of conspiracy or secret association is entirely prohibited
   even by the laws of the land; so all the more properly is this
   forbidden in the church of God. So if any clerics or monks are found to
   be either forming a conspiracy or a secret society or hatching plots
   against bishops or fellow clergy, let them lose their personal rank
   completely.

Canon 19.

   We have heard that in the provinces the synods of bishops prescribed by
   canon law are not taking place, and that as a result many
   ecclesiastical matters that need putting right are being neglected. So
   the sacred synod decrees that in accordance with the canons of the
   fathers, the bishops in each province are to foregather twice a year at
   a place approved by the bishop of the metropolis and put any matters
   arising to rights. Bishops failing to attend who enjoy good health and
   are free from all unavoidable and necessary engagements, but stay at
   home in their own cities, are to be fraternally rebuked.

Canon 20.

   As we have already decreed, clerics who are serving a church are not
   permitted to join a church in another city, but are to be content with
   the one in which they were originally authorised to minister, apart
   from those who have been displaced from their own country and been
   forced to move to another church. If subsequent to this decision any
   bishop receives a cleric who belongs to another bishop, it is decreed
   that both the received and the receiver are to be excommunicate until
   such time as the cleric who has moved returns to his own church.

Canon 21.

   Clerics or layfolk who bring allegations against bishops or clerics are
   not to be admitted to make their charges without more ado and before
   any examination, but their reputation must first be investigated.

Canon 22.

   It is not permitted for clerics, following the death of their own
   bishop, to seize the things that belong to him, as has been forbidden
   even by earlier canons. Those who do this risk losing their personal
   rank.

Canon 23.

   It has come to the notice of the sacred synod that certain clerics and
   monks who have no employment from their own bishop and have sometimes
   even been excommunicated by him, are frequenting imperial
   Constantinople and spending long periods there causing disturbances,
   upsetting the ecclesiastical establishment and ruining people's homes.
   So the sacred synod decrees that such people are first to be warned by
   the public attorney of the most holy Constantinopolitan church to get
   out of the imperial city; and if they shamelessly persist in the same
   kinds of behaviour, they are to be expelled by the same public attorney
   even against their will, and are to betake themselves to their own
   places.

Canon 24.

   Monasteries once consecrated in accordance with the will of the bishop
   are to remain monasteries in perpetuity, and the effects which belong
   to them are reserved to the monastery, and they must not be turned into
   secular hostelries. Those who allow this to happen are to be subject to
   the canonical penalties.

Canon 25.

   According to our information, certain metropolitans are neglecting the
   flocks entrusted to them and are delaying the ordination of bishops, so
   the sacred synod has decided that the ordination of bishops should take
   place within three months, unless the period of delay has been caused
   to be extended by some unavoidable necessity. If a metropolitan fails
   to do this, he is to be subject to ecclesiastical penalties. The income
   of the widowed church is to be kept safe by the administrator of the
   said church.

Canon 26.

   According to our information, in some churches the bishops handle
   church business without administrators; so it has been decided that
   every church which has a bishop is also to have an administrator, drawn
   from its own clergy, to administer ecclesiastical matters according to
   the mind of the bishop concerned so that the church's administration
   may not go unaudited, and that consequently the church's property is
   not dispersed and the episcopate not exposed to serious criticism. If
   he does not comply with this, he is to be subject to the divine canons.

Canon 27.

   The sacred synod decrees that those who carry off girls under pretext
   of cohabitation, or who are accomplices or co-operate with those who
   carry them off, are to lose their personal rank if they are clerics,
   and are to be anathematised if they are monks or layfolk.

Canon 28.

[in fact a resolution passed by the council at the 16th session but rejected
by the Pope]

   Following in every way the decrees of the holy fathers and recognising
   the canon which has recently been read out--the canon of the 150 most
   devout bishops who assembled in the time of the great Theodosius of
   pious memory, then emperor, in imperial Constantinople, new Rome -- we
   issue the same decree and resolution concerning the prerogatives of the
   most holy church of the same Constantinople, new Rome. The fathers
   rightly accorded prerogatives to the see of older Rome, since that is
   an imperial city; and moved by the same purpose the 150 most devout
   bishops apportioned equal prerogatives to the most holy see of new
   Rome, reasonably judging that the city which is honoured by the
   imperial power and senate and enjoying privileges equalling older
   imperial Rome, should also be elevated to her level in ecclesiastical
   affairs and take second place after her. The metropolitans of the
   dioceses of Pontus, Asia and Thrace, but only these, as well as the
   bishops of these dioceses who work among non-Greeks, are to be ordained
   by the aforesaid most holy see of the most holy church in
   Constantinople. That is, each metropolitan of the aforesaid dioceses
   along with the bishops of the province ordain the bishops of the
   province, as has been declared in the divine canons; but the
   metropolitans of the aforesaid dioceses, as has been said, are to be
   ordained by the archbishop of Constantinople, once agreement has been
   reached by vote in the usual way and has been reported to him.

Canon 29.

[an extract from the minutes of the 19th session]

   The most eminent and illustrious officials asked: What does the sacred
   synod advise in the case of the bishops ordained by the most reverend
   Bishop Photius and removed by the most reverend Bishop Eustathius and
   consigned to be priests after losing the episcopacy? The most reverend
   Bishops Paschasinus and Lucentius and the priest Bonifatius,
   representatives of the apostolic see of Rome, replied: It is sacrilege
   to reduce a bishop to the rank of priest. But if whatever cause there
   is for removing those persons from the exercise of episcopacy is just,
   they ought not to occupy the position even of a priest. And if they
   have been removed from office and are without fault, they shall be
   restored to the episcopal dignity. The most reverend archbishop of
   Constantinople, Anatolius, replied: If those who are said to have
   descended from the episcopal dignity to the rank of priest have been
   condemned on what are reasonable grounds, they are clearly not worthy
   to hold even the office of a priest. But if they have been demoted to
   the lower rank without reasonable cause, then as long as they are seen
   to be innocent, they have every right to resume the dignity and
   priesthood of the episcopacy .

Canon 30.

[an extract from the minutes of the 4th session]

   The most eminent and illustrious officials and the exalted assembly
   declared: Since the most reverend bishops of Egypt have up to now put
   off subscribing to the letter of the most holy Archbishop Leo, not
   because they are in opposition to the catholic faith, but because they
   claim that it is customary in the Egyptian diocese not to do such
   things in contravention of the will and ordinance of their archbishop,
   and because they consider they should be given until the ordination of
   the future bishop of the great city of Alexandria, we think it
   reasonable and humane that, retaining their present rank in the
   imperial city, they should be granted a moratorium until such time as
   an archbishop of the great city of Alexandria is ordained. Most
   reverend Bishop Paschasinus, representative of the apostolic see, said:
   If your authority demands it, and you order that some measure of
   kindness be shown them, let them give guarantees that they will not
   leave this city before Alexandria receives its bishop. The most eminent
   and illustrious officials and the exalted assembly replied: Let the
   resolution of the most holy Bishop Paschasinus be upheld. So let the
   most reverend bishops of the Egyptians maintain their present rank and,
   either providing guarantees if they can, or pledging themselves on
   solemn oath, let them await the ordination of the future bishop of the
   great city of Alexandria.
