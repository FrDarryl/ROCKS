The General Council of Basel-Ferrara-Florence, 1431-45

Introduction

   Basel had been designated as the place for this ecumenical council by
   the abortive council of Pavia - Siena (1423-1424). It was opened on 25
   July 1431 by the papal legate, who had been appointed by Pope Martin V
   in two bulls dated 1 February 1431, Dum onus universalis gregis and
   Nuper siquidem cupientes shortly before the pope's death on 20 February
   1431. A great part of the council's work in the early years was taken
   up with its quarrel with Pope Eugenius IV, who was accused of wishing
   to dissolve or transfer the council. The prospect of re-union with the
   eastern church provided an opportunity to transfer the council to
   another city. This move was supported by the council fathers loyal to
   the pope, who however were in a minority, and in the 25th session they
   voted for the city of Ferrara. There the council was re-opened on 8
   January 1438, Pope Eugenius IV later attending in person. Some
   historians doubt the ecumenicity of the first 25 sessions at Basel. All
   agree that the sessions held at Basel after the 25th session until the
   final one on 25 April 1449 cannot be regarded as sessions of an
   ecumenical council.

   The Greek bishops and theologians attended the council of Ferrara from
   9 April 1438. The council was transferred to Florence on 10 January
   1439. There, in the session on 6 July 1439, the decree of union with
   the Greek church was approved. Subsequently decrees of union with the
   Armenian and Coptic churches were approved. Finally the council was
   transferred to Rome on 24 February 1443. There other decrees of union
   with the Bosnians, the Syrians and finally with the Chaldeans and
   Maronites of Cyprus, were approved. The last session of the council was
   held on 7 August 1445.

   The decisions taken at Basel have the form of conciliar decrees. Those
   taken at Ferrara, Florence and Rome are almost always in the form of
   bulls, since the pope was presiding in person; in these cases the
   decree mentions the council's approval and contains the words "in a
   solemnly celebrated general session of the synod".

   Almost all the decrees of re-union were of little effect. Nevertheless
   it is significant that the church's unity was discussed in a council
   attended by some eastern bishops and theologians, and that there was
   agreement on the principal dogmatic and disciplinary questions which
   had divided the two churches for many centuries.

   The acts of the council of Basel were first published by S. Brant in
   Basel in 1499, with the title Decreta concilii Basileensis (= Dc). This
   collection was subsequently published by Z. Ferreri at Milan in 1511,
   and by J. Petit at Paris in 1512. Almost all later conciliar
   collections included the acts and decrees of the council of Basel, from
   Merlin to Mansi's Amplissima collectio (= Msi). A brief history of
   these collections was written in 1906 by H. Herre in his work entitled,
   Handschriften und Drucke Baseler Konzilsakten, in Deutsche
   Reichstagsakten unter Kaiser Sigmund, Part IV/1, 1431-1432, 10/1,
   Goettingen 1957, XCVI-CI. Another edition of the decrees of Basel is
   contained in John of Segovia's diary, which is to be found in Monumenta
   conciliorum generalium saeculi XV (= Mxv), II Vienna 1873. Editio
   Romana, however, omits the council of Basel (see Labbe-Cossart XIII, n.
   7; S. Kuttner, L 'Edition romaine des conciles generaux, Rome 1940).

   For Basel, we have followed the edition of Msi 29 (1788) 1-227. We have
   noted the principal variants in Dc and Mxv. We have omitted some
   decrees pertaining to internal matters of the council, to the quarrel
   with Eugenius IV and to administration; we have always noted the titles
   of these decrees in footnotes. The decrees of Ferrara, Florence and
   Rome were first published by P. Crabbe (1538, 2, 754V-826). H.
   Justinianus subsequently published a more careful edition, Acta sacri
   oecumenici concilii Florentini, Rome 1638, which was followed by later
   collections until Msi 31 supplement (1901) (see V. Laurent L'edition
   princeps des actes du Concile de Florence, Orient. Christ. Per.21
   (1955) 165-189, and J. Gill, ibid. 22 (1956) 223-225). The decrees are
   also to be found in Monumenta conc. gen. saec. XV, III-IV Vienna
   1886-1935. We have followed the critical edition published by the
   Pontifical Oriental Institute, Concilium Florentinum. Documenta et
   Scriptores (= CF), Rome 1940-, and we have included the principal
   variants noted in it.

   As regards the English translation, the following points should be
   noted where the original text is given in two languages, namely Latin
   and another. Where a Greek text is given (pp. 520-528), this is of
   equal authority with the parallel Latin version, and in the English
   translation the few significant discrepancies between the two texts
   have been noted. In the cases of Armenian and Arabic texts (pp. 534-559
   and 567-583), these were translations from the Latin, which was the
   authoritative text, and therefore the English translation is from the
   Latin alone (the differences from the Latin in the Armenian and Arabic
   texts are numerous and complex). For these points, see J. Gill, The
   Council of Florence, Cambridge 1959, pp. 290-296, 308 and 326.

   Session 1 - 8 January 1438

   [Declaration of cardinal Nicholas Albergati, president of the council]

   We, Nicholas, legate of the apostolic see, announce that we preside on
   behalf of our most holy lord pope Eugenius IV in this sacred synod
   which was translated from Basel to the city of Ferrara and is already
   legitimately assembled, and that the continuation of this translated
   synod has been effected today 8 January, and that the synod is and
   ought to be continued from today onwards for all the purposes for which
   the synod of Basel was convened, including being the ecumenical council
   at which the union of the western and the eastern church is treated and
   with God's help achieved.


   Session 2 - 10 January 1438

   [On the legitimate continuation of the council of Ferrara, against the
   assembly at Basel]

   For the praise of almighty God, the exaltation of the catholic faith
   and the peace, tranquillity and unity of the whole Christian people.
   This holy universal synod, through the grace of God authorized by the
   most blessed lord pope Eugenius IV, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit in this city of Ferrara, represents the universal church. Its
   president, on behalf and in the name of the said most holy lord
   Eugenius, is the most reverend father and lord in Christ lord Nicholas,
   cardinal-priest of the holy Roman church of the title of holy Cross in
   Jerusalem, legate of the apostolic see. It adheres to the firm
   foundation of him who said to the prince of the apostles: You are
   Peter, and on this rock I will build my church. It is eager to preserve
   the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, so that we might be one
   body and one spirit, just as we were called in the one hope of our
   calling. It records that much was done in days past both at the former
   council of Basel and after its translation by some staying on there
   without any authority, and also by the said most blessed pope lord
   Eugenius, especially in respect of the business of the most holy union
   of the western and the eastern church, namely the following: the decree
   of the nineteenth session of the former council of Basel beginning As a
   dutiful mother, to which the most holy lord Eugenius gave his assent by
   his letter; also an agreed proposal on the choice of a place to which
   the council of Basel should be translated which was agreed upon and
   confirmed by all the fathers in common and which led to the decree of
   the twenty-fifth session of the former council, which begins This holy
   synod from its outset etc. and which the pope himself, urged on by the
   envoys of the Greeks, accepted and confirmed by his letter given in a
   general consistory at Bologna and published in the presence of these
   envoys, also the letter of the same most blessed Eugenius dated 18
   September last, issued in a general consistory at Bologna and solemnly
   read out at the beginning of the continuation of this synod, by which
   the pope with the counsel and consent of the most reverend cardinals of
   the holy Roman church and with the approval of the prelates then in the
   curia, transferred the council to this city of Ferrara; also the letter
   of the declaration of the same, dated 30 December, immediately
   following the said translation; all of which this holy synod has
   ordered to be registered verbatim in its acts as a permanent record, as
   is contained in these same acts.

   All these facts and many more have been duly pondered and maturely
   discussed in various meetings. This holy synod declares that the
   aforesaid translation and declaration were and are legitimate, just and
   reasonable, and were and are made from urgent necessity so as to remove
   an obstacle to the most holy union of the western and the eastern
   church, to prevent a schism already threatening in God's church, and
   for the manifest benefit of the whole Christian commonwealth, and that
   therefore this holy synod was legitimately assembled and established in
   the holy Spirit in this city of Ferrara for all the purposes for which
   the said former council of Basel was instituted at its beginning, and
   especially to be the future ecumenical council for the aforesaid most
   holy union; and that it ought to continue and to proceed to all the
   aforesaid matters. This holy synod therefore praises, accepts and
   approves the translation and the consequent declaration, as mentioned
   above. It exhorts in the Lord and requires of each and all of the
   present and future members of the holy synod to apply themselves to the
   above things with earnest care and serious study. By the generosity of
   him who has begun in us a good work, may everything be directed and
   done for his glory and the salvation of the whole Christian people.

   This holy synod further declares that, since the well known necessity
   of the above reasons demanded and impelled the said most holy lord
   Eugenius to that translation, the matter in no way falls within the
   decrees of the eighth, the eleventh or any other session of the former
   council of Basel.

   It decrees that the assembly at Basel, and every other assembly which
   may perchance convene there or elsewhere under the name of a general
   council, rather is and ought to be considered a spurious gathering and
   conventicle, and can in no way exist with the authority of a general
   council.

   It quashes, invalidates and annuls, and declares to be invalid,
   quashed, null and of no force or moment, each and all of the things
   done in the city of Basel in the name of a general council after the
   said translation, and whatever may be attempted there or elsewhere in
   the future in the name of a general council.

   But if in the matter of the Bohemians something useful has been
   achieved by the said people assembled at Basel after the said
   translation, it intends to approve that and supply for defects.

   In order that each and all of the members of the holy synod may be kept
   safe from every annoyance and may serve God in good works without
   anxiety, free from all fear, harassment and injury, this holy synod
   absolves, frees and dispenses, and declares to be absolved and freed,
   and the oaths to be dispensed from, each and all of those who, under
   whatsoever plea or cause, bound themselves to the former synod of Basel
   by oaths, with obligations and commitments, whereby their full and free
   right to obey this present holy synod and to promote its honour and
   good might be impeded and they might have scruples of some kind.

   This holy synod also ordains and decrees that nobody of whatsoever rank
   or dignity, by any ordinary or delegated jurisdiction for any cause or
   occasion, except by the jurisdiction of the apostolic see, shall dare
   to disturb, harass or molest, in their dignities, offices,
   administrations, privileges, honours, benefices and other goods, each
   and all of those, both seculars and religious, including members of
   mendicant orders, who are or shall be at this present synod, or who
   follow the Roman curia and will soon be at this synod on account of the
   move of the most holy lord Eugenius with his curia to this city, which
   has been announced by the posting up of notices in accordance with the
   ancient custom of the curia.

   But if, under any pretext, directly or indirectly, any should presume
   to molest any of the said persons in their dignities, offices,
   administrations, honours, privileges, benefices or other goods, or to
   prevent them from freely enjoying their jurisdiction, fruits and
   emoluments as they did before, or to confer on others their dignities,
   offices, administrations, honours and benefices, on the plea of some
   deprivation, this holy synod intends that each and all of them, even if
   they are cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops or persons with
   some other dignity, or chapters, colleges, convents or universities,
   shall incur automatically and without the need for a previous warning
   sentences of excommunication, suspension and interdict, absolution from
   which is reserved to the Roman pontiff alone, except at the hour of
   death.

   Moreover the synod decrees that those who do not repent within three
   days after making these conferrals or placing these obstacles, by fully
   restoring those whose dignities, offices, administrations, honours and
   benefices they conferred, or whom they impeded in other ways, as stated
   above, to all their churches and benefices as they held them before,
   whether they held them by title, in commendam or in administration; and
   also each and all of those who presume to accept collation to the
   aforesaid dignities, offices, administrations, honours and benefices,
   even if they were made motu proprio, or to take possession of them in
   person or through others, or to hold such action as valid; all these
   persons are automatically deprived by law, if they previously had any
   claim in them, of all their other benefices, whether they held them by
   title, in commendam or in administration, and they are rendered
   perpetually disqualified from them and all other benefices, and they
   can be restored and habilitated only by the Roman pontiff.

   This holy synod, moreover, warns and requires each and all of those who
   are obliged by law or custom to take part in general councils, to come
   as soon as possible to this present synod at Ferrara, which will
   continue, as noted above, for the speedy attainment of the aforesaid
   purposes.


   Session 3 - 15 February 1438

   [Ecclesiastical penalties against members of the Basel synod]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. The duties of the pastoral office over which we preside by
   divine mercy, despite our lack of merit, demand that we repress by
   opportune remedies the nefarious excesses of evil-minded persons,
   especially those who, unless prevented, strive to force the peaceful
   state of the church into various dangerous storms and disturbances and
   who endeavour to overturn the barque of Peter, and that we inflict due
   retribution for their excesses, lest boasting of their malice they give
   occasion to others to commit mischief. For it is a crime to be slack in
   punishing crimes that harm many people, as canonical regulations state.

   Thus, the former council of Basel debated the choice of a place for the
   future ecumenical council. Those on whom the power of choosing the
   place devolved, passed a decree which was accepted by the ambassadors
   of our most dear son in Christ John, emperor of the Greeks, and of our
   venerable brother Joseph, patriarch of Constantinople. Some persons
   chose Avignon or another place, but the said ambassadors protested that
   most assuredly they did not want to go there, declaring as certain that
   the said emperor and patriarch would by no means go to the said sacred
   council unless we attended in person. Those who asked for Avignon,
   afraid that the Greeks certainly would not come to them, dared to
   concoct a certain decree or notorious pamphlet, which they call a
   monition, against us, even though it is null and indeed leads to
   serious scandal and a split in the church, disrupting this holy work of
   union with the Greeks.

   In order to preserve the unity of the church and to promote the said
   union with the Greeks, we, for just, necessary and pressing reasons,
   with the advice and assent of our venerable brothers the cardinals of
   the holy Roman church, and with the advice and approval of very many of
   our venerable brothers the archbishops, bishops, beloved chosen sons
   and abbots who were present at the apostolic see, translated the said
   council of Basel, by our apostolic authority and in a fixed manner and
   form, to the city of Ferrara, which is suitable for the Greeks and for
   us, so that those at Basel might duly recoil from their scandalous
   actions, as is contained at greater length in the letter composed for
   the occasion' . But they, spurning every avenue of peace, persevering
   in their obstinate purpose, scorning the letter of the said translation
   and everything contained in it, and piling evil upon evil, not only
   rejected our reasonable translation made for the said most just and
   urgent reasons, as stated above, but even dared with renewed obstinacy
   to warn us to withdraw the said translation within a fixed time and
   under pain of suspension. Yet this would have been nothing less than to
   force us to abandon the prosecution of such a holy work so much desired
   by all Christians.

   When we realized this, with grief of heart, since we saw that
   everything tended to the destruction of the holy task of union and to
   an open split in the church, as was said above, we declared that the
   translation had been made by us from necessity, that the conditions
   attached to it had been regularized, and that the council at Ferrara
   ought to begin and legitimately continue, as is stated more fully in
   another letter of ours .

   To open this council at Ferrara we sent our beloved son Nicholas,
   cardinal-priest of the holy Roman church of the title of holy Cross,
   legate of us and the apostolic see.

   This council at Ferrara, legitimately assembled and with many prelates,
   solemnly declared in a public session that the said translation and
   declaration were and are legitimate, just and reasonable, and were made
   from urgent necessity so as to remove an obstacle to the said most holy
   union between the western and the eastern church and to avoid an
   impending split in God's church for the evident benefit of the whole
   Christian commonwealth, as is crystal clear from the decree made about
   it.

   Meanwhile, informed that the aforesaid emperor, patriarch and Greeks
   were approaching the shores of Italy, under God's guidance we came to
   this council at Ferrara with the firm intention and purpose of
   effectively pursuing, with God's help, not only the work of holy union
   but also the objectives for which the council of Basel had assembled.

   In view of all this, our beloved son Julian, cardinal-priest of the
   title of St Sabina, legate of the apostolic see, strongly urged the
   aforesaid people at Basel to withdraw from such flagrant scandals. But
   because of their obstinacy of mind he was without effect. Then, seeing
   them ready to precipitate still worse scandals in God's church, he
   departed so as not to appear to approve their impiety. They, for their
   part, paid no attention to this. Ignorant of how to direct their steps
   in the way of peace and justice, although they were already aware that
   the Greeks were utterly unwilling to come to them and were approaching
   the shores of Italy, they persevered in their hardness of heart. Since
   they could in no other way prevent and disrupt the union with the
   Greeks, for which they should have been labouring with us with all
   their strength and mind and assisting us, they added bad to worse and
   went to such a pitch of rashness and insolence that, even though many
   of the envoys of kings and princes who were at Basel execrated so
   wicked a deed and protested against it, they dared to declare with
   sacrilegious arrogance that we were suspended from the administration
   of the papacy and to proceed to various other things, albeit everything
   was null.

   So we, conscious that their excesses are so notorious that they cannot
   be hidden by any subterfuge, and that error that is not resisted
   appears to be approved and throws wide open to delinquents a door that
   no longer guards against their intrusions, and unable without grave
   offence to our lord Jesus Christ and his holy church to tolerate
   further so many grievous excesses which are seen especially to impede,
   disrupt and utterly destroy the holy and most desired union with the
   Greeks, we decree against the aforesaid remnant at Basel, in virtue of
   the most High and with the approval of this holy council, the steps
   that should be taken with justice.

   Hence we decree and declare, after mature deliberation with this holy
   synod and with its approval, that each and all of those meeting in
   Basel, in spite of the aforesaid translation and declaration, under the
   pretended name of a council which more accurately should be called a
   conventicle, and daring to perpetrate such scandalous and nefarious
   deeds, whether they are cardinals, patriarchs archbishops, bishops or
   abbots or of some other ecclesiastical or secular dignity, have already
   incurred the penalties instanced in our said letter of translation,
   namely excommunication, privation of dignities and disqualification
   from benefices and offices in the future.

   We also decree and declare to be null and void and of no force or
   moment, whatever has been attempted by them in the name of a council or
   otherwise since the day of the translation made by us, or shall be
   attempted in the future, in respect of the aforesaid matters or against
   those who follow our curia or are at this sacred council at Ferrara.

   We also command, with the approval of this council, under the same
   penalties and censures and in virtue of their oath by which they are
   bound to the holy apostolic see, each and all of the cardinals,
   patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, elected persons, abbots and all
   others of whatsoever condition, status or rank who are meeting in the
   said city of Basel under the pretext of a council, really and
   effectively to leave the said city within thirty days of the date of
   this decree. We also order the mayor of the citizens, the councillors
   and the magistrates ruling the city of Basel and the governors and
   other officials, whatever name they go under, to expel the aforesaid
   persons who have not left the city within the said thirty days and
   really and effectively to eject them.

   If they fail to do this within the said thirty days, we decree that
   each and all of the said rulers and officials automatically incur
   sentence of excommunication, and the people and the city automatically
   incur sentence of ecclesiastical interdict; we specially reserve to
   ourself absolution from the sentences of excommunication, except at the
   hour of death, and the lifting of the interdict. We order and command,
   in virtue of holy obedience and under pain of excommunication, each and
   all of those to whom this notice shall come that, if the aforesaid
   persons meeting in Basel and the citizens are obstinately disobedient
   towards us, nobody should approach the city of Basel after the said
   thirty days and they should deny them all commerce and all articles
   needed for human use.

   Merchants of all kinds, who have gone to Basel on account of the former
   council, shall depart under the same pain of excommunication. If there
   are some who ignore these orders of ours, daring perhaps to convey
   goods after the time-limit to those at Basel persisting in contumacy,
   since it is written that the righteous plundered the ungodly, such
   persons may be despoiled without penalty by any of the faithful and
   their goods shall be ceded to the first takers.

   However, because the church never closes its bosom to returning sons,
   if the said people meeting in Basel, or some of them, repent and depart
   from the said city within the said interval of thirty days from the
   date of this present decree, then with the approval of this sacred
   council we remit and fully cancel the aforesaid penalties as for
   obedient sons and we wish, decree and order that they and their
   consequences are to be regarded as without force from the date of their
   imposition, and we supply with the council's approval for all defects,
   if perhaps there are any in respect of solemnity of the law or of
   omission. Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however ...


   Session 4 - 29 April 1438

   [Eugenius IV and the fathers of the council at Ferrara declare the
   council at Ferrara to be legitimate and ecumenical]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. It befits us to render thanks to almighty God who, mindful of
   his past mercies, always bestows on his church even richer growth and,
   although he allows her to be tossed on occasions by the waves of trials
   and tribulations, yet never permits her to be submerged but keeps her
   safe amid the mountainous waters, so that by his mercy she emerges from
   the various vicissitudes even stronger than before. For behold, the
   western and eastern peoples, who have been separated for long, hasten
   to enter into a pact of harmony and unity; and those who were justly
   distressed at the long dissension that kept them apart, at last after
   many centuries, under the impulse of him from whom every good gift
   comes, meet together in person in this place out of desire for holy
   union.

   We are aware that it is our duty and the duty of the whole church to
   strain every nerve to ensure that these happy initiatives make progress
   and have issue through our common care, so that we may deserve to be
   and to be called co-operators with God.

   Finally, our most dear son John Palacologus, emperor of the Romans,
   together with our venerable brother Joseph, patriarch of
   Constantinople, the apocrisiaries of the other patriarchal sees and a
   great multitude of archbishops, ecclesiastics and nobles arrived at
   their last port, Venice, on 8 February last. There, the said emperor
   expressly declared, as he had often done before, that for good reasons
   he could not go to Basel to celebrate the ecumenical or universal
   council, and he intimated this by a letter to those assembled at Basel.
   He exhorted and required all of them to go to Ferrara, which had been
   chosen for the council, to carry through the pious task of this holy
   union.

   We have always had this holy union close to our heart and have sought
   with all our strength to bring it about. Therefore we intend to carry
   out with care, as is our duty, the decree of the council of Basel, to
   which the Greeks agreed, as well as the choice of a place for the
   ecumenical council, which was made at the council of Basel and which
   was later confirmed by us at Bologna at the urging of the envoys of the
   said emperor and patriarch, and any other things pertaining to this
   work of holy union.

   Therefore we decree and declare, in every way and form as best we can,
   with the assent of the said emperor and patriarch and of all those in
   the present synod, that there exists a holy universal or ecumenical
   synod in this city of Ferrara, which is free and safe for all; and
   therefore it should be deemed and called such a synod by all, in which
   this holy business of union will be conducted without any quarrelsome
   contention but with all charity and, as we hope, will be brought by
   divine favour to a happy conclusion together with the other holy tasks
   for which the synod is known to have been instituted.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Session 5 - 10 January 1439

   [Decree translating the council of Ferrara to Florence]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. It is fitting that the site of an ecumenical council, in which
   men chosen from the whole Christian world meet together, should be such
   that in it, among other human necessities, there should be the most
   important of all, namely healthy air. Otherwise, because of the
   pest-laden contagion of infected air which all people naturally fear
   and flee, those present at the council may be forced to depart with
   nothing accomplished and the absent will refuse to attend. Assuredly it
   is right that those who come together at synods to treat of difficult
   questions should be free from every anxiety and fear, so that they may
   be able in greater peace and freedom to give their attention to the
   matters of public concern.

   We would, indeed, have preferred that the universal council which we
   initiated in this city should continue here, and that the union of the
   eastern and western churches should be brought to its happy and desired
   conclusion in this city, where we initiated it. When the plague
   afflicted this city last autumn, pressure was exerted by some for the
   transferal of the synod to a non-infected locality. Nothing was done,
   however, because it was hoped that the plague would cease with the
   advent of winter, as it usually does.

   Since in fact the plague continues from day to day and it is feared
   that it will gain strength when spring and summer come, all judge and
   advise that a move must be made without delay to some non-infected
   place. For this and several other good reasons, with the agreement of
   our dear son John Palaeologus, emperor of the Romans, and of our
   venerable brother Joseph, patriarch of Constantinople, and with the
   approval of the council:

   In the name of the Trinity, Father, Son and holy Spirit, with the full
   securities and safe-conducts which we gave to all at the beginning of
   the sacred council, we transfer and declare to be transferred as from
   now this ecumenical or universal synod from this city of Ferrara to the
   city of Florence, which is manifestly free for all, safe, peaceful and
   tranquil, and enjoying healthy air, and which, situated as it is
   between the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas, is excellently situated for
   easy access for both easterners and westerners. Let nobody therefore .
   .. If anyone however . . .


   Session 6 - 6 July 1439

   [Definition of the holy ecumenical synod of Florence]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. With the agreement of our most dear son John Palaeologus,
   illustrious emperor of the

   Romans, of the deputies of our venerable brothers the patriarchs and of
   other representatives of the eastern church, to the following.

   Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice. For, the wall that
   divided the western and the eastern church has been removed, peace and
   harmony have returned, since the corner-stone, Christ, who made both
   one, has joined both sides with a very strong bond of love and peace,
   uniting and holding them together in a covenant of everlasting unity.
   After a long haze of grief and a dark and unlovely gloom of
   long-enduring strife, the radiance of hoped-for union has illuminated
   all.

   Let mother church also rejoice. For she now beholds her sons hitherto
   in disagreement returned to unity and peace, and she who hitherto wept
   at their separation now gives thanks to God with inexpressible joy at
   their truly marvellous harmony. Let all the faithful throughout the
   world, and those who go by the name of Christian, be glad with mother
   catholic church. For behold, western and eastern fathers after a very
   long period of disagreement and discord, submitting themselves to the
   perils of sea and land and having endured labours of all kinds, came
   together in this holy ecumenical council, joyful and eager in their
   desire for this most holy union and to restore intact the ancient love.
   In no way have they been frustrated in their intent. After a long and
   very toilsome investigation, at last by the clemency of the holy Spirit
   they have achieved this greatly desired and most holy union. Who, then,
   can adequately thank God for his gracious gifts?' Who would not stand
   amazed at the riches of such great divine mercy? Would not even an iron
   breast be softened by this immensity of heavenly condescension?

   These truly are works of God, not devices of human frailty. Hence they
   are to be accepted with extraordinary veneration and to be furthered
   with praises to God. To you praise, to you glory, to you thanks, O
   Christ, source of mercies, who have bestowed so much good on your
   spouse the catholic church and have manifested your miracles of mercy
   in our generation, so that all should proclaim your wonders. Great
   indeed and divine is the gift that God has bestowed on us. We have seen
   with our eyes what many before greatly desired yet could not behold.

   For when Latins and Greeks came together in this holy synod, they all
   strove that, among other things, the article about the procession of
   the holy Spirit should be discussed with the utmost care and assiduous
   investigation. Texts were produced from divine scriptures and many
   authorities of eastern and western holy doctors, some saying the holy
   Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, others saying the
   procession is from the Father through the Son. All were aiming at the
   same meaning in different words. The Greeks asserted that when they
   claim that the holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, they do not intend
   to exclude the Son; but because it seemed to them that the Latins
   assert that the holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son as
   from two principles and two spirations, they refrained from saying that
   the holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. The Latins
   asserted that they say the holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the
   Son not with the intention of excluding the Father from being the
   source and principle of all deity, that is of the Son and of the holy
   Spirit, nor to imply that the Son does not receive from the Father,
   because the holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, nor that they posit two
   principles or two spirations; but they assert that there is only one
   principle and a single spiration of the holy Spirit, as they have
   asserted hitherto. Since, then, one and the same meaning resulted from
   all this, they unanimously agreed and consented to the following holy
   and God-pleasing union, in the same sense and with one mind.

   In the name of the holy Trinity, Father, Son and holy Spirit, we
   define, with the approval of this holy universal council of Florence,
   that the following truth of faith shall be believed and accepted by all
   Christians and thus shall all profess it: that the holy Spirit is
   eternally from the Father and the Son, and has his essence and his
   subsistent being from the Father together with the Son, and proceeds
   from both eternally as from one principle and a single spiration. We
   declare that when holy doctors and fathers say that the holy Spirit
   proceeds from the Father through the Son, this bears the sense that
   thereby also the Son should be signified, according to the Greeks
   indeed as cause, and according to the Latins as principle of the
   subsistence of the holy Spirit, just like the Father.

   And since the Father gave to his only-begotten Son in begetting him
   everything the Father has, except to be the Father, so the Son has
   eternally from the Father, by whom he was eternally begotten, this
   also, namely that the holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.

   We define also that the explanation of those words "and from the Son"
   was licitly and reasonably added to the creed for the sake of declaring
   the truth and from imminent need.

   Also, the body of Christ is truly confected in both unleavened and
   leavened wheat bread, and priests should confect the body of Christ in
   either, that is, each priest according to the custom of his western or
   eastern church. Also, if truly penitent people die in the love of God
   before they have made satisfaction for acts and omissions by worthy
   fruits of repentance, their souls are cleansed after death by cleansing
   pains; and the suffrages of the living faithful avail them in giving
   relief from such pains, that is, sacrifices of masses, prayers,
   almsgiving and other acts of devotion which have been customarily
   performed by some of the faithful for others of the faithful in
   accordance with the church's ordinances.

   Also, the souls of those who have incurred no stain of sin whatsoever
   after baptism, as well as souls who after incurring the stain of sin
   have been cleansed whether in their bodies or outside their bodies, as
   was stated above, are straightaway received into heaven and clearly
   behold the triune God as he is, yet one person more perfectly than
   another according to the difference of their merits. But the souls of
   those who depart this life in actual mortal sin, or in original sin
   alone, go down straightaway to hell to be punished, but with unequal
   pains. We also define that the holy apostolic see and the Roman pontiff
   holds the primacy over the whole world and the Roman pontiff is the
   successor of blessed Peter prince of the apostles, and that he is the
   true vicar of Christ, the head of the whole church and the father and
   teacher of all Christians, and to him was committed in blessed Peter
   the full power of tending, ruling and governing the whole church, as is
   contained also in the acts of ecumenical councils and in the sacred
   canons.

   Also, renewing the order of the other patriarchs which has been handed
   down in the canons, the patriarch of Constantinople should be second
   after the most holy Roman pontiff, third should be the patriarch of
   Alexandria, fourth the patriarch of Antioch, and fifth the patriarch of
   Jerusalem, without prejudice to all their privileges and rights.


   Session 7 - 4 September 1439

   [Decree of the council of Florence against the synod at Basel]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. Moses, the man of God, was zealous for the well-being of the
   people entrusted to him. He feared that God's wrath would be roused
   against them if they followed Korah, Dathan and Abiram in their
   seditious schism. Therefore he said to the whole people, at the Lord's
   command: depart from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of
   theirs, lest you be involved in their sins. For he had perceived, under
   the Lord's inspiration, that those seditious and schismatic men would
   incur a grievous retribution, as was demonstrated afterwards when even
   the earth could not bear with them but by God's just judgment swallowed
   them up, so that they fell alive into hell.

   Similarly we too to whom, though unworthy, the lord Jesus Christ has
   deigned to entrust his people, as we hear of the abominable crime that
   certain wicked men dwelling in Basel have plotted in these days so as
   to breach the unity of holy church, and since we fear that they may
   seduce some of the unwary by their deceits and inject them with their
   poisons, are forced to proclaim in like words to the people of our lord
   Jesus Christ entrusted to us, depart from the tents of these wicked
   men, particularly since the Christian people is far more numerous than
   the Jewish people of those days, the church is holier than the
   synagogue, and the vicar of Christ is superior in authority and status
   even to Moses.

   This impiety of those at Basel we began to foresee long ago, when we
   observed the council of Basel already lapsing into tyranny; when many,
   including those of lower status, were forced to go to it and to stay at
   the whim of that faction of agitators; when the votes and decisions of
   some of them were being extorted by various tricks and others were
   being suborned by lies and deceits, as they abandoned almost everything
   to conspiracies, cabals, monopolies and cliques, and from a
   long-standing rivalry with the papacy sought to prolong the duration of
   the council; when, finally, innumerable novelties, irregularities,
   deformities and ills were perpetrated, to which there concurred even
   clerics in lower orders, the ignorant and inexperienced, vagabonds,
   quarrelers, fugitives, apostates, condemned criminals, escapees from
   prison, those in rebellion against us and their own superiors, and
   other such human monsters, who brought with them every stain of
   corruption from those teachers of evil-doing.

   We directed our attention also to that most holy work of union with the
   eastern church, which seemed to us to be greatly endangered by the
   deceit of certain factious persons, and we wished to provide as best we
   could for so many evils. For these and other just and necessary reasons
   which are stated in full in the decree of translation, with the advice
   of our venerable brothers the cardinals of the holy Roman church, and
   with the approval of very many venerable brothers and sons,
   archbishops, bishops, elected persons, abbots and other prelates of
   churches, masters and doctors, we transferred the aforesaid council of
   Basel to this city of Ferrara, where we established with the Lord's
   help an ecumenical council of the western and the eastern church.

   Afterwards, when the plague came and continued unabated, under the
   inspiration of grace and with the approval of the same holy council, we
   transferred the council to this city of Florence. Here the most
   gracious and merciful God showed his wonders. For, the most disastrous
   schism, which had endured in God's church for almost five hundred years
   to the immense harm of the whole of Christianity, and for the
   elimination of which very many of our predecessors as Roman pontiffs
   and many kings and princes and other Christians in past times had
   laboured very hard, at last, after public and private discussions in
   both places and many other labours, was removed and the most holy union
   of the Greeks and the Latins was happily achieved, as is described more
   fully in the decree about this which was drawn up and solemnly
   promulgated.

   Returning fervent thanks for this to the eternal God and sharing our
   joy with all the faithful, we offered to God a sacrifice of jubilation
   and praise. For we saw that not just one nation like the Hebrew people
   was being summoned to the promised land, but peoples of many races,
   nations and tongues were hastening to the one utterance and merit of
   the divine truth. Through this, great hope is forthcoming that the sun
   of justice, rising in the east, will spread the beams of its light to
   pierce the darkness of many other races, even of infidels, and the
   salvation of the Lord may reach to the ends of the earth.

   Already indeed, by God's providence, we have excellent pledges of this.
   For almighty God has granted that, by our means, representatives of the
   Armenians with full powers have recently come from most distant
   northern parts to us and the apostolic see and to this holy council.
   They regard and venerate us as no other than blessed Peter, prince of
   the apostles, they recognize the holy see as mother and mistress of all
   the faithful, and they profess that they have come to the holy see and
   to the aforesaid council for spiritual food and the truth of sound
   doctrine. For this too we have given many thanks to our God.

   But the mind recoils from recording what troubles, attacks and
   persecutions we have suffered in the course of this divine undertaking
   until now, not indeed from Turks or Saracens but from those who call
   themselves Christians. Blessed Jerome reports that from the time of
   Hadrian until the reign of Constantine there was set up and worshipped
   by the pagans at the place of the Lord's resurrection an image of
   Jupiter and on the rock of the crucifixion a marble statue of Venus,
   since the authors of persecution thought that they could take away from
   us our faith in the resurrection and the cross if they polluted the
   holy places with their idols.

   Much the same has happened in these days against us and the church of
   God, at the hands of those desperate men at Basel, except that what was
   then done by pagans ignorant of the true God is now the work of men who
   have known him and hated him Their pride, then, according to the
   prophet, is ever rising, all the more dangerously in that it is under
   the cloak of reform, which in truth they have always abhorred, that
   they spread their poisons.

   In the first place, those who were the authors of all the scandals in
   Basel have failed in their promises to the Greeks. For they knew from
   the envoys of the Greeks and the eastern church that our most dear son
   in Christ John Palaeologus, illustrious emperor of the Romans, and
   Joseph, patriarch of Constantinople of happy memory, and the other
   prelates and persons of the eastern church wished to proceed to the
   place which had been legally chosen for the ecumenical council by our
   legates and presidents and other notable persons present there, whose
   right it was to choose the site in accordance with the agreement which
   had been approved by the common consent of the council after serious
   disagreements among its members. Whereupon we, for our part, confirmed
   the choice of place in a general consistory at Bologna and we sent to
   Constantinople, at great labour and expense, the galleys and other
   things necessary for this holy work of union.

   When they learnt of this, they dared to decree against us and the
   aforesaid cardinals a detestable admonition or citation, so as to block
   the holy work, [and to send it to the aforesaid emperor and patriarch
   of Constantinople, so that they and all others] might be deterred from
   coming. Yet they knew full well that there was no chance of them going
   to any place other than the one which had been chosen for the site, as
   stated above.

   Then, when they realized that the aforesaid emperor and patriarch and
   others were already on their way to us for this work of holy union,
   they tried to lay another wicked snare to catch this divine project.
   That is, they produced against us a sacrilegious sentence of suspension
   from the administration of the papacy. Finally, those leaders of
   scandal, very few in number, most of them of the lowest rank and
   reputation, in their intense hatred of true peace, piling iniquity on
   top of iniquity lest they should enter into the justice of the Lord,
   when they saw that the grace of the holy Spirit was working in us
   towards union with the Greeks, swerving away from the straight line
   into paths of error, held a so-called session on 16 May last asserting
   that they were obeying certain decrees, although these were passed at
   Constance by only one of the three obediences after the flight of John
   XXIII, as he was called in that one obedience, at a time of schism.

   Alleging obedience to those decrees, they proclaimed three propositions
   which they term truths of the faith, seemingly to make heretics of us
   and all princes and prelates and other faithful and devout adherents of
   the apostolic see. The propositions are the following.

   "The truth about the authority of a general council, representing the
   universal church, over a pope and anyone else whatsoever, declared by
   the general councils of Constance and this one of Basel, is a truth of
   the catholic faith. The truth that a pope cannot by any authority,
   without its consent, dissolve a general council representing the
   universal church, legitimately assembled for the reasons given in the
   above-mentioned truth or for any of them, or prorogue it to another
   time or transfer it from place to place, is a truth of the catholic
   faith. Anyone who persists in opposing the aforesaid truths is to be
   considered a heretic."

   In this, those utterly pernicious men, masking their malice with the
   rosy colour of a truth of the faith, gave to the council of Constance
   an evil and mischievous meaning completely opposed to its true
   teaching, imitating in this the teaching of other schismatics and
   heretics who always amass for their support fabricated errors and
   impious dogmas drawn from their perverse interpretation of the divine
   scriptures and the holy fathers.

   Finally, completely perverting their mind and turning away their eyes
   from looking to heaven or remembering righteous judgments, after the
   manner of Dioscorus and the infamous synod of Ephesus, they proceeded
   to a declaratory sentence of deprivation, as they claimed, from the
   dignity and office of the supreme apostolate, a poisonous and execrable
   pronouncement involving an unforgivable crime. Here we will take the
   tenor of that sentence, abhorrent to every pious mind, as sufficiently
   expressed. They omitted nothing, as far as was in their power, that
   might overthrow this incomparable good of union.

   O miserable and degenerate sons! O wicked and adulterous generation!
   What could be more cruel than this impiety and iniquity? Can anything
   more detestable, more dreadful and more mad be imagined? Earlier on
   they were the ones who said that nothing better, nothing more glorious
   and fruitful had ever been seen or heard of in the Christian people,
   from the very birth of the church, than this most holy union, and that
   to further it there should be no contention about the place, but rather
   to achieve it the wealth of this world as well as body and soul should
   be hazarded, proclaiming this aloud to the whole world and urging the
   Christian people to it, as their decrees and letters fully state. But
   now they persecute exactly this as furiously and as impiously as they
   can, so that the devils of the entire world seem to have flocked
   together to that conventicle of brigands at Basel.

   So far almighty God has not allowed their iniquity and its lying
   inconsistencies to prevail. But seeing that they are striving with all
   their strength to bring it to success, even to the point of setting up
   the abomination of desolation in God's church, we can in no way pretend
   to ignore these things without most serious offence to God and imminent
   danger of confusion and abomination in God's church. In keeping with
   our pastoral office, at the urging of many who are fired with zeal for
   God, we wish to put a stop to such evils and, as far as we can, to take
   appropriate and salutary measures to eliminate from God's church this
   execrable impiety and most destructive pestilence.

   Following in the steps of our predecessors who, as Pope Nicholas of
   holy memory writes, were accustomed to annul councils which had been
   conducted improperly, even those of universal pontiffs, as occurred at
   the second universal synod at Ephesus, inasmuch as the blessed pope Leo
   summoned it but later established the council of Chalcedon.

   We renew by our apostolic authority, with the approval of this holy
   council of Florence, the solemn and salutary decree against those
   sacrilegious men, which was issued by us in the sacred general council
   of Ferrara on 15 February. By that decree we declared among other
   things, with the approval of the said sacred council of Ferrara, that
   each and every person at Basel who, in the name of a pretended council
   which we called more accurately a conventicle, dared to perpetrate
   those scandalous and wicked deeds in contravention of our translation
   and declaration, whether they are cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops,
   bishops, abbots or of some other ecclesiastical or secular dignity, has
   incurred the penalties of excommunication, privation of dignities,
   benefices and offices and disqualification for the future, which are
   instanced in our letter of translation.

   Now we decree and declare again that all the things done or attempted
   by those impious men presently in Basel, which were mentioned in our
   said decree of Ferrara, and each and all of the things done, performed
   or attempted by the same men since then, especially in the two
   so-called sessions or rather conspiracies which have just been
   mentioned, and whatever may have followed from these things or from any
   of them, or may follow in the future, as coming from impious men who
   have no authority and have been rejected and reprobated by God, were
   and are null, quashed, invalid, presumptuous and of no effect, force or
   moment.

   With the approval of the sacred council we condemn and reject, and we
   proclaim as condemned and rejected, those propositions quoted above as
   understood in the perverse sense of the men at Basel, which they
   demonstrate by their deeds, as contrary to the sound sense of sacred
   scripture, the holy fathers and the council of Constance itself; and
   likewise the aforesaid so-called sentence of declaration or
   deprivation, with all its present and future consequences, as impious
   and scandalous and tending to open schism in God's church and to the
   confusion of all ecclesiastical order and Christian government. Also,
   we decree and declare that all of the aforesaid persons have been and
   are schismatics and heretics, And that as such they are assuredly to be
   punished with suitable penalties over and above the penalties imposed
   at the aforesaid council of Ferrara, together with all their supporters
   and abettors, of whatever ecclesiastical or secular status, condition
   or rank they may be, even cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops
   or abbots or those of any other dignity, so that they may receive their
   deserts with the aforesaid Korah, Dathan and Abiram Let nobody
   therefore ... If anyone however ...


   Session 8 - 22 November 1439

   [Bull of union with the Armenians]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. All people everywhere who go by the name of Christian: Exult in
   God our helper, rejoice in the God of Jacob. Behold the Lord once
   again, mindful of his mercy had deigned to remove from his church
   another stumbling block which has endured for more than nine centuries.
   He who makes peace in the heavens and is peace on earth for people of
   good will, has granted in his inexpressible mercy that most desired
   union with the Armenians. Blessed be the God and Father of our lord
   Jesus Christ, the father of mercies and God of all comfort, who
   comforts us in all our tribulation. For the most merciful Lord, seeing
   his church buffeted about by strong whirlwinds, some times at the hands
   of those who are outside, at other times at the hands of those within,
   deigns in many ways every day to console and strengthen her so that she
   may be able to breathe freely in the midst of her troubles and to rise
   more robust to resist.

   Some time ago God established that great union with the Greeks, who
   include many races and tongues spread far and wide. Today God has
   confirmed in the same bond of faith and charity with the apostolic see
   this union with the Armenians, who are a very numerous people spread
   over the north and east. These indeed are such great and wondrous
   benefactions of divine providence that the human mind cannot render
   worthy thanks for either of them, still less for both together. Who
   would not be overwhelmed with admiration at the achievement in this
   council, within so short a time, of two such brilliant feats which have
   been longed for over centuries ? Truly this is the Lord's doing and it
   is wonderful in our eyes. For how could human prudence or diligence
   have brought to completion such great exploits as these are, unless the
   favour of God had given them their beginning and end? Let us, then,
   together and with all our hearts bless the Lord who alone does great
   wonders, let us sing with the spirit, let us sing with our minds and
   our mouths and let us give thanks in deeds, as far as human weakness
   allows, for such great gifts. Let us pray and beseech that, as the
   Greeks and the Armenians have been made one with the Roman church, so
   also may other nations be, especially those signed with the seal of
   Christ, and that finally the whole Christian people, after all hatreds
   and wars have been extinguished, may rest and rejoice together in
   mutual peace and brotherly love. Rightly we hold that the Armenians
   deserve great praise. As soon as they were invited by us to this synod,
   in their eagerness for ecclesiastical unity, at the cost of many
   labours and much toil and perils at sea, they sent to us and this
   council from very distant parts, their notable, dedicated and learned
   envoys with sufficient powers to accept, namely whatever the holy
   Spirit should inspire this holy synod to achieve.

   We, for our part, with all our attention as befits our pastoral office
   and desiring to bring this holy work to a successful conclusion,
   frequently conversed with their envoys about this holy union. To avoid
   even the slightest delay in this holy project, we nominated from every
   rank of this sacred council experts in divine and human law to treat of
   the matter with the envoys with all care, study and diligence, closely
   inquiring of them about their faith in respect of the unity of the
   divine essence and the Trinity of divine persons, also about the
   humanity of our lord Jesus Christ, the seven sacraments of the church
   and other points concerning the orthodox faith and the rites of the
   universal church.

   So, after many debates, conferences and disputations, after a thorough
   examination of the written authorities which were produced from fathers
   and doctors of the church, and after discussion of the questions at
   issue, at length, so that in future there could be no doubt about the
   truth of the faith of the Armenians and that they should think in every
   way like the apostolic see and that the union should be stable and
   lasting with no cause for hesitation whatsoever we judged it
   advantageous, with the approval of this sacred council of Florence and
   the agreement of the said envoys, to give in this decree a summary of
   the truth of the orthodox faith that the Roman church professes about
   the above.

   In the first place, then, we give them the holy creed issued by the
   hundred and fifty bishops in the ecumenical council of Constantinople,
   with the added phrase and the Son, which for the sake of declaring the
   truth and from urgent necessity was licitly and reasonably added to
   that creed, which runs as follows: I believe . . . I We decree that
   this holy creed should be sung or read within the mass at least on
   Sundays and greater feasts, as is the Latin custom, in all Armenian
   churches.

   In the second place, we give them the definition of the fourth council
   of Chalcedon about two natures in the one person of Christ, which was
   later renewed in the fifth and sixth universal councils. It runs as
   follows: This wise and saving creed ... Thirdly, the definition about
   the two wills and two principles of action of Christ promulgated in the
   above-mentioned sixth council, the tenor of which is This pious and
   orthodox creed, and the rest which follows in the above-mentioned
   definition of the council of Chalcedon until the end, after which it
   continues thus: And we proclaim

   Fourth, apart from the three synods of Nicaea, Constantinople and the
   first of Ephesus, the Armenians have accepted no other later universal
   synods nor the most blessed Leo, bishop of this holy see, by whose
   authority the council of Chalcedon met. For they claim that it was
   proposed to them that both the synod of Chalcedon and the said Leo had
   made the definition in accordance with the condemned heresy of
   Nestorius. So we instructed them and declared that such a suggestion
   was false and that the synod of Chalcedon and blessed Leo holily and
   rightly defined the truth of two natures in the one person of Christ,
   described above, against the impious tenets of Nestorius and Eutyches.
   We commanded that for the future they should hold and venerate the most
   blessed Leo, who was a veritable pillar of the faith and replete with
   all sanctity and doctrine, as a saint deservedly inscribed in the
   calendar of the saints; and that they should reverence and respect,
   like the rest of the faithful, not only the three above-mentioned
   synods but also all other universal synods legitimately celebrated by
   the authority of the Roman pontiff.

   Fifthly, for the easier instruction of the Armenians of today and in
   the future we reduce the truth about the sacraments of the church to
   the following brief scheme. There are seven sacraments of the new Law,
   namely baptism, confirmation, eucharist, penance, extreme unction,
   orders and matrimony, which differ greatly from the sacraments of the
   old Law. The latter were not causes of grace, but only prefigured the
   grace to be given through the passion of Christ; whereas the former,
   ours, both contain grace and bestow it on those who worthily receive
   them. The first five of these are directed to the spiritual perfection
   of each person in himself, the last two to the regulation and increase
   of the whole church.

   For, by baptism we are reborn spiritually; by confirmation we grow in
   grace and are strengthened in faith. Once reborn and strengthened, we
   are nourished by the food of the divine eucharist. But if through sin
   we incur an illness of the soul, we are cured spiritually by penance.
   Spiritually also and bodily as suits the soul, by extreme unction. By
   orders the church is governed and spiritually multiplied; by matrimony
   it grows bodily.

   All these sacraments are made up of three elements: namely, things as
   the matter, words as the form, and the person of the minister who
   confers the sacrament with the intention of doing what the church does.
   If any of these is lacking, the sacrament is not effected.

   Three of the sacraments, namely baptism, confirmation and orders,
   imprint indelibly on the soul a character, that is a kind of stamp
   which distinguishes it from the rest. Hence they are not repeated in
   the same person. The other four, however, do not imprint a character
   and can be repeated.

   Holy baptism holds the first place among all the sacraments, for it is
   the gate of the spiritual life; through it we become members of Christ
   and of the body of the church. Since death came into the world through
   one person, unless we are born again of water and the spirit, we
   cannot, as Truth says, enter the kingdom of heaven. The matter of this
   sacrament is true and natural water, either hot or cold. The form is: I
   baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy
   Spirit. But we do not deny that true baptism is conferred by the
   following words: May this servant of Christ be baptized in the name of
   the Father and of the Son and of the holy Spirit; or, This person is
   baptized by my hands in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
   the holy Spirit. Since the holy Trinity is the principle cause from
   which baptism has its power and the minister is the instrumental cause
   who exteriorly bestows the sacrament, the sacrament is conferred if the
   action is performed by the minister with the invocation of the holy
   Trinity. The minister of this sacrament is a priest, who is empowered
   to baptize in virtue of his office. But in case of necessity not only a
   priest or a deacon, but even a lay man or a woman, even a pagan and a
   heretic, can baptize provided he or she uses the form of the church and
   intends to do what the church does. The effect of this sacrament is the
   remission of all original and actual guilt, also of all penalty that is
   owed for that guilt. Hence no satisfaction for past sins is to be
   imposed on the baptized, but those who die before they incur any guilt
   go straight to the kingdom of heaven and the vision of God.

   The second sacrament is confirmation. Its matter is chrism made from
   oil and balsam blessed by a bishop, the oil symbolizing the gleaming
   brightness of conscience and balsam symbolizing the odour of a good
   reputation. The form is: I sign you with the sign of the cross and I
   confirm you with the chrism of salvation in the name of the Father and
   of the Son and of the holy Spirit. The ordinary minister is a bishop.
   Whereas a simple priest can use other unctions, only a bishop ought to
   confer this one, because it is said only of the apostles, whose place
   is held by bishops, that they gave the holy Spirit by the imposition of
   hands, as this text from the Acts of the Apostles shows: Now when the
   apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God,
   they sent to them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them
   that they might receive the holy Spirit; for it had not yet come down
   upon any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the
   lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the
   holy Spirit'. In place of this imposition of hands confirmation is
   given in the church. We read that sometimes for a reasonable and really
   urgent cause, by dispensation of the apostolic see, a simple priest has
   conferred this sacrament of confirmation with chrism prepared by a
   bishop. The effect of this sacrament is that a Christian should boldly
   confess the name of Christ, since the holy Spirit is given in this
   sacrament for strengthening just as he was given to the apostles on the
   day of Pentecost. Therefore the candidate is enjoined on the forehead,
   which is the seat of shame, not to shrink from confessing the name of
   Christ and especially his cross, which is a stumbling block for Jews
   and a folly for gentiles, according to the Apostle, and for this reason
   he is signed with the sign of the cross. The third is the sacrament of
   the eucharist. Its matter is wheat bread and wine from the vine, to
   which a very little water is added before the consecration. Water is
   added thus because it is believed, in accordance with the testimony of
   holy fathers and doctors of the church manifested long ago in
   disputation, that the Lord himself instituted this sacrament in wine
   mixed with water, and because it befits the representation of the
   Lord's passion. For the blessed pope Alexander, fifth after blessed
   Peter, says: "In the oblations of the sacraments which are offered to
   the Lord within the solemnities of masses, only bread and wine mixed
   with water are to be offered in sacrifice. There should not be offered
   in the chalice of the Lord either wine only or water only but both
   mixed together, because both blood and water are said to have flowed
   from Christ's side'; also because it is fitting to signify the effect
   of this sacrament, which is the union of the Christian people with
   Christ. For, water signifies the people according to those words of the
   Apocalypse: many waters, many peoples. And Pope Julius, second after
   blessed Silvester, said: The chalice of the Lord, by a precept of the
   canons, should be offered mixed of wine and water, because we see that
   the people is understood in the water and the blood of Christ is
   manifested in the wine; hence when wine and water are mingled in the
   chalice, the people are made one with Christ and the mass of the
   faithful are linked and joined together with him in whom they believe.
   Since, therefore, both the holy Roman church taught by the most blessed
   apostles Peter and Paul and the other churches of Latins and Greeks, in
   which the lights of all sanctity and doctrine have shone brightly, have
   behaved in this way from the very beginning of the growing church and
   still do so, it seems very unfitting that any other region should
   differ from this universal and reasonable observance. We decree,
   therefore, that the Armenians should conform themselves with the whole
   Christian world and that their priests shall mix a little water with
   the wine in the oblation of the chalice, as has been said. The form of
   this sacrament are the words of the Saviour with which he effected this
   sacrament. A priest speaking in the person of Christ effects this
   sacrament. For, in virtue of those words, the substance of bread is
   changed into the body of Christ and the substance of wine into his
   blood. In such wise, however, that the whole Christ is contained both
   under the form of bread and under the form of wine, under any part of
   the consecrated host as well as after division of the consecrated wine,
   there is the whole Christ. The effect of this sacrament, which is
   produced in the soul of one who receives it worthily, is the union of
   him or her with Christ. Since by grace a person is incorporated in
   Christ and is united with his members, the consequence is that grace is
   increased by this sacrament in those who receive it worthily, and that
   every effect that material food and drink produce for corporal life -
   sustaining, increasing, repairing and delighting - this sacrament works
   for spiritual life. For in it, as Pope Urban said, we recall the
   gracious memory of our Saviour, we are withdrawn from evil, we are
   strengthened in good and we receive an increase of virtues and graces.

   The fourth sacrament is penance. Its matter is the acts of the
   penitent, which are threefold. The first is contrition of heart, which
   includes sorrow for sin committed, with the resolve not to sin again.
   The second is oral confession, which implies integral confession to the
   priest of all sins that are remembered. The third is satisfaction for
   sins in accordance with the judgment of the priest which is ordinarily
   done by prayer, fasting and almsgiving. The form of this sacrament are
   the words of absolution which the priest pronounces when he says: I
   absolve you. The minister of this sacrament is a priest with authority
   to absolve, which is either ordinary or by commission of a superior.

   The fifth sacrament is extreme unction. Its matter is olive oil blessed
   by a priest. This sacrament should not be given to the sick unless
   death is expected. The person is to be anointed on the following
   places: on the eyes for sight, on the ears for hearing, on the nostrils
   for smell, on the mouth for taste or speech, on the hands for touch, on
   the feet for walking, on the loins for the pleasure that abides there.
   The form of this sacrament is: Through this anointing and his most
   pious mercy may the Lord pardon you whatever you have done wrong by
   sight, and similarly for the other members. The minister of the
   sacrament is a priest. Its effect is to cure the mind and, in so far as
   it helps the soul, also the body. Blessed James the apostle said of
   this sacrament: Any one of you who is sick should send for the elders
   of the church, and they shall pray over him and anoint him with oil in
   the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will save the sick person and
   the Lord will raise him up again: and if he is in sins, they will be
   forgiven him.

   The sixth is the sacrament of orders. Its matter is the object by whose
   handing over the order is conferred. So the priesthood is bestowed by
   the handing over of a chalice with wine and a paten with bread; the
   diaconate by the giving of the book of the gospels; the subdiaconate by
   the handing over of an empty chalice with an empty paten on it; and
   similarly for the other orders by allotting things connected with their
   ministry. The form for a priest is: Receive the power of offering
   sacrifice in the church for the living and the dead, in the name of the
   Father and of the Son and of the holy Spirit. The forms for the other
   orders are contained in full in the Roman pontifical. The ordinary
   minister of this sacrament is a bishop. The effect is an increase of
   grace to make the person a suitable minister of Christ.

   The seventh is the sacrament of matrimony, which is a sign of the union
   of Christ and the church according to the words of the apostle: This
   sacrament is a great one, but I speak in Christ and in the church. The
   efficient cause of matrimony is usually mutual consent expressed in
   words about the present. A threefold good is attributed to matrimony.
   The first is the procreation and bringing up of children for the
   worship of God. The second is the mutual faithfulness of the spouses
   towards each other. The third is the indissolubility of marriage, since
   it signifies the indivisible union of Christ and the church. Although
   separation of bed is lawful on account of fornication, it is not lawful
   to contract another marriage, since the bond of a legitimately
   contracted marriage is perpetual.

   Sixthly, we offer to the envoys that compendious rule of the faith
   composed by most blessed Athanasius, which is as follows:

   Whoever wills to be saved, before all things it is necessary that he
   holds the catholic faith. Unless a person keeps this faith whole and
   undefiled, without doubt he shall perish eternally. The catholic faith
   is this, that we worship one God in the Trinity, and the Trinity in
   unity, neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance. For
   there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of
   the holy Spirit. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son and of the
   holy Spirit is one, the glory equal, and the majesty co-eternal. Such
   as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the holy Spirit. The
   Father uncreated the Son uncreated and the holy Spirit uncreated. The
   Father infinite, the Son infinite and the holy Spirit infinite. The
   Father eternal, the Son eternal and the holy Spirit eternal. Yet they
   are not three eternals, but one eternal. As also they are not three
   uncreateds nor three infinites, but one uncreated and one infinite.
   Likewise the Father is almighty, the Son is almighty and the holy
   Spirit is almighty. Yet they are not three almighties, but one
   almighty. Likewise the Father is God, the Son is God and the holy
   Spirit is God. Yet they are not three gods, but one God. Likewise the
   Father is Lord, the Son is Lord and the holy Spirit is Lord. Yet they
   are not three lords, but one Lord. For just as we are compelled by the
   Christian truth to acknowledge each person by himself to be God and
   Lord, so we are forbidden by the catholic religion to say there are
   three gods or three lords. The Father is made by none, neither created
   nor begotten. The Son is from the Father alone; not made nor created,
   but begotten. The holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son; not made
   nor created nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not
   three fathers; one Son, not three sons; one holy Spirit, not three holy
   spirits. And in this Trinity nothing is before or after, nothing is
   greater or less; but the whole three persons are co-eternal together
   and co-equal. So that in all things, as has been said above, the unity
   in Trinity and the Trinity in unity is to be worshipped. Whoever,
   therefore, wishes to be saved, let him think thus of the Trinity.

   It is also necessary for salvation to believe faithfully the
   incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ. The right faith, therefore, is
   that we believe and confess that our lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, is
   God and man. God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the
   ages; and man, of the substance of his mother, born in the world.
   Perfect God, perfect man, subsisting of a rational soul and human
   flesh. Equal to the Father according to his Godhead, less than the
   Father according to his humanity. Although he is God and man, he is not
   two, but one Christ. One, however, not by conversion of the Godhead
   into flesh, but by the taking of humanity into God. One altogether, not
   by confusion of substance, but by unity of person. For as a reasoning
   soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ. He suffered
   for our salvation and descended into hell. On the third day he rose
   from the dead. He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of
   God the Father almighty. Thence he shall come to judge the living and
   the dead. At his coming all shall rise again with their bodies, and
   shall give an account of their own deeds. Those who have done good
   shall go into eternal life, but those who have done evil shall go into
   eternal fire.

   This is the catholic faith. Unless a person believes it faithfully and
   firmly, he cannot be saved.

   Seventhly, the decree of union concluded with the Greeks, which was
   promulgated earlier in this sacred ecumenical council of Florence and
   which is as follows: Let the heavens be glad . . . '

   Eighthly, there was discussion with the Armenians about, among other
   things, the days on which the following feasts should be kept: the
   annunciation of the blessed virgin Mary, the birth of blessed John the
   Baptist and, in consequence, the birth and the circumcision of our lord
   Jesus Christ and his presentation in the temple (or the purification of
   the blessed virgin Mary). The truth was made quite clear by the
   testimonies of fathers and by the custom of the Roman church and all
   other churches among Latins and Greeks. Therefore, lest the rites of
   Christians be at variance in such great celebrations, whence a threat
   to charity could arise, we decree that, as something consonant with
   truth and reason, the Armenians too should solemnly celebrate,
   according to the observance of the rest of the world, the following
   feasts on the following days: the annunciation of the blessed virgin
   Mary on 25 March, the birth of blessed John the Baptist on 24 June, the
   birth of our Saviour on 25 December, his circumcision on 1 January, the
   epiphany on 6 January, and the presentation of our Lord in the temple
   (or the purification of the mother of God) on 2 February.

   After all these matters had been explained, the aforesaid Armenians, in
   their own name and in the name of their patriarch and of all Armenians,
   with all devotion and obedience accept, admit and embrace this salutary
   synodal decree with all its chapters, declarations, definitions,
   traditions, precepts and statutes and all the doctrine contained in it,
   and also whatever the holy apostolic see and the Roman church holds and
   teaches. They also accept with reverence all those doctors and holy
   fathers approved by the Roman church. Indeed, they hold as reprobated
   and condemned whatever persons and things the Roman church reprobates
   and condemns. They promise that as true sons of obedience, in the name
   as above, they will faithfully obey the ordinances and commands of the
   apostolic see.

   When the aforesaid decree had been solemnly read out in our and the
   holy synod's presence, straightaway our beloved son Narses, an
   Armenian, in the name of the said envoys, publicly recited the
   following in Armenian and thereupon our beloved son Basil of the order
   of friars Minor, the interpreter between us and the Armenians, publicly
   read it out in Latin as follows.

   Most blessed father and most holy synod. Recently the whole of this
   holy decree, which has now been read out in Latin in your presence, was
   clearly explained and interpreted to us word by word in our language.
   It was and is completely acceptable to us. To disclose our
   understanding more fully, however, we repeat its contents in summary.

   The following is contained in it. First, you give to our people of the
   Armenians the holy creed of Constantinople, with the added phrase and
   the Son, to be sung or read within the mass in our churches at least on
   Sundays and greater feasts. Secondly, the definition of the fourth
   universal council of Chalcedon about two natures in the one person of
   Christ. Thirdly, the definition about the two wills and principles of
   action of Christ which was promulgated in the sixth universal council.

   Fourthly, you declare that the synod of Chalcedon and most blessed pope
   Leo rightly defined the truth about two natures in the one person of
   Christ against the impious doctrines of Nestorius and Eutyches. You
   order that we should venerate most blessed Leo as holy and a pillar of
   the faith and that we should reverently accept not only the synods of
   Nicaea, Constantinople and the first of Ephesus, but also all other
   synods legitimately celebrated . . authority of the Roman pontiff.

   Fifthly, a short scheme of the seven sacraments of the church, namely
   baptism, confirmation, eucharist, penance, extreme unction, orders and
   matrimony indicating the matter, the form and the minister of each; and
   that while the chalice is being offered in the sacrifice of the altar a
   little water should be mixed with the wine.

   Sixthly, a compendious rule of the faith of most blessed Athanasius,
   which begins: Whoever wills to be saved etc.

   Seventhly, the decree of union concluded with the Greeks, which was
   promulgated earlier in this sacred council, recording how the holy
   Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son, and that the
   phrase and the Son was licitly and reasonably added to the creed of
   Constantinople. Also that the body of the Lord is effected in leavened
   or unleavened wheat bread; and what is to be believed about the pains
   of purgatory and hell, about the life of the blessed and about
   suffrages offered for the dead. In addition, about the plenitude of
   power of the apostolic see given by Christ to blessed Peter and his
   successors, . . . . . about the order of the patriarchal sees.

   Eighthly, you decree that the following feasts should be kept on the
   following days, in accordance with the custom of the universal church:
   the annunciation of the blessed virgin Mary on 25 March, the birth of
   blessed John the Baptist on 24 June, the birth of our Saviour on 25
   December, his circumcision on I January, the epiphany on 6 January, and
   the presentation of the Lord in the temple (or the purification of
   blessed Mary) on 2 February.

   Therefore we envoys, in our own name and in the name of our reverend
   patriarch and of all Armenians, with all devotion and obedience accept,
   admit and embrace, just as your holiness affirms in the decree, this
   most salutary synodal decree with all its chapters, declarations,
   definitions, traditions, precepts and statutes and all the doctrine
   contained in it, and also whatever the holy apostolic see and the Roman
   church holds and teaches. We accept with reverence all those doctors
   and holy fathers approved by the Roman church. Indeed we hold as
   reprobated and condemned whatever persons and things the Roman church
   reprobates and condemns. We promise that as true sons of obedience, in
   the name of the above, we will faithfully obey the ordinances and
   commands of this apostolic see.

   Session 9 - 23 March 1440

   [Monition of the council of Florence against the antipope Felix V]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. Many examples of holy fathers of the old and the new Testament
   warn us that we should not pass over in silence or leave completely
   unpunished specially grave crimes which lead to the scandal and public
   division of the people entrusted to us. For if we delay to pursue and
   avenge what is grievously offensive to God, we thereby provoke the
   divine patience to wrath. For, there are sins for which it is a sin to
   be slack about their retribution. It is indeed right and eminently
   reasonable, in the opinion of holy fathers, that those who despise
   divine commands and disobey paternal enactments should be corrected
   with really severe penalties, so that others may fear to commit the
   same faults and that all may rejoice in fraternal harmony and take note
   of the example of severity and probity. For if - though may it never be
   - we are negligent about ecclesiastical vigilance and activity,
   idleness ruins discipline and the souls of the faithful will suffer
   great harm. Therefore, rotting flesh should be cut away and mangy sheep
   driven out

   He cannot have God as his father If he does not hold the unity of the
   church i he who does not agree with the body of the church and the
   whole brotherhood, cannot agree with anyone. Since Christ suffered for
   the church and since the church is the body of Christ, without doubt
   the person who divides the church is convicted of lacerating the body
   of Christ. Hence the avenging will of the Lord went forth against
   schismatics like Korah, Dathan and Abiram, who were swallowed up
   together by an opening in the ground for instigating schism against
   Moses, the man of God, and others were consumed by fire from heaven;
   idolatry indeed was punished by the sword; and the burning of the book
   was requited by the slaughter of war and imprisonment in exile.

   Finally, how indivisible is the sacrament of unity! How bereft of hope,
   and how punished by God's indignation with the direst loss, are those
   who produce schism and, abandoning the true spouse of the church, set
   up a pseudo-bishop! Divine scripture declares this in the book of
   Kings, which says that when ten tribes had separated themselves from
   the tribe of Judah and Benjamin and abandoned their king, setting up
   for themselves another king: the Lord was indignant with all the
   descendants of Israel and gave them over to destruction till he cast
   them away from his face. It says that the Lord was indignant and gave
   over to destruction those who split off from unity and set up for
   themselves another king. Indeed, so great was the wrath of God against
   those who had brought about a schism that even when the man of God had
   been sent to Jeroboam to reprove his sins and to predict a future
   vengeance, the man of God was forbidden to eat bread with them or to
   drink water and when he did not obey this order of the Lord and dined,
   straightaway the divine retribution struck him and he was killed by a
   lion on his return journey. Hence, as blessed Jerome declares, nobody
   should doubt that the crime of schism is very wicked since it is
   avenged so severely.

   In days gone by, in the holy general council of Constance, that chronic
   and disastrous schism, which had cruelly and daily afflicted God's
   church and the Christian religion with great loss of souls, not only of
   individual persons but also in entire cities and provinces, was at last
   settled by the ineffable mercy of God and the unbounded labours and
   hardships of many kings and princes, both ecclesiastical and secular,
   many universities and others of Christ's faithful, and at great
   expense. With the election of lord Martin of happy memory and, after
   his death, the undisputed, genuine, unanimous and canonical elevation
   of your holiness to the summit of the apostolate, the universal church
   seemed to be enjoying a greatly desired peace. But behold! Again we are
   compelled with copious tears to say with Jeremiah the prophet: we
   looked for peace, but behold disturbance. And again with Isaiah: we
   looked for light, but behold darkness. Some sons of perdition and
   disciples of iniquity, who were few in numbers and of little authority,
   tried at Basel with all their strength, guile and cunning, even after
   the translation of the former council which had been made canonically
   and legitimately by your holiness for just, evident, urgent and
   necessary reasons, to prevent the most holy union with the Greeks and
   the whole eastern church, which was ardently desired by the whole
   Christian people.

   For after the said authors of the scandals who remained in Basel had
   failed to fulfil their promise to the Greeks, when they learnt from the
   envoys of the Greeks and the eastern church that the most serene prince
   lord John Palaeologus, emperor of the Romans, and Joseph, patriarch of
   Constantinople of happy memory, with many other prelates and men of the
   eastern church were about to come to the place chosen for the
   ecumenical council, and that your holiness had despatched many prelates
   and envoys with galleys at great expense and outlay, they dared to
   decree, with a view to preventing the arrival of the said emperor and
   Greeks, a detestable monition against your holiness and my most
   reverend lords, the lord cardinals of the holy Roman church.

   Afterwards, when they learnt that the said emperor and patriarch and
   other easterners were coming, they issued against your holiness a kind
   of sacrilegious decree of suspension from the administration of the
   papacy.

   Despite these and other wicked attempts and sacrilegious acts, on
   account of the constant solicitude displayed by you and this sacred
   council and after great labours and many disputations, at last the
   divine mercy granted that the above-mentioned schism of the Greeks and
   the eastern church, which had lasted for almost five hundred years to
   the great harm of the whole Christian people, should be removed from
   the midst of the church and that the most desired union of the western
   and the eastern church, which was hardly thought possible, should
   follow with the utmost harmony from your and this sacred council's holy
   work. This ought to be greatly admired and venerated with the highest
   praise and the joy of exultation, as all the rest of the Christian
   religion had done, and thanks should be returned to the most High for
   so admirable a gift. But they became more hard-hearted and obstinate,
   preferring even at the cost of ruining the whole Christian world to fan
   into flames the conflagration, which they had already begun, of their
   aforesaid most wicked monster. They adopted an attitude of opposition
   and, prodigal of their good name and enemies to their own honour, they
   strove to their utmost with pestilential daring to rend the unity of
   the holy Roman and universal church and the seamless robe of Christ',
   and with serpent-like bites to lacerate the womb of the pious and holy
   mother herself.

   The leader and prince of these men and the architect of the whole
   nefarious deed was that first-born son of Satan, the most unfortunate
   Amadeus, once duke and prince of Savoy. He meditated this scheme for
   long. Several years ago, as is widely said, he was seduced by the
   trickery, soothsayings and phantoms of certain unfortunate men and
   women of low reputation (commonly called wizards or witches or
   Waldensians and said to be very numerous in his country), who had
   forsaken their Saviour to turn backwards to Satan and be deceived by
   demonic illusions, to have himself raised up to be a monstrous head in
   God's church. He adopted the cloak of a hermit, or rather of a most
   false hypocrite, so that in sheep's clothing, like a lamb he might
   assume the ferocity of a wolf. Eventually he joined the people at
   Basel. By force, fraud, bribery, promises and threats he prevailed on
   the majority of those at Basel, who were subject to his sway and
   tyranny, to proclaim him as an idol and Beelzebub, the prince of these
   new demons, in opposition to your holiness, the true vicar of Christ
   and the undoubted successor of Peter in God's church.

   Thus that most ill-starred Amadeus, a man of insatiable and unheard of
   greed, whom avarice (which, according to the Apostle, is the service of
   idols) has always blinded, was set up as an idol and like a statue of
   Nebuchadnezzar in God's church by that most wicked synagogue, those
   offscourings of forsaken men, that shameful cesspool of all
   Christianity, from among whom certain heinous men, or rather demons
   hiding under the form of men, had been deputed as electors or rather as
   profaners. He himself, agitated by the furies of his own crimes and
   sinking into the depth of all evils, said after the manner of Lucifer:
   I will set my throne in the north and I shall be like the most High. He
   grasped with avid and detestable greed at the above-mentioned election,
   or rather profanation made of him, which he had earlier sought with
   intense fever of mind and anguish of heart. He did not shrink from
   adopting and wearing papal robes, ornaments and insignia, from
   behaving, holding himself and acting as Roman and supreme pontiff, and
   from having himself venerated as such by the people. Further, he was
   not afraid to write and despatch to many parts of the world letters
   which were sealed with a leaden seal after the manner of the Roman
   pontiffs. By these letters, in which he calls himself Felix even though
   he is the most unhappy of mortals, he tries to spread the poisons of
   his faction among the people of Christ.

   What complaint or accusation am I to make first, most blessed father
   and most holy synod? With what force of speech, grief of mind or
   outpouring of words am I to deplore so great a crime? What rich
   discourse could suitably bewail or express this most foul deed?
   Assuredly no account can equal the grossness of the act, for the
   magnitude of so heinous a crime transcends the power of speech.

   But, as I see it, most blessed father and most reverend and reverend
   fathers, now is the hour not for lament but for remedy.

   For behold, holy mother church was basking in true unity and peace, in
   the person of your holiness her undoubted spouse, when the fountain of
   tears was opened. To you, her spouse, and to you most reverend and
   reverend fathers, who share in solicitude and have been summoned to
   this sacred and ecumenical council, she is forced to cry and shout with
   many sighs and sobs: Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my
   fiends'. For my bowels are full of bitterness. For the foxes destroy
   the vineyard of the God of hosts, and the impious rend the seamless
   robe of Christ. Let God therefore arise, let all his enemies be
   scattered. And you, most blessed father, since all these things are so
   manifest, public and notorious that they cannot be hidden by any
   evasion or defended by excuses, arise in the power of the most High,
   together with this sacred council, and judge the cause of your spouse
   and be mindful of your sons. Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty
   one. Set out, proceed prosperously and reign, and say with the
   psalmist: I will pursue my enemies and crush them, and I shall not
   return until I consume them. I shall consume and crush them and they
   will not rise; they will fall at my feet. For it is wrong that so
   wicked a deed and so detestable a precedent should be allowed to pass
   by disguised, lest perhaps unpunished daring and malice find an
   imitator, but rather let the example of punished transgressions deter
   others from offending.

   Therefore your holiness and this sacred synod, following the example of
   Moses the man of God, must say to the whole Christian people: Depart
   from the tents of these impious men. Follow also the example of blessed
   pope Leo, your predecessor, who moved the second council of Ephesus and
   Dioscorus with his supporters to Chalcedon, where he instituted a synod
   which condemned them, and of your other predecessors as supreme
   pontiff, who continuously rising up in God's church have eliminated
   heresies and schisms, with their instigators, followers and supporters,
   from the church of God and the communion of the faithful, which is the
   most sacred body of Christ, and have afflicted them with many other
   condign penalties at the demand of justice.

   With the approval and help of this sacred ecumenical council, avenge
   with condign penalties this new frenzy which has become inflamed to
   your injury and that of the holy Roman church, your spouse, and to the
   notorious scandal of the whole Christian people. By the authority of
   almighty God and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul and by your own
   authority, remove and separate from God's holy church, by a perpetual
   anathema, the aforesaid wicked perpetrators of this prodigious crime
   and their unfortunate heresiarch and veritable antichrist in God's
   church together with all their supporters, adherents and followers and
   especially his execrable electors or rather profaners.

   May he and all the aforesaid be cast out like an antichrist and an
   invader and a destroyer of the whole of Christianity. Let no appeal in
   this matter ever be allowed to him or to them. Let them and their
   posterity and successors be deprived without appeal of every
   ecclesiastical or secular rank and dignity whatsoever. Let all of them
   be condemned by a perpetual anathema and excommunication and may they
   be counted among the wicked who will not rise at the judgment. May they
   feel the anger of God against them. May they feel the rage of saints
   Peter and Paul, whose church they dare to throw into confusion, both in
   this life and in the next. May their dwelling be a desolation, let no
   one dwell in their tents. May their children be orphans and their wives
   be widows. May the world fight against them and all the elements be
   opposed to them, so that they may be cast out, destroyed and eliminated
   by all and so that, as they grovel in permanent penury, death may
   deservedly be their refuge and life their punishment. May the merits of
   all the saints cast them into confusion and display open vengeance on
   them in their lifetime. May they receive a deserved fate with Korah,
   Dathan and Abiram. Finally, unless they repent from their hearts,
   perform deeds worthy of repentance and make worthy satisfaction to your
   holiness and the universal church for the enormity of their sins, may
   they be thrust with the wicked into the everlasting darkness, doomed by
   the just judgment of God to eternal torments.

   May the grace of almighty God protect all of us and all Christ's
   faithful who execrate with merited blasphemies the aforesaid
   heresiarchs and their abominable idol and antichrist, who acknowledge
   you as Christ's vicar and spouse of his most worthy church, and who
   venerate you with devout reverence and constant faith and obedience. By
   the authority of blessed Peter and Paul and your authority, may we and
   they be absolved from all bonds of sins, be filled with all blessings
   on our pilgrimage and finally be led by his ineffable mercy to eternal
   joys. Amen.

   For our part, as soon as we were aware from the reports of trustworthy
   people that so great an impiety had been committed, we were afflicted
   with grief and sadness, as was to be expected, both for the great
   scandal to the church and for the ruin of the souls of its
   perpetrators, especially Amadeus that antichrist whom we used to
   embrace in the depths of charity and whose prayers and wishes we always
   strove to meet in so far as we could in God. Already for some time we
   had it in mind to provide salutary remedies, in accordance with our
   pastoral office, against an abomination of this sort. Now, however,
   challenged publicly before the church to confront these evils, we
   propose to rise to the defence of the church and tackle this great
   crime more quickly and more urgently. Therefore, in order that so
   enormous and execrable a deed may, with the help of God whose cause is
   at stake, be destroyed from its very roots, we are applying, in
   conjunction with this holy council and with the least possible delay, a
   remedy in accordance with the holy canons.

   We are aware that the above petition of the promoter and the procurator
   is just and in conformity with both divine and human law, and although
   the aforesaid crimes and excesses are so very public and notorious that
   nothing can conceal them and no further information is required;
   Nevertheless, for greater precaution and certainly about the above, we
   commissioned, with the approval of this sacred council, some noteworthy
   persons from every rank in the council to seek information about the
   above and to refer their findings to us and the sacred council. Those
   so commissioned fulfilled their task of investigation with the care
   demanded by a schismatical depravity of this kind and faithfully
   reported to us and the sacred council in a synodal congregation what
   they had found out by the interrogation of trustworthy persons. In such
   public, manifest and notorious matters, action could have been taken
   against the said infamous and scandalous men without waiting further,
   by means of severe penalties in accordance with canonical sanctions.
   Nevertheless we and this holy synod, imitating the mercy of God who
   desires not the death of the sinner but rather that he be converted and
   live, have decided to show all possible mercy and to act, in so far as
   we can, in such a way that the proposed mildness may recall them to
   heart and lead them to recoil from the above-mentioned excesses, and so
   that when at last they return to the bosom of the church like the
   prodigal son, we may receive them with kindness and embrace them with
   fatherly love.

   Therefore, through the tender mercy of our God and by the shedding of
   the precious blood of our lord Jesus Christ, in whom and by whom the
   redemption of the human race and the foundation of holy mother church
   were effected, from the depths of our hearts we exhort, beg and beseech
   the antichrist Amadeus and the aforesaid electors, or rather profaners,
   and whoever else believes in, adheres to, receives or in any way
   supports him, straightaway to stop violating the church's unity for
   which the Saviour prayed so earnestly to the Father, and to cease from
   rending and lacerating the fraternal charity and peace which the same
   Redeemer, as he was about to leave this world, repeatedly and so
   insistently commended to his disciples and without which neither
   prayers nor fasts nor alms are acceptable to God, and utterly to desist
   as quickly as possible from the aforesaid destructive and scandalous
   excesses, and so to find with us and this sacred council, if they
   really obey as they are bound to do, the affection of a father in
   respect of everything.

   However, so that fear of penalties and harshness of discipline may
   force them if perchance love of justice and virtue does not withdraw
   them from sin, with the approval of this sacred council we demand and
   warn the antichrist Amadeus and the aforesaid electors, or rather
   profaners, and believers, adherents, receivers and supporters, and we
   strictly enjoin and order him and them in virtue of holy obedience and
   under the penalties of anathema, heresy, schism and treason which have
   been inflicted in any ways against such persons, whether by men or by
   the law:

   That within fifty days immediately following the publication of this
   letter, the antichrist Amadeus should cease from acting any more and
   designating himself as the Roman pontiff and should not, in so far as
   he can, allow himself to be held and called such by others, and should
   not dare hereafter in any way to use papal insignia and other things
   belonging in any way to the Roman pontiff; And that the aforesaid
   electors, or rather profaners, and adherents, receivers and supporters
   should no longer, either in person or through others, directly or
   indirectly or under any pretext, aid, believe in, adhere to or support
   the said Amadeus in this crime of schism.

   Rather, both Amadeus himself and the aforesaid electors, believers,
   adherents and supporters should hold, recognize and reverence us as the
   true Roman pontiff and vicar of Christ and legitimate successor of
   Peter, and should reverently obey and maintain us as father and pastor
   of their souls, and should take care legitimately to notify us and this
   sacred council about these matters within the appointed interval of
   time, so that no scruple of doubt may remain about their genuine
   obedience.

   If Amadeus and the said electors, believers, adherents, receivers and
   supporters shall act otherwise - though may it not be so - and do not
   effectively fulfil each and all of the aforesaid points within the
   appointed time, we wish and decree that from then as from now they
   automatically incur the stated penalties.

   Moreover, on the fifteenth day after the aforesaid interval of time, if
   it is not a feast, otherwise on the following non-feast day, the
   aforesaid supporters all together or singly shall appear in person
   before us and the aforesaid council where we shall then be, to be seen
   and heard individually and even by name. Thus we now cite them for that
   day, to be declared schismatics, blasphemers and as heretics, to be
   punished as traitors, and to have incurred the aforesaid censures and
   penalties, and others to be inflicted, according as it shall seem good
   and justice shall persuade:

   Notifying the same people and any of them individually, whether or not
   they come, that if they shall not have shown that they have obeyed, we
   shall proceed with justice to declaring the aforesaid penalties,
   notwithstanding their contumacy or absence, with the intention of
   proceeding further to aggravation and re-aggravation, as the rigour of
   justice shall demand and their merits require. In order that this
   monition and citation of ours may be brought to the attention of the
   authors of their monition and citation and of other interested persons,
   we shall have sheets of paper or membranes of parchment containing it
   affixed to the doors or gates of the church of St Mary Novella in
   Florence, of our palace situated near that church and of the cathedral
   church of Florence. These will make known this monition as if by a
   sonorous town-crying and a public notice, in order that after such
   notification these people may not be able to pretend that it did not
   reach them or that they were ignorant of it, since it is unlikely that
   what is made known so obviously to all should remain unknown or hidden
   to them.

   We wish and we decree by our apostolic authority that this our monition
   promulgated on the said doors and gates shall have as much value and be
   as immutable and as binding on the said warned people, notwithstanding
   any contrary constitution, as if it had been intimated and disclosed to
   each and all of the warned people in person and in their presence.

   Finally, lest the aforesaid warned and cited persons allege as a cloak
   of excuse that the council and the Roman curia, the common fatherland
   of all, is an unsafe place for them and that, because of the
   above-mentioned things or other enmities or other reasons, danger
   threatens them in their coming, staying and returning, we reassure them
   by this present letter and we require and exhort by the same letter all
   patriarchs, archbishops, bishops and other prelates of churches and
   monasteries, clerics and ecclesiastical persons as well as dukes,
   marquises, princes, rulers, captains and any other officials and their
   lieutenants, as also the communities and corporations of cities,
   castles, towns, vills and other places, and we strictly command the
   patriarchs, archbishops, bishops and other prelates and our other
   subjects that they are not to inflict any injury or harm on the
   aforesaid warned persons and their goods and property nor, to the best
   of their power, to allow such to be inflicted by others. Let nobody
   therefore . . . If anyone however . . .


   Session 10 - 27 May 1440

   [Eugenius IV exhorts the members of the synod at Basel to desist from
   their opposition]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. In the opinion of holy fathers, public sinners ought to be
   publicly censured so that others may stand in fear. Accordingly, we and
   this sacred council of Florence recently censured and denounced in
   public before the church, in synodal form, the authors and abettors of
   the pestilential sin of schism against the holy apostolic see and the
   holy Roman church, the mother and mistress of all Christians, which was
   perpetrated by Amadeus, once duke of Savoy, and his accomplices. It
   would have been in conformity with the sacred canons to have passed a
   sentence of due severity straightaway on those notoriously sacrilegious
   persons. However, desiring their conversion and salvation rather than
   their punishment, we begged, warned and required of them, with all the
   charity and mildness we could, to reflect and to recoil from such great
   iniquity, promising them pardon and favour and a father's affection.
   But if they refused to heed these dutiful admonitions, we decreed that
   they should be punished with penalties proportionate to so great an
   outrage, as is contained in the monition promulgated against them,
   which is as follows.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Session 11 - 4 February 1442

   [Bull of union with the Copts]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. Sing praises to the Lord for he has done gloriously; let this
   be known in all the earth. Shout, and sing for joy, O inhabitant of
   Zion, for great in your midst is the holy one of Israel. To sing and to
   exult in the Lord certainly befits the church of God for his great
   magnificence and the glory of his name, which the most merciful God has
   deigned to bring about on this very day. It is right, indeed, to praise
   and bless with all our hearts our Saviour, who daily builds up his holy
   church with new additions. His benefactions to his Christian people are
   at all times many and great and manifest more clearly than the light of
   day his immense love for us. Yet if we look more closely at the
   benefactions which the divine mercy has deigned to effect in most
   recent times, we shall assuredly be able to judge that in these days of
   ours the gifts of his love have been more in number and greater in kind
   than in many past ages.

   For in less than three years our lord Jesus Christ by his indefatigable
   kindness, to the common and lasting joy of the whole of Christianity,
   has generously effected in this holy ecumenical synod the most salutary
   union of three great nations. Hence it has come about that nearly the
   whole of the east that adores the glorious name of Christ and no small
   part of the north, after prolonged discord with the holy Roman church,
   have come together in the same bond of faith and love. For first the
   Greeks and those subject to the four patriarchal sees, which cover many
   races and nations and tongues, then the Armenians, who are a race of
   many peoples, and today indeed the Jacobites, who are a great people in
   Egypt, have been united with the holy apostolic see.

   Nothing is more pleasing to our Saviour, the lord Jesus Christ, than
   mutual love among people and nothing can give more glory to his name
   and advantage to the church than that Christians, with all discord
   between them banished, should come together in the same purity of
   faith. Deservedly all of us ought to sing for joy and to exult in the
   Lord; we whom the divine clemency has made worthy to see in our days
   such great splendour of the Christian faith. With the greatest
   readiness we therefore announce these marvellous facts to the whole
   Christian world, so that just as we are filled with unspeakable joy for
   the glory of God and the exaltation of the church, we may make others
   participate in this great happiness. Thus all of us with one voice may
   magnify and glorify God and may return abundant and daily thanks, as is
   fitting, to his majesty for so many and so great marvellous benefits
   bestowed on his holy church in this age. He who diligently does the
   work of God not only awaits merit and reward in heaven but also
   deserves generous glory and praise among people. Therefore we consider
   that our venerable brother John, patriarch of the Jacobites, whose zeal
   for this holy union is immense, should deservedly be praised and
   extolled by us and the whole church and deserves, together with his
   whole race, the general approval of all Christians. Moved by us,
   through our envoy and our letter, to send an embassy to us and this
   sacred synod and to unite himself and his people in the same faith with
   the Roman church, he sent to us and this synod the beloved son Andrew,
   an Egyptian, endowed in no mean degree with faith and morals and abbot
   of the monastery of St Anthony in Egypt, in which St Anthony himself is
   said to have lived and died. The patriarch, fired with great zeal,
   ordered and commissioned him reverently to accept, in the name of the
   patriarch and his Jacobites, the doctrine of the faith that the Roman
   church holds and preaches, and afterwards to bring this doctrine to the
   patriarch and the Jacobites so that they might acknowledge and formally
   approve it and preach it in their lands.

   We, therefore, to whom the Lord gave the task of feeding Christ's
   sheep', had abbot Andrew carefully examined by some outstanding men of
   this sacred council on the articles of the faith, the sacraments of the
   church and certain other matters pertaining to salvation. At length,
   after an exposition of the catholic faith to the abbot, as far as this
   seemed to be necessary, and his humble acceptance of it, we have
   delivered in the name of the Lord in this solemn session, with the
   approval of this sacred ecumenical council of Florence, the following
   true and necessary doctrine.

   First, then, the holy Roman church, founded on the words of our Lord
   and Saviour, firmly believes, professes and preaches one true God,
   almighty, immutable and eternal, Father, Son and holy Spirit; one in
   essence, three in persons; unbegotten Father, Son begotten from the
   Father, holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son; the Father
   is not the Son or the holy Spirit, the Son is not the Father or the
   holy Spirit, the holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son; the Father
   is only the Father, the Son is only the Son, the holy Spirit is only
   the holy Spirit. The Father alone from his substance begot the Son; the
   Son alone is begotten of the Father alone; the holy Spirit alone
   proceeds at once from the Father and the Son. These three persons are
   one God not three gods, because there is one substance of the three,
   one essence, one nature, one Godhead, one immensity, one eternity, and
   everything is one where the difference of a relation does not prevent
   this. Because of this unity the Father is whole in the Son, whole in
   the holy Spirit; the Son is whole in the Father, whole in the holy
   Spirit; the holy Spirit is whole in the Father, whole in the Son. No
   one of them precedes another in eternity or excels in greatness or
   surpasses in power. The existence of the Son from the Father is
   certainly eternal and without beginning, and the procession of the holy
   Spirit from the Father and the Son is eternal and without beginning.
   Whatever the Father is or has, he has not from another but from himself
   and is principle without principle. Whatever the Son is or has, he has
   from the Father and is principle from principle. Whatever the holy
   Spirit is or has, he has from the Father together with the Son. But the
   Father and the Son are not two principles of the holy Spirit, but one
   principle, just as the Father and the Son and the holy Spirit are not
   three principles of creation but one principle. Therefore it condemns,
   reproves, anathematizes and declares to be outside the body of Christ,
   which is the church, whoever holds opposing or contrary views. Hence it
   condemns Sabellius, who confused the persons and altogether removed
   their real distinction. It condemns the Arians, the Eunomians and the
   Macedonians who say that only the Father is true God and place the Son
   and the holy Spirit in the order of creatures. It also condemns any
   others who make degrees or inequalities in the Trinity.

   Most firmly it believes, professes and preaches that the one true God,
   Father, Son and holy Spirit, is the creator of all things that are,
   visible and invisible, who, when he willed it, made from his own
   goodness all creatures, both spiritual and corporeal, good indeed
   because they are made by the supreme good, but mutable because they are
   made from nothing, and it asserts that there is no nature of evil
   because every nature, in so far as it is a nature, is good. It
   professes that one and the same God is the author of the old and the
   new Testament - that is, the law and the prophets, and the gospel -
   since the saints of both testaments spoke under the inspiration of the
   same Spirit. It accepts and venerates their books, whose titles are as
   follows.

   Five books of Moses, namely Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
   Deuteronomy; Joshua, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings, two of
   Paralipomenon, Esdras, Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Job, Psalms of
   David, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus,
   Isaiah, Jeremiah, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel; the twelve minor prophets,
   namely Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
   Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; two books of the Maccabees; the
   four gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; fourteen letters of Paul,
   to the Romans, two to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, to the
   Ephesians, to the Philippians, two to the Thessalonians, to the
   Colossians, two to Timothy, to Titus, to Philemon, to the Hebrews; two
   letters of Peter, three of John, one of James, one of Jude; Acts of the
   Apostles; Apocalypse of John.

   Hence it anathematizes the madness of the Manichees who posited two
   first principles, one of visible things, the other of invisible things,
   and said that one was the God of the new Testament, the other of the
   old Testament. It firmly believes, professes and preaches that one
   person of the Trinity, true God, Son of God begotten by the Father,
   consubstantial and coeternal with the Father, in the fullness of time
   which the inscrutable depth of divine counsel determined, for the
   salvation of the human race, took a real and complete human nature from
   the immaculate womb of the virgin Mary, and joined it to himself in a
   personal union of such great unity that whatever is of God there, is
   not separated from man, and whatever is human is not divided from the
   Godhead, and he is one and the same undivided, each nature perduring in
   its properties, God and man, Son of God and son of man, equal to the
   Father according to his divinity, less than the Father according to his
   humanity, immortal and eternal through the nature of the Godhead,
   passible and temporal from the condition of assumed humanity. It firmly
   believes, professes and preaches that the Son of God was truly born of
   the virgin in his assumed humanity, truly suffered, truly died and was
   buried, truly rose from the dead, ascended into heaven and sits at the
   right hand of the Father and will come at the end of time to judge the
   living and the dead. It anathematizes, execrates and condemns every
   heresy that is tainted with the contrary. First it condemns Ebion,
   Cerinthus, Marcion, Paul of Samosata, Photinus and all similar
   blasphemers who, failing to see the personal union of the humanity with
   the Word, denied that our lord Jesus Christ was true God and professed
   him to be simply a man who by a greater participation in divine grace,
   which he had received through the merit of his holier life, should be
   called a divine man.

   It anathematizes also Manes and his followers who, imagining that the
   Son of God took to himself not a real body but a phantasmal one
   completely rejected the truth of the humanity in Christ, Valentinus,
   who declared that the Son of God took nothing from his virgin mother
   but that he assumed a heavenly body and passed through the virgin's
   womb like water flowing down an aqueduct; Arius, who by his assertion
   that the body taken from the virgin had no soul, wanted the Deity to
   take the place of the soul; and Apollinarius who, realizing that if the
   soul informing the body were denied there would be no true humanity in
   Christ, posited only a sensitive soul and held that the deity of the
   Word took the place of the rational soul. It anathematizes also
   Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorius, who asserted that the humanity
   was united to the Son of God through grace, and hence that there are
   two persons in Christ just as they profess there are two natures, since
   they could not understand that the union of the humanity to the Word
   was hypostatic and therefore they denied that he had received the
   subsistence of the Word. For according to this blasphemy the Word was
   not made flesh but the Word dwelt in flesh through grace, that is, the
   Son of God did not become man but rather the Son of God dwelt in a man.
   It also anathematizes, execrates and condemns the archimandrite
   Eutyches who, when he understood that the blasphemy of Nestorius
   excluded the truth of the incarnation, and that it was therefore
   necessary for the humanity to be so united to the Word of God that
   there should be one and the same person of the divinity and the
   humanity; and also because, granted the plurality of natures, he could
   not grasp the unity of the person, since he posited one person in
   Christ of divinity and humanity; so he affirmed that there was one
   nature, suggesting that before the union there was a duality of natures
   which passed into a single nature in the act of assumption, thereby
   conceding a great blasphemy and impiety that either the humanity was
   converted into the divinity or the divinity into the humanity. It also
   anathematizes, execrates and condemns Macarius of Antioch and all
   others of similar views who, although they are orthodox on the duality
   of natures and the unity of person, yet have gone enormously wrong on
   Christ's principles of action by declaring that of the two natures in
   Christ, there was only one principle of action and one will. The holy
   Roman church anathematizes all of these and their heresies and affirms
   that in Christ there are two wills and two principles of action.

   It firmly believes, professes and preaches that never was anyone,
   conceived by a man and a woman, liberated from the devil's dominion
   except by faith in our lord Jesus Christ, the mediator between God and
   humanity, who was conceived without sin, was born and died. He alone by
   his death overthrew the enemy of the human race, canceling our sins,
   and unlocked the entrance to the heavenly kingdom, which the first man
   by his sin had locked against himself and all his posterity. All the
   holy sacrifices sacraments and ceremonies of the old Testament had
   prefigured that he would come at some time.

   It firmly believes, professes and teaches that the legal prescriptions
   of the old Testament or the Mosaic law, which are divided into
   ceremonies, holy sacrifices and sacraments, because they were
   instituted to signify something in the future, although they were
   adequate for the divine cult of that age, once our lord Jesus Christ
   who was signified by them had come, came to an end and the sacraments
   of the new Testament had their beginning. Whoever, after the passion,
   places his hope in the legal prescriptions and submits himself to them
   as necessary for salvation and as if faith in Christ without them could
   not save, sins mortally. It does not deny that from Christ's passion
   until the promulgation of the gospel they could have been retained,
   provided they were in no way believed to be necessary for salvation.
   But it asserts that after the promulgation of the gospel they cannot be
   observed without loss of eternal salvation. Therefore it denounces all
   who after that time observe circumcision, the sabbath and other legal
   prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ and unable to share
   in eternal salvation, unless they recoil at some time from these
   errors. Therefore it strictly orders all who glory in the name of
   Christian, not to practise circumcision either before or after baptism,
   since whether or not they place their hope in it, it cannot possibly be
   observed without loss of eternal salvation.

   With regard to children, since the danger of death is often present and
   the only remedy available to them is the sacrament of baptism by which
   they are snatched away from the dominion of the devil and adopted as
   children of God, it admonishes that sacred baptism is not to be
   deferred for forty or eighty days or any other period of time in
   accordance with the usage of some people, but it should be conferred as
   soon as it conveniently can; and if there is imminent danger of death,
   the child should be baptized straightaway without any delay, even by a
   lay man or a woman in the form of the church, if there is no priest, as
   is contained more fully in the decree on the Armenians.

   It firmly believes, professes and teaches that every creature of God is
   good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
   because according to the word of the Lord not what goes into the mouth
   defiles a person, and because the difference in the Mosaic law between
   clean and unclean foods belongs to ceremonial practices, which have
   passed away and lost their efficacy with the coming of the gospel. It
   also declares that the apostolic prohibition, to abstain from what has
   been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled, was
   suited to that time when a single church was rising from Jews and
   gentiles, who previously lived with different ceremonies and customs.
   This was so that the gentiles should have some observances in common
   with Jews, and occasion would be offered of coming together in one
   worship and faith of God and a cause of dissension might be removed,
   since by ancient custom blood and strangled things seemed abominable to
   Jews, and gentiles could be thought to be returning to idolatry if they
   ate sacrificial food. In places, however, where the Christian religion
   has been promulgated to such an extent that no Jew is to be met with
   and all have joined the church, uniformly practising the same rites and
   ceremonies of the gospel and believing that to the clean all things are
   clean, since the cause of that apostolic prohibition has ceased, so its
   effect has ceased. It condemns, then, no kind of food that human
   society accepts and nobody at all neither man nor woman, should make a
   distinction between animals, no matter how they died; although for the
   health of the body, for the practice of virtue or for the sake of
   regular and ecclesiastical discipline many things that are not
   proscribed can and should be omitted, as the apostle says all things
   are lawful, but not all are helpful.

   It firmly believes, professes and preaches that all those who are
   outside the catholic church, not only pagans but also Jews or heretics
   and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life and will go into the
   everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels,
   unless they are joined to the catholic church before the end of their
   lives; that the unity of the ecclesiastical body is of such importance
   that only for those who abide in it do the church's sacraments
   contribute to salvation and do fasts, almsgiving and other works of
   piety and practices of the Christian militia produce eternal rewards;
   and that nobody can be saved, no matter how much he has given away in
   alms and even if he has shed his blood in the name of Christ, unless he
   has persevered in the bosom and the unity of the catholic church.

   It embraces, approves and accepts the holy synod of 318 fathers at
   Nicaea, which was convened in the time of our predecessor most blessed
   Silvester and the great and most pious emperor Constantine. In it the
   impious Arian heresy and its author was condemned and there was defined
   that the Son of God is consubstantial and coeternal with the Father. It
   also embraces, approves and accepts the holy synod of 150 fathers at
   Constantinople, which was convoked in the time of our predecessor most
   blessed Damasus and the elder Theodosius and which anathematized the
   impious error of Macedonius, who asserted that the holy Spirit is not
   God but a creature. Those whom they condemn, it condemns; what they
   approve, it approves; and in every respect it wants what was defined
   there to remain unchanged and inviolate.

   It also embraces, approves and accepts the first holy synod of 200
   fathers at Ephesus, which is third in the order of universal synods and
   was convoked under our predecessor most blessed Celestine and the
   younger Theodosius. In it the blasphemy of the impious Nestorius was
   condemned, and there was defined that the person of our lord Jesus
   Christ, true God and true man, is one and that the blessed ever-virgin
   Mary should be preached by the whole church not only as Christ-bearer
   but also as God-bearer, that is as mother of God as well as mother of
   the man.

   But it condemns, anathematizes and rejects the impious second synod of
   Ephesus, which was convened under our predecessor most blessed Leo and
   the aforesaid emperor. In it Dioscorus, bishop of Alexandria, defender
   of the heresiarch Eutyches and impious persecutor of holy Flavian,
   bishop of Constantinople, with cunning and threat led the execrable
   synod to an approval of the Eutychian impiety.

   It also embraces, approves and accepts the holy synod of 630 fathers at
   Chalcedon, which is fourth in the order of universal synods and was
   held in the time of our predecessor most blessed Leo and the emperor
   Marcian. In it the Eutychian heresy and its author Eutyches and its
   defender Dioscorus were condemned, and there was defined that our lord
   Jesus Christ is true God and true man and that in the one and same
   person the divine and human natures remain entire, inviolate,
   incorrupt, unconfused and distinct, the humanity doing what befits man,
   the divinity what befits God. Those whom they condemn, it condemns;
   those whom they approve, it approves.

   It also embraces, approves and accepts the fifth holy synod, the second
   of Constantinople, which was held in the time of our predecessor most
   blessed Vigilius and the emperor Justinian. In it the definition of the
   sacred council of Chalcedon about the two natures and the one person of
   Christ was renewed and many errors of Origen and his followers,
   especially about the penitence and liberation of demons and other
   condemned beings, were refuted and condemned.

   It also embraces, approves and accepts the third holy synod of 150
   fathers at Constantinople, which is sixth in the order of universal
   synods and was convened in the time of our predecessor most blessed
   Agatho and the emperor Constantine IV. In it the heresy of Macarius of
   Antioch and his adherents was condemned, and there was defined that in
   our lord Jesus Christ there are two perfect and complete natures and
   two principles of action and also two wills, although there is one and
   the same person to whom the actions of each of the two natures belong,
   the divinity doing what is of God, the humanity doing what is human.

   It also embraces, approves and accepts all other universal synods which
   were legitimately summoned, celebrated and confirmed by the authority
   of a Roman pontiff, and especially this holy synod of Florence, in
   which, among other things, most holy unions with the Greeks and the
   Armenians have been achieved and many most salutary definitions in
   respect of each of these unions have been issued, as is contained in
   full in the decrees previously promulgated, which are as follows: Let
   the heavens be glad . . . 1; Exult in God . 2

   However, since no explanation was given in the aforesaid decree of the
   Armenians in respect of the form of words which the holy Roman church,
   relying on the teaching and authority of the apostles Peter and Paul,
   has always been wont to use in the consecration of the Lord's body and
   blood, we concluded that it should be inserted in this present text. It
   uses this form of words in the consecration of the Lord's body: For
   this is my body. And of his blood: For this is the chalice of my blood,
   of the new and everlasting covenant, which will be shed for you and for
   many unto the remission of sins .

   Whether the wheat bread, in which the sacrament is confected, has been
   baked on the same day or earlier is of no importance whatever. For,
   provided the substance of bread remains, there should be no doubt at
   all that after the aforesaid words of consecration of the body have
   been pronounced by a priest with the intention of consecrating,
   immediately it is changed in substance into the true body of Christ.

   It is asserted that some people reject fourth marriages as condemned.
   Lest sin is attributed where it does not exist, since the apostle says
   that a wife on her husband's death is free from his law and free in the
   Lord to marry whom she wishes, and since no distinction is made between
   the deaths of the first, second and third husbands, we declare that not
   only second and third marriages but also fourth and further ones may
   lawfully be contracted, provided there is no canonical impediment. We
   say, however, that they would be more commendable if thereafter they
   abstain from marriage and persevere in chastity because we consider
   that, just as virginity is to be preferred in praise and merit to
   widowhood, so chaste widowhood is preferable to marriage.

   After all these explanations the aforesaid abbot Andrew, in the name of
   the aforesaid patriarch and of himself and of all the Jacobites,
   receives and accepts with all devotion and reverence this most salutary
   synodal decree with all its chapters, declarations, definitions
   traditions, precepts and statutes and all the doctrine contained
   therein, and also whatever the holy apostolic see and the Roman church
   holds and teaches. He also reverently accepts those doctors and holy
   fathers whom the Roman church approves, and he holds as rejected and
   condemned whatever persons and things the Roman church rejects and
   condemns, promising as a son of true obedience, in the name of the
   above persons, faithfully and always to obey the regulations and
   commands of the said apostolic see.

   Session 12 - 14 October 1443

   [Eugenius IV convokes the Lateran council, that is, the continuation of
   the council of Florence]

   Eugenius. Convocation of the Lateran council. For an everlasting
   record. By the infinite clemency and pity of the redeemer of the human
   race, our God and lord Jesus Christ, by whose ineffable providence the
   whole body of the church is sanctified and ruled and through whose aid
   - which surpasses our merits and exceeds what we recognise ourselves as
   worthy either to seek or to solicit - gifts and favours of his mercy
   daily come to us, we have returned to bountiful Rome, the see of most
   blessed Peter, to the holy of holies, the Lateran of the patriarchs.
   With great trust we are embracing and earnestly pursuing the things
   which seem to be promoted and revealed by divine rather than by human
   wisdom. Hence it is that because of various just, reasonable and
   necessary causes which then moved our mind, by apostolic authority and
   the plenitude of power and with the approval of the council, we
   transferred the holy ecumenical council of Florence, over which we were
   then presiding, to this bountiful city of Rome and the Lateran
   basilica, to be re-established and continued on the first day following
   the fifteenth day after our arrival, as is contained in more detail in
   the letter composed for that purpose, whose text is word for word as
   follows:

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record The compassionate and merciful Lord ordained that his
   only-begotten Son should assume a human nature and should so join it to
   himself into a single person that not only would fallen nature be
   repaired by virtue of that ineffable union, but also by his embrace as
   spouse and by the kiss of his mouth his bride the holy church would be
   brought forth, her members would be joined together by a solid bond of
   love, and the Christian people would acquire peace in harmony,
   salvation in a unity of spirit, and glory in the bond of charity.

   In so far as it is granted to us by the mercy of our lord and saviour
   Jesus Christ, whose place we though unworthy take on earth, we,
   following in his footsteps, ardently desire and intensely pursue the
   salvation, unity and peace of the Christian people. Therefore we are
   intent, with a deserved watchfulness, on the conservation of this holy
   ecumenical council. In it, by the marvellous kindness and mercy of the
   same Saviour, very many most noteworthy works have been achieved for
   his praise and glory, the increase of the catholic faith, the unity of
   the Christian people and the exaltation of the holy apostolic see and
   the Roman church. For in our own days we have seen Greeks, Armenians,
   Jacobites and other almost innumerable peoples, some of whom have been
   separated from the rite and the holy teaching of the Roman church for
   almost five hundred or even seven hundred years, joined with us in this
   sacred council, by God's mercy, under one divine law of truth and
   embracing us with due reverence as the true vicar of Christ, the
   successor of Peter and the shepherd of the universal church.

   There are no limits to the kindness of our Saviour, who works for the
   unity of the Christian people and his mystical body, for which he
   prayed: I wish, Father, that they may be one even as we are one. Indeed
   we are experiencing his kindness particularly in these times. For his
   infinite mercy has granted that we are now awaiting the arrival of
   envoys, furnished with full power to accept in this holy council the
   doctrine of the orthodox faith from which their peoples have gone
   astray in many points, from our most dear son in Christ Zar'a Ya'qob,
   king of Ethiopia, commonly called Prester John, to whom very many kings
   and almost innumerable peoples are subject and who is impelled, as we
   trust, by divine inspiration. To foster and hasten such a holy and
   divine proposal, which is so necessary for the whole of Christianity,
   we have sent our own nuncios and envoys, who are full of zeal for this
   holy task and have considerable influence with the said most powerful
   king.

   Many more works have been proposed to us for the praise of God and the
   increase of the faith and the Christian people. We wish to give careful
   attention to them. Frightened by neither the heavy expenses nor the
   many labours, we put our trust in the power of him whose inspiration
   motivates us. Let us hope, moreover, that in the course of time many
   other desirable and salutary fruits will accrue to the catholic faith
   and the church of Christ, especially if this holy synod is held in a
   place of greater importance and in a royal and sacerdotal city. To the
   genial city of Rome, which is particularly our city and which, as is
   right, we want to participate and help in these salutary and divine
   tasks, we have turned our attention, a city which we consider to be
   abounding in all spiritual and temporal goods and more holy and
   outstanding than all other cities for carrying out these holy tasks and
   bringing them to a religious and happy conclusion. For in it our
   Saviour in his eternal providence settled the apostolic see in blessed
   Peter, prince of all the apostles, and on his right in fellowship the
   wondrous foresight of the same Saviour added the blessed apostle Paul.
   They are two bulwarks of the faith through whom the gospel shone in
   Rome; they are true fathers and true pastors; they are those who
   suffered on one day for merit, in one place for grace, under one
   persecutor for equal virtue, and made this city sacerdotal and royal
   and the capital of the world, as being the holy seat of Peter, and
   consecrated it to the lord Christ with the glorious blood of martyrdom.
   "For the Roman church founded all, whether the eminence of a patriarch
   or the seats of metropolitan primacy or of bishoprics or the dignities
   of churches of whatever rank; he alone, who entrusted to blessed Peter,
   the key-bearer of eternal life, the rights of the heavenly as well as
   of the earthly kingdom, founded the Roman church and straightaway set
   it on the rock of nascent faith." Since, then, the city of Rome has
   been ennobled and distinguished by so many and so great divine gifts
   and is resplendent with so much authority and also draws the faithful
   to itself from all sides by the relics and sanctity of apostles,
   martyrs and confessors; since Christian nations and peoples even in the
   furthest parts of the world flock to the said city and are seen to
   desire greatly that we return to our see, which has been divinely
   constituted for Roman pontiffs, in order that a greater veneration and
   devotion may grow in the Christian people towards both us, through the
   authority of the said see, and the said see, through our presence and
   authority, and since we are informed that, on account of our residence
   in Rome, subjects and faithful of ours and of the Roman church, whose
   peace and tranquillity we are bound to procure and preserve with
   special zeal, will enjoy much greater peace and unity and that in this
   way, with God's blessing, we shall be more expeditious and effective in
   pursuing works of peace and harmony and in arranging and confirming, as
   we ardently desire, peace and unity among other catholic kings and
   princes and peoples; Therefore to Rome, which is a suitable and safe
   place fulfilling all human needs as regards fertility of the soil and
   sea transport; under the influence of the above-mentioned necessary
   causes and many other just and reasonable ones which direct our mind to
   the praise and glory of almighty God, the extirpation of heresies and
   errors, the reform of morals, the peace, salvation and increase of the
   Christian people and the prosecution of other holy works, under the
   Lord's leadership, for which the said council was originally convened;

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son and holy
   Spirit, with the approval of the said general council given on 5
   January last, in a general congregation under our presidency, by
   apostolic authority and by this present letter, we translate as from
   now this holy ecumenical council of Florence, and by the same authority
   and the same letter we have decreed and declared it to be translated to
   the Lateran basilica, which is the first and proper seat of the supreme
   pontiff and the vicar of Jesus Christ, to be resumed, continued and
   prosecuted on the day following the fifteenth day after our entry into
   bountiful Rome. In addition, by an inviolable constitution and decree
   we ordain that each and all of the securities and safe-conducts, which
   we granted at the beginning of this sacred council and which we are
   extending anew and prolonging, are to be considered as included in this
   present letter and as having the same force and effect as if they had
   been mentioned word for word in this our synodal constitution and had
   been inserted and denoted in it. Let nobody therefore . . . If anyone
   however . . .

   Now that the appointed day has come and all the reasons for which it
   had then seemed necessary to resume the council are recognised to be
   more than ever necessary, with the said necessary reasons and many
   other just and reasonable ones impelling us, for the praise and glory
   of almighty God, the extirpation of heresies and errors, the reform of
   morals, the peace, salvation and increase of the Christian people, and
   the completion of other holy works, under the Lord's leadership, for
   which the aforesaid council was originally convened;

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son and holy
   Spirit, by the same authority and power, with the same approval and by
   this present letter; We resume, continue and carry forward the
   aforesaid ecumenical council of Florence, which was translated as
   above, and we decree and declare by this present letter that this
   continuation, resumption and prosecution is taking place in this
   council hall of the sacred Lateran patriarchate. We warn and require
   each and all of those who are bound by law or custom to take part in
   general councils that they should come as quickly as possible to this
   present holy ecumenical Lateran council, as referred to above, which is
   continuing for the attainment of the above-mentioned ends. In addition,
   we ordain again by this constitution and decree that each and all of
   the securities and safe-conducts, which we granted at the beginning of
   the sacred ecumenical council of Ferrara and which we are extending
   anew and prolonging, are to be considered as included in this present
   letter and as having the same force and effect as if they had been
   mentioned word for word in this our synodal constitution and had been
   inserted and denoted in

   Let nobody therefore . . . if anyone however . . .

   Session 13 - 30 November 1444

   [Bull of union with the Syrians]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. In these our days the ineffable clemency of divine mercy
   bestows on his holy church many and marvellous gifts which are much
   greater than we could have asked for or envisaged. Hence we see that
   the orthodox faith is expanded, new peoples daily return to the
   obedience of the apostolic see and reasons for joy and exaltation are
   daily being multiplied for us and all Christ's faithful, in such wise
   that we are deservedly incited time and again to say in jubilation with
   the prophet to the faithful peoples: Come, let us exult in the Lord,
   let us hail the God who saves us, for the Lord is great and most worthy
   of praise in the city of our God, on his holy mountain. It is true that
   in the catholic church, which is the city of God on the holy mountain
   and is founded on the authority of the apostolic see and Peter, God,
   whose omnipotence and wisdom knows no limits, has always worked great
   and inscrutable deeds. But the singular and special gift which the
   ineffable providence of its founder bestowed on it is that the orthodox
   faith, which alone gives life to and sanctifies the human race, should
   abide for ever on that holy mountain in a unique and unchangeable
   profession of faith and that dissents, which arise against the church
   from the variety of earthly opinions and separate people off from the
   firmness of that rock, should return to that mountain and be
   exterminated and eradicated. Whence it comes about that the peoples and
   nations thronging to its bosom agree with it in one truth of faith.
   Assuredly it is not from our merit that the immensity of divine
   goodness has granted us to behold these great sublime and marvellous
   gifts of God. His benevolence and condescension alone have granted that
   after the union of the Greeks in the sacred ecumenical council of
   Florence, who were seen to differ from the Roman church in some
   articles, and after the return of the Armenians and the Jacobites, who
   were entangled in various opinions, they should at last, having
   abandoned all dissent, come together into the one right way of truth.
   Behold now again with the Lord's help other nations have gathered from
   afar, inhabitants of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and the Euphrates,
   whose thinking about the procession of the holy Spirit and some other
   articles had gone astray.

   Great, then, for us and for all Christ's faithful is the reason for
   rejoicing. For with the Lord's approval the most illustrious profession
   of the Roman church about the truth of the faith, which has always been
   pure from all stain of error shines with new beams also in the east
   beyond the bounds of the Euphrates inasmuch as it has drawn our
   venerable brother Abdala, archbishop of Edessa and legate of our
   venerable brother Ignatius, patriarch of the Syrians, and of his whole
   nation, to us here in bountiful Rome and to this sacred ecumenical
   Lateran council and has bidden him humbly and devoutly to petition that
   we give to them the rule of faith which the holy Roman church
   professes. Among all the preoccupations of the holy apostolic see, we
   hold, as we have always done, our first and chiefest care to be the
   defence of the faith, the extermination of heresies and the propagation
   of the orthodox faith. Therefore we selected some of our venerable
   brethren, cardinals of the holy Roman church, who in turn co-opted from
   this sacred council some masters in holy scripture, to confer with the
   aforesaid archbishop about the difficulties, doubts and errors of that
   nation, to examine him in person and to open to him the rule of
   catholic truth, and finally to instruct and inform him fully about the
   integrity of the faith of the Roman church.

   They found him orthodox on all points of faith and practice except
   three articles: namely, the procession of the holy Spirit, the two
   natures in Jesus Christ our saviour, the two wills and principles of
   action in him. They laid before him the truth of the orthodox faith,
   opened up the meaning of the sacred scriptures, adduced the testimonies
   of holy doctors and added telling and pertinent reasons.

   When the archbishop had understood the doctrine on these points, he
   affirmed that all his doubts had been completely answered. He professed
   that he thought he fully understood the truth of the faith as regards
   both the procession of the holy Spirit and the two natures, two wills
   and two principles of action in our lord Jesus Christ. Moreover he
   declared that he would accept, in the name of the aforesaid patriarch
   and of the whole nation and of himself, the whole faith and all the
   teaching which we, with the approval of this sacred council, would
   propose to him.

   For this reason we were filled with exultation in Christ and poured out
   immense gratitude to our God, since we are seeing our desire for the
   salvation of that nation fulfilled.

   After careful discussion with our brethren and the sacred council, we
   decided, with the approval of the same council, to propose and assign
   to the said archbishop, who will accept it in the name of the above
   persons, the faith and doctrine which the holy Roman mother church
   holds.

   This, then, is the faith which the holy Roman mother church has always
   held, preached and taught and which she now holds, preaches, professes
   and teaches. This is the faith, as regards those three articles, which
   we decree that the said archbishop Abdala, on behalf and in the name of
   the said patriarch of the Syrians and of all that nation and of
   himself, shall accept and shall keep for ever. First, that the holy
   Spirit is eternally from the Father and the Son, and has his essence
   and his subsistent being from the Father together with the Son, and
   proceeds from both eternally as from one principle and a single
   spiration.

   Also it holds, professes and teaches that one and the same Son of God
   and of man, our lord Jesus Christ, is perfect in divinity and perfect
   in humanity; true God and true man, of a rational soul and a body;
   consubstantial with the Father as regards his divinity, consubstantial
   with us as regards his humanity; like us in all respects except for
   sin; begotten before the ages from the Father, and in the last days the
   same born according to his humanity for us and our salvation from Mary
   the virgin mother of God; one and the same Christ true only-begotten
   Son of God, acknowledged in two natures which undergo no confusion, no
   change, no division, no separation; at no point was the difference
   between the natures taken away through the union, but rather the
   property of both natures is preserved and comes together into a single
   person and a single subsistent being; he is not parted or divided into
   two persons, but is one and the same Son of God and of man, our lord
   Jesus Christ.

   Also it believes, professes and teaches in the one lord Jesus Christ
   two natural principles of action which undergo no division, no change,
   no separation, no confusion, in accordance with the teaching of the
   holy fathers; and two natural wills one divine, the other human, not in
   opposition, but his human will subject to his divine and all powerful
   will. For in the same way that his most holy animate flesh was made
   divine, not destroyed, but remained in its own limit and category, so
   his human will was made divine, not destroyed, but rather was preserved
   and perfected.

   We decree that the said archbishop Abdala ought, in the name of the
   above persons, to accept this faith, to hold it in his heart and to
   profess it with his mouth. Further we ordain and decree that he ought
   to receive and embrace, in the name of the above persons, whatever has
   been defined and established at various times by the holy Roman church,
   especially the decrees on the Greeks, the Armenians and the Jacobites,
   which were issued in the sacred ecumenical council of Florence and
   which, since Archbishop Abdala has carefully read them translated into
   Arabic and praised them, we have given to him, in the name of the above
   persons, for a wider and more complete instruction on everything; that
   whatever doctors and holy fathers the holy Roman church approves and
   accepts, he should, in the name of the above persons, approve and
   accept; and that whatever persons and other things she condemns and
   rejects, he should, in the name of the above persons, hold as condemned
   and rejected; promising on oath as a true son of obedience, in the name
   of the above persons, always devoutly and faithfully to obey the
   regulations and orders of the said apostolic see. If anyone however . .
   . Let nobody therefore . . .

   Session 14 - 7 August 1445

   [Bull of union with the Chaldeans and the Maronites of Cyprus]

   Eugenius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. Blessed be the God and Father of our lord Jesus Christ, the
   Father of mercies and God of all consolation, who daily promotes with
   many great favours, and accompanies with happy results far beyond our
   deserts, our aims and pious desires, whereby in fulfilment of our
   pastoral duties we long for and foster with many works, in so far as
   this allowed us from on high, the salvation of the Christian people.

   Indeed, after the union of the eastern church with the western church
   in the ecumenical council of Florence, and after the return of the
   Armenians, the Jacobites and the people of Mesopotamia, we despatched
   our venerable brother Andrew, archbishop of Kalocsa, to eastern lands
   and the island of Cyprus. He was to confirm in the faith which had been
   accepted the Greeks, Armenians and Jacobites living there, by his
   sermons and his expositions and explanations of the decrees issued for
   their union and return. He was also to try to bring back to the truth
   of the faith, using our warnings and exhortations, whoever else he
   might find there to be strangers to the truth of faith in other sects,
   whether they are followers of Nestorius or of Macarius.

   He pursued this task with vigour, thanks to the wisdom and other
   virtues with which the Lord, the giver of graces, has enriched him. He
   finally eliminated from their hearts, after many discussions, first all
   the impurity of Nestorius, who asserted that Christ is only a man and
   that the blessed Virgin is the mother of Christ but not of God, then
   that of the most impious Macarius of Antioch who, although he confessed
   that Christ is true God and man, asserted that there is in him only the
   divine will and principle of action, thereby diminishing his humanity.

   With divine assistance he converted to the truth of the orthodox faith
   our venerable brothers Timothy, metropolitan of the Chaldeans, who have
   been called Nestorians in Cyprus until now because they used to follow
   Nestorius, and Elias, bishop of the Maronites, who with his nation in
   the same realm was infected with the teachings of Macarius, together
   with a whole multitude of peoples and clerics subject to him in the
   island of Cyprus. To these prelates and all their subjects there, he
   delivered the faith and doctrine that the holy church has always
   cherished and observed. The said prelates, moreover, accepted this
   faith and doctrine with much veneration in a great public assembly of
   different peoples living in that realm, which was held in the
   metropolitan church of St Sophia.

   After that, the Chaldeans sent to us the aforesaid metropolitan
   Timothy, and Bishop Elias of the Maronites sent an envoy, to make to us
   a solemn profession of the faith of the Roman church, which by the
   providence of the Lord and the aid of blessed Peter and the apostle has
   always remained immaculate . Timothy, the metropolitan, reverently and
   devoutly professed this faith and doctrine to us, in this sacred
   general congregation of the ecumenical Lateran council, first in his
   own Chaldean tongue, which was interpreted in Greek and then translated
   from Greek into Latin, as follows: I, Timothy, archbishop of Tarsus and
   metropolitan of the Chaldeans who are in Cyprus, on behalf of myself
   and all my peoples in Cyprus, profess, vow and promise to almighty God,
   Father and Son and holy Spirit, and then to you, most holy and blessed
   father pope Eugenius IV, to this holy apostolic see and to this holy
   and venerable congregation, that henceforth I will always remain under
   the obedience of you and your successors and of the holy Roman church
   as under the unique mother and head of all other churches. Also, in
   future I will always hold and profess that the holy Spirit proceeds
   from the Father and the Son, as the holy Roman church teaches and
   holds. Also, in future I will always hold and approve two natures, two
   wills, one hypostasis and two principles of action in Christ.

   Also, in future I will always confess and approve all seven sacraments
   of the Roman church, just as she holds, teaches and preaches.

   Also, in future I will never add oil in the sacred eucharist.

   Also, in future I will always hold, confess, preach and teach whatever
   the holy Roman church holds, confesses, teaches and preaches and I
   reject, anathematize and condemn whatever she rejects, anathematizes
   and condemns; in future I will always reject, anathematize and condemn
   especially the impieties and blasphemies of the most wicked heresiarch
   Nestorius and every other heresy raising its head against this holy
   catholic and apostolic church.

   This is the faith, holy father, that I vow and promise to hold and
   observe and to see that it is held and observed by all my subjects. I
   engage myself and solemnly promise to deprive of all his goods and
   benefices, to excommunicate and to denounce as heretical and condemned,
   whoever rejects it and raises himself up against it and, if he is
   obstinate, to degrade him and to hand him over to the secular arm.

   Then our beloved son in Christ Isaac, envoy of our venerable brother
   Elias, bishop of the Maronites, on his behalf and in his name,
   rejecting the heresy of Macarius about one will in Christ, made with
   great veneration a profession that was similar in all details.

   For the devotion of these professions and for the salvation of so many
   souls we offer immense thanks to God and our lord Jesus Christ, who is
   in our times so greatly enlarging the faith and bestowing benefits on
   so many Christian peoples. We receive and approve these professions; we
   receive into the bosom of holy mother church the metropolitan and the
   bishop in Cyprus and their subjects; and while they remain in the
   aforesaid faith, obedience and devotion, we honour them with the
   following favours and privileges.

   First, nobody shall in future dare to call the said metropolitan of the
   Chaldeans and the said bishop of the Maronites, or their clerics and
   peoples or any individual among them, heretics, or to call Chaldeans,
   Nestorians. If anyone despises this ordinance, we order him to be
   excommunicated until such time as he offers a worthy satisfaction or
   has been punished, in the judgment of the ordinary, by some other
   temporal penalty.

   Also, the said metropolitan and bishop and their successors are
   forthwith to be preferred in each and every honour to bishops who are
   separated from the communion of the holy Roman church.

   Also, in future they can lay censures on their subjects, and those whom
   they rightly excommunicate in future shall be held by all as
   excommunicated, and those whom they absolve shall be held by all as
   absolved.

   Also, the said prelates and priests and their clerics can freely
   celebrate divine services in the churches of Catholics, and Catholics
   can freely celebrate them in their churches.

   Also, in future the said prelates and clerics and their lay men and
   women, who have accepted this union and faith, can choose to be buried
   in the churches of Catholics, to contract marriages with Catholics, but
   in the rite of Latin Catholics, and to enjoy and utilize all benefits,
   immunities and liberties which other Catholics, both lay and clerical,
   possess and enjoy in the said realm. Let nobody therefore . . . If
   anyone however . . .

   Session 1 - 14 December 1431

   The holy synod of Basel, representing the universal church,
   legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit under the presidency of the
   most reverend father in Christ lord Julian, cardinal deacon of St
   Angelo of the holy Roman church, legate of the apostolic see, for the
   glory of almighty God, the exaltation of the catholic faith and the
   progress of the Christian religion, laying its foundation on the
   cornerstone Christ Jesus, in whom the whole structure is joined
   together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord, calls to mind that
   the holy general synod of Constance, celebrated in the holy Spirit,
   esteeming it salutary and beneficial that general councils should be
   frequent in the holy church of God, established this by its decree as
   follows: The frequent holding of general councils . . . 2 Hence for the
   execution of that decree, the city of Pavia in Italy was chosen for the
   general council to be held at the end of the five years immediately
   following. At the decreed time that council was indeed inaugurated in
   the said city of Pavia and thence it was translated for certain reasons
   to the city of Siena. In that general council which was begun in Pavia
   and was held in the city of Siena, this city of Basel was chosen and
   duly assigned for the next future general council to be held after the
   seven-year period from the end of the council of Siena, as is stated in
   the public instrument then composed about this succession.

   [Establishment of the holy council of Basel]

   The most reverend lord legate in his desire to fulfil the apostolic
   commission since at the time when the beginning of the council was
   imminent he was immersed in the expedition against the pestilential
   heresy of the Hussites for the sake of the faith, had his vicegerents
   despatched to this city and thereafter with all possible speed came
   himself to this city, in order that, with the help of God's grace, he
   might fulfil in this general council the office of legate laid upon
   him, as our most holy lord Eugenius IV, pope by divine providence, had
   by a series of letters of his holiness enjoined on him. In this city,
   during more than three months, he held several congregations with
   prelates and others who had arrived in the city for the said general
   council, and he had discussions about the establishment and holding of
   the council. Finally it was decreed that the present solemn session
   should be held, in which, firstly, since from the above it is manifest
   that this city is the place deputed for the general council and the
   date for it to be held is already past, and the authority of the most
   holy apostolic see is not lacking, it decrees, defines and declares
   that in this city and place the general council is canonically fixed
   and founded, and that all, both prelates and others who by right or
   custom are obliged to attend general councils, are bound to come to its
   celebration.

   [Purpose of the council of Basel]

   Seeing that all things direct their actions more immediately and
   intensely the more knowledge they have of their destined purpose, so
   this holy synod, after intense meditation and thought on the needs of
   the Christian religion and after mature and ordered deliberation,
   decrees that, with the help of God from whom all good things comet, it
   will pursue with all its zeal and attention these three ends. First
   that, with the banishment of the darkness of all heresies from the
   bounds of the Christian people, the light of catholic truth, by the
   generosity of Christ the true light, may be resplendent. Secondly that,
   after due thought and with the help of the author of peace, the
   Christian people, freed from the madness of wars by which - with the
   sower of weeds doing his work - it is affected and divided in various
   parts of the world, may be brought back to a peaceful and tranquil
   state. Thirdly, as the vine of Christ has already almost run wild on
   account of the multitude of thistles and thorns of vices crowding in
   upon it, to cut them back through the endeavour of necessary
   cultivation, with the work from on high of the evangelical husbandman,
   so that it may flourish again and produce with happy abundance the
   fruits of virtue and esteem. Since such great benefits as these cannot
   be hoped for without a generous flow of heavenly grace, it earnestly
   exhorts in the Lord all Christ's faithful that for the happy
   achievement of the aforesaid they should urge the divine majesty with
   devout prayers, fasts and almsgiving that the good and merciful God,
   placated by such humble submission, may deign with his accustomed
   goodness to grant to this sacred council the desired completion of all
   these things, imposing this on them unto the remission of their sins.

   Session 2 - 15 February 1432

   The holy general synod of Basel, representing the church militant, for
   an everlasting record. To the praise of almighty God and the glory and
   honour of the blessed and undivided Trinity, for the extirpation of
   heresies and errors, for the reformation of morals in head and members
   of the church of God, and for the pacification of kings and kingdoms
   and other Christians in discord among themselves through the
   instigation of the author of discords, the synod, legitimately
   assembled in the holy Spirit, decrees, establishes, defines, declares
   and ordains as follows.

   [Decree that the council of Basel is legitimately begun]

   First, that the same sacred synod of Basel, by the decrees and
   ordinances of the sacred general councils of Constance and of Siena,
   and by the action of apostolic authority, was and is duly and
   legitimately begun and assembled in this place of Basel. And lest
   anyone should doubt about the power of the same sacred synod of Basel,
   this same synod in this present session ordains and decrees that two
   declarations from the decrees of the synod of Constance are to be
   inserted among its other decrees already issued or to be issued. The
   text of the first of these declarations is as follows, First it
   declares . . . 1; that of the other is this, Next it declares . . . I
   Therefore, presupposing also some other decrees of the council of
   Constance, especially the one beginning The frequent, which were read
   out in a former session of this sacred synod of Basel, the said synod
   of Basel decrees and declares that, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, for the extirpation of heresies and a general reformation of
   morals in the church in head and members, and also for procuring peace
   among Christians, as is stated above, no one of whatever authority,
   even if he is distinguished by the dignity of the papacy, could or
   should have in the past, or can or ought to now or in the future,
   dissolve or transfer the said synod of Basel to another locality or
   prorogue it to another date without the deliberation and consent of the
   same synod of Basel.


   Session 3 - 29 April 1432

   [Impossibility of the dissolution of the council is decreed]

   This holy council, considering that the aforesaid dissolution of the
   council was enacted contrary to the decrees of the council of
   Constance, and that it leads to a serious danger of subversion of the
   faith as well as disturbance and harm for the state of the church and
   scandal for the whole Christian people, decreed that the dissolution
   could not be made. Since, therefore, the dissolution is no obstacle at
   all, the prosecution of what has been praiseworthily set in motion for
   the stability of the faith and the salvation of the Christian people
   should, with the grace of the holy Spirit, be proceeded with. But since
   the aforesaid bishop of Lausanne and the dean of Utrecht, on their
   return, did not bring back from the most holy lord pope the desired
   reply, although the said most holy lord pope had been entreated,
   appealed to, required, requested and with every insistence very often
   implored not only by the aforesaid messengers in the name of the
   council but also by the most serene lord Sigismund, king of the Romans
   and loyal supporter of the church, so this holy synod, relying on the
   decrees of the sacred council of Constance, whose words are these, That
   the holy synod . . . ' decreed in this solemn session to make its
   demands to the most holy lord pope and also to the most reverend lord
   cardinals in the way and style as follows.

   This holy synod, therefore, legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit,
   beseeches the aforesaid most blessed lord pope Eugenius with all
   reverence and insistence and through the tender mercy of Jesus Christ
   entreats, requires implores and warns him to revoke in fact the alleged
   dissolution as in fact it was issued, and in the same way as he made
   the dissolution to send and publish over the different parts of the
   world the revocation, and completely to desist from every obstacle
   against the said council: indeed more, to favour and assist the
   council, as is his duty, and to offer it every support and opportune
   help, and to come in person within three months - an interval which it
   assigns and determines as a peremptory limit - if his physical state so
   allows. But if it does not, in his place and stead he should nominate
   some person or persons and send them with plenary power for each and
   every question in this council up to its very end through each and all
   of its acts gradually and successively. Otherwise, if his holiness
   should fail to do this, which is a thing that in no way is to be
   expected of the vicar of Christ, the holy synod will see to it that
   provision is made for the necessities of the church as shall seem just
   and as the holy Spirit shall dictate, and will proceed in accordance
   with what befits both divine and human law.

   In the same way it beseeches, requires, implores and warns the
   aforesaid most reverend lord cardinals, who as the chief hinges of the
   church of God should apply their minds with great fervour to these
   things, that they should bring earnest pressure to bear on the lord
   pope about the aforesaid things, and should favour, aid and help this
   sacred council in every opportune way. And since their presence, in
   view of their authority, great prudence and practical experience, is
   highly expedient for this sacred council, it requires and warns and
   cites the lord cardinals and each of them in particular that, canonical
   impediment ceasing, they shall come to the said council within three
   months from the notification by this present decree, which interval it
   precisely and peremptorily assigns and determines for the triple
   canonical monition. Otherwise, since failure to come to the sacred
   general council so as to aid the church in its great necessities will
   without doubt be judged as contributing to the danger of a serious
   challenge to the catholic faith and to the harm of the whole church,
   this holy council at the expiry of the stated interval will take
   proceedings against those who have failed to come, since their
   contumacy demands this, according as the order of divine as well as
   human law shall dictate and allow, and will take steps, with the help
   of the most High, to provide for the necessities of the church. In the
   aforesaid however, the said synod has no intention of including the
   most reverend lord cardinal of holy Cross as long as he is engaged in
   negotiations for peace between the kingdoms of France and England; but
   in respect of the most reverend lord cardinals of Plasencia and of
   Foix, as they are commonly called, and the cardinal of St Eustathius,
   since they are in nearer localities, it limits the above-mentioned
   interval to two months.

   Further the holy synod orders all lord patriarchs, archbishops, bishops
   and other prelates of churches, and clerics, notaries and
   ecclesiastical personages, as also other faithful of Christ, of every
   status, dignity, grade and condition, and it requires and requests all
   princes and lords, even if they possess imperial, regal, ducal or any
   other authority, who shall have been requested regarding the above,
   that in virtue of holy obedience, under threat of the divine judgment
   and under pain of excommunication, they should report, intimate and
   notify all and each of the aforesaid things to the said most holy lord
   pope and to the most reverend lord cardinals, and should have them
   reported, intimated and notified to these people in person, if they
   have safe and convenient access to them. Where personal access is not
   possible, this is to be done by affixing notices drawn up by a public
   notary, if this can be done safely, to their residences and also on the
   door of the apostolic palace and on the churches of St John Lateran, St
   Peter's and St Mary Maggiore; or failing that, on the chief churches of
   the cities of Sutri Viterbo and Siena, or three other neighbouring
   cities, as it shall seem better. This holy synod decrees that these
   places are suitable for the execution of all the aforementioned.

   Yet this holy synod, desiring to meeting future eventualities and to
   avoid all waste of time, since delay in these matters is fraught with
   danger, ordains and decrees that a decree of admonition and citation of
   this kind, after it has been read out in this solemn session and
   published, shall be affixed to the doors of the cathedral church of
   Basel so that, should it happen that its intimation cannot be effected
   in any of the ways outlined above, in that case, as by a public edict,
   for four months to be calculated from this day, the publication,
   monition and citation shall be considered as performed in respect of
   all its effects, so that all its effects are obtained and it binds
   those to whom it is directed as if it had been insinuated and presented
   in person, the above peremptory force and threats being considered here
   as inserted.

   Further, this holy council declares and insists that, despite the
   aforesaid delays, since a legal summons has already been issued by the
   decrees of the council of Constance, and since the urgency of the
   situation suggests the following, as does also the nature of what is to
   be accomplished in the continuation of the council and of the things to
   be done in it, it means to proceed in an orderly, due and mature
   manner, and for that reason not to be remiss in any way in the process.
   Lastly, this holy synod decrees citations for all prelates and others
   who are obliged to come to a general council, and each and all generals
   of orders and also inquisitors of heresy, with the delay of a fixed
   term or terms as it shall seem good to the deputies, with penalties and
   censures and suitable conditions.


   Session 4 - 20 June 1432

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church. By this decree we indicate
   to all that to each and every priest, baron, noble, soldier and citizen
   and every other man of whatever status, condition or rank from the
   kingdom of Bohemia and the marquisate of Moravia, from Prague and the
   cities and other places of the same, and to all other ecclesiastical
   and secular persons who, male or female, will be sent with them to the
   general council of Basel and are about to set out, to all these persons
   under whatever name they are listed or can be called, within however
   the number of two hundred persons, by the force of this present decree
   we grant and give our fullest and perfect safe-conduct and we bestow a
   most genuine security for their coming to this city of Basel and their
   abiding, staying and resting here, and for their treating with us on
   affairs suitably committed to them and their arranging, concluding and
   ending them. We allow them to perform the divine offices in their
   lodgings without any obstacle on our part; so that also, on account of
   their presence, neither on their journey nor in any other place of
   their journey, in coming, remaining or returning, nor in the city
   itself of Basel, will cessation from divine offices be imposed in any
   way in the form of an interdict.

   Further, they will be allowed freely to propose and explain in the
   general council or synod of Basel, by word of mouth or in writing, the
   four articles on whose clarity they insist; to prove, support and
   recommend them with quotations from the sacred scriptures and the
   blessed doctors and, if need be, to reply to the objections of the
   general synod or to argue about them with one or several from the
   council or to discuss them in a charitable way without any impediment;
   with reproach, abuse and taunt being totally excluded, observing the
   form and the ways specified and mutually agreed between our envoys and
   the messengers of the aforesaid kingdom and marquisate in the city of
   Eger; and specifically that in the case of the four articles proposed
   by them, the divine law, the apostolic practice of Christ and of the
   primitive church, and the councils and doctors truly founding
   themselves on the same, will be accepted in the council of Basel as the
   most true and impartial judge. Whether these discussions are or are not
   brought to a conclusion, whenever by the order or permission of their
   superiors they, or any one of them, shall choose to return home, then
   straightaway, without any refusal, condition or delay, they may return
   freely and safely at their pleasure, with their goods, honour and
   persons intact, but with the knowledge of the deputies of the council
   so that suitable provision may be made, without guile or fraud, for
   their safety.

   Moreover, in this safe-conduct of theirs we wish all clauses to be
   included and contained, and to be held as included, which are necessary
   and opportune for full, efficacious and sufficient safety in coming,
   staying and returning; we express these things clearly in order to
   secure and keep the good of peace. If any one or several of them,
   whether coming on their journey to us in Basel or while staying here or
   on their return, shall commit (may it not be so) some heinous crime by
   which the benefit of security conceded to them could be annulled and
   quashed, we wish, admit and concede that those arrested in a deed of
   such sort shall straightaway be punished only by their own people, not
   by others, by an adequate censure and a sufficient penalty to be
   approved and praised by us, with the form, conditions and ways of their
   security remaining completely unimpaired. Similarly if any of ours,
   whether on their way to us in Basel or while staying here or returning,
   shall commit (may it not be so) some heinous crime through which the
   benefit of the security conceded to them could be annulled or quashed,
   we wish that those arrested in a crime of this sort shall straightaway
   be punished only by us and our people, not by others, by an adequate
   censure and a sufficient penalty to be approved and praised by the lord
   ambassadors and envoys, with the present form, conditions and ways of
   the security remaining completely unimpaired.

   We wish also that it be allowed to each and every ambassador as often
   as it is opportune or necessary, to leave the city of Basel in order to
   take the air and to return to it, and freely to send and despatch their
   messengers to any place for the arrangement of necessary affairs and to
   receive a messenger or messengers as often as it suits them, in such a
   way that they are accompanied by the deputies of the council who will
   provide for their safety. Further, neither in discussions, public
   sermons or other conferences can or may our side, in prejudice,
   derogation or depreciation of the case of the four articles, employ or
   procure in the locality of the city of Basel any terms that tend to
   disorder. These safe-conducts and assurances are to remain in force
   from the moment when, and for as long as, they are received into the
   care of our protection, to be brought to Basel, and in all the period
   of their staying here: and again on the conclusion of a sufficient
   hearing, an interval of twenty days having been set in advance, when
   they shall request it, or after the hearing the council shall decide,
   we shall, with God's help and without any guile or fraud, let them
   return from Basel to Tuschkau, Tachov or Engelsberg, to whichever of
   these places they prefer to go.

   Also for all of Christ's faithful, especially for the most holy lord
   the Roman pontiff, the most serene prince the lord Sigismund, king of
   the Romans etc. , the venerable lord cardinals, archbishops and bishops
   and lord abbots, prelates and clerics as well as for the most
   illustrious princes, kings, dukes, marquises, counts, barons and noble
   soldiers, universities, and communities of cities, castles and towns,
   and their councillors, magistrates, officials and others of whatever
   condition and status, whether ecclesiastical or secular, under whatever
   name they go, and for the subjects of all the aforesaid and every part
   of them, we promise in good faith and guarantee that all of us and
   every one of the aforesaid persons will observe and guard the
   prescribed security and the form of their safe-conduct in all its
   conditions, points and clauses elaborated above, inviolably and
   unbroken in good faith and with pure heart. Further, we promise that we
   neither wish nor ought on any alleged occasion, covertly or overtly, to
   employ any authority, power, law, statute or privilege of laws or
   canons or of any councils whatever, especially of Constance and Siena,
   in whatever form of words they may be expressed, to any prejudice of
   the safe-conduct or assurance and the public hearing which we have
   granted to them. But if we or anyone of us, of whatever condition or
   status or pre-eminence, shall violate in any detail or clause the form
   and way of the above assurance and safe-conduct (which, however, may
   the Almighty deign to avert), and a suitable penalty shall not have
   followed straightaway, to be fittingly approved and praised by their
   judgment, let them hold us, as indeed they can, to have incurred all
   penalties which by divine and human law or by custom violators of such
   safe-conducts incur, without any excuse or any challenge from this side
   .

   [If the apostolic see becomes vacant while the council is in progress,
   the election may not be held outside the council]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, bears in mind that it
   pertains to the duty of providence to foresee the future with
   clear-sighted consideration and to take wholesome steps against what
   could bring harm to the common good. The synod is intent upon the
   extirpation of heresies, peace among the people of Christ and the
   reformation of morals, with the grace of the holy Spirit, as is really
   necessary in view of the present situation. It has summoned the
   venerable fathers in Christ, the cardinals of the holy Roman church, to
   this sacred council, convinced that their presence at it is fruitful in
   many ways in view of their authority, wisdom and knowledge of affairs.
   If, then, as obedient sons they are coming to the council when the
   apostolic see falls vacant elsewhere, such a situation would redound to
   the benefit of the church but the obedient cardinals would be serving
   the council to their own disadvantage, whereas everyone knows that
   obedience should bring with it not disadvantage but an increase of
   benefit and honour. Lest disobedience may seem to be to the advantage
   of some who fail to come, this holy synod, with purposeful anticipation
   and for the above and other reasons which can and should motivate a
   prudent mind establishes, decrees and defines that, in the event of a
   vacancy of the apostolic see while this sacred council is in progress,
   the election of the supreme pontiff shall be held in the place of this
   sacred council, and it forbids it to be held elsewhere. The synod also
   decrees that any attempt against this by any authority whatsoever, be
   it even papal, notwithstanding any constitutions issued or to be issued
   or anything else acting to the contrary, even if there should be
   special mention in so many words or a confirmation on oath, which the
   synod rejects with full knowledge, is null and void and of no force or
   importance by law; and that those who attempt such things shall be
   disqualified in both active and passive voice with respect to the
   election of a Roman pontiff and for every other dignity, and deprived
   perpetually of all dignities which they hold, and shall automatically
   incur the mark of infamy as well as sentence of excommunication. If any
   such pretended election should be attempted, then both the one
   allegedly elected and his supporters as well as those who treat him as
   elected incur in the same way the above-mentioned penalties. The said
   synod reserves to itself, except at the moment of death, absolution of
   everyone who in any way shall incur the said sentences or any one of
   them. It declares that the present decree shall bind and come into
   force after forty days following its publication.


   Session 5 - 9 August 1432

   [In this session there were approved rules about the organization of
   the council: On cases and the procurator of the faith; Judges are
   deputed for the general examination of cases; That members of the
   council may not be brought to trial outside the place of this council;

   Session 6 - 6 September 1432

   [This session was devoted to reading: Petition of the promoters of the
   council against the pope and the cardinals. ]


   Session 7 - 6 November 1432

   [Interval for a papal election]

   The most holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the
   holy Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting
   record. Earlier this holy synod issued a decree about the election of a
   Roman pontiff if a vacancy of the apostolic see occurs during this
   sacred council. It is entitled, It pertains to the duty of providence .
   . . , and is to be found in full in the fourth session. However, a
   doubt about that decree has occurred to some, namely that the interval
   of ten days which the constitution of the council of Lyons fixed for
   the cardinals of the holy Roman church to enter the conclave, might
   elapse and be too restricted at least by the time that notification of
   the vacancy reaches this council. For, the interval would seems to be
   too rigid and too short for many of the cardinals who may be away in
   localities distant from this council. Moreover this holy synod wishes
   to eliminate all grounds for doubt and to provide carefully for what is
   conducive to the peace and unity of God's holy church, and with all
   modesty and due maturity to proceed with what is known in this matter,
   as in all things to promote the exaltation of the catholic faith and
   the general reformation and peace of the Christian people, for which
   the council is legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit. It therefore
   decrees that in the case of a vacancy of the apostolic see in the
   lifetime of this present council, nothing shall be done for the
   election of a Roman pontiff before the expiry of sixty days from the
   day of the vacancy.


   Session 8 - 18 December 1432

   [Decree that there ought to be only one council]

   The most holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the
   holy Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting
   record. Just as there is only one holy catholic church, as Christ her
   spouse says, My dove, my perfect one, is only one, and as an article of
   the faith declares, since unity does not tolerate division, so there
   can be only one general council representing the holy catholic church.
   Since, therefore, by decrees of the sacred general councils of
   Constance and of Siena and by the approval of two Roman pontiffs,
   namely Martin V and Eugenius IV of happy memory, a general council was
   instituted and established in this city of Basel and assembled
   legitimately in the holy Spirit, it is clear that during this council
   another general council cannot exist elsewhere. Whoever therefore,
   during the lifetime of this sacred council shall presume to raise and
   hold another assembly with the title of a general council, is convicted
   of raising and holding a conventicle of schismatics and not a council
   of the catholic church. Therefore this holy council warns and exhorts
   all Christ's faithful, of whatever status or rank they may be, even if
   papal, imperial or regal, under the adjuration of the divine judgment
   which holy scripture relates in the case of Korah, Dathan and Abiram,
   authors of schism, and it strictly commands and forbids them in virtue
   of holy obedience and under the penalties laid down by the law, not to
   hold or summon, during this sacred council, another assembly with the
   title of a general council, which in reality would not be a council,
   nor to go to or to take part in or in any way to have recourse to it as
   if it were a general council, even under the pretext of any promise or
   oath, nor to hold or esteem it to be or even to call it a general
   council, even if it claims to have been summoned or shall try in the
   future to be summoned. If any ecclesiastical person, even a cardinal of
   the holy Roman church, or anyone else of whatever status, rank or
   condition he may be, shall dare to go to or stay in Bologna or any
   place with a pretended general council, during this present council, he
   shall automatically incur sentence of excommunication and deprivation
   of all benefices, dignities and offices and disqualification from them;
   and the dignities, offices and benefices of such persons may be freely
   disposed of by those to whom this pertains by law.

   Session 9 - 22 January 1433

   [This session was entirely taken up with the solemn reception of the
   emperor Sigismund. ]


   Session 10 - 19 February 1433

   [This session was almost entirely taken up with reading: Accusation of
   contumacy of the pope. ]


   Session 11 - 27 April 1433

   [For the permanent validity of the authority of general councils]

   The holy general council of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   Since the frequent holding of general councils, as a principal means of
   cultivating the Lord's field affects the universal church, every effort
   should be made that all obstacles that could impede so holy an
   institution are removed with great care. Hence this holy synod, obeying
   the decree of the council of Constance beginning The frequent, and
   anxious that no scandals such as unhappily have occurred in our day
   should spring up again in the future, to the detriment of the church,
   establishes and decrees that the Roman pontiff, who ought to be the
   first in working in the Lord's vineyard and in drawing others to work
   by his example, should take part in general councils in person or by a
   legate or legates a latere who is or are to be chosen in consultation
   with and with the consent - which is not to be just by word of mouth -
   of two-thirds of the cardinals. Also, all ecclesiastical persons who by
   law or custom ought to attend general councils are bound henceforward
   to come in person without further summons to general councils, both by
   force of the constitution The frequent and by the authority of this
   sacred council of Basel or of some other future council legitimately
   assembled, unless they are prevented by a legitimate impediment, in
   which case they are bound to send suitable persons with a sufficient
   mandate. If the Roman pontiff or other above-mentioned persons fail to
   do this, or in any way take means to impede change, prorogue or
   dissolve the council, and shall not have repented with real
   satisfaction within four months, thereafter the pope will be
   automatically suspended from the papal administration and the other
   persons from the administration of their dignities; the papal
   administration will devolve by law upon the sacred council. If they
   persist with hardened hearts under the aforesaid penalties for a
   further two months after the said four months, then the general council
   shall proceed against both the Roman pontiff and the above-mentioned
   persons up to and including the penalty of deprivation.

   [That everybody is free to come to the council]

   This holy synod decrees that, notwithstanding any prohibition, even
   from the Roman pontiff, there is freedom for absolutely all persons, of
   whatsoever status or condition they may be, even if they are cardinals
   of the Roman church, to go to general councils; and that the Roman
   pontiff is bound to grant permission to those who wish to go to general
   councils, especially to the aforesaid cardinals, if they request it.

   [The council explains the phrase about prorogation of the council, and
   annuls attempts to the contrary, including future attempts]

   This holy synod also declares that those words "it may never be
   prorogued", contained in the said decree, are to be understood so
   prohibitively that it cannot be prorogued even by a pope, and that a
   council actually assembled cannot be dissolved or moved from place to
   place by a Roman pontiff without the express consent of the council
   itself, and it quashes, voids and annuls anything that may be attempted
   in the future against this or even in disparagement or obstruction of
   this general council or of the persons, prelates and supporters of it,
   by deprivation, translation and ecclesiastical censures or in any other
   way.

   [That the council may not be dissolved or moved without the express
   consent of two-thirds of each deputation, etc. ]

   For certain reasonable causes it decrees that the present council of
   Basel cannot be dissolved or moved from place to place by anybody, even
   by the pope, unless there is obtained the express consent of two-thirds
   of each deputation, after a scrutiny of the votes of individual
   members, and then the approval of two-thirds of the general
   congregation, after a similar scrutiny of the votes of individual
   members, and finally a declaration is to be made in a public session.
   It prays through the tender mercy of Jesus Christ, and by the
   sprinkling of his precious blood it adjures all members of this sacred
   council, both present and future, that in no way they give their
   consent to a dissolution or allow a change of place, except for just
   and manifest reasons, before the reform in head and members has been
   completed, in so far as this can reasonably be achieved.

   [That the place of the council should be chosen a month before the
   dissolution, and the phrase "in ten years" is clarified]

   In accordance with the ordinance of the council of Constance, it wishes
   that the place of the future council should be chosen at least a month
   before the date of the dissolution. It also declares, as a precaution,
   that the phrase "in ten years" which is used in the said constitution
   should be understood in this way, namely that the ten years should be
   completely finished, and when it is fully completed the authorization
   to hold a general council begins. If it happens for any reason that
   those who are obliged to attend general councils do not come at the
   beginning, it declares that the said authorization to hold the council
   does not thereby cease, but that it should be held as soon as it
   conveniently can. But so that it cannot be deferred for a long time,
   this council decrees that for twenty days before the end of the said
   ten years, or of some other interval if perhaps this should reasonably
   be determined by the council, the Roman pontiff in person or through
   his legate or legates, and the archbishop in whose province or diocese
   the council is to be held and all the prelates who are within four
   days' journey of the place of the forthcoming council, provided there
   is no canonical impediment, in person or, if that cannot be, through
   suitable men constituted as proxies for this purpose, are obliged to
   present themselves so as to negotiate about the disposition of the
   place and other preliminaries of the council. On the day appointed for
   the opening of the council, those present shall celebrate a solemn mass
   of the holy Spirit, and the council shall be considered constituted and
   begun from that day. However, on account of the many necessities that
   can occur for those coming to a council, this holy synod exhorts those
   who shall be present not to bring difficult questions to a conclusion
   until after a reasonable wait for those absent and a fitting interval
   of time, rather, with divine fear as a guide, let everything proceed
   with due gravity, as the great mass of business of the universal church
   demands and requires. In those cases in which, according to the decree
   of Constance, the pope may, with the consent of the cardinals of the
   holy Roman church, change the place of a future council, it determines
   that, should the pope fail to do this, the college of cardinals may
   supply for the defect, on condition however that two-thirds of the
   cardinals agree, keeping, , nevertheless to the procedure contained in
   the said decree The frequent. The said cardinals shall swear by God and
   their consciences that they are making the change of place, if indeed
   they decide this, for the clear reasons that are mentioned in the
   decree The frequent.

   [That the electors of a pope before entering the conclave shall swear
   that, if one of them is elected, he will observe the said decrees]

   So that the aforesaid may be put into execution the more easily, the
   holy synod determines that the electors of a Roman pontiff are bound,
   before entering the conclave, to swear to God and to promise the church
   that, should one of them be chosen as pope, he will observe the above
   decrees, statutes and ordinances, and to the best of his ability will
   endeavour to fulfil them really and effectively adding that whoever in
   future years shall be chosen as Roman pontiff must swear, among the
   other things which he must profess according to the decree of the
   council of Constance beginning Since the Roman pontiff, effective
   observance of the present decree. Later, in his first public
   consistory, he is bound to make again the same profession and let him
   also profess that, if he violates what is contained in this decree or
   commits a notorious crime which scandalizes the church, he will subject
   himself to the judgment of a general council. Both he and the college
   of cardinals shall insert this profession in the letters which they
   customarily send throughout the world on the accession of a new pope.

   [That this decree should be published in synods]

   So that nobody may plead ignorance of this wholesome and necessary
   decree, the holy synod orders, in virtue of holy obedience, all
   metropolitan bishops to have this decree read and published in
   provincial and synodal councils, and superiors of religious to have it
   read and published in their general chapters. 2
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Session 12 - 13 July 1433

   [Decree on elections and confirmations of bishops and prelates]

   Just as in building a house the architect's chief concern is to lay
   such a foundation that the edifice built on it will endure immovable,
   so in the general reformation of the church the principal preoccupation
   of this holy synod is that the pastors set over the church may be such
   that, like pillars and bases, they will firmly uphold the church by the
   strength of their doctrine and merits. The office enjoined on prelates
   manifestly shows how great care should be taken in their election, for
   they are appointed for the government of souls for which our lord Jesus
   Christ died and shed his precious blood. Therefore the sacred canons
   promulgated under the Spirit of God, providentially established that
   each church and college or convent should elect a prelate for itself.
   Adhering to these prescriptions this holy synod, assembled in the same
   Spirit, establishes and defines that a general reservation of all
   metropolitan, cathedral, collegiate and monastic churches and elective
   dignities ought not to be made or used by the Roman pontiff in the
   future, always with the exception of reservations contained in the body
   of law and those which may arise in territories mediately or
   immediately subject to the Roman church by reason of direct or
   beneficial dominion. Rather, provision should duly be made for the
   aforesaid metropolitan, cathedral, monastic and collegiate churches and
   elective dignities, when they are vacant, by canonical elections and
   confirmations in conformity with the dispositions of the common law,
   without thereby derogating from statutes, privileges and reasonably
   customs, all postulations in the disposition of the common law
   remaining intact. This holy synod also decrees that it will be in
   conformity with reason and beneficial for the common good that the
   Roman pontiff should attempt nothing contrary to this salutary decree,
   except for an important, reasonable and manifest cause, which is to be
   specified expressly in an apostolic letter. So that this salutary
   decree may be more strictly adhered to, the same holy synod wishes
   that, among other things that the Roman pontiff shall profess on
   assuming office, he shall swear to observe inviolably this decree.

   Since prelates should be such as is described above, those with the
   right of electing them should be very careful that they make a worthy
   election in the presence of God and of the people, and let them be most
   solicitous to elect such persons as can fill so great an office. Let
   them remember that if they act in so important an affair either
   fraudulently or carelessly or without regard for the fear of God, they
   will be the authors and cause of evil pastors and will therefore share
   in the penalties which the evil pastors themselves will suffer in the
   severe judgment of God. Since the endeavour of human fragility can
   effect nothing without the help of almighty God, from whom every good
   endowment and every perfect gift comes down, those in whose hands lies
   the election of a pontiff or an abbot shall meet in church on the day
   of the election in order to hear with great devotion a mass of the holy
   Spirit, whom they will humbly petition to deign to inspire them to
   elect a worthy pastor. The more devoutly they approach the act of
   election, the more readily they will merit that grace, so let them
   confess and reverently receive the sacrament of the eucharist. When
   they have entered the place of the election of any prelate who is to be
   chosen through election, they shall swear in the hands of the president
   of the chapter, and the president in the hands of his immediate
   subordinate, in these words: I, N. , swear and promise to almighty God
   and to such and such a saint (according to the dedication of the
   church) to elect the person who I believe will be the more useful to
   the church in spiritual and temporal things, and not to give a vote to
   anyone who I think is procuring the election for himself by the promise
   or gift of some temporal thing, or by making a request in person or
   through another, or in any other way directly or indirectly. He who
   appoints a procurator to elect a certain person shall take the same
   oath and shall confess and communicate; so also shall a procurator with
   a general mandate for election in matters in which by common law he can
   be appointed a procurator in the business of such an election. The oath
   shall be taken also by those who may have made an agreement about the
   election of a future prelate, and they too are obliged to confess and
   to communicate. If they do not do so, for that occasion they shall be
   deprived by law of the power of electing. Thereupon let them elect to
   the said prelacy a man of lawful age, of serious character and adequate
   education, already in sacred orders and suitable in other respects in
   accordance with canonical regulations.

   If the election is made in another way and of a different kind of
   person than the above or by the wickedness of simony, the election
   shall be invalid and null by law. Those electing simoniacally shall be
   automatically subject to perpetual deprivation of the right of
   electing, besides other penalties. Others shall be subject to canonical
   penalties. Those elected simoniacally and those who take part in such a
   simoniacal election, as well as the electors and those confirmed shall
   automatically incur the penalty of excommunication in horror of so
   great a crime. Moreover, those so elected and confirmed cannot be
   absolved from such guilt and excommunication unless they freely resign
   the churches and dignities which they had disgracefully obtained, and
   they are rendered perpetually disqualified from acquiring them again.
   In order to remove every root of ambition this holy synod implores
   through the tender mercy of Jesus Christ and most earnestly exhorts
   kings and princes, communities and others of whatever rank or dignity,
   ecclesiastical or secular, not to write letters to electors or to
   provide petitions for someone who will get such petitions or letters
   for himself or for another, and much less to resort to threats or
   pressure or anything else whereby the process of election would be
   rendered less free. Similarly, in virtue of holy obedience, it is
   enjoined on electors not to elect anyone on the strength of such
   letters, petitions, threats or pressure.

   When the election has been completed and presented to the person who
   has the right of confirmation, if a co-elected person or an objector to
   the election shows himself, he should be summoned by name to discuss
   the matter of the disputed election. Usually a public announcement
   should be made in the church in which the election was held, in
   accordance with the constitution of Boniface VIII of happy memory.
   Whether or not a co-elected person or an objector appears, the
   confirmer should proceed in virtue of his office, as is done in the
   business of the inquisition, using diligence in the due examination and
   discussion of the form of the election, of the merits of the one
   elected and of all the circumstances. The confirmation or the annulment
   of the election should be done in a judicial manner. So that the whole
   process may be clean and without blemish or even a suspicion of it, the
   confirmer should altogether refrain, personally as well as through
   others, from presuming to demand anything at all or even to receive
   free offerings in return for the confirmation or under the pretext of
   homage, subvention, gratitude or any other excuse of supposed custom or
   privilege. For notaries and scribes in such cases, let a moderate fee
   be levied which is proportionate to the work of writing and not to the
   value of the prelacy. If the said confirmers shall confirm elections in
   contravention of the above regulations or in respect of unsuitable
   persons or involving simony, such confirmations are automatically null.
   This is to be the case for the occasion, for those who confirm persons
   other than as stated above: but for the stain of simony, if they have
   incurred it, they automatically incur sentence of excommunication, from
   which they cannot be absolved except by the Roman pontiff', except at
   the point of death.

   This holy synod exhorts the supreme pontiff, since he should be the
   mirror and standard of all sanctity and purity, not to demand or accept
   anything at all for confirming elections referred to him. Otherwise, if
   he scandalizes the church by notorious and repeated contraventions, he
   will be delated to a future council. However, for the burdens which he
   must carry for the government of the universal church, and for the
   sustenance of the cardinals of the holy Roman church and of other
   necessary officials, this holy council will make due and suitable
   provision before its dissolution. If it does not make any provision in
   this way, then those churches and benefices which hitherto paid a
   certain tax on the entry into office of a new prelate, shall be obliged
   thenceforward to pay in parts half of this tax for the year after their
   peaceful possession; this provision shall continue until the sustenance
   of the said pope and cardinals is otherwise provided for. By these
   ordinances the same synod does not intend any prejudice to the holy
   Roman and universal church or to any other church.


   Session 13 - 11 September 1433

   [In this session there was read out, Accusation of contumacy of the
   pope made by the promoters of the sacred council; the time-limit
   already intimated to Eugenius IV for him to come to Basel and to
   abrogate his decree dissolving the council was deferred; finally a new
   Decree for the protection of members was approved. ]


   Session 14 - 7 November 1433

   [In this session there was made, Another deferral, for ninety days, of
   the monition to the pope, to which were added two proposals, one
   regarding the revoking of the suspension of the council. the other
   regarding Eugenius IV's assent to the council. ]


   Session 15 - 26 November 1433

   [On provincial and synodal councils]

   The holy general council of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   Already this holy synod has promulgated a most salutary decree on the
   stability and authority of general councils, the frequent holding of
   which is a principal means of cultivating the Lord's field. Indeed,
   since there is no doubt that episcopal synods and provincial councils
   form part of this same cultivation, inasmuch as the ancient canons
   decreed that they should be frequent, so this holy synod, desiring that
   ancient and praiseworthy customs should be observed in our age,
   establishes and commands that an episcopal synod should be held yearly
   in every diocese after the octave of Easter, or on another day
   according to diocesan custom, at least once a year where custom does
   not prescribe two, by the diocesan in person unless he is prevented by
   a canonical impediment, in which case by a vicar who is fitted for the
   task. This synod should last at least two or three days, or as the
   bishops deem to be necessary.

   On the first day, when the diocesan and all those who are obliged to be
   present at the synod have assembled, during or after the celebration of
   mass, the diocesan or another in his name shall expound the word of
   God, exhorting all to strive after good behaviour and refrain from
   vice, and to strive after what pertains to ecclesiastical discipline
   and each one's duties, and especially that those who have the care of
   souls should instruct the people subject to them in doctrine and with
   salutary exhortations on Sundays and feast-days. Then there should be
   read out the provincial and synodal statutes and, among other things, a
   comprehensive treatise on how the sacraments should be administered and
   other useful points for the instruction of priests. Then the diocesan
   himself should diligently inquire into the life and morals of his
   subjects and check with suitable correction the evil of simony,
   usurious contracts, concubinage, fornication and all other faults and
   excesses. He should revoke alienations of ecclesiastical property
   forbidden by law, and he should correct and reform abuses of clerics
   and other subjects who have failed in respect of the divine office and
   the wearing of proper dress. Since many scandals often arise because
   Pope Boniface VIII's constitution Periculoso on the enclosure of nuns
   is not observed, the diocesan should insist that this enclosure be
   strictly observed in accordance with that constitution; also that all
   religious subject to the diocesan should inviolably observe the rules
   and constitutions of their orders, especially that all ownership is
   renounced by them. Also let nothing be demanded simoniacally at their
   reception into a religious order. A chief care of the bishop at the
   synod should be to make inquiry and to apply proper remedies lest any
   teaching that is heretical, erroneous, scandalous or offensive to pious
   ears, or fortune-telling, divinations incantations, superstitions or
   any diabolic inventions, infiltrate into his diocese. Let there be
   appointed synodal witnesses, who should be serious, prudent and honest
   men, filled with zeal for God's law, in a number proportionate to the
   area of the diocese, or others with their powers if none are appointed
   for this, who may be removed by the diocesan if they seem to him to be
   unsuitable and he may appoint others (as he thinks fit). They shall be
   obliged to take an oath in the hands of the diocesan himself or of his
   vicar, as is stated in the canon Episcopus in synodo; they shall travel
   round the diocese for a year and shall refer what they have seen to be
   in need of correction and reform to those whose duty it is to correct
   and reform. If these matters are not corrected and reformed, they shall
   refer them to a subsequent synod, when proper remedies should be
   applied. Besides what the diocesan hears from the synodal witnesses or
   others exercising their office, he should himself inquire assiduously
   about the faults of his subjects and so confront the guilty with the
   discipline of needed correction that it may serve as an example to
   others inclined to do evil.

   Also, in every province within two years of the end of a general
   council, and thereafter at least once in every three years, a
   provincial council should be held in a safe place. It should be
   attended by both the archbishop and all his suffragans and others who
   are obliged to take part in such provincial councils, after a due
   summons has been issued to them. If a bishop is prevented by a
   canonical impediment, he should designate his procurator, not only to
   excuse and justify his absence, but also to participate in the council
   in his name and to report back what the council decides. Otherwise the
   bishop is automatically suspended from receiving half the fruits of his
   church for one year: these should be effectively diverted to the fabric
   of his church by someone deputed in the council itself. Others who fail
   to attend are to be punished at the decision of the council and other
   penalties of the law are to remain in force. Provincial councils are
   not to be held while a general council is sitting and for six months
   beforehand. At the beginning of a provincial council the metropolitan
   or someone in his name during the celebration of mass or afterwards,
   shall deliver an exhortation calling to mind the things that pertain to
   the ecclesiastical state and especially the episcopal office and
   warning all the participants that, as the prophet says, if any soul is
   lost by their fault his blood will be required by the Lord at their
   hands. In particular, there should be a strict warning that orders and
   benefices should be conferred, without any simony, on worthy and
   deserving persons whose lives are sufficiently well known. Above all,
   the greatest care and mature inquiry should be used when entrusting the
   care of souls. Ecclesiastical property on no account should be used for
   illegal purposes, but for the glory of God and the conservation of
   churches and, following the holy canons, with a primary concern for the
   poor and needy, mindful that at the tribunal of the eternal judge they
   will have to give an account of all of it to the very last farthing. In
   these councils there should be, according to the regulations of the
   law, a careful investigation into the correction of faults, the reform
   of the morals of subjects and especially the conduct of bishops in
   conferring benefices, confirming elections, administering orders,
   deputing confessors, preaching to the people, punishing the faults of
   their subjects and observing episcopal synods, and in any other points
   respecting the episcopal office and the jurisdiction and administration
   of bishops in spiritual and temporal matters, especially whether they
   keep their hands clean of the stain of simony, in order that all those
   who are found to have transgressed in the aforesaid matters may be
   corrected and punished by the council. A similar careful inquiry should
   be instituted about the metropolitan himself in all these respects, and
   the council should explain clearly to him his faults and defects,
   admonishing and imploring him that since he is called and ought to be
   the father of others, he should altogether desist from such failings.
   Even so, the council should send straightaway to the Roman pontiff, or
   to another of his superiors if he has one, a written account of the
   investigation made about him, so that he may receive punishment and
   fitting reform from the Roman pontiff or other superior. Besides, if
   there are discords, quarrels and feuds among some which could disturb
   the peace and tranquillity of the province, the holy council should
   strive to pacify them and seek watchfully, as would a dutiful father,
   for peace and agreement among its sons. If discords of this sort arise
   between kingdoms, provinces and principalities, the holy bishops of God
   should straightaway arrange the simultaneous convocation of provincial
   councils and, in combining their respective counsel and help, strive to
   banish whatever promotes discord; they should not cease from this out
   of love or hatred for anyone, but raising the eyes of their minds to
   God alone and the salvation of their people and putting aside all
   half-heartedness, they should be intent on the sacred work of peace.

   Moreover, in a provincial synod that immediately precedes a forthcoming
   general council, thought should be given to all that is likely to be
   dealt with in that general council, to the glory of God and the good of
   the province and the salvation of the Christian people. Let a suitable
   number of people be elected at it to go in the name of the whole
   province to the next general council; let them be provided for by a
   grant or in some other way, according to the law and the judgment of
   the provincial council; in such a way, however, that those wishing to
   go to the council or their clergy, in addition to those deputed as
   above, shall in no way be disadvantaged thereby. Also, let there be
   read out in each provincial council those things which the canonical
   regulations order to be read out in them, so that they may be observed
   inviolably and transgressors may be duly punished. If metropolitans and
   diocesans fail to celebrate provincial and episcopal synods at the
   aforesaid time, after the cessation of any legal impediment, they shall
   lose half of all fruits and revenues accruing to them by reason of
   their churches, and these shall be applied immediately to the fabric of
   their churches. If they persist in such neglect for three consecutive
   months, they shall automatically be suspended from their offices and
   benefices. After these intervals of time have elapsed, with the
   aforesaid penalties, the senior bishop in the province of the
   metropolitan, or the person in orders who is highest in dignity below a
   bishop, unless by custom or privilege it pertains to another, is
   obliged to supply for this failure to hold the said provincial and
   episcopal synods. Moreover, this holy synod bids all superiors of
   religious communities and orders of all kinds, who are responsible for
   holding chapters, to hold them at the appointed times, under the
   aforesaid penalties, and to see that they are held; and let them aim in
   them, in accordance with canonical sanctions and the constitutions of
   the orders, at a true reform of the individual communities and orders,
   so that thereafter regular observance may duly flourish in all
   monasteries in accordance with their rules and constitutions, and in
   particular that the three fundamental vows of profession may be
   strictly observed. By the aforesaid, however, the holy synod does not
   mean to derogate in any way from anyone's rights.

   Session 16 - 5 February 1434

   [This session declares the adherence of Pope Eugenius to the council,
   with the usual ceremonies; Eugenius's bull Dudum sacrum, and three
   other bulls abrogated by that bull, are incorporated into the acts. ]


   Session 17 - 26 April 1434

   [On the admission of the presidents into the council in the name of the
   lord pope Eugenius IV]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, admits the beloved sons of
   the church Nicholas, priest of the title of holy Cross in Jerusalem,
   and Julian, deacon of St Angelo, cardinals of the holy Roman church,
   the venerable John, archbishop of Taranto, and Peter, bishop of Padua,
   and the beloved son of the church Louis, abbot of St Justina of Padua,
   as presidents in this sacred council in the name, stead and place of
   the most holy lord pope Eugenius IV, to have the fullest authority and
   effect throughout, but only on the following conditions: they are to be
   without any coercive jurisdiction, and the way of proceeding hitherto
   observed in this council is to remain unchanged, especially what is
   contained in the ordinances of this sacred council beginning, First,
   there shall be four deputations, as there are, among which all from the
   council shall be distributed equally as far as is possible, etc. It
   also ordains that apart from on a Friday, which is the ordinary day for
   a general congregation, another general congregation cannot be called
   unless at least three of the deputations agree to this beforehand. And
   then the presidents should be informed, or one of them, so that they
   may announce the programme. If they do not, one of the promoters of the
   council or someone from the deputations shall announce the programme.
   All from the council shall come to the congregation. On the other
   occasions, if the three deputations do not agree, nobody shall come to
   that congregation; and whatever is done there shall be null and void.
   The same with regard to a session. When what has been agreed upon by
   the deputations has been read out in the general congregation, the
   first of the presidents there present, even if another or others of
   them are absent, shall conclude the matter in accordance with the
   ordinances of the sacred council. If he or another of the presidents
   then presiding refuses to do this, the next prelate in the order of
   seating shall conclude the matter. If he is unwilling, let another in
   succession do it. If it happens that none of the presidents comes to a
   congregation or a session of the general council, then the first
   prelate, as indicated above, shall fulfil the office of president for
   that day. Also, all the acts of this sacred council shall be made and
   despatched under the name and seal of this council, as has been done
   until now.


   Session 18 - 26 June 1434

   [On the renewal of the decree of the council of Constance about the
   authority and power of general councils]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   It is well known that it redounds to the great benefit of the catholic
   church that its authority, which was earlier declared in the sacred
   council of Constance and to which all are obliged to submit, should be
   manifested frequently and the attention of all should be drawn to it.
   Just as councils of the past were accustomed to renew the salutary
   institutions and declarations of previous synods, so this holy synod
   too renews that necessary declaration on the authority of general
   councils, which was promulgated in the said council of Constance in the
   words that follow: First it declares . . . and Next it declares ,


   Session 19 - 7 September 1434

   [On the agreement between the council and the Greeks about union]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit representing the universal church, for an everlasting record. As
   a dutiful mother is ever anxious about the health of her children and
   is uneasy until any dissension among them has been quietened, so and to
   a much greater extent holy mother church, which regenerates its
   children to eternal life, is wont to strive with every effort that all
   who go by the name of Christian may put aside all quarrelling and may
   guard in fraternal charity the unity of the faith, without which there
   can be no salvation. It has therefore been a primary care of this holy
   synod from the beginning of its meeting to put an end to the recent
   discord of the Bohemians and the ancient discord of the Greeks, and to
   bind them to us in the same permanent bond of faith and charity. We
   invited in all charity to this sacred council, through our letters and
   envoys, first the Bohemians, since they are nearer, and then the
   Greeks, so that the holy union might be achieved. Although many from
   the beginning thought that the Bohemian affair was not only difficult
   but almost impossible and judged our labours to be a waste of time and
   useless, nevertheless our lord Jesus Christ, to whom nothing is
   impossible, has so safely directed the business until now that the
   invitation to the Bohemians has been of much greater benefit to holy
   church than the many powerful armies which frequently invaded their
   country.

   This fills us with greater hope to pursue the union with the Greeks
   with all confidence and perseverance. We approach this task the more
   willingly because we perceive the Greeks to be very inclined to this
   union. For as soon as the most serene emperor of the Greeks and the
   patriarch of Constantinople were approached by our envoys, straightaway
   they appointed to this holy synod three outstanding men from those who
   seem to be of great authority among them - the first of whom was indeed
   a blood-relative of the emperor - with a sufficient commission from the
   emperor himself signed by his own hand and with a golden seal, and
   furnished with letters of the patriarch. Both in a general congregation
   and in the presence of our commissaries they expressed the most fervent
   desire of the emperor, the patriarch and the whole eastern church for
   this union. They urge and daily stimulate us in a wonderful way to
   pursue this holy work, strongly and persistently affirming two things:
   that union is only possible in a universal synod in which both the
   western church and the eastern church meet, and that union will
   assuredly follow if matters proceed in that synod in the way that is
   agreed below. We were filled with joy and gladness when we heard this.
   For what happier and more glorious thing could ever happen to the
   catholic church than that so many eastern peoples, who seem to be about
   equal in number to those of our faith, should be joined with us in the
   unity of faith ? What could be more useful and fruitful to the
   Christian people, since the beginning of the church, than for an
   inveterate and destructive schism to be completely eradicated ?
   Moreover, we trust that with God's help another benefit will accrue to
   the Christian commonwealth; because from this union, once it is
   established, there is hope that very many from the abominable sect of
   Mahomet will be converted to the catholic faith. What, then, should not
   be attempted and done by Christ's faithful for so holy and salutary an
   objective? What Catholic is not in duty bound to risk not only the
   passing substance of this world but even his body and soul for such an
   advance of the Christian name and the orthodox faith? Wherefore, we
   venerable cardinals of the holy Roman church, presidents of the
   apostolic see, casting all our thought on God, who alone does great
   wonders, deputed the patriarch of Antioch and a suitable number of
   archbishops, bishops, abbots, masters and doctors to treat of this
   question with the ambassadors of the Greeks and to look for a way to
   reach a solution. After these men had frequently met and discussed
   among themselves and with the envoys, they reached the conclusions
   given below. These conclusions, in accordance with the custom of this
   council, were seriously debated by the deputations and ratified by a
   general congregation. Their contents, together with the chrysobull of
   the lord emperor, are as follows.

   [Agreement of the deputies of the sacred council with the ambassadors
   of the Greeks]

   The ambassadors of the most serene lord emperor of the Greeks and of
   the lord patriarch of Constantinople, namely the lord Demetrius
   protonostiarius Palaeologus Metotides, the venerable Isidore abbot of
   the monastery of St Demetrius, and the lord John Dissipatus of the
   household of the same emperor, meeting together with the lord deputies
   of the sacred council, first declared that if the western church would
   agree that this synod should be held in Constantinople, the eastern
   church would meet there at its own expense and there would be no need
   for the western church to pay any expenses to eastern prelates. Indeed,
   the lord emperor himself would, within his limits, provide for Latin
   prelates on their way to Constantinople. But if it was preferred that
   the prelates of the eastern church should come to Latin territories for
   the said synod, then for legitimate reasons the western church would
   have to meet the expenses of the eastern church. Since the said lord
   deputies for many reasons believed that this union would be more
   conveniently arranged in the city of Basel, where in fact the council
   was sitting, they frequently and urgently pressed the lord envoys that
   this place should be chosen for the holy union and offered to pay the
   necessary expenses for this. The envoys replied that since the
   instructions given to them by the emperor and the patriarch contained
   limitations on certain places, they would not choose the city of Basel
   because it was not mentioned in the instructions. The deputies of the
   sacred council, aware of the holy and perfect intention of the council
   not to spare any labour and expenditure for the honour of God and the
   advance of the catholic faith, judged it inexpedient to miss so great a
   good merely on a question of place. So they agreed, subject to the
   council's consent, to one of the places named below with the condition,
   which is detailed later, that one or more persons should be sent to the
   lord emperor, the patriarch and others to persuade them by cogent
   reasons to agree to the city of Basel. The nominated places are these:
   Calabria, Ancona or another maritime territory; Bologna, Milan or
   another Italian city; and outside Italy, Buda in Hungary, Vienna in
   Austria or in the last place, Savoy.

   The lord deputies agreed with the lord ambassadors in what follows,
   subject to the council's consent. First, the ambassadors promised that
   the emperor of the Greeks, the patriarch of Constantinople, the other
   three patriarchs and the archbishops, bishops and other ecclesiastics
   who can conveniently come, will come to the synod. Likewise,
   representatives will come from all the kingdoms and territories subject
   to the churches of the Greeks, with full power and authority which
   shall be confirmed by oath and suitable documents by both the secular
   authorities and the prelates. Also, the sacred council shall send one
   or more ambassadors with eight thousand ducats for the holding of a
   congregation of the prelates of the eastern church in Constantinople.
   The eight thousand ducats will be paid out by the ambassadors of the
   sacred council, as it shall seem good to the lord emperor or to the
   ambassadors themselves; but in such a way that, if the said prelates
   refuse to come to Constantinople or, having come to Constantinople,
   refuse to go to the synod, then the emperor shall be bound to restore
   to the said ambassadors whatever they may have expended on this matter.

   Also, that the western church shall pay the expenses of four large
   galleys, of which two shall be from Constantinople and two from
   elsewhere, to convey to our port at the appropriate time the emperor,
   the patriarchs and the prelates of the eastern church with their
   suites, to the number of seven hundred persons, and to return them to
   Constantinople. The western church shall pay the expenses for this in
   the following way. For the expenses of the emperor and of seven hundred
   persons from Constantinople to our last port, it will give the emperor
   fifteen thousand ducats. From the said last port to the place of the
   said council, and thereafter as long as they remain at the synod and
   until their return to Constantinople, it will give to the emperor with
   the said seven hundred persons fair expenses. Also that within the ten
   months after next November, the sacred council shall be obliged to send
   two large galleys and two lighter ones to Constantinople with three
   hundred crossbowmen. On these galleys shall travel the ambassadors of
   the sacred council and the lord Demetrius protonostiarius Palaeologus,
   chief of the lord emperor's ambassadors. These ambassadors of the
   sacred council will have with them fifteen thousand ducats to be given
   to the lord emperor for the expenses that he and the patriarchs,
   prelates and others who are coming, to the number of seven hundred
   persons, shall incur between Constantinople and the last port at which
   they shall put in, as mentioned above. Also, the said ambassadors of
   the sacred council who are to travel on the galleys will arrange that
   ten thousand ducats are at hand to be expended, if necessary, on the
   defence of the city of Constantinople against any danger that the Turks
   might cause the city during the lord emperor's absence; this money will
   be expended by someone deputed by the said ambassadors of the sacred
   council in proportion to the necessity. Also, the said ambassadors of
   the sacred council will pay the cost of two light galleys and three
   hundred crossbowmen for the defence of the city of Constantinople in
   the lord emperor's absence, and shall ensure that the crews of the said
   galleys and the crossbowmen take an oath in the hands of the emperor
   that they will serve him faithfully. Their captains shall be appointed
   by the emperor. Also, that the said ambassadors shall have for the
   expenses of the two large galleys what is usually expended in arming
   such galleys.

   Also, the ambassadors of the sacred council who are to go with the said
   galleys to Constantinople, shall name to the lord emperor the port at
   which they should finally land and the place, from among those listed
   above, where the said universal synod shall be held. They will,
   however, strive with all their might that the city of Basel be chosen,
   as is to be hoped. Also, this sacred council of Basel will remain
   meanwhile at Basel, and shall not be dissolved as long as there is no
   legitimate impediment; but if a legitimate impediment arises, which may
   God avert, it may transfer itself for its continuation to another city,
   in accordance with the decree The frequent . If the lord emperor is not
   satisfied with this place, then within one month after he has landed at
   the said last port, the sacred council will transfer itself to one of
   the said places nominated by the same council, as was said above.

   Also that, in any event, all the above shall be fulfilled by both
   parties; and all the above shall be effected in a really stable way and
   with the greatest force and security that is possible for the sacred
   council, namely by a decree and under a seal. Also, when all the
   aforesaid matters have been concluded and agreed and, as was said,
   fully confirmed, the supreme pontiff should give his express consent by
   his patent bulls. Everything above is to be understood in good faith,
   without fraud or deceit and without legitimate or manifest impediment.
   If all the clauses are fulfilled, the said ambassadors of the Greeks
   shall state and promise that assuredly the above persons will come even
   if there should be war and threats to their city, and in confirmation
   of all this they will deliver to the sacred council a chrysobull of the
   said emperor, and on behalf of the said emperor they and the others
   shall take an oath, in writing and signed, in pledge of their firm and
   true belief that the universal holy synod ought to take place with
   God's help, unless there intervenes the death of the emperor or some
   obvious and real obstacle that cannot be escaped or avoided.

   Lastly, the ambassadors of the Greeks were requested to explain the
   meaning of some terms contained in their instructions. First, what they
   understand by "universal synod". They replied that the pope and the
   patriarchs ought to be present at the synod either in person or through
   their procurators; similarly other prelates ought to be present either
   in person or through representatives; and they promised, as is stated
   above, that the lord emperor of the Greeks and the patriarch of
   Constantinople will participate in person. "Free and inviolate", that
   is each may freely declare his judgment without any obstacle or
   violence. "Without contention", that is without quarrelsome and
   ill-tempered contention; but debates and discussions which are
   necessary, peaceful, honest and charitable are not excluded. "Apostolic
   and canonical", to explain how these words and the way of proceeding in
   the synod are to be understood, they refer themselves to what the
   universal synod itself shall declare and arrange. Also that the emperor
   of the Greeks and their church shall have due honour, that is to say,
   what it had when the present schism began, always saving the rights,
   honours, privileges and dignities of the supreme pontiff and the Roman
   church and the emperor of the Romans. If any doubt arises, let it be
   referred to the decision of the said universal council. There follows
   the text of the chrysobull of the said emperor translated from Greek
   into Latin, Whereas there were sent . . . 1; and the letter of the lord
   patriarch of Constantinople with a leaden seal translated from Greek
   into Latin, which is as follows, Joseph by the grace of God archbishop
   of Constantinople . . . we receive the letter of your reverence . . . 2

   By the authority of the universal church, therefore, this holy synod by
   this present decree approves, ratifies, confirms, determines and
   decrees the above clauses and agreements, and it promises to observe
   each and all of them and to keep them intact, as is said above. As they
   lead to an increase of the orthodox faith and the benefit of the
   catholic church and the whole Christian people, they should be most
   welcome and acceptable to all who love the faith of Christ. Since, as
   has been said above, the Greeks for a variety of reasons request that
   the most holy lord pope Eugenius IV should expressly consent to these
   clauses and agreements, lest on this account so great a good should be
   let slip, this holy synod implores and begs Eugenius in all charity,
   and through the tender mercy of Jesus Christ it requests and demands
   with all possible insistence, that he expresses his assent, for the
   benefit of the faith and of ecclesiastical unity, to the aforesaid
   clauses and agreements, which have already been approved and ratified
   by a synodal decree, by his bulls in the customary style of the Roman
   curia.

   [Decree on Jews and neophytes]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   This holy synod following in the footsteps of our saviour Jesus Christ,
   desires in deepest charity that all may acknowledge the truth of the
   gospel and thereafter abide in it faithfully. By these salutary
   instructions it desires to provide measures whereby Jews and other
   infidels may be converted to the orthodox faith and converts may remain
   steadfastly in it. It therefore decrees that all diocesan bishops
   should depute persons well trained in scripture, several times a year,
   in the places where Jews and other infidels live, to preach and expound
   the truth of the catholic faith in such a way that the infidels who
   hear it can recognise their errors. They should compel infidels of both
   sexes who have reached the age of discretion, to attend these sermons
   under pain both of being excluded from business dealings with the
   faithful and of other apposite penalties. But the bishops and the
   preachers should behave towards them with such charity as to gain them
   for Christ not only by the manifestation of the truth but also by other
   kindnesses. The synod decrees that Christians of whatever rank or
   status who in any way impede the attendance of Jews at these sermons,
   or who forbid it, automatically incur the stigma of being supporters of
   unbelief.

   Since this preaching will be more fruitful in proportion to the
   linguistic skill of the preachers, we decree that there must be
   faithful observance of the constitution of the council of Vienne, which
   ordered the provision in certain universities of teachers of the
   Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Chaldean languages. So that this may be more
   adhered to, we wish that the rectors of these universities should add
   to what they swear to on taking office, that they will endeavour to
   observe the said constitution. It should be clearly laid down, at the
   councils of the provinces in which these universities are situated,
   that the teachers of the said languages are to be adequately
   recompensed.

   Furthermore, renewing the sacred canons, we command both diocesan
   bishops and secular powers to prohibit in every way Jews and other
   infidels from having Christians, male or female, in their households
   and service, or as nurses of their children; and Christians from
   joining with them in festivities, marriages, banquets or baths, or in
   much conversation, and from taking them as doctors or agents of
   marriages or officially appointed mediators of other contracts. They
   should not be given other public offices, or admitted to any academic
   degrees, or allowed to have on lease lands or other ecclesiastical
   rents. They are to be forbidden to buy ecclesiastical books, chalices,
   crosses and other ornaments of churches under pain of the loss of the
   object, or to accept them in pledge under pain of the loss of the money
   that they lent. They are to be compelled, under severe penalties, to
   wear some garment whereby they can be clearly distinguished from
   Christians. In order to prevent too much intercourse, they should be
   made to dwell in areas, in the cities and towns, which are apart from
   the dwellings of Christians and as far distant as possible from
   churches. On Sundays and other solemn festivals they should not dare to
   have their shops open or to work in public.

   [About those who desire conversion to the faith]

   If any of them wishes to be converted to the catholic faith, all his
   goods, both movable and immovable, shall remain intact and unharmed in
   his possession. But if his goods were acquired by usury or illicit
   dealings, and the persons to whom restitution ought to be made are
   known, it is absolutely necessary that this restitution be made, since
   the sin is not forgiven unless the illegal object is restored. However,
   if these persons are no longer an issue because the church has turned
   the goods to pious uses, this holy synod, acting for the universal
   church, grants in favour of the baptism received that the goods should
   remain with the church as a pious use, and it forbids both
   ecclesiastics and secular persons, under pain of divine anathema, to
   cause or allow to be caused any vexation on this count under any
   pretext whatsoever, but they should regard it as a great gain to have
   won such persons for Christ. Moreover since, as it is written, if
   anyone has this world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes
   his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him ?, this holy
   synod through the tender mercy of God exhorts all, both ecclesiastics
   and secular persons, to stretch out helping hands to such converts if
   they are poor or in need at the time of their conversion. Bishops
   should exhort Christians to aid these converts and should themselves
   support them from the income of churches, as far as they can, and from
   what passes through their hands for the benefit of the poor, and they
   should defend them with fatherly solicitude from detraction and
   invective.

   Since by the grace of baptism converts have been made fellow citizens
   with the saints and members of the household of God, and since
   regeneration in the spirit is of far greater worth than birth in the
   flesh, we determine by this edict that they should enjoy these
   privileges, liberties and immunities, of the cities and localities in
   which they are regenerated by holy baptism, which others obtain merely
   by reason of birth and origin. Let the priests who baptise them and
   those who receive them from the sacred font carefully instruct them,
   both before and after their baptism, in the articles of the faith and
   the precepts of the new law and the ceremonies of the catholic church.
   Both they and the bishops should strive that, at least for a long time,
   they do not mingle much with Jews or infidels lest, as occurs with
   convalescents from illness, a small occasion may make them fall back
   into their former perdition. Since experience shows that social
   communication between converts renders them weaker in our faith, and
   has been found to damage much their salvation, this holy synod exhorts
   local ordinaries to exercise care and zeal that they are married to
   born-Christians, in so far as this seems to promote an increase of the
   faith. Converts should be forbidden, under pain of severe penalties, to
   bury the dead according to the Jewish custom or to observe in any way
   the sabbath and other solemnities and rites of their old sect. Rather,
   they should frequent our churches and sermons, like other Catholics,
   and conform themselves in everything to Christian customs. Those who
   show contempt for the above should be delated to the diocesan bishops
   or inquisitors of heresy by their parish priests, or by others who are
   entrusted by law or ancient custom with inquiring into such matters, or
   by anyone else at all. Let them be so punished, with the aid of the
   secular arm if need be, as to give an example to others.

   There should be careful inquiry into all these things in provincial
   councils and synods, and an opportune remedy should be applied not only
   to negligent bishops and priests but also to converts and infidels who
   scorn the above. If anyone, of whatever rank or status, shall encourage
   or defend such converts against being compelled to observe the
   Christian rite or anything else mentioned above, he shall incur the
   penalties promulgated against abettors of heretics. If converts fail to
   correct themselves after a canonical warning, and as Judaizers are
   found to have returned to their vomit, let proceedings be taken against
   them as against perfidious heretics in conformity with the enactments
   of the sacred canons. If there have been granted to Jews or infidels,
   or perhaps shall be granted to them in the future, any indults or
   privileges by any ecclesiastics or secular persons, of whatever status
   or dignity, even papal or imperial, which tend in any way to the
   detriment of the catholic faith, the Christian name or anything
   mentioned above, this holy synod decrees them quashed and annulled; the
   apostolic and synodal decrees and constitutions enacted about the above
   remaining in force. In order that the memory of this holy constitution
   may be perpetually retained and that nobody may be able to claim
   ignorance of it, the holy synod orders that it should be promulgated at
   least once a year during divine service in all cathedral and college
   churches and other holy places where the faithful gather in large
   numbers.

   Session 20 - 22 January 1435

   [Decree on concubinaries]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit representing the universal church, for an everlasting record. We
   are inclined to grant requests for authentic statutes and decrees in
   proportion to the likelihood that they will be observed. For this
   reason we ordered to be extracted from our acts and recorded in this
   present document, at the request of the beloved sons of the church N.
   and N. , who assert that they need texts of this kind for judicial and
   extra-judicial purposes, the texts of the constitutions transcribed
   below, which we issued some time ago and promulgated in the cathedral
   church of Basel on 22 January 1435 and incorporated into our acts. They
   are as follows.

   Any cleric of whatsoever status, condition, religious order or dignity,
   even if it be episcopal or some other pre-eminence, who, after
   receiving notice of this constitution, as he may be presumed to have
   done, for two months after its publication in cathedral churches, which
   bishops are bound to arrange, after the constitution has come to his
   notice, still persists as a public concubinary, shall automatically be
   suspended for three months from the fruits of all his benefices. These
   fruits shall be consigned by his superior to the fabric or some other
   evident need of the churches from which the fruits come. His superior
   is bound to admonish him, as soon as he is aware that he is a public
   concubinary, to dismiss his concubine within a very short time. If he
   does not dismiss her, or having dismissed her takes her again or
   another woman, this holy synod orders his superior to deprive him of
   all his benefices. These public concubinaries moreover, shall be
   disqualified from receiving any goods, dignities, benefices or offices
   until such time as, after dismissing their concubines and an evident
   emendation of their lives, they shall have received a dispensation from
   their superiors. Those who receive a dispensation and then return to
   public concubinage, as to their vomit, shall be totally debarred from
   the above without any hope of another dispensation. If those who are
   responsible for correcting such people fail to punish them, as stated
   above, their superiors shall punish properly both them for their
   neglect and the others for their concubinage. Severe measures must be
   taken also in provincial and synodal councils against both those who
   neglect to punish and those who are reputed offenders, even by
   suspension from the conferment of benefices or some other adequate
   penalty. Those who are found by provincial councils or their superiors
   to deserve deprivation for public concubinage, but who can be deprived
   only by the supreme pontiff, should be referred immediately to the
   supreme pontiff together with the process of inquiry. The same
   diligence and inquiry should be employed by general and provincial
   chapters in respect of their subjects: and other penalties established
   against them and other non-public concubinaries are to remain in force.
   By "public" is meant not only someone whose concubinage is made
   notorious by a judicial sentence or a legal confession or by a
   notoriety that no subterfuge can conceal, but also anyone who keeps a
   woman suspected of incontinence and of ill repute and who, after being
   admonished by his superior, does not dismiss her.

   Because in some regions there are persons with ecclesiastical
   jurisdiction who are not ashamed to accept bribes from concubinaries
   for allowing them to wallow in their filth, this holy synod commands,
   under pain of eternal malediction, that henceforth they shall not
   tolerate or dissemble such conduct in any way by agreement, composition
   or promise; otherwise, in addition to the aforesaid penalty for
   negligence, they shall be strictly obliged and compelled to give to
   pious causes double what they have received in this way. Prelates
   should take every care to segregate from their subjects concubines and
   women of doubtful repute, even by recourse to the secular arm if need
   be, and they should not allow children born of such concubinage to live
   with their fathers. This holy synod also orders that this constitution
   is to be published in the aforesaid synods and chapters, and that stern
   warning should be given to subjects to dismiss their concubines. It
   also enjoins on all secular men, even if they are of royal rank, not to
   interpose any obstacle whatever under any excuse to prelates who
   proceed, in virtue of their office, against their subjects for
   concubinage. Moreover, since fornication of every kind is forbidden by
   divine law and is to be avoided under pain of mortal sin, this holy
   synod warns all lay people, both married and single, to abstain from
   concubinage. That man is most blameworthy who has a wife but goes to
   another woman. If a single man cannot abstain, let him marry, as the
   apostle advises. Let those responsible strive with all their strength,
   by salutary advice and canonical sanctions, for the observance of this
   divine precept.

   [Excommunicates are not to be shunned unless specifically named]

   To avoid scandals and many dangers and to relieve timorous consciences,
   this holy synod decrees that henceforth nobody shall be obliged to
   abstain from communion with anyone in the administration and reception
   of sacraments or in any other sacred or profane matters, or to shun
   someone or to observe an ecclesiastical interdict, on the ground of any
   ecclesiastical sentence, censure, suspension or prohibition that has
   been promulgated in general by a person or by the law, unless the
   sentence, prohibition, suspension or censure was specifically or
   expressly promulgated or pronounced by a judge against a specified
   person, college, university, church or place, or if it is clear that
   someone has incurred a sentence of excommunication with such notoriety
   that it cannot be concealed or in any way excused in law. For the synod
   wishes such persons to be avoided in accordance with canonical
   sanctions. By this, however, it does not intend any relief or favour to
   those so excommunicated, suspended, interdicted or prohibited.

   [Interdicts are not to be imposed lightly]

   Since an undiscriminating promulgation of interdicts has led to many
   scandals, this holy synod determines that no city, town, castle, vill
   or place may be laid under an ecclesiastical interdict except by reason
   or through the fault of the places themselves or of their lord,
   governors or officials. Such places cannot be laid under an interdict
   by any ordinary or delegated authority by reason or through the fault
   of any other private person, unless the person has been previously
   excommunicated and denounced, or publicly named in a church, and the
   lords or governors or officials of the places, though requested by the
   authority of a judge, have not effectively evicted the excommunicated
   person within two days or made him give satisfaction. If he is evicted
   after two days, or retires or gives satisfaction, divine services may
   be resumed straightaway. This applies also to dependencies of the
   place.

   So that lawsuits may be brought to a speedier end, a second appeal is
   hereby forbidden if it is a question of the same complaint or if the
   appeal is made from the same interlocutory sentence which does not have
   the force of a final judgment. Anyone who makes a frivolous or unjust
   appeal before the final judgment shall be condemned by the appeal judge
   to pay to the party appealed against the sum of fifteen gold florins of
   the treasury, in addition to the expenses, damages and interest.


   Session 21 - 9 June 1435

   [On annates]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   In the name of the holy Spirit the paraclete, this holy synod decrees
   that in future, both in the Roman curia and elsewhere, for the
   confirmation of elections, admission of postulations and provision of
   presentations and for collations, dispositions, elections,
   postulations, presentations, even if made by layfolk, institutions,
   installations and investitures, in respect of cathedral and
   metropolitan churches, monasteries, dignities, benefices and any
   ecclesiastical offices whatsoever, and for sacred orders, blessings and
   pallia, nothing whatsoever is to be exacted, either before or after,
   for sealing the bull of the letters, or for common annates, minor
   services, first fruits or dues, or under any other title or name, or on
   the pretext of any custom, privilege or statute, or for any other
   reason or occasion, directly or indirectly. Only the writers
   abbreviators and registrars of the letters or minutes shall receive a
   suitable salary for their work. If anyone dares to contravene this
   sacred canon by demanding, giving or promising anything, he shall incur
   the penalty inflicted on simoniacs and shall acquire no right or title
   to the dignities or benefices thus obtained. Obligations, promises,
   censures and mandates, and whatever is done to the prejudice of this
   most salutary decree, are to be deemed null and void. Even if, which
   God forbid, the Roman pontiff, who beyond all others should carry out
   and observe the canons of universal councils, should scandalize the
   church by acting contrary to this sanction, he should be delated to a
   general council. Others are to be punished by their own superiors with
   a fitting penalty, proportionate to their offence, in accordance with
   canonical sanctions.

   [About those in peaceful possession]

   Whoever has been in possession for the last three years, not through
   violence but with a specious title, peacefully and without a lawsuit,
   of a prelacy, dignity, benefice or office, or shall have possession of
   them in the future, cannot be disturbed afterwards in his claim or
   possession by anyone, even by reason of a newly enacted law, except in
   the case of warfare or some other legitimate impediment, which he must
   protest and intimate in accordance with the council of Vienne. A
   lawsuit in this case is to be understood as regards future
   controversies, if the proceedings have reached the execution of the
   citation, the exhibition of his right in the judgment and the
   observance of all the terms. Ordinaries, however, should make careful
   inquiry to see that nobody possesses a benefice without a title. If
   they find such a person, they shall declare that the right does not
   belong to him, and they shall give the right either to him, if they
   think fit, unless he is an intruded person or violent or undeserving in
   some other way, or to some other suitable person.

   [How the divine office is to be celebrated in church]

   A person who is about to make a request to a secular prince takes pains
   to compose himself and his words by decent dress, becoming gesture,
   regulated speech and close attention of mind. How much more careful
   ought he to be in all these things when he is about to pray to almighty
   God in a sacred place! The holy synod therefore decrees that in all
   cathedral and collegiate churches, at suitable times and at the sound
   of a bell, the divine praises shall be reverently celebrated by
   everyone through all the hours, not hurriedly but gravely and slowly
   and with reasonable pauses, especially in the middle of each verse of
   the psalms, and with a suitable distinction between solemn and ferial
   offices. Those who recite the canonical hours shall enter the church
   wearing an ankle-length gown and a clean surplice reaching below the
   middle of the shin-bone or a cloak, according to the different seasons
   and regions, and covering their heads not with a cowl but with an amice
   or a biretta. Having arrived in the choir, they shall behave with such
   gravity as the place and the duty demand, not gossiping or talking
   among themselves or with others, nor reading letters or other writings.
   They have gathered there to sing, so they should not keep their mouths
   shut rather all of them, especially those with more important
   functions, should sing to God eagerly in psalms, hymns and canticles.
   When "Glory be to the Father and, to the Son and to the holy Spirit" is
   being recited, all shall rise. Whenever mention is made of the glorious
   name of Jesus, at which every knee should bow in heaven, on earth and
   under the earth, they shall bow their heads. Nobody should read or say
   the office there privately during the public chanting of the hours in
   common, for not only does this take away due honour from the choir but
   also it distracts the singers. To ensure that these things and whatever
   else concerns the performance of the divine office and the discipline
   of the choir are duly observed, the dean, or the person whose duty it
   is, shall carefully keep watch, looking round, to see if there is
   anything not in order. Transgressors shall be punished with the penalty
   of that hour in which the offence was committed, or even more severely,
   as the gravity of the fault demands.

   [The times at which each one should be in choir]

   Whoever is not present at matins before the end of the psalm Come let
   us exult at the other hours before the end of the first psalm, and at
   mass before the last Lord have mercy, until the end, except in cases of
   necessity and then only with the permission of the president of the
   choir, is to be considered absent from that hour, saving however any
   stricter regulations of churches in this regard. The same is to be
   observed with regard to those who do not remain in processions from the
   start until the finish. To ensure observance of this, someone, who
   shall be under oath to act honestly and to spare none, should be
   deputed with the duty of noting individuals who are absent at the
   appointed times. This holy synod also orders that in churches in which
   stipends are not allotted for individual hours, a deduction should be
   made from the gross revenues of delinquents so that their emoluments
   are more or less proportionate to their labours, thus destroying the
   abuses whereby anybody present at only one hour gets a full day's
   stipend and presidents or deans or other officials, from the mere fact
   of being officials, receive the daily stipends even when absent for
   purposes other than those of their church.

   [How the canonical hours should be recited outside choir]

   This holy synod admonishes all holders of benefices, or those in holy
   orders, since they are bound to the canonical hours, if they wish their
   prayers to be acceptable to God, to recite the day and night offices,
   not in a mumble or between their teeth, nor swallowing or abbreviating
   their words, nor intermingling conversation and laughter, but, whether
   they are alone or with others, reverently and distinctly and in such a
   place as will not diminish devotion, for which they ought to dispose
   and prepare themselves, as the scripture says: Before prayer prepare
   your soul, and do not be like someone who tempts God.

   [About those who wander about the church during services]

   Any holder of a benefice in a church, especially of a major one, if he
   is seen wandering around inside or outside the church during the divine
   services, strolling or chatting with others, shall automatically
   forfeit his attendance not only for that hour but also for the whole
   day. If after being corrected once he does not stop, let him be
   deprived of his stipends for a month, or, if he is obstinate, let him
   be subjected to a heavier penalty so that in the end he is forced to
   desist. Also, noisy comings and goings in the church should not be
   allowed to impede or disturb the divine service. Regulars who err in
   these matters in conventual churches should be punished with a heavy
   penalty at the judgment of their superior.

   [About a notice-board hanging in the choir]

   So that everything may be well ordered in the house of God and that
   each person may know what he has to do, let there be affixed a
   notice-board permanently hanging in the choir, with information on it
   of the duties of each canon or other benefice-holder as regards reading
   or singing at the individual hours during the week or a longer time.
   Anyone who fails to do in person or by proxy what is prescribed there,
   shall forfeit for each hour the stipend of one day.

   [On those who at mass do not complete the creed, or sing songs, or say
   mass in too low a voice or without a server]

   There are abuses in some churches whereby the "I believe in one God",
   which is the symbol and profession of our faith, is not sung to the
   end, or the preface or the Lord's prayer is omitted, or secular songs
   are sung in the church, or masses (including private ones) are said
   without a server, or the secret prayers are said in so low a voice that
   they cannot be heard by the people nearby. These abuses are to stop and
   we decree that any transgressors shall be duly punished by their
   superiors.

   [About those who pledge divine worship]

   We abolish also that abuse, so manifestly incompatible with divine
   worship, whereby some canons of churches, having contracted debts, bind
   themselves to their creditors in such a way that, if they do not pay
   their debts by a fixed time there will be a cessation of divine
   services. We declare this obligation null even if it has been confirmed
   by oath. We decree that those who make these illicit agreements shall
   automatically lose for three months their revenues, which shall be
   applied to their church They shall receive no emoluments from their
   church until they resume the divine services.

   [On holding chapters at the same time as the principal mass]

   This holy synod forbids chapters and other meetings of canons to be
   held, or chapter business to be transacted, at the same time as the
   principal mass, especially on solemn feasts, unless an urgent and
   manifest necessity suddenly occurs. Whoever summons the chapter for
   that time shall be suspended from receiving his daily stipends for a
   week, and the canons shall forego their stipends for that hour.

   [On not performing spectacles in churches]

   In some churches, during certain celebrations of the year, there are
   carried on various scandalous practices. Some people with mitre,
   crozier and pontifical vestments give blessings after the manner of
   bishops. Others are robed like kings and dukes; in some regions this is
   called the feast of fools or innocents, or of children. Some put on
   masked and theatrical comedies, others organize dances for men and
   women, attracting people to amusement and buffoonery. Others prepare
   meals and banquets there. This holy synod detests these abuses. It
   forbids ordinaries as well as deans and rectors of churches, under pain
   of being deprived of all ecclesiastical revenues for three months, to
   allow these and similar frivolities, or even markets and fairs, in
   churches, which ought to be houses of prayer, or even in cemeteries.
   They are to punish transgressors by ecclesiastical censures and other
   remedies of the law. The holy synod decrees that all customs, statutes
   and privileges which do not accord with these decrees, unless they add
   greater penalties, are null.


   Session 22 - 15 October 1435

   [On the condemnation of the book of friar Augustine of Rome, archbishop
   of Nazareth]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   The main reason, among other pious aims, why this holy synod assembled
   was to preserve the truth of the catholic faith and to eradicate errors
   and heresies. Therefore the chief goal of our activity is, as soon as
   we learn of the spread of something that can harm the purity of the
   Christian faith or in any way obscures the brilliance of the light in
   the minds of the faithful, to eradicate it completely and carefully to
   clear the Lord's field of noxious weeds and brambles. This holy synod
   therefore condemns and censures a certain book by master Augustine,
   commonly called "of Rome", archbishop of Nazareth. Its first treatise
   is entitled, "On the sacrament of the unity of Jesus Christ and the
   church, or on the whole Christ"; the second, "On Christ the head and
   his glorious sovereignty", another, "On the charity of Christ towards
   the elect and his infinite love". The holy synod condemns and censures
   the book as containing teaching that is unsound and erroneous in the
   faith, as well as its defenders.

   The holy synod especially condemns and censures, in the book, the
   assertion which is scandalous, erroneous in the faith and offensive to
   the ears of the pious faithful, namely: Christ sins daily and has
   sinned daily from his very beginning, even though he avers that he does
   not understand this as of Christ our saviour, head of the church, but
   as referring to his members, which together with Christ the head form
   the one Christ, as he asserts. Also, the propositions, and ones similar
   to them, which the synod declares are contained in the articles
   condemned at the sacred council of Constance, namely the following. Not
   all the justified faithful are members of Christ, but only the elect,
   who finally will reign with Christ for ever. The members of Christ,
   from whom the church is constituted, are taken according to the
   ineffable foreknowledge of God; and the church is constituted only from
   those who are called according to his purpose of election. To be a
   member of Christ, it is not enough to be united with him in the bond of
   charity, some other union is needed. Also the following. The human
   nature in Christ is really Christ. The human nature in Christ is the
   person of Christ. The intimate cause that determines the human nature
   in Christ is not really distinguished from the nature that is
   determined. The human nature in Christ is without doubt the person of
   the Word; and the Word in Christ, once the nature has been assumed, is
   really the person who assumes. The human nature assumed by the Word in
   a personal union is truly God, natural and proper. Christ according to
   his created will loves the human nature united to the person of the
   Word as much as he loves the divine nature. Just as two persons in God
   are equally lovable, so the two natures in Christ, the human and the
   divine, are equally lovable on account of the common person. The soul
   of Christ sees God as clearly and intensely as God sees himself.

   These propositions and others springing from the same root, which are
   to be found in the said book, this holy synod condemns and censures as
   erroneous in the faith. Lest it come to pass that any of the faithful
   fall into error on account of such teaching, the synod strictly forbids
   anyone to teach, preach, defend or approve the teaching of the said
   book, especially the aforesaid condemned and censured propositions, and
   its supporting treatises. It decrees that transgressors shall be
   punished as heretics and with other canonical penalties. By these
   measures the synod intends to detract in nothing from the sayings and
   writings of the holy doctors who discourse on these matters. On the
   contrary, it accepts and embraces them according to their true
   understanding as commonly expounded and declared by these doctors and
   other catholic teachers in the theological schools. Nor does the synod
   intend by this judgment to prejudice the person of the said author
   since, though duly summoned, he gave reasons for being absent, and in
   some of his writings and elsewhere he has submitted his teaching to the
   church's judgment. Further, this holy synod orders all archbishops,
   bishops, chancellors of universities and inquisitors of heresy, who are
   responsible in this matter, to ensure that nobody has the said book and
   supporting treatises or presumes to keep them with him, rather he shall
   consign them to these authorities, so that they may deal with them in
   accordance with the law: otherwise let such persons be proceeded
   against with canonical censures.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   Session 23 - 26 March 1436

   [On the election of the supreme pontiff]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   Since a good shepherd is the salvation of his flock, it is the duty of
   this sacred synod to strive, with all the diligence that human law can
   contrive, that the Roman pontiff, who is first in the Lord's flock and
   the supreme shepherd, should be and continue to be such as to provide
   for the salvation of all souls and the benefit of the whole Christian
   world and to fulfil worthily so great an office. Therefore it renews
   the constitutions about the election of Roman pontiffs which sacred
   councils and supreme pontiffs have issued and it adds to them some
   further salutary norms. It decrees that whenever the apostolic see
   falls vacant, all the cardinals of the holy Roman church who are
   present in the place where the election of the supreme pontiff is to be
   held, shall meet together on the tenth day after the see becomes vacant
   in some chapel or place near the conclave. From there they shall
   process behind a cross, two by two, devoutly singing the Veni creator
   Spiritus, and enter the place of the conclave, each taking with him not
   more than two necessary attendants. In view of the ceremonies, two
   clerics may also be admitted, at least one of whom shall be a notary.
   The chamberlain together with the deputies for the custody of the
   conclave shall ensure that nobody, apart from the aforesaid persons,
   enters the conclave. After the cardinals have entered and the doors
   have been closed, the chamberlain shall enter with the deputies and
   carefully examine the cells of all the cardinals. He shall remove any
   food and edibles found there, except medicines of the sick and infirm.
   He shall ensure a careful guard whenever he leaves and closes the door,
   and each day he shall closely inspect the food being brought in for the
   cardinals and allow only what seems necessary for moderate refreshment,
   without prejudice to the decrees passed in the fourth and seventh
   sessions of this sacred council.

   On the next day all the cardinals, in the presence of all those in the
   conclave, shall hear a mass of the holy Spirit and receive the
   eucharist. Before the voting begins, they shall swear before the holy
   gospels in these words: I, N. , cardinal of . . . , swear and promise
   to almighty God, Father, Son and holy Spirit, and to blessed Peter,
   prince of the apostles, that I shall elect as pontiff the person who I
   think will be beneficial to the universal church in both spiritual and
   temporal matters and suitable for so great a dignity; I shall not give
   my vote to anyone who I have reason to think is directly or indirectly
   aiming at getting himself elected, by his promising or giving some
   temporal thing or by asking in person or through another or in any
   other way whatsoever; and I shall not make obeisance to anyone elected
   as pontiff before he takes the oath prescribed by this council of
   Basel; so help me God, to whom on the day of tremendous judgment I
   shall have to give an account of this oath and all my deeds After this
   each cardinal shall submit a ballot-card, on which he shall nominate a
   maximum of three persons. If he nominates more than one person, the
   second and third persons shall be from outside the college of
   cardinals. There shall not be more than one ballot on any day and it
   shall be held immediately after the mass. When the ballot-cards have
   been read, they shall be burnt straightaway unless two-thirds of the
   votes are for the same person. No approach shall be made to anyone
   until six ballots have been completed. During this time let the
   cardinals reflect and seriously ponder how much merit or loss to
   themselves, how much fruit or damage to the Christian people, how much
   good or evil, they will be causing by their choice of a pontiff. There
   is nothing, indeed, by which they can more merit the grace or the wrath
   of our lord Jesus Christ than when they are setting his vicar over his
   sheep, which he loved so much as to suffer the torments of the cross
   and to die for them.

   [On the profession of the supreme pontiff]

   The holy synod decrees that the person elected as pope is obliged to
   express his consent to the election in the manner stated below. It is
   fitting that this consent should be made to the cardinals, if the
   person elected is present in the curia, or to one of the cardinals or
   someone mandated by them if he is not present there, in the presence of
   a notary and at least ten persons. After he has been informed of the
   election, he is bound to act within a day of the demand. If he does not
   do so, his election is annulled and the cardinals must proceed in the
   Lord's name to another election. But if he expresses his consent, as
   stated above, the cardinals shall straightaway make due obeisance to
   him as supreme pontiff. Once the obeisance has been made by the
   cardinals, nobody has any right to challenge his pontificate.

   [Form of consent]

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son and holy
   Spirit. I, N. , elected pope, with both heart and mouth confess and
   profess to almighty God, whose church I undertake with his assistance
   to govern, and to blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, that as long
   as I am in this fragile life I will firmly believe and hold the
   catholic faith, according to the tradition of the apostles, of general
   councils and of other holy fathers, especially of the eight holy
   universal councils - namely the first at Nicaea, the second at
   Constantinople, the third which was the first at Ephesus, the fourth at
   Chalcedon, the fifth and sixth at Constantinople, the seventh at Nicaea
   and the eighth at Constantinople - as well as of the general councils
   at the Lateran, Lyons, Vienne, Constance and Basel, and to preserve
   intact this faith unchanged to the last dot, and to defend and preach
   it to the point of death and the shedding of my blood, and likewise to
   follow and observe in every way the rite handed down of the
   ecclesiastical sacraments of the church. I promise also to labour
   faithfully for the defence of the catholic faith, the extirpation of
   heresies and errors, the reform of morals and the peace of the
   Christian people. I swear also to continue with the holding of general
   councils and the confirmation of elections in accordance with the
   decrees of the holy council of Basel. I have signed this profession
   with my own hand; I offer it on the altar with a sincere mind to you
   almighty God, to whom on the day of tremendous judgment I shall have to
   give an account of this and all my deeds; and I will repeat it at the
   first public consistory.

   'So that this salutary institution may not fade from the supreme
   pontiff's memory with the passage of time, every year on the
   anniversary of his election or of his coronation, the first cardinal
   present shall, during mass, publicly and in a loud voice address the
   supreme pontiff thus: Most holy father, may your holiness heed and
   carefully ponder the promise which you made to God on the day of your
   election. He shall then read out the promise and shall continue as
   follows: May your holiness, therefore, for the honour of God, for the
   salvation of your soul and for the good of the universal church, strive
   to observe to your utmost all these things in good faith and without
   guile or fraud. Recall whose place it is that you hold on earth, namely
   of him who laid down his life for his sheep, who thrice asked the
   blessed Peter if he loved him, before he entrusted his sheep to him',
   and who, as the just judge whom nothing secret escapes, will exact from
   you an account of everything to the very last farthing. Remember what
   blessed Peter and his successors as pontiffs did: they thought only of
   the honour of God, the spread of the faith, the public good of the
   church and the salvation and benefit of the faithful; finally,
   imitating their master and Lord they did not hesitate to lay down their
   lives for the sheep entrusted to them. Do not lay up for yourself or
   your kinsfolk treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where
   thieves and robbers break in, but lay up for yourself treasure in
   heaven. Do not be an acceptor of persons or of blood-ties or of
   homeland or of nation. All people are children of God and have been
   equally entrusted to your care and safe-keeping. Say after the example
   of Christ: Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven, he is my
   brother and sister and mother. In distributing dignities and benefices
   put before yourself neither the flesh nor gifts nor anything temporal
   at all, but solely God and the virtues and merits of people. Exercise
   ecclesiastical discipline in correcting faults, mindful of what grace
   Phinehas merited and what punishment Eli, the one for avenging injuries
   to God, the other for pretending not to know them. Defend, help and
   support the poor and needy. Show a fatherly charity to all.

   After the solemnities of his coronation, and each year after the
   anniversary of his election, the supreme pontiff shall carefully
   discuss with his brethren, for at least eight consecutive days, how he
   shall carry out his solemn promises to God. In the first place,
   therefore, he should examine where in the world the Christian religion
   is being persecuted by Turks, Saracens, Tartars and other infidels;
   where heresy or schism or any form of superstition flourishes, in which
   provinces there has been a decline in morals and observance of the
   divine precepts and in the right way of living, in both ecclesiastical
   and secular matters, where ecclesiastical liberty is infringed; among
   which kings, princes and peoples enmity, wars and fears of war are
   rife; and like a dutiful father he should strive with his brethren
   carefully to provide remedies.

   When these affairs of an universal character have been settled, let him
   deal with those nearer at hand. Let him begin by reforming and ordering
   in an exemplary way his house, his household and the Roman curia, where
   and in so far as this is necessary, so that from the visible reform of
   the church which is the head of all others, lesser churches may draw
   purity of morals and no occasion may be given for calumny and malicious
   talk. Making diligent inquiry in person and through others about both
   important and lesser persons, he should allow no delay or pretence in
   correcting whatever is found in need of reform, remembering that the
   sin is twofold, the one being committed, the other and far more serious
   being its consequences. For whatever is done there is easily made into
   an example. That is why, if the head is sick, disease enters into the
   rest of the body. The papal household and court should be a kind of
   clear mirror, so that all who look at it form themselves and live
   according to its example. Thereafter let him banish and eradicate any
   traces of simony, filthy concubinage or whatever may offend God or
   scandalize people. He should take care that officials do not exercise
   their offices badly or oppress anybody or extort anything by threats or
   illegal means, and that those in charge of the officials do not let
   their excesses go unpunished. They should not tolerate clothes and
   colours which are forbidden by the sacred canons. Let him instruct the
   Roman clergy, who are chiefly and immediately subject to him, in all
   ecclesiastical decorum, admonishing them that God's approval depends
   not on the parade and splendour of clothes but on humility, docility,
   purity of mind, simplicity of heart, holiness of behaviour and the
   other virtues which commend their possessor to God and to people. Let
   him enact reforms especially so that the divine services may be
   observed in the churches of Rome with all seemly devotion and
   discipline. He should also instruct the people of Rome, which is his
   own parish, and direct them in the way of salvation. He should bid the
   cardinals to visit and reform their titular churches and parishes as
   befits their office. He should appoint some prelate of great learning
   and of proven and exemplary life as his vicar in the city, to take his
   place in the episcopal care of the clergy and people, and he should
   often inquire about whether he is fulfilling his task.

   Next, let him reflect carefully with the same brethren on the good and
   wholesome administration of the temporalities of the Roman church and
   let him ensure that the provinces, cities, towns, castles and lands
   subject to the Roman church are justly and peacefully ruled with such
   moderation that the difference between government by ecclesiastics and
   by secular princes is like that between a father and a master. He
   should not aim at gain, but cherishing all with paternal charity he
   should esteem them not as subjects but as sons and daughters. Since he
   has charge of their spiritual and temporal well-being, he must watch to
   get rid of all factions and seditious groups - especially of Guelphs
   and Ghibellines and other similar parties - which breed destruction to
   both souls and bodies. He must strive, employing spiritual and temporal
   penalties of all possible kinds, to remove all causes of dissension and
   to keep people united for the defence of the church. To govern the
   provinces and chief cities, he should appoint cardinals or prelates of
   untarnished reputation who will seek not financial gain but justice and
   peace for their subjects. Their legation shall last for two, or at most
   three, years. When their legation has ended, since it is right that
   each one should give an account of his stewardship, one or more
   outstanding men shall be appointed to review their administration and
   to hear the complaints and petitions of the inhabitants and to render
   justice; these shall refer what they cannot easily effect to the pope,
   and he shall strive to find out what the former have done and to punish
   any illegal actions, so that their successors may learn from their
   example to avoid illegalities. Officials should be allotted a suitable
   salary on which they can live honestly, to prevent them turning their
   hand to what is illicit.

   The supreme pontiff should often inquire how his legates, governors and
   commissars, as well as deputies and feudatories of the Roman church,
   rule their subjects and whether they oppress them with new taxes and
   exactions. He should not tolerate any austere measure or unjust burden
   being laid on his subjects' necks. For it would be wicked to allow
   those whom the pope should rule as a father to be treated tyrannically
   by others. He should ensure that statutes and ancient constitutions by
   which provinces and districts have been well governed in the past are
   kept intact. But if any have subsequently been issued unreasonably or
   from envy or partiality, they should be cancelled or altered when the
   reasons for doing so have been understood. Within a year from the day
   of his election, the Roman pontiff shall summon spokesmen and proctors
   of the provinces and chief cities of the Roman church and shall
   question them closely, with fatherly affection, about the following:
   the state and condition of their territories, how they were governed in
   the time of his predecessor, whether they are being oppressed by any
   unjust burden, and what should be done for their good government. Then
   let him apply to them as to sons remedies which will provide for their
   benefit and security and for the common good. He should not shrink from
   repeating this at least every two years. Among the other things that
   feudatories, captains, governors, senators, castellans and other high
   officials of Rome and of the lands of the church customarily swear to,
   there should be added at the time of their installation an oath that,
   when the papacy is vacant, they will hold their cities, lands, places,
   citadels, castles and peoples at the command of the cardinals, in the
   name of the Roman church, and that they will freely and without
   opposition hand them over to the same. Lest the supreme pontiff may
   seem to be influenced by carnal affection rather than by right reason,
   and to avoid the scandals that sad experience shows often arise, in
   future he shall not make or allow to be made anyone related to him by
   blood or affinity to the third degree inclusive a duke, marquis, count,
   feudatory, emphyteutic tenant, deputy, governor, official or castellan
   of any province, city, town, castle, fortress or place of the Roman
   church, nor give them any jurisdiction or power over them, nor appoint
   them captains or leaders of men under arms. The cardinals must never
   agree with a supreme pontiff attempting to act otherwise, and his
   successor as pontiff shall withdraw and revoke anything done in this
   way.

   In accordance with the constitution of Pope Nicholas IV, the holy synod
   decrees that half of all fruits, revenues, proceeds, fines, penalties
   and taxes deriving from all the lands and places subject to the Roman
   church belongs to the cardinals of the holy Roman church, and that the
   institution and dismissal of all rulers and governors and guardians,
   howsoever they may be called, who are in charge of the aforesaid lands
   and places, and also of the collectors of the said fruits, should be
   made with the advice and agreement of the cardinals. The holy synod
   therefore admonishes the cardinals to protect the lands and subjects of
   the Roman church from harm and oppression and, mindful of their peace,
   safety and good government, to recommend them, if need be, to the
   supreme pontiff. While it is true that the supreme pontiff and the
   cardinals should give careful attention to all the territories of the
   Roman church, nevertheless the city of Rome should be at the centre of
   their concern. For there the holy bodies of blessed Peter and Paul and
   of innumerable martyrs and saints of Christ repose; there is the seat
   of the Roman pontiff, from which he and the Roman empire take their
   name; thither all Christians flock for the sake of devotion. They
   should feel for it a special love and affection, as being peculiarly
   their daughter and principal parish, so that it should be governed in
   peace, tranquillity and justice and should suffer no damage to its
   churches, walls and roads and the security of its streets. Hence this
   holy synod decrees that from the sum total of the income and proceeds
   of the city, an adequate portion shall be set aside for the
   preservation of the churches, walls, roads and bridges and the security
   of the streets in the city itself and the district; this money is to be
   administered by men of proven reputation who are to be chosen on the
   advice of the cardinals.

   The supreme pontiff calls himself the servant of the servants of God;
   let him prove it in deeds. As long as people from all parts have
   recourse to him as to a common father, he should give them all easy
   access. Let him set aside at least one day in the week for a public
   audience, when he shall listen with patience and kindness to all,
   especially the poor and oppressed, and shall grant their prayers as
   much as he can with God's help, and shall assist all with kind advice
   and help as each one has need and as a father does for his children. If
   he is prevented by some bodily need, he shall entrust this task to some
   cardinal or other noteworthy person who will report everything to him,
   and he shall order all officials of the curia, especially the
   vice-chancellor, the penitentiary and the chamberlain, to expedite
   business for the poor with speed and free of charge, bearing in mind
   the apostolic charity of Peter and Paul, who pledged themselves to
   remember the poor . He should attend a public mass on Sundays and
   feast-days, and after it for a while he should give audience to the
   needy. He should hold a public consistory each week, or at least twice
   a month, to treat of the business of cathedral churches, monasteries,
   princes and universities and other important affairs. But he should
   refer lawsuits and lesser matters to the vice-chancellor. He should
   keep himself free of lawsuits and lesser business as far as he can, so
   as to be freer to attend to major issues. Since the cardinals of the
   holy Roman church are considered to be part of the body of the Roman
   pontiff, it is extremely expedient for the common good that, following
   ancient custom, serious and difficult questions should hereafter be
   settled on their advice and direction after mature deliberation,
   especially the following: decisions on matters of faith; canonizations
   of saints, erections, suppressions, divisions, subjections or unions of
   cathedral churches and monasteries; promotions of cardinals;
   confirmations and provisions relating to cathedral churches and
   monasteries; deprivations and translations of abbots, bishops and
   superiors; laws and constitutions; legations a latere or commissions or
   envoys and nuncios functioning with the authority of legates a latere;
   foundations of new religious orders; new exemptions for churches,
   monasteries and chapels, or the revocation of those already granted
   without prejudice to the decree of the holy council of Constance about
   not transferring prelates against their will.

   [On the number and qualities of cardinals]

   Since the cardinals of the holy Roman church assist the supreme pontiff
   in directing the Christian commonweal, it is essential that such
   persons be appointed as may be, like their name, real hinges on which
   the doors of the universal church move and are upheld. The sacred synod
   therefore decrees that henceforth their number shall be so adjusted
   that it is not a burden to the church which now, owing to the malice of
   the times, is afflicted by many serious inconveniences) or cheapened by
   being too large. They should be chosen from all the regions of
   Christianity, as far as this is convenient and possible, so that
   information on new things in the church may be more easily available
   for mature consideration. They should not exceed twenty-four in number,
   including the present cardinals. Not more than a third of them at any
   given time shall be from one nation, not more than one from any city or
   diocese. None shall be chosen from that nation which now has more than
   a third of them, until its share has been reduced to a third. They
   should be men outstanding in knowledge, good conduct and practical
   experience, at least thirty years old, and masters, doctors or
   licentiates who have been examined in divine or human law. At least a
   third or a quarter of them should be masters or licentiates in holy
   scripture. A very few of them may be sons, brothers or nephews of kings
   or great princes; for them an appropriate education will suffice, on
   account of their experience and maturity of behaviour.

   Nephews of the Roman pontiff, related to him through his brother or
   sister, or of any living cardinal shall not be made cardinals; nor
   shall bastards or the physically handicapped or those stained by a
   reputation of crime or infamy. There can, however, be added to the
   aforesaid twenty-four cardinals, on account of some great necessity or
   benefit for the church, two others who are outstanding in their
   sanctity of life and excellence of virtues, even if they do not possess
   the above-mentioned degrees, and some distinguished men from the
   Greeks, when they are united to the Roman church. The election of
   cardinals shall not be made by oral votes alone, rather only those
   shall be chosen who, after a genuine and publicized ballot, obtain the
   collegial agreement, signed with their own hands, of the majority of
   the cardinals. For this purpose let an apostolic letter be drawn up
   with the signatures of the cardinals. The decree of this sacred council
   beginning Also since the multiplication of cardinals, etc., which was
   published in the fourth session, is to remain in force. When cardinals
   receive the insignia of their dignity, whose meaning is readiness to
   shed their blood if necessary for the good of the church, they shall
   take the following oath in a public consistory, if they are in the
   curia, or publicly in the hands of some bishop commissioned for this
   purpose by an apostolic letter containing the oath, if they are not in
   the curia.

   I,N., recently chosen as a cardinal of the holy Roman church, from this
   hour henceforward will be faithful to blessed Peter, to the universal
   and Roman church and to the supreme pontiff and his canonically elected
   successors. I will labour faithfully for the defence of the catholic
   faith, the eradication of heresies errors and schisms, the reform of
   morals and the peace of the Christian people. I will not consent to
   alienations of property or goods of the Roman church or of other
   churches or of any benefices, except in cases allowed by law, and I
   will strive to the best of my ability for the restoration of those
   alienated from the Roman church. I will give neither advice nor my
   signature to the supreme pontiff except for what is according to God
   and my conscience. I will faithfully carry out whatever I am
   commissioned to do by the apostolic see. I will maintain divine worship
   in the church of my title and will preserve its goods: so help me God.

   For the preservation of the titular churches of the cardinals, some of
   which have sadly deteriorated both in divine worship and in their
   buildings, to the shame of the apostolic see and of the cardinals
   themselves, this holy synod decrees that from the revenues and incomes
   of the territories of the Roman church - half of which belongs to the
   cardinals in accordance with the constitution of Pope Nicholas, as was
   said above - a tenth of what each cardinal receives shall be applied
   each year to his titular church. Moreover, each cardinal shall leave to
   his titular church, either in his lifetime or at his death, enough for
   the upkeep of one person. If he fails to do so, regarding both this and
   the said tenth, all his goods shall be sequestrated until due
   satisfaction has been made. We place the burden of carrying this out on
   the first cardinal of the order in which he died. Each cardinal present
   in the curia should make an annual visitation of his titular church in
   person; each one not present should make it through a suitable deputy.
   He should also inquire carefully concerning the clergy and the people
   of his dependent churches, and make useful provision with regard to the
   divine worship and the goods of these churches as well as the life and
   conduct of the clergy and parishioners, about whom, since they are his
   sheep, he will have to render an account at the severe judgment of God.
   As regards the time of the visitation and other things, let him observe
   what is laid down in our decree on synodal councils.

   Although both the dignity itself and the cardinal's own promise urge
   him to toil at the holy tasks just mentioned, yet results will be
   greater if the tasks are spread among individuals. Therefore
   cardinal-bishops shall inquire about what regions are infected with new
   or old heresies, errors and superstitions; cardinal-priests shall
   inquire about where conduct, observance of the divine commandments and
   ecclesiastical discipline are lax; cardinal-deacons shall inquire about
   which kings, princes and peoples are troubled by actual or possible
   wars. Like busy bees, both with the supreme pontiff and among
   themselves, they should promote these holy works with diligence and in
   detail, striving to provide a remedy where this is needed. The supreme
   pontiff for his part, as the common father and pastor of all, should
   have investigations made everywhere not only when requested to do so
   but also on his own initiative and he should apply salutary medicines,
   as best he can, for all the illnesses of his children. If the cardinals
   ever notice that a pope is negligent or remiss or acting in a way
   unbefitting his state, though may this never happen, with filial
   reverence and charity they shall beg him as their father to live up to
   his pastoral office, his good name and his duty. First, let one or some
   of them warn him that if he does not desist they will delate him to the
   next general council, and if he does not amend they shall all do this
   as a college together with some notable prelates. For the well-being of
   the supreme pontiff and the common good they should not fear the
   hostility of the supreme pontiff himself or anything else, provided
   they act with reverence and charity. Much more so, if it comes to the
   pope's notice that some cardinal is acting wrongly and reprehensibly,
   he should correct him, always with paternal charity and according to
   evangelical teaching. Thus, acting in charity towards each other, one
   to another, a father to his sons and sons to their father, let them
   direct the church with exemplary and salutary government.

   Let the cardinals both publicly and privately treat with kindness and
   respect prelates and all others, especially distinguished persons who
   come to the Roman curia, and let them present their business to the
   supreme pontiff freely and graciously. Since the cardinals assist him
   who is the common father of all, it is very unseemly for them to become
   acceptors of persons or advocates. Hence this holy synod forbids them
   to exercise any favouritism as collateral judges, even if they take
   their origin from a favoured region. Neither should they be biased
   protectors or defenders of princes or communities or others against
   anyone, whether paid or unpaid, but putting aside all sentiment let
   them assist the pope in pacifying quarrels with harmony and justice.
   The holy synod urges and commends them to promote the just business of
   princes and anybody else, especially religious and the poor, without
   charge and without seeking reward, as an act of charity. Let them
   preserve with readiness and kindness the gravity and modesty that
   befits their dignity. Let them maintain towards all people godliness
   which, according to the Apostle, is profitable in every way. Although
   they should not neglect their kinsfolk, especially if they are
   deserving and poor, they should not load them with a mass of goods and
   benefices to the scandal of others. Let them beware of pouring out on
   flesh and blood, beyond the bounds of necessity, goods coming from the
   churches. If the pontiff notices such strutting among the great, he
   should reprimand and object, as is fitting, and he will be blameworthy
   if he fails to correct, in keeping with his office, whatever needs
   correction.

   The household, table, furniture and horses of both pope and cardinals
   should not be open to blame as regards quantity, state, display or any
   other excess. The house and its contents should be on a moderate scale,
   a model of frugality and not a source of scandal. Both the supreme
   pontiff and the cardinals, as well as other bishops, should strive to
   observe the constitution of blessed Gregory which was published at a
   general synod and which this holy synod now renews the sense of which
   is as follows: Though the life of a pastor should be an example to
   disciples, the clergy for the most part do not know the private
   life-style of their pontiff, even though secular youths know it; we
   therefore declare by this present decree that certain clerics and even
   monks should be selected to minister in the pontifical chamber, so that
   he who is in the seat of government may have witnesses who will observe
   his true private behaviour and will draw an example of progress from
   this regular sight.

   Let them also pay attention to the words of Pope Paschal: "Let bishops
   spend their time in reading and prayer and always have with them
   priests and deacons and other clerics of good reputation, so that,
   following the Apostle and the instructions of holy fathers, they may be
   found without blame."3 It does not profit the commonweal for cases
   other than those concerning elections to cathedral churches or
   monasteries, or princes or universities or similar matters, to be
   assigned by the pope or the chancery to cardinals, since they should
   devote themselves to the greater problems of the universal church.
   Lesser cases, therefore, should be sent to the court of the Rota, which
   was instituted for this purpose. Neither the pope nor cardinals should
   in future send their officials to prelates who have been confirmed or
   provided, as it were to accept gifts, lest they allow others to do what
   is unfitting for themselves to do. Something that has happened in the
   past - namely a sum of money or something else is subtracted from the
   goods of a dead cardinal, as a charge for the ring given to him on the
   assignment of his titular church - is not to occur in the future, since
   the labours of cardinals for the commonweal merit rather obsequies from
   public funds, if they are poor.

   [On elections]

   Already this holy synod, with its abolition of the general reservation
   of all elective churches and dignities, has wisely decreed that
   provision should be made for them by canonical elections and
   confirmations. It wishes also to forbid special and particular
   reservations of elective churches and dignities, whereby free elections
   and confirmations can be prevented; and to ensure that the Roman
   pontiff will attempt nothing against this decree, except for an
   important, persuasive and clear reason, which should be expressed in
   detail in an apostolic letter. However, much has been done against the
   intention of this decree and without the required reason, resulting in
   serious scandals already and the likelihood of even more serious ones
   in the future. This holy synod wishes to prevent this and does not want
   the purpose of the decree, which was to remove every obstacle to
   canonical elections and confirmations, to be deprived of its effect. It
   therefore decrees that elections should assuredly be held in the said
   churches without any impediment or obstacle and that, after they have
   been examined in accordance with common law and the dispositions of our
   decree, they shall be confirmed. However, if perhaps on occasion it
   should happen that an election is made which in other respects is
   canonical but which, it is feared, will lead to trouble for the church
   or the country or the common good, the supreme pontiff, when the
   election is referred to him for confirmation, if he is convinced that
   there exists such a most pressing reason, after mature discussion and
   then with the signed votes of the cardinals of the Roman church or the
   majority of them declaring that the reason is true and sufficient, may
   reject the election and refer it back to the chapter or convent for
   them to institute another election, from which such consequences are
   not to be feared, within the legal time or otherwise according to the
   distance of the place.

   [On reservations]

   The numerous reservations of churches and benefices hitherto made by
   supreme pontiffs have turned out to be burdensome to churches.
   Therefore this holy synod abolishes all of them both general and
   special or particular - for all churches and benefices whatsoever that
   were customarily provided for by an election or a collation or some
   other disposition - which were introduced either by the additional
   canons Ad regimen and Execrabilis or by rules of the chancery or by
   other apostolic constitutions, and it decrees that never again shall
   they exist, with the exception only of reservations expressly contained
   in the corpus of law and those which occur in the lands mediately or
   immediately subject to the Roman church by reason of direct or
   beneficial dominion.

   [On Clementine "Letters"]3

   Although apostolic and other letters may state that someone has
   renounced, or been deprived of, a dignity, benefice or right, or has
   done something for which a right of his has been taken away,
   nevertheless letters of this sort should not prejudice him, even though
   they are based on the status or the intention of the person making the
   statement, unless proof is forthcoming from witnesses or other
   legitimate documents.


   Session 24 - 14 April 1436

   [About business with the Greeks and about indulgences, etc.]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   Our ambassadors to the most serene emperor of the Romans and the most
   reverend lord patriarch of Constantinople, who were sent to
   Constantinople on behalf and in the name of this holy synod, for
   various reasons promised to present the terms which were concluded and
   signed by the two sides on another occasion in this holy synod
   regarding the manner of holding a universal and ecumenical council of
   both churches, and to exhibit them with effect, under the customary
   leaden seal of this holy synod, with the present date and containing
   the following text word for word. This holy synod, unwilling to omit
   anything that might help the union of Christ's churches, accepts,
   approves, ratifies and confirms by this present decree the said promise
   of its ambassadors and includes in this document the said terms word
   for word as was promised by the said ambassadors, as follows.

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   Among the various works necessary for the whole Christian people for
   which this holy council was assembled, the union of the western and
   eastern churches of Christ is the chief and greatest. Rightly,
   therefore, from the very start of its proceedings, this holy synod has
   made every effort to achieve this. For, as quickly as possible it sent
   its ambassadors with letters to the most serene emperor of the Greeks
   and the most reverend patriarch of Constantinople, to exhort them with
   all charity and insistence that they should send some persons with full
   authority to treat with us on the way to achieve the said holy union.
   As soon as they were asked, they appointed to this holy synod three
   outstanding men from those who seem to be of great authority among them
   - the first of whom was indeed a blood-relative of the emperor - with a
   sufficient commission from the emperor himself signed by his own hand
   and with a golden seal, and furnished with letters of the patriarch.
   Both in a general congregation and in the presence of our commissaries
   they expressed the most fervent desire of the emperor, the patriarch
   and the whole eastern church for this union. They urge and daily
   stimulate us in a wonderful way to pursue this holy work, strongly and
   persistently affirming two things: that union is only possible in a
   universal synod in which both the western church and the eastern church
   meet, and that it is to be hoped that this union will follow if matters
   proceed in that synod in the way that is agreed below. We were filled
   with joy and gladness when we heard this. Therefore we venerable
   cardinals of the holy Roman church, presidents of the apostolic see,
   casting all our thoughts on God, who alone does great wonders, deputed
   the patriarch of Antioch and a suitable number of archbishops, bishops,
   abbots, masters and doctors to treat of this question with the
   ambassadors of the Greeks and to look for a way to reach a solution.
   After these men had frequently met and discussed among themselves and
   with the ambassadors, they reached the conclusions given below. These
   conclusions, in accordance with the custom of this council, were
   seriously debated by the deputations and ratified by a general
   congregation. Their contents, together with the chrysobull of the lord
   emperor, are as follows: The ambassadors of the most serene lord
   emperor, etc., which is given at length in the council's decree which
   is included above. But because the period of time mentioned above,
   within which the aforesaid things should have been fulfilled, has
   elapsed, not through the fault of either party but because of various
   intervening negotiations, this holy synod therefore accepts the period
   of time agreed by the most serene emperor of the Greeks and the most
   reverend patriarch of Constantinople on the one side, and by the
   ambassadors of this sacred council on the other, namely the year
   beginning this coming month of May, so that for the whole of this May
   until the following year each of the two parties is prepared to carry
   out the aforesaid points, and each accepts and promises that it will
   fulfil for its part, within the said time, whatever is included in the
   above-mentioned terms.

   [Safe-conduct for the Greeks given by the sacred council of Basel to
   the lord emperor of the Greeks and the patriarch of Constantinople]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church. In our western region and
   the obedience of the Roman church, a universal and ecumenical synod is
   to be held, under God's inspiration, at which both the western church
   and the eastern church will meet in accordance with the agreement
   reached at this holy synod and later ratified in Constantinople. In
   order that the sincerity of our intention towards the eastern church
   may be manifest to all, and that all possible suspicion as regards the
   security and freedom of those coming to it may be removed, this holy
   synod of Basel by this present decree, in the name and on behalf of the
   entire western church and of all in that church of every status,
   including those of imperial, regal or pontifical rank or of any lower
   spiritual or secular dignity, authority or office, decrees, gives and
   concedes a full and free safe-conduct to the most serene emperor of the
   Greeks, the most reverend patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria,
   Antioch and Jerusalem, and others up to the number of seven hundred
   persons, whether of imperial, regal, archiepiscopal or any other rank,
   dignity or condition, who are coming or shall come to the aforesaid
   universal and ecumenical council in the west. This holy synod, by this
   decree, receives and has received into its safe-keeping each and all of
   the said people, as regards their persons, honours and everything else,
   in the kingdoms, provinces, lordships, territories, communities,
   cities, castles, towns, vills and places of our obedience of the
   western church in which they shall stay or through which they shall
   pass. It promises and concedes to each and all of them, by this present
   synodal edict, free and safe permission to approach and enter the city
   or place in which the said holy universal council will be held; to
   stay, remain, reside and dwell there with all the immunities, liberties
   and securities which those of the obedience of the western church
   dwelling there will have; of debating, arguing and alleging rights and
   authorities and of saying, doing and treating of, freely and without
   hindrance from anyone, anything else that may seem to them useful and
   apt for the union of the churches of Christ.

   They may at will go out and return from the said town or place safely,
   freely and without restraint, once or often or as many times as any of
   them may wish, singly or together, with or without their goods and
   money, with every real or personal obstacle ceasing and being put
   aside, even if the said union does not come about, though may that not
   be so. In the latter case and in every other outcome, the most serene
   emperor, the lord patriarchs and other aforesaid persons will be taken
   back to Constantinople, at our expense and in our galleys, without any
   delay or obstacle, with the same honours, good will and friendship with
   which they were brought to the said universal council, whether or not
   union resulted from the council.

   All this is notwithstanding any differences, disagreements or
   dissensions about the aforesaid matters, or any of them in particular,
   which exist at present or could arise in the future between the said
   western and eastern churches, that is, between the Roman church and
   those subject and attached to it, and the aforesaid most serene emperor
   and others attached to the church of Constantinople; notwithstanding
   any judgments, decrees, condemnations, laws or decretals of any kind
   that have been or shall be made or issued; notwithstanding any crimes,
   excesses, faults or sins that may be committed by any of the aforesaid
   persons; and notwithstanding anything else, even if it is something for
   which a special mention in this decree is necessary. If one or some of
   ours should harm one or more of them, though may it not happen, or
   should molest them in their persons, honour, property or anything else,
   the miscreant shall be sentenced by us or ours to make adequate and
   reasonable satisfaction to the injured party. And conversely, if any of
   them harms any of ours, he shall be sentenced by them to make adequate
   and reasonable satisfaction to the injured party, in accordance with
   the customs of both parties. As regards other crimes, excesses and
   faults, each party will institute proceedings and pass judgment on its
   own members.

   This holy synod exhorts all Christ's faithful and furthermore commands,
   by the authority of the universal church and in virtue of the holy
   Spirit and of holy obedience, all prelates, kings, dukes, princes,
   officials, communities and other individuals, of whatever status,
   condition or dignity, who are members of our western church, to observe
   inviolably each and all of the above things and, far as they can, to
   have them observed; and to honour and treat with favour and reverence,
   and to have so honoured and treated, both individually and together,
   the most serene emperor, the patriarch and each and all of the other
   aforesaid persons on their way to and from the said council. If any
   doubt arises about the safe-conduct and its contents, it shall be
   decided by a declaration of the universal synod which is to be held.
   This holy synod, for its part, wishes the safe-conduct to remain in
   force until the most serene emperor, the patriarch and other aforesaid
   persons with their nobles and suites to the number of seven hundred
   persons, as was stated, and with their goods and chattels, have
   returned to Constantinople. If anyone attempts to act in any way
   contrary to the aforesaid or any part of it, let him know that he will
   incur the indignation of almighty God and of the said holy synod.

   Session 25 - 7 May 1437

   [On the places for the future ecumenical council for the Greeks]

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   Recently this holy synod among the various tasks for which the
   inscrutable providence of the divine majesty has deigned, by the
   invocation of the holy Spirit the paraclete, to bring it together and
   to employ it in the cultivation of the Lord's field, turning its mind
   like a watchful farmer and clearly perceiving how deplorable and
   abiding has been the division in God's church over the profession of
   the same faith by the eastern and western churches, conceived high hope
   and confidence in the most merciful goodness of him with whom nothing
   is impossible, and who generously and without restraint gives to all
   who duly ask him, to bring about the unity of the catholic faith
   between these churches. It decided, therefore, to apply the resources
   of its diligence more fully, grudging no labour or expense, because it
   was convinced that thence would follow the greater praise and glory of
   almighty God, a more fruitful salvation of souls and a greater increase
   of the faith. Desirous of undertaking this most salutary project of
   union, with the help of the grace of the holy Spirit it invited and
   exhorted to come to the project, through various envoys and letters,
   the most serene emperor of the Romans, the venerable patriarch of
   Constantinople, the other prelates and the rest of the Greek people.

   The emperor, the patriarch and others of the Greeks received these
   exhortations with eagerness, their hearts inclined and influenced by
   the grace of the most High. Sincerely zealous to embark on this project
   of union, they decided to send to this holy synod their solemn envoys
   and spokesmen, who were furnished with an adequate mandate with the
   golden seal and signature of the emperor and the leaden seal of the
   patriarch, devoutly expressing their most fervent desire for this unity
   of faith. This holy synod concluded with them, in various preliminary
   meetings and deliberations about the execution of this salutary task of
   union, certain mutually agreed decrees and terms highly useful and
   necessary for this purpose, which were recorded above and were
   promulgated in a session of this holy synod in the cathedral of Basel.
   Thereafter this holy synod wished to implement these decrees and terms
   by all necessary and suitable means, and therefore to proceed to
   choosing a place for the coming ecumenical council, to which the
   aforesaid emperor, the patriarch and others of the Greeks could and
   should come. After many propositions about these and other topics
   relevant to this holy matter had been considered by the various
   deputations of this holy synod, and after the votes of their members on
   these points had been counted, finally in a general congregation
   summoned for this purpose in the said cathedral, as is customary, in
   which the votes of the individuals were again counted, it was found
   that more than two-thirds of them had voted for Basel, Avignon or
   Savoy. After they had invoked the grace of the holy Spirit and
   celebrated a mass, they agreed that due and earnest pressure should be
   exerted on the emperor, the patriarch and other aforesaid Greeks, with
   the many good reasons being put before them, so that they might agree
   to Basel as the place for the ecumenical council, and that if they
   rejected Basel, it should be held at Avignon. If Avignon proved
   impossible, it should be held in Savoy.

   Therefore, in order that each and all of the aforesaid points might be
   brought to fruition, with all the solemnity normally employed in this
   sacred council of Basel in expediting matters of importance, while the
   fathers are seated in the cathedral of Basel after the mass, this holy
   synod decrees, wishes, ordains and declares that the future ecumenical
   council ought to be held at the due and agreed time in the city of
   Basel or, if that is rejected, in the city of Avignon or otherwise in
   Savoy, in accordance with the above-mentioned agreement; and that the
   emperor, the patriarch and other aforesaid Greeks, as detailed in the
   said terms and decrees, and all other persons of whatever rank, status,
   dignity or pre-eminence who ought by right or custom to take part in
   general councils, including those of episcopal rank, are bound and
   obliged to come to and take part in that ecumenical council, especially
   so that this salutary work might be completed. This holy synod wishes,
   declares and decrees this nomination and choice to be firm, fixed and
   unchangeable. Any modification, ordinance, disposition, nomination or
   choice to the contrary that may be made by this holy council or by one
   or more other persons, whatever their authority, even if it be papal,
   is utterly invalid; and this holy synod from its certain knowledge as
   from now quashes, revokes and annuls any such measures, and denounces
   them as quashed, null and of no effect, and it wishes them to be of no
   effect and holds them so now, in so far as they impede or oppose in
   whole or in part the said choice. Also this holy synod from its certain
   knowledge supplies for any defect that may exist in the aforesaid
   things or in any of them in particular. Furthermore, since this very
   difficult undertaking, which will bear great fruit in God's church, as
   well as the transport and maintenance of the aforesaid Greeks, cannot
   be accomplished without heavy expenses, it is right and fitting that
   all of Christ's faithful, especially ecclesiastics, should contribute
   generously from the substance of the patrimony of our lord Jesus Christ
   entrusted to them, for the conclusion of so happy a venture. This holy
   synod therefore imposes on each and every ecclesiastical person, both
   exempt and non-exempt under whatever form or words, even the order of
   St John of Jerusalem, of whatever status, dignity, rank, order or
   condition, even if they are cardinals or bishops, a tenth of all their
   ecclesiastical fruits and revenues - only daily distributions being
   excepted - from their churches, monasteries, dignities, offices and
   other ecclesiastical benefices. This tenth has already been imposed and
   agreed upon in a general congregation of this holy synod, and this holy
   synod now decrees and declares that it is to be imposed, and by this
   decree it imposes it. Furthermore, the said holy synod decrees, wishes,
   ordains and declares that the venerable bishops John of Luebeck, Luis
   of Viseu, Delfino of Parma and Louis of Lausanne, envoys of this holy
   synod, have full power for bringing the Greeks to the place of the
   ecumenical council, and for the majority of them then present to choose
   and nominate the Latin port which is most suitable and nearest to the
   places chosen and nominated above, and to which the said Greeks ought
   to direct themselves. The synod concedes this power to them by this
   present decree in accordance with the form of the other letters granted
   to them in this affair. Finally the same holy synod wishes, ordains and
   decrees, for the due and desired execution of the aforesaid points and
   what follows from them, and for the fuller security of the said envoys
   and of the council, that, at the request of these envoys or of their
   agents, any other suitable, useful and necessary letters shall be
   granted, drawn up and despatched in due and correct form by the synod's
   chancery under the synod's seal.

   The holy general synod of Basel, legitimately assembled in the holy
   Spirit, representing the universal church, for an everlasting record.
   This holy synod from its outset, in order that those things might be
   accomplished which general councils are instituted to achieve with the
   assistance of the holy Spirit, devoted very great care to promoting
   union between the western and eastern peoples so that, as the church of
   God has suffered innumerable disasters from the long-standing
   dissension, the greatest profit might ensue from fraternal union.
   Therefore it sent envoys to Constantinople for the promotion of this
   holy work. They returned with the ambassadors of the most serene
   emperor of the Romans and of the venerable patriarch of Constantinople.
   After many meetings and mature deliberation on this subject, certain
   terms were agreed between this sacred council and those ambassadors and
   were confirmed by a decree in a public session. By these terms this
   holy synod bound itself to send envoys with certain sums of money, two
   large and two smaller galleys and three hundred crossbowmen within a
   fixed time, and to nominate through these envoys one of the places
   mentioned in the decree for the ecumenical council, where the emperor
   and the patriarch with seven hundred persons would meet with us to
   bring about this holy union.

   However, since the time-limit for accomplishing the above is imminent,
   this holy synod, desirous of fulfilling its promises completely and of
   bringing to its desired goal this holy endeavour which is the most
   salutary of all works in these times, came to the following conclusion
   in its discussions and then in a general congregation: namely, that
   Florence or Udine in Friuli should be put into the council's hands, or
   else that there should be chosen for the ecumenical council some other
   safe place which is mentioned in the decree and is convenient for the
   pope and the Greeks, that is to say whichever of the aforesaid places
   shall be quickest to collect and send the galleys, the sums of money
   and other requisites with the necessary securities. The port would be
   Venice, Ravenna or Rimini; whichever of them the emperor and the
   patriarch of Constantinople prefer. Also, so that the clergy are not
   burdened uselessly, the tenth shall not be decreed or exacted until the
   Greeks have arrived at one of the above-mentioned ports. Also, that the
   sacred council should remain in this city during the whole time covered
   by the decree. Also, that the legates and presidents of the apostolic
   see, after they have summoned such fathers as shall seem good to them,
   shall choose the envoys for accompanying the Greeks and for carrying
   out the aforesaid things; these envoys ought to urge forcibly the
   choice of this city of Basel. Therefore, in order that each and all of
   the above may attain due effect, with the assistance of divine grace,
   in this public and solemn session this holy synod wishes, decrees and
   declares that the aforesaid decision is definite and valid, to be
   adhered to and to be implemented. It quashes, voids and annuls, and
   declares to be quashed, void and null, whatever has been or shall be
   done, or may be attempted, by any person or persons contrary to the
   above or its consequences or whatever could in any way impede their
   execution. And it wishes that the aforesaid apostolic legates and
   presidents shall compose in due form and under the seal of the council
   suitable letters for the execution of the above, and shall expedite
   whatever else may be necessary and appropriate for this holy
   enterprise.
