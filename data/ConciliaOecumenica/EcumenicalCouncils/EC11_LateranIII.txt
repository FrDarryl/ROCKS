The Third General Council of the Lateran, 1179

Introduction

   By an agreement reached at Venice in 1177, the bitter conflict which
   had arisen about twenty years earlier between Pope Alexander III
   (1159-1181) and Emperor Frederick I (1152-1190) was brought to an end.
   For when Pope Hadrian IV had died in 1159, the cardinals elected two
   popes together, namely Roland of Siena, who took the name of Alexander
   III, and Octavian of Rome who though he was nominated by fewer
   cardinals, nevertheless with the support of the emperor Frederick
   usurped the name of Pope Victor IV. The emperor, wishing to remove
   everything which stood in the way of his authority in Italy, declared
   war upon the Italian states and especially the Roman church which after
   its struggle for ecclesiastical liberty for so many years, was enjoying
   great authority. The emperor carried on the war for a long time. A
   serious schism had arisen out of this conflict, and after Victor IV two
   antipopes were nominated in opposition to Alexander III, namely Paschal
   III (1164-1168) and Callistus III (1168-1178). At last, when Alexander
   had gained the victory, he promised the emperor at Venice that he would
   summon a general council.
   The particular object of this council was to put an end to the schism
   within the church and the quarrel between the emperor and the papacy.
   It was summoned by Pope Alexander in 1178, "so that according to the
   custom of the ancient fathers, the good should be sought and confirmed
   by many, and that with the cooperation of the grace of the holy Spirit,
   by the efforts of all, there should be carried out what was required
   for the correction of abuses and the establishment of what was pleasing
   to God". The council was held at Rome in March 1179. About three
   hundred fathers assembled from the provinces of Europe and some from
   the Latin east, and a single legate from the Greek church. It began on
   5 March, according to Archbishop William of Tyre, our chief authority.
   The bishops first heard Rufinus, bishop of Assisi, who in a highly
   polished address praised the Roman pontiff and the Roman church, "that
   church to which alone belongs the decision and power to summon a
   general council, to lay down new canons and cancel the old; indeed,
   though the fathers had summoned a solemn council many times in the
   past, yet the obligation and reason to do this was never more expedient
   than at the present".
   We do not have the same reasons for doubting the ecumenical nature of
   this council as we have for Lateran I and II. For, the way in which the
   council was summoned and conducted by the pope, and the number of
   fathers who gathered from the whole Latin world and devoted their
   efforts to strengthening the unity of the church and condemning
   heretics, resemble rather the ancient councils than Lateran I and II
   and exemplify the typical council of the Middle Ages presided over by
   the Roman pontiff. For this reason it is not surprising that chronicles
   of the period frequently refer to this council as Lateran I.
   Although we do not possess the acts of the council, we have evidence
   from chronicles and annals and especially from the canons which the
   fathers laid down in the final session on 19 March. Accordingly, to
   avoid future schisms it was first laid down that nobody was to be
   regarded as Roman pontiff unless he had been elected by two thirds of
   the cardinals (canon 1) ; all appointments by antipopes were deemed
   invalid (canon 2), heretics called Cathars were excommunicated and
   likewise were the bands of mercenaries, or rather criminals, which were
   causing utter destruction in some parts of Europe; it was declared, and
   this seems an innovation, that arms should be taken up against them
   (canon 27) ; it was also decided not to pass judgment about the
   preaching of the Waldensians. All this seems to have been directed to
   strengthening the unity of the church. In addition, Alexander III and
   the fathers, renewing the precedent of Lateran I and II, laid down
   several canons for the reform of the church and some concerning morals
   and civil affairs.
   The canons of this council played a notable part in the future
   government of the church. They were frequently included in the
   collections of decretals compiled in the late 12th and early 13th
   century, and afterwards all were inserted into Pope Gregory IX's
   Decretals. Walter Holtzmann and other scholars considered that these
   decretal collections in fact arose from this Lateran council and its
   canons. Certainly the canons, unlike those of Lateran I and II and many
   preceding councils, appear to have been worked out by an excellent
   legal mind so that it is probable they were composed under the
   authority of Alexander III himself, who was an expert lawyer. The
   canons, except for those which refer to Lateran II or the council of
   Rheims in 1148 (see canons 2, 11, 20-22) or to Gratian's Decrees (see
   canons 1-4, 7, 11, 13-14, 17-18), are new and original.
   The tradition of the canons has not yet been adequately examined and
   remains very uncertain. Many manuscript codices survive for this
   council (in contrast to Lateran I and II). However, they do not seem to
   give us the version of the canons which was confirmed by ecclesiastical
   authority and which Archbishop William of Tyre, with the authority of
   the fathers, had himself drawn up. Frequently the canons are to be
   found in chronicles and decretal collections. They are included in four
   contemporary English chronicles: those of Abbot Benedict of
   Peterborough, Gervase of Canterbury, William of Newburgh, and Roger of
   Hoveden. And in the following collections of decretals: the collection
   called the Appendix of the Lateran council, the collections of Bamberg,
   Berlin I, Canterbury I-II, Kassel, Cheltenham, Claudian, Cotton,
   Dertosa, Douai, Durham, Eberbach, Erlangen, Florian, Klosterneuberg,
   Leipzig, Oriel II, Paris I, Peterhouse, Rochester, Sangerman, and
   Tanner; and there are a considerable number of collections still to be
   examined. The canons are also contained in the book called
   "Rommersdorfer Briefbuch", the Cartulary of Rievaulx, and the codices
   Florence Ricc. 288 (Day-book), Innsbruck Univ. 90 (Gratian's Decrees),
   and (which seem to have been unnoticed hitherto) Vatican Regin. lat.
   596, 12th century (fos. 6V-8v), and 984, 12th century (fos. 2r-7v). We
   can say for certain that the canons of the council were spread abroad
   through the whole Latin church, and were of great weight in its
   concerns and transactions.
   The first printed edition was made by Cr2 (2, 1551, 836-843). He
   edited, from a manuscript now lost or unknown, the whole collection
   known as the Appendix of the Lateran council, which is divided into
   fifty parts; all 27 canons of Lateran III are in the first part. This
   text was copied by Su (3, 1567, 626-633) and Bn (3, 1606, 1345-1350),
   though Su introduced some errors. Bn who was the first to give the name
   "Appendix of the Lateran council" to the collection, added some variant
   readings and rubrics which he had found in the chronicle of Roger of
   Hoveden. The Roman editors (Rm 4, 1612, 27-33), using also the
   manuscript codex of Antonio Augustine of Tarragona, produced a more
   accurate text and more variant readings. Later editions, all of which
   we have exarnined, followed the Roman text, narnely:ER27 (1644)
   439-463;LC10 (1671) 1507-1523;Hrd 6 (1714) 1673-1684; Cl 13 (1730)
   416-432; Msi 22 (1778) 217-233. Boehmer, who published his edition in
   1747, before Msi, is an exception. He took the canons from the Kassel
   collection of decretals, where the order and some readings are
   different. Finally Herold, in his unpublished Bonn dissertation of
   1952, examined thoroughly the whole tradition and established the order
   of the canons; using 36 sources, he concluded there were 34 different
   traditions!
   As things now stand, it is impossible to use all the known sources for
   our edition. For, these sources reveal only a limited part of the whole
   tradition and, what is even more important, we do not yet understand
   the relations between the individual traditions. Even Herold has not
   examined these relations sufficiently. We have therefore preferred to
   publish the text of a single tradition, namely that of the Appendix of
   the Lateran council, using Cr2 and Rm as the best text of this
   tradition and including the variant readings listed in Rrn. This
   "Appendix" is a good text, as even Herold's text (= H) shows. We have
   given Herold's variant readings in the critical apparatus, and we have
   noted in footnotes the order in which he places the 23 canons that he
   includes.

CANONS

Canon 1.

   Although clear enough decrees have been handed down by our predecessors
   to avoid dissension in the choice of a sovereign pontiff, nevertheless
   in spite of these, because through wicked and reckless ambition the
   church has often suffered serious division, we too, in order to avoid
   this evil, on the advice of our brethren and with the approval of the
   sacred council, have decided that some addition must be made. Therefore
   we decree that if by chance, through some enemy sowing tares, there
   cannot be full agreement among the cardinals on a successor to the
   papacy, and though two thirds are in agreement a third party is
   unwilling to agree with them or presumes to appoint someone else for
   itself, that person shall be held as Roman pontiff who has been chosen
   and received by the two thirds. But if anyone trusting to his
   nomination by the third party assumes the name of bishop, since he
   cannot take the reality, both he and those who receive him are to incur
   excommunication and be deprived of all sacred order, so that viaticum
   be denied them, except at the hour of death, and unless they repent,
   let them receive the lot of Dathan and Abiron, who were swallowed up
   alive by the earth. Further, if anyone is chosen to the apostolic
   office by less than two thirds, unless in the meantime he receives a
   larger support, let him in no way assume it, and let him be subject to
   the foresaid penalty if he is unwilling humbly to refrain. However, as
   a result of this decree, let no prejudice arise to the canons and other
   ecclesiastical constitutions according to which the decision of the
   greater and senior {1 } part should prevail, because any doubt that can
   arise in them can be settled by a higher authority; whereas in the
   Roman church there is a special constitution, since no recourse can be
   had to a superior.

Canon 2.

   Renewing the decision taken by our predecessor of happy memory,
   Innocent, we decree that the ordinances made by the heresiarchs
   Octavian {2 } and Guido {3 }, and also by John of Struma {4 } who
   followed them, and by those ordained by them, are void; and furthermore
   that if any have received ecclesiastical dignities or benefices through
   the foresaid schismatics, they are to be deprived of them. Moreover
   alienations or seizures of ecclesiastical property, which have been
   made by these schismatics or by lay persons, are to lack all validity
   and are to return to the church without any burden to it. If anyone
   presumes to act against this, let him know that he is excommunicated.
   We decree that those who of their own accord have taken an oath to
   remain in schism are suspended from sacred orders and dignities.

Canon 3.

   Since in holy orders and ecclesiastical ministries both maturity of
   age, a serious character and knowledge of letters should be required,
   much more should these qualities be required in a bishop, who is
   appointed for the care of others and ought to show in himself how
   others should live in the house of the Lord. Therefore, lest what has
   been done with regard to certain persons through the needs of the time
   should be taken as a precedent for the future, we declare by the
   present decree that no one should be chosen bishop unless he has
   already reached the age of thirty, been born in lawful wedlock and also
   is shown to be worthy by his life and learning. When he has been
   elected and his election has been confirmed, and he has the
   administration of ecclesiastical property, after the time has passed
   for the consecration of bishops as laid down by the canons let the
   person to whom the benefices which he held belong, have the free
   disposition of them. Further, with regard to the inferior ministries,
   for instance that of dean or archdeacon, and others which have the care
   of souls annexed, let no one at all receive them, or even the rule of
   parish churches, unless he has already reached his twenty-fifth year of
   age, and can be approved for his learning and character. When he has
   been nominated, if the archdeacon is not ordained deacon, and the deans
   (and the rest after due warning) are not ordained priests within the
   time fixed by the canons, let them be removed from that office and let
   it be conferred on another who is both able and willing to fulfill it
   properly; and let them not be allowed the evasion of recourse to an
   appeal, should they wish by an appeal to protect themselves against a
   transgression of the constitution. We order that this should be
   observed with regard to both past and future appointments, unless it is
   contrary to the canons. Certainly if clerics appoint someone contrary
   to this rule, let them know that they are deprived of the power of
   election and are suspended from ecclesiastical benefices for three
   years. For it is right that at least the strictness of ecclesiastical
   discipline should restrain those who are not recalled from evil by the
   fear of God. But if any bishop has acted in anyone's interest contrary
   to this decree, or has consented to such actions, let him lose the
   power of conferring the foresaid offices, and let these appointments be
   made by the chapter, or by the metropolitan if the chapter cannot
   agree.

Canon 4.

   Since the apostle decided that he ought to support himself and those
   accompanying him by his own hands, so that he might remove the
   opportunity of preaching from false apostles and might not be
   burdensome to those to whom he was preaching, it is recognized that it
   is a very serious matter and calls for correction that some of our
   brethren and fellow bishops are so burdensome to their subjects in the
   procurations demanded that sometimes, for this reason, subjects are
   forced to sell church ornaments and a short hour consumes the food of
   many days. Therefore we decree that archbishops on their visitations of
   their dioceses are not to bring with them more than forty or fifty
   horses or other mounts, according to the differences of dioceses and
   ecclesiastical resources; cardinals should not exceed twenty or
   twenty-five, bishops are never to exceed twenty or thirty, archdeacons
   five or seven, and deans, as their delegates, should be satisfied with
   two horses. Nor should they set out with hunting dogs and birds, but
   they should proceed in such a way that they are seen to be seeking not
   their own but the things of Jesus Christ. Let them not seek rich
   banquets but let them receive with thanksgiving what is duly and
   suitably provided {5 }. We also forbid bishops to burden their subjects
   with taxes and impositions. But we allow them, for the many needs which
   sometimes come upon them, if the cause be clear and reasonable, to ask
   for assistance moderated by charity. For since the apostle says
   children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for their
   children, it seems to be far removed from paternal affection if
   superiors are burdensome to their subjects, when like a shepherd they
   ought to cherish them in all their needs. Archdeacons or deans should
   not presume to impose charges or taxes on priests or clerics. Indeed,
   what has been said above by way of permission about the number of
   horses may be observed in those places where there are greater
   resources or revenues, but in poorer places we wish measure so to be
   observed that the visit of greater personages should not be a burden to
   the humbler, lest by such a grant those who were accustomed to use
   fewer horses should think that the widest powers have been granted to
   them.

Canon 5.

   If a bishop ordains someone as deacon or priest without a definite
   title from which he may draw the necessities of life, let the bishop
   provide him with what he needs until he shall assign him the suitable
   wages of clerical service in some church, unless it happens that the
   person ordained is in such a position that he can find the support of
   life from his own or family inheritance.

Canon 6.

   A most reprehensible custom has become established in certain places
   whereby our brethren and fellow bishops and even archdeacons have
   passed sentence of excommunication or suspension, without any previous
   admonition on those who they think will lodge an appeal. Others too,
   while they fear the sentence and canonical discipline of a superior,
   lodge an appeal without any real grounds and thus make use of a means
   ordained for the help of the innocent as a defence of their own
   wrongdoing. Therefore to prevent prelates burdening their own subjects
   without reason, or subjects at their will being able to escape the
   correction of prelates under cover of an appeal, we lay down by this
   present decree that prelates should not pass sentence of suspension or
   excommunication without a previous canonical warning, unless the fault
   is such that by its nature it incurs the penalty of excommunication {6
   } , and that subjects should not recklessly have recourse to an appeal,
   contrary to ecclesiastical discipline, before the introduction of their
   case. But if anyone believes that because of his own need he should
   make an appeal, let a proper limit be fixed for his making it, and if
   it happens that he fails to do so within this limit, let the bishop
   freely use his own authority. If in any business someone makes an
   appeal, but fails to appear when the defendant has arrived, let him
   make a proper repayment of the defendant's expenses, if he is in a
   position to do so; in this way, at least by fear, a person may be
   deterred from lightly making an appeal to the injury of another. But we
   wish that in religious houses especially this should be observed,
   namely that monks or other religious, when they are to be corrected for
   any fault, should not presume to appeal against the regular discipline
   of their superior or chapter, but they should humbly and devoutly
   submit to what is usefully enjoined them for their salvation.

Canon 7.

   Since in the body of the church everything should be treated with a
   spirit of charity, and what has been freely received should be freely
   given, it is utterly disgraceful that in certain churches trafficking
   is said to have a place, so that a charge is made for the enthroning of
   bishops, abbots or ecclesiastical persons, for the installation of
   priests in a church, for burials and funerals, for the blessing of
   weddings or for other sacraments, and that he who needs them cannot
   gain them unless he first makes an offering to the person who bestows
   them. Some think that this is permitted in the belief that long
   standing custom has given it the force of law. Such people, blinded by
   avarice, are not aware that the longer an unhappy soul is bound by
   crimes the graver they are. Therefore, so that this may not be done in
   the future, we severely forbid that anything be demanded for the
   enthronement of ecclesiastical persons or the institution of priests,
   for burying the dead as well as for blessing marriages or for any other
   sacrament. But if anyone presumes to act against this, let him know
   that he will have his lot with Giezi {7 }, whose action he imitates by
   his demand of a disgraceful present. Moreover we forbid bishops, abbots
   or other prelates to impose upon churches new dues, increase the old or
   presume to appropriate to their own use part of the revenues, but let
   them readily preserve for their subjects those liberties which
   superiors wish to be preserved for themselves. If anyone acts
   otherwise, his action is to be held invalid.

Canon 8.

   Let no ecclesiastical ministries or even benefices or churches be
   assigned or promised to anyone before they are vacant, so that nobody
   may seem to wish for the death of his neighbour to whose position or
   benefice he believes himself to be the successor. For since we find
   this forbidden even in the laws of the pagans themselves, it is utterly
   disgraceful and calls for the punishment of God's judgment if the hope
   of future succession should have any place in God's church when even
   pagans have taken care to condemn it. But whenever ecclesiastical
   prebends or any offices happen to become vacant in a church, or are
   even now vacant, let them no longer remain unassigned and let them be
   conferred within six months on persons who are able to administer them
   worthily. If the bishop, when it concerns him, delays to make the
   appointment, let it be done by the chapter; but if the election belongs
   to the chapter and it does not make the appointment within the
   prescribed time, let the bishop proceed according to God's will, with
   the advice of religious men; or if by chance all fail to do so, let the
   metropolitan dispose of these matters without opposition from them and
   in accordance with God's will.

Canon 9.

   Since we ought both to plant holy religion and in every way to cherish
   it when planted, we shall never fulfil this better than if we take care
   to nourish what is right and to correct what stands in the way of the
   progress of truth by means of the authority entrusted to us {8 }. Now
   we have learnt from the strongly worded complaints of our brethren and
   fellow bishops that the Templars and Hospitallers, and other professed
   religious, exceeding the privileges granted them by the apostolic see
   have often disregarded episcopal authority, causing scandal to the
   people of God and grave danger to souls. We are told that they receive
   churches from the hands of lay persons; that they admit those under
   excommunication and interdict to the sacraments of the church and to
   burial; that in their churches they appoint and remove priests without
   the knowledge of the bishop; that when the brothers go to seek alms,
   and it is granted that the churches should be open on their arrival
   once a year and the divine services should be celebrated in them,
   several of them from one or more houses often go to a place under
   interdict and abuse the privileges granted {9 } to them by holding
   divine service, and then presume to bury the dead in the said churches.
   On the occasion also of the brotherhoods which they establish in many
   places, they weaken the bishops' authority, for contrary to their
   decision and under cover of some privileges they seek to defend all who
   wish to approach and join their brotherhood. In these matters, because
   the faults arise not so much with the knowledge or advice of the
   superiors as from the indiscretion of some of the subjects, we have
   decreed that abuses should be removed and doubtful points settled. We
   absolutely forbid that these orders and all other religious should
   receive churches and tithes from the hands of lay persons, and we even
   order them to put away what they have recently received contrary to
   this decree. We declare that those who are excommunicated, or
   interdicted by name, must be avoided by them and all others according
   to the sentence of the bishop. In churches which do not belong to them
   by full right, let them present to the bishops the priests to be
   instituted, so that while they are answerable to the bishops for the
   care of the people, they may give to their own members a proper account
   of temporal matters. Let them not presume to remove those priests who
   have been appointed without first consulting the bishops. If the
   Templars or Hospitallers come to a church which is under an interdict,
   let them be allowed to hold the services of the church only once a year
   and let them not bury there the bodies of the dead. With regard to the
   brotherhoods we declare as follows: if any do not give themselves
   entirely to the said brothers but decide to keep their possessions,
   they are in no way on this account exempt from the sentence of the
   bishops, but the bishops may exercise their power over them as over
   other parishioners whenever they are to be corrected for their faults.
   What has been said about the said brothers, we declare shall be
   observed with regard to other religious who presume to claim for
   themselves the rights of bishops and dare to violate their canonical
   decisions and the tenor of our privileges. If they do not observe this
   decree, let the churches in which they dare so to act be placed under
   an interdict, and let what they do be considered void.

Canon 10.

   Monks are not to be received in a monastery for money nor are they
   allowed money of their own. They are not to be stationed individually
   in towns or cities or parish churches, but they are to remain in larger
   communities or with some of their brethren, nor are they to await alone
   among people of the world the attack of their spiritual foes, since
   Solomon says, Woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another
   to lift him up. If anyone when demanded gives something for his
   reception, let him not proceed to sacred orders and let the one who has
   received him be punished by loss of his office. If he has money in his
   possession, unless it has been granted him by the abbot for a specific
   purpose, let him be removed from the communion of the altar, and any
   one who is found at his death with money in his possession {10 } is not
   to receive burial among his brethren and mass is not to be offered for
   him. We order that this is also to be observed with regard to other
   religious. Let the abbot who does not exercise care in such matters
   know that he will incur the loss of his office. Neither priories nor
   obediences are to be handed over to anyone for a sum of money;
   otherwise both giver and receiver are to be deprived of ministry in the
   church. Priors, when they have been appointed to conventual churches,
   are not to be changed except for a clear and reasonable cause, for
   instance if they are wastrels or live immoral lives or have committed
   an offence for which they clearly should be removed, or if on account
   of the demands of higher office they should be transferred on the
   advice of their brethren.

Canon 11.

   Clerics in holy orders, who in open concubinage keep their mistresses
   in their houses, should either cast them out and live continently or be
   deprived of ecclesiastical office and benefice. Let all who are found
   guilty of that unnatural vice for which the wrath of God came down upon
   the sons of disobedience and destroyed the five cities with fire, if
   they are clerics be expelled from the clergy or confined in monasteries
   to do penance; if they are laymen they are to incur excommunication and
   be completely separated from the society of the faithful. If any cleric
   without clear and necessary cause presumes to frequent convents of
   nuns, let the bishop keep him away; and if he does not stop, let him be
   ineligible for an ecclesiastical benefice.

Canon 12.

   Clerics in the subdiaconate and above and also those in minor orders,
   if they are supported by ecclesiastical revenues, should not presume to
   become advocates in legal matters before a secular judge, unless they
   happen to be defending their own case or that of their church, or
   acting on behalf of the helpless who cannot conduct their own cases.
   Let clerics not presume to take upon themselves the management of towns
   or even secular jurisdiction under princes or seculars so as to become
   their ministers of justice. If anyone dares to act contrary to this
   decree, and so contrary to the teaching of the Apostle who says, No
   soldier of God gets entangled in secular affairs, and acts as a man of
   this world, let him be deprived of ecclesiastical ministry, on the
   grounds that neglecting his duty as a cleric he plunges into the waves
   of this world to please its princes. We decree in the strictest terms
   that any religious who presumes to attempt any of the above-mentioned
   things should be punished.
