The General Council of Constance, 1414-18

INTRODUCTION 1

   [This is the introduction given by Tanner in Decrees of the Ecumenical
   Councils]

   This council was summoned by John XXIII, the Pisan pope [1 ] , with the
   support of Emperor Sigismund. It began on 5 November 1414 in the
   cathedral of Constance, with many bishops from all parts of Europe.
   Business in the council was transacted in a way that was largely new
   for an ecumenical council, namely votes were cast not by Individual
   persons but by nations.

   The council, from the very beginning, proposed the following three
   topics:

   1. To bring unity back to the church and to make an end to the
   schism which had divided the church since 1378 and which the council
   held at Pisa in 1409 had not healed but rather aggravated when it
   elected Alexander V as a third pope. When the council of Constance
   opened, Christians owed obedience to three different popes: some owed
   obedience to Gregory XII of the Roman party others to Benedict XIII of
   the Avignon party, and others to John XXIII, who had been elected after
   the death of Alexander V. John XXIII and Benedict XIII were deposed by
   the council, Gregory XII voluntarily resigned. Then Martin V was
   elected pope on 11 November 1417 and he was regarded as the legitimate
   pontiff by the church as a whole.

   2. To eradicate heresies, especially those spread by John Wyclif in
   Britain and by John Hus and Jerome of Prague in Bohemia.

   3. To reform the corrupt morals of the church. This, however, was only
   partly accomplished in the final sessions of the council.

   With regard to the ecumenical nature of the sessions, there is dispute
   about those before the election of Martin V and also about the
   significance and force of the approval which he gave to the matters
   transacted by the council. The decrees notably those of sessions
   3-5 and the decree Frequens (session 39), appear to proceed from the
   council's teaching. Objection has been made to them on the grounds of
   the primacy of the Roman pontiff. There is no doubt, however, that in
   enacting these decrees there was solicitude and care to choose the true
   and sure way ahead in order to heal the schism, and this could only be
   done by the authority of a council.

   The acts of the council of Constance were first published by Jerome of
   Croaria at Hagenau in 1500 (Acta scitu dignissima docteque concinnata
   Constantiensis concilii celebratissimi = Asd), from the epitome of the
   acts which the council of Basel had ordered to be compiled and publicly
   accepted in 1442. This edition of the Basel epitome was followed by all
   general collections of the councils (including Editio Romana, IV
   127-300, even though it ignores the council of Basel). These
   collections, down to Mansi (27, 529-1240), added various appendices. H.
   von der Hardt, in his great collection of the sources of the council of
   Constance, made an edition of the acts and decrees of the council
   according to the earliest trustworthy documents (Magnum oecumenicum
   Constantiense concilium, in six tomes, Frankfurt-Leipzig 1696-1700;
   tome IV, Corpus actorum et decretorum magni Constantiensis concilii de
   Ecclesiae refor matione, unione ac fide = Hardt). We have followed von
   der Hardt's edition throughout and have noted only the principle
   variants provided by Asd. We indicate only, and do not print, the
   decrees pertaining to the internal administration of the council and of
   the church and to judicial acts.

SESSION 1 - 16 November 1414

   [On the matters to be treated in the council, in which order and by
   which officials [12 ]]

   John, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for future record.
   Wishing to carry out those things which were decreed at the council of
   Pisa [13 ] by our predecessor of happy memory, pope [14 ] Alexander V,
   regarding the summoning of a new general council, we earlier convoked
   this present council by letters of ours, the contents of which we have
   ordered to be inserted here:

   John, bishop ... [15 ]

   We have therefore come together with our venerable brothers, cardinals
   of the holy Roman church, and our court to this city of Constance at
   the appointed time. Being present here by the grace of God, we now
   wish, with the advice of this sacred synod, to attend to the peace,
   exaltation and reform of the church and to the quiet of the christian
   people.

   In such an arduous matter it is not right to rely on one's own
   strength, but rather trust should be placed in the help of God.
   Therefore, in order to begin with divine worship, we decreed, with the
   approval of this sacred council, that a special mass for this purpose
   should be said today. This mass has now been duly celebrated, by the
   grace of God. We now decree that such a mass shall be celebrated
   collegially in this and every other collegiate church of this city
   whether secular or regular, once a week, namely each Friday, for the
   duration of this sacred council. Moreover, in order that the faithful
   may devote themselves to this holy celebration most fervently, whereby
   they will feel themselves refreshed by a more abundant gift of grace,
   we relax, mercifully in the Lord, the following amounts of enjoined
   penance to each and every one of them who is truly penitent and has
   confessed: for each mass, one year to the celebrating priest and forty
   days to those present at it. Furthermore, we exhort our venerable
   brothers, cardinals of the holy Roman church, as well as patriarchs,
   archbishops and bishops, and our beloved chosen sons, abbots and others
   in the priesthood, devoutly to celebrate this mass once every week, in
   order that the aforesaid divine aid may be implored; and we grant the
   same indulgences to the celebrant and to those present at the mass. We
   exhort in the Lord, moreover, each and all who glory in the name of
   Christ, in order that the desired outcome to so great a matter may be
   obtained, to give themselves diligently to prayer, fasting, almsgiving
   and other pious works, so that God may be placated by our and their
   humility, and so deign to grant a happy outcome to this sacred
   gathering.

   Considering, moreover, that a council should specially treat of those
   matters which concern the catholic faith, according to the praiseworthy
   practices of the early councils, and aware that such things demand
   diligence, sufficient time and study, on account of their difficulty,
   we therefore exhort all those who are well versed in the sacred
   scriptures to ponder and to treat, both within themselves and with
   others, about those things which seem to them useful and opportune in
   this matter. Let them bring such things to our notice and to that of
   this sacred synod, as soon as they conveniently can, so that at a
   suitable time there may be decided what things, it seems, should be
   held and what repudiated for the profit and increase of the same
   catholic faith.

   Let them especially ponder on the various errors which are said to have
   sprouted in certain places at various times, especially on those which
   are said to have arisen from a certain John called Wyclif.

   We exhort, moreover, all Catholics assembled here and others who will
   come to this sacred synod that they should seek to think on, to follow
   up and to bring to us, and to this same sacred synod, those matters by
   which the body of Catholics may be led, if God is willing, to a proper
   reformation and to the desired peace. For it is our intention and will
   that all who are assembled for this purpose may say, consult about and
   do, with complete freedom, each and all of the things that they think
   pertain to the above.

   In order, however, that a rule may be observed in the procedure of this
   sacred synod with regard to what things are to be said and decided, the
   action to be taken and the regulating of customs, we think that
   recourse should be had to the practices of the ancient fathers, which
   are best learned from a canon of the council of Toledo, the contents of
   which we have decided to insert here [16 ] :

   Nobody should shout at or in any way disturb the Lord's priests when
   they sit in the place of blessing. Nobody should cause disturbance by
   telling idle stories or jokes or, what is even worse, by stubborn
   disputes. As the apostle says, if anyone thinks himself religious and
   does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, then his religion is
   vain. For, justice loses its reverence when the silence of the court is
   disturbed by a crowd of turbulent people. As the prophet says, the
   reverence due to justice shall be silence. Therefore whatever is being
   debated by the participants, or is being proposed by persons making an
   accusation, should be stated in quiet tones so that the hearers' senses
   are not disturbed by contentious voices and they do not weaken the
   authority of the court by their tumult. Whoever thinks that the
   aforesaid things should not be observed while the council is meeting,
   and disturbs it with noise or dissensions or jests, contrary to the
   things forbidden here, shall leave the assembly, dishonourably stripped
   of the right to attend, according to the precept of the divine law
   (whereby it is commanded: drive out the scoffer, and strife will go out
   with him), and he shall be under sentence of excommunication for three
   days.

   Since it may happen that some of the participants will not be in their
   rightful seats, we decree, with this sacred council's approval, that no
   prejudice shall arise to any church or person as a result of this
   seating arrangement.

   Since certain ministers and officials are required in order that this
   council may proceed, we therefore depute, with this sacred council's
   approval, those named below, namely our beloved sons... [17 ]

SESSION 2 - 2 March 1415

   [John XXIII publicly offers to resign the papacy]

SESSION 3 - 26 March 1415

   [Decrees on the integrity and authority of the council, after the pope
   s flight [18 ]]

   For the honour, praise and glory of the most holy Trinity, Father and
   Son and holy Spirit, and to obtain on earth, for people of good will,
   the peace that was divinely promised in God's church, this holy synod,
   called the sacred general council of Constance, duly assembled here in
   the holy Spirit for the purpose of bringing union and reform to the
   said church in its head and members, discerns declares, defines and
   ordains as follows.

   First, that this synod was and is rightly and properly summoned to this
   city of Constance, and likewise has been rightly and properly begun and
   held.

   Next, that this sacred council has not been dissolved by the departure
   of our lord pope from Constance, or even by the departure of other
   prelates or any other persons, but continues in its integrity and
   authority, even if decrees to the contrary have been made or shall be
   made in the future.

   Next, that this sacred council should not and may not be dissolved
   until the present schism has been entirely removed and until the church
   has been reformed in faith and morals, in head and members.

   Next, that this sacred council may not be transferred to another place,
   except for a reasonable cause, which is to be debated and decided on by
   this sacred council.

   Next, that prelates and other persons who should be present at this
   council may not depart from this place before it has ended, except for
   a reasonable cause which is to be examined by persons who have been, or
   will be, deputed by this sacred council. When the reason has been
   examined and approved, they may depart with the permission of the
   person or persons in authority. When the individual departs, he is
   bound to give his power to others who stay, under penalty of the law,
   as well as to others appointed by this sacred council, and those who
   act to the contrary are to be prosecuted.

SESSION 4 - 30 March 1415

   [Decrees of the council on its authority and integrity, in the
   abbreviated form read out by cardinal Zabarella]

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father and Son and holy
   Spirit Amen. This holy synod of Constance, which is a general council,
   for the eradication of the present schism and for bringing unity and
   reform to God's church in head and members, legitimately assembled in
   the holy Spirit to the praise of almighty God, ordains, defines,
   decrees, discerns and declares as follows, in order that this union and
   reform of God's church may be obtained the more easily, securely,
   fruitfully and freely.

   First, that this synod, legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit,
   constituting a general council, representing the catholic church
   militant, has power immediately from Christ, and that everyone of
   whatever state or dignity, even papal, is bound to obey it in those
   matters which pertain to the faith and the eradication of the said
   schism. [19 ]

   Next, that our most holy lord pope John XXIII may not move or transfer
   the Roman curia and its public offices, or its or their officials, from
   this city to another place, nor directly or indirectly compel the
   persons of the said offices to follow him, without the deliberation and
   consent of the same holy synod; this refers to those officials or
   offices by whose absence the council would probably be dissolved or
   harmed. If he has acted to the contrary in the past, or shall in the
   future, or if he has in the past, is now or shall in the future
   fulminate any processes or mandates or ecclesiastical censures or any
   other penalties against the said officials or any other adherents of
   this council, to the effect that they should follow him then all is
   null and void and in no way are the said processes, censures and
   penalties to be obeyed, inasmuch as they are null and void, and they
   are invalid. The said officials are rather to exercise their offices in
   the said city of Constance, and to carry them out freely as before, as
   long as this holy synod is being held in the said city.

   Next, that all translations of prelates, and depositions of the same,
   or of any other beneficed persons, revocations of commendams and gifts,
   admonitions, ecclesiastical censures, processes, sentences, acts and
   whatever has been or will be done or accomplished by our aforesaid lord
   and his officials or commissaries, from the time of his departure, to
   the injury of the council or its adherents, against the supporters or
   participants of this sacred council, or to the prejudice of them or any
   one of them, in whatever way they may have been or shall be made or
   done, against the will of the persons concerned, are in virtue of the
   law itself null, quashed, invalid and void, and of no effect or moment,
   and the council by its authority quashes, invalidates and annuls them.

   [Next, it was declared and decided that three persons should be chosen
   from each nation who know both the reasons of those wishing to depart
   and the punishments that ought to be inflicted on those departing
   without permission. [20 ]]

   Next, that for the sake of unity new cardinals should not be created.
   Moreover, lest for reasons of deceit or fraud some persons may be said
   to have been made cardinals recently, this sacred council declares that
   those persons are not to be regarded as cardinals who were not publicly
   recognised and held to be such at the time of our lord pope's departure
   from the city of Constance.

SESSION 5 - 6 April 1415

   The famous Haec Sancta decree contradicting Vatican 1 on papal
   primacy/infallibility.

   [Decrees of the council, concerning its authority and integrity, which
   had been abbreviated by cardinal Zabarella at the preceding session,
   against the wishes of the nations, and which are now restored, repeated
   and confirmed by a public decree]

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father and Son and holy
   Spirit. Amen. This holy synod of Constance, which is a general council,
   for the eradication of the present schism and for bringing unity and
   reform to God's church in head and members, legitimately assembled in
   the holy Spirit to the praise of almighty God, ordains, defines,
   decrees, discerns and declares as follows, in order that this union and
   reform of God's church may be obtained the more easily, securely,
   fruitfully and freely.

   First it declares that, legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit,
   constituting a general council and representing the catholic church
   militant, it has power immediately from Christ; and that everyone of
   whatever state or dignity, even papal, is bound to obey it in those
   matters which pertain to the faith, the eradication of the said schism
   and the general reform of the said church of God in head and members.

   Next, it declares that anyone of whatever condition, state or dignity,
   even papal, who contumaciously refuses to obey the past or future
   mandates, statutes, ordinances or precepts of this sacred council or of
   any other legitimately assembled general council, regarding the
   aforesaid things or matters pertaining to them, shall be subjected to
   well-deserved penance, unless he repents, and shall be duly punished,
   even by having recourse, if necessary, to other supports of the law.

   Next, the said holy synod defines and ordains that the lord pope John
   XXIII may not move or transfer the Roman curia and its public offices,
   or its or their officials, from the city of Constance to another place,
   nor directly or indirectly compel the said officials to follow him,
   without the deliberation and consent of the same holy synod. If he has
   acted to the contrary in the past, or shall in the future, or if he has
   in the past, is now or shall in the future fulminate any processes or
   mandates or ecclesiastical censures or any other penalties, against the
   said officials or any other adherents of this sacred council, to the
   effect that they should follow him, then all is null and void and in no
   way are the said processes, censures and penalties to be obeyed,
   inasmuch as they are null and void. The said officials are rather to
   exercise their offices in the said city of Constance, and to carry them
   out freely as before, as long as this holy synod h being held in the
   said City.

   Next, that all translations of prelates, or depositions of the same, or
   of any other beneficed persons, officials and administrators,
   revocations of commendams and gifts, admonitions, ecclesiastical
   censures, processes, sentences and whatever has been or will be done or
   accomplished by the aforesaid lord pope John or his officials or
   commissaries, since the beginning of this council, to the injury of the
   said council or its adherents, against the supporters or participants
   of this sacred council, or to the prejudice of them or of any one of
   them, in whatever way they may have been or shall be made or done,
   against the will of the persons concerned, are by this very fact, on
   the authority of this sacred council, null, quashed, invalid and void,
   and of no effect or moment, and the council by its authority quashes,
   invalidates and annuls them.

   Next, it declares that the lord pope John XXIII and all the prelates
   and other persons summoned to this sacred council, and other
   participants in the same synod, have enjoyed and do now enjoy full
   freedom, as has been apparent in the said sacred council, and the
   opposite has not been brought to the notice of the said summoned
   persons or of the said council. The said sacred council testifies to
   this before God and people. [21 ]

SESSION 6 - 17 April 1415

   [At this session there were, among other minor deliberations, decrees
   about admitting the office of proctor in the matter of pope John
   XXIII's renunciation of the papacy and about the citing of Jerome of
   Prague.]

SESSION 7 - 2 May 1415

   [At this session it was decreed that pope John should be publicly
   summoned and that the summons of Jerome of Prague, now charged with
   contumacy, should be repeated.]

SESSION 8 - 4 May 1415

   This most holy synod of Constance, which is a general council and
   represents the catholic church and is legitimately assembled in the
   holy Spirit, for the eradication of the present schism and the
   elimination of the errors and heresies which are sprouting beneath its
   shade and for the reform of the church, make this perpetual record of
   its acts.

   [Sentence condemning various articles of John Wyclif]

   We learn from the writings and deeds of the holy fathers that the
   catholic faith without which (as the Apostle says) it is impossible to
   please God , has often been attacked by false followers of the same
   faith, or rather by perverse assailants, and by those who, desirous of
   the world's glory, are led on by proud curiosity to know more than they
   should; and that it has been defended against such persons by the
   church's faithful spiritual knights armed with the shield of faith.
   Indeed these kinds of wars were prefigured in the physical wars of the
   Israelite people against idolatrous nations. Therefore in these
   spiritual wars the holy catholic church, illuminated in the truth of
   faith by the rays of light from above and remaining ever spotless
   through the Lord's providence and with the help of the patronage of the
   saints, has triumphed most gloriously over the darkness of error as
   over profligate enemies. In our times, however, that old and jealous
   foe has stirred up new conflicts so that the approved ones of this age
   may be made manifest. Their leader and prince was that
   pseudo-christian John Wyclif. He stubbornly asserted and taught many
   articles against the christian religion and the catholic faith while he
   was alive. We have decided that forty-five of the articles should be
   set out on this page as follows.

   1. The material substance of bread, and similarly the material
   substance of wine, remain in the sacrament of the altar.

   2. The accidents of bread do not remain without their subject in the
   said sacrament.

   3. Christ is not identically and really present in the said sacrament
   in his own bodily persona.

   4. If a bishop or a priest is in mortal sin, he does not ordain or
   confect or consecrate or baptise.

   5. That Christ instituted the mass has no basis in the gospel.

   6. God ought to obey the devil.

   7. If a person is duly contrite, all exterior confession is superfluous
   and useless for him.

   8. If a pope is foreknown as damned and is evil, and is therefore a
   limb of the devil, he does not have authority over the faithful given
   to him by anyone, except perhaps by the emperor.

   9. Nobody should be considered as pope after Urban VI. Rather, people
   should live like the Greeks, under their own laws.

   10. It is against sacred scripture for ecclesiastics to have
   possessions.

   11. No prelate should excommunicate anyone unless he first knows that
   the person has been excommunicated by God; he who does so thereby
   becomes a heretic and an excommunicated person.

   12. A prelate excommunicating a cleric who has appealed to the king or
   the king's council is thereby a traitor to the king and the kingdom.

   13. Those who stop preaching or hearing the word of God on account of
   an excommunication issued by men are themselves excommunicated and will
   be regarded as traitors of Christ on the day of judgment.

   14. It is lawful for any deacon or priest to preach the word of God
   without authorisation from the apostolic see or from a catholic bishop.

   15. Nobody is a civil lord or a prelate or a bishop while he is in
   mortal sin.

   16. Secular lords can confiscate temporal goods from the church at
   their discretion when those who possess them are sinning habitually,
   that is to say sinning from habit and not just in particular acts.

   17. The people can correct sinful lords at their discretion.

   18. Tithes are purely alms, and parishioners can withhold them at will
   on account of their prelates' sins.

   19. Special prayers applied by prelates or religious to a particular
   person avail him or her no more than general prayers, if other things
   are equal.

   20. Whoever gives alms to friars is thereby excommunicated.

   21. Whoever enters any religious order whatsoever, whether it be of the
   possessioners or the mendicants, makes himself less apt and suitable
   for the observance of God's commands.

   22. Saints who have founded religious orders have sinned in so doing.

   23. Members of religious orders are not members of the christian
   religion.

   24. Friars are bound to obtain their food by manual work and not by
   begging. [22 ]

   25. All are simoniacs who bind themselves to pray for people who help
   them in temporal matters.

   26. The prayer of someone foreknown as damned profits nobody.

   27. All things happen from absolute necessity.

   28. Confirming the young, ordaining clerics and consecrating places
   have been reserved to the pope and bishops because of their greed for
   temporal gain and honour.

   29. Universities, places of study, colleges, degrees and academic
   exercises in these institutions were introduced by a vain pagan spirit
   and benefit the church as little as does the devil.

   30. Excommunication by a pope or any prelate is not to be feared since
   it is a censure of antichrist.

   31. Those who found religious houses sin, and those who enter them
   belong to the devil.

   32. It is against Christ's command to enrich the clergy.

   33. Pope Silvester and the emperor Constantine erred in endowing the
   church.

   34. All the members of mendicant orders are heretics, and those who
   give them alms are excommunicated.

   35. Those who enter a religious or other order thereby become incapable
   of observing God's commands, and consequently of reaching the kingdom
   of heaven, unless they leave them.

   36. The pope with all his clerics who have property are heretics, for
   the very reason that they have property; and so are all who abet them,
   namely all secular lords and other laity.

   37. The Roman church is Satan's synagogue; and the pope is not the
   immediate and proximate vicar of Christ and the apostles.

   38. The decretal letters are apocryphal and seduce people from Christ's
   faith, and clerics who study them are fools.

   39. The emperor and secular lords were seduced by the devil to endow
   the church with temporal goods.

   40. The election of a pope by the cardinals was introduced by the
   devil.

   41. It is not necessary for salvation to believe that the Roman church
   is supreme among the other churches. [23 ]

   42. It is ridiculous to believe in the indulgences of popes and
   bishops.

   43. Oaths taken to confirm civil commerce and contracts between people
   are unlawful.

   44. Augustine, Benedict and Bernard are damned, unless they repented of
   having owned property and of having founded and entered religious
   orders; and thus they are all heretics from the pope down to the lowest
   religious.

   45. All religious orders alike were introduced by the devil.

   [Condemnation of Wyclif's books]

   This same John Wyclif wrote books called by
   him Dialogus and Trialogus and many other treatises, works and
   pamphlets in which he included and taught the above and many other
   damnable articles. He issued the books for public reading, in order to
   publish his perverse doctrine, and from them have followed many
   scandals, losses and dangers to souls in various regions, especially in
   the kingdoms of England and Bohemia. Masters and doctors of the
   universities and houses of study at Oxford and Prague, opposing with
   God's strength these articles and books, later refuted the above
   articles in scholastic form. They were condemned, moreover, by the most
   reverend fathers who were then the archbishops and bishops of
   Canterbury, York and Prague, legates of the apostolic see in the
   kingdoms of England and of Bohemia. The said archbishop of Prague,
   commissary of the apostolic see in this matter, also judicially decreed
   that the books of the same John Wyclif were to be burnt and he forbade
   the reading of those that survived.

   After these things had again been brought to the notice of the
   apostolic see and a general council, the Roman pontiff condemned the
   said books, treatises and pamphlets at the lately held council of Rome
   [24 ] , ordering them to be publicly burnt and strictly forbidding
   anyone called a Christian to dare to read, expound, hold or make any
   use of any one or more of the said books, volumes, treatises and
   pamphlets, or even to cite them publicly or privately, except in order
   to refute them. In order that this dangerous and most foul doctrine
   might be eliminated from the church's midst, he ordered, by his
   apostolic authority and under pain of ecclesiastical censure, that all
   such books, treatises, volumes and pamphlets should be diligently
   sought out by the local ordinaries and should then be publicly burnt;
   and he added that if necessary those who do not obey should be
   proceeded against as if they were promoters of heresy.

   This sacred synod has had the aforesaid forty-five articles examined
   and frequently considered by many most reverend fathers, cardinals of
   the Roman church, bishops, abbots, masters of theology, doctors in both
   laws and many notable persons. After the articles had been examined it
   was found, as indeed is the case, that some of them, indeed many, were
   and are notoriously heretical and have already been condemned by holy
   fathers, others are not catholic but erroneous, others scandalous and
   blasphemous, some offensive to the ears of the devout and some rash and
   seditious. It was also found that his books contain many other similar
   articles and introduce into God's church teaching that is unsound and
   hostile to faith and morals. This holy synod, therefore, in the name of
   our lord Jesus Christ, in ratifying and approving the sentences of the
   aforesaid archbishops and of the council of Rome, repudiates and
   condemns for ever, by this decree, the aforesaid articles and each one
   of them in particular, and the books of John Wyclif called by him
   Dialogus and Trialogus, and the same author's other books, volumes,
   treatises and pamphlets (no matter what name these may go under, and
   for which purpose this description is to be regarded as an adequate
   listing of them). It forbids the reading, teaching, expounding and
   citing of the said books or of any one of them in particular, unless it
   is for the purpose of refuting them. It forbids each and every Catholic
   henceforth, under pain of anathema, to preach, teach or affirm in
   public the said articles or any one of them in particular, or to teach,
   approve or hold the said books, or to refer to them in any way, unless
   this is done, as has been said, for the purpose of refuting them. It
   orders, moreover, that the aforesaid books, treatises, volumes and
   pamphlets are to be burnt in public, in accordance with the decree of
   the synod of Rome, as stated above. This holy synod orders local
   ordinaries to attend with vigilance to the execution and due observance
   of these things, insofar as each one is responsible, in accordance with
   the law and canonical sanctions.

   [Condemnation of 260 other articles of Wyclif] [25 ]

   When the doctors and masters of the university of Oxford examined the
   aforesaid written works, they found 260 articles in addition to the 45
   articles that have been mentioned. Some of them coincide in meaning
   with the 45 articles, even if not in the forms of words used. Some of
   them, as has been said, were and are heretical, some seditious, some
   erroneous, others rash, some scandalous, others unsound, and almost all
   of them contrary to good morals and the catholic truth. They were
   therefore condemned by the said university in correct and scholastic
   form. This most holy synod, therefore, after deliberating as mentioned
   above, repudiates and condemns the said articles and each one of them
   in particular; and it forbids, commands and decrees in the same way as
   for the other 45 articles. We order the contents of these 260 articles
   to be included below [26 ] .

   [The council pronounces John Wyclif a heretic, condemns his memory and
   orders his bones to be exhumed]

   Furthermore, a process was begun, on the authority or by decree of the
   Roman council, and at the command of the church and of the apostolic
   see, after a due interval of time, for the condemnation of the said
   Wyclif and his memory. Invitations and proclamations were issued
   summoning those who wished to defend him and his memory, if any still
   existed. However, nobody appeared who was willing to defend him or his
   memory. Witnesses were examined by commissaries appointed by the
   reigning lord pope John and by this sacred council, regarding the said
   Wyclif's final impenitence and obstinacy. Legal proof was thus
   provided, in accordance with all due observances, as the order of law
   demands in a matter of this kind, regarding his impenitence and final
   obstinacy. This was proved by clear indications from legitimate
   witnesses. This holy synod, therefore, at the instance of the
   procurator-fiscal and since a decree was issued to the effect that
   sentence should be heard on this day, declares, defines and decrees
   that the said John Wyclif was a notorious and obstinate heretic who
   died in heresy, and it anathematises him and condemns his memory. It
   decrees and orders that his body and bones are to be exhumed, if they
   can be identified among the corpses of the faithful, and to be
   scattered far from a burial place of the church, in accordance with
   canonical and lawful sanctions.

SESSION 9 - 13 May 1415

   [Pope John is publicly summoned for the second time and an inquiry
   against him is decreed.]

SESSION 10 - 14 May 1415

   [John XXIII is summoned for the third time, he is accused of contumacy
   and is suspended from the papacy.]

SESSION 11 - 25 May 1415

   [Pope John XXIII is publicly charged and forty-four articles against
   him are produced.]

SESSION 12 - 29 May 1415

   [Decree stating that the process for electing a pope, if the see
   happens to be vacant, may not begin without the council's express
   consent [27 ] ]

   This most holy general synod of Constance, representing the catholic
   church, legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit, for the eradication
   of the present schism and errors, for bringing about the reform of the
   church in head and members, and in order that the unity of the church
   may be obtained more easily, quickly and freely, pronounces,
   determines, decrees and ordains that if it happens that the apostolic
   see becomes vacant, by whatever means this may happen, then the process
   of electing the next supreme pontiff may not begin without the
   deliberation and consent of this sacred general council. If the
   contrary is done then it is by this very fact, by the authority of the
   said sacred council, null and void. Nobody may accept anyone elected to
   the papacy in defiance of this decree, nor in any way adhere to or obey
   him as pope, under pain of eternal damnation and of becoming a
   supporter of the said schism. Those who make the election in such a
   case, as well as the person elected, if he consents, and those who
   adhere to him, are to be punished in the forms prescribed by this
   sacred council. The said holy synod, moreover, for the good of the
   church's unity, suspends all positive laws, even those promulgated in
   general councils, and their statutes, ordinances, customs and
   privileges, by whomsoever they may have been granted, and penalties
   promulgated against any persons, insofar as these may in any way impede
   the effect of this decree.

   [Sentence deposing pope John XXIII]

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father and Son and holy
   Spirit Amen. This most holy general synod of Constance, legitimately
   assembled in the holy Spirit, having invoked Christ's name and holding
   God alone before its eyes, having seen the articles drawn up and
   presented in this case against the lord pope John XXIII, the proofs
   brought forward, his spontaneous submission and the whole process of
   the case, and having deliberated maturely on them, pronounces, decrees
   and declares by this definitive sentence which it commits to writing:
   that the departure of the aforesaid lord pope John XXIII from this city
   of Constance and from this sacred general council, secretly and at a
   suspicious hour of the night, in disguised and indecent dress, was and
   is unlawful, notoriously scandalous to God's church and to this
   council, disturbing and damaging for the church's peace and unity,
   supportive of this long-standing schism, and at variance with the vow,
   promise and oath made by the said lord pope John to God, to the church
   and to this sacred council; that the said lord pope John has been and
   is a notorious simoniac, a notorious destroyer of the goods and rights
   not only of the Roman church but also of other churches and of many
   pious places, and an evil administrator and dispenser of the church's
   spiritualities and temporalities; that he has notoriously scandalised
   God's church and the christian people by his detestable and dishonest
   life and morals, both before his promotion to the papacy and afterwards
   until the present time, that by the above he has scandalised and is
   scandalising in a notorious fashion God's church and the christian
   people; that after due and charitable warnings, frequently reiterated
   to him, he obstinately persevered in the aforesaid evils and thereby
   rendered himself notoriously incorrigible; and that on account of the
   above and other crimes drawn from and contained in the said process
   against him, he should be deprived of and deposed from, as an unworthy,
   useless and damnable person, the papacy and all its spiritual and
   temporal administration. The said holy synod does now remove, deprive
   and depose him. It declares each and every Christian, of whatever
   state, dignity or condition, to be absolved from obedience, fidelity
   and oaths to him. It forbids all Christians henceforth to recognise him
   as pope, now that as mentioned he has been deposed from the papacy, or
   to call him pope, or to adhere to or in any way to obey him as pope.
   The said holy synod, moreover, from certain knowledge and its fullness
   of power, supplies for all and singular defects that may have occurred
   in the above-mentioned procedures or in any one of them. It condemns
   the said person, by this same sentence, to stay and remain in a good
   and suitable place, in the name of this sacred general council, in the
   safe custody of the most serene prince lord Sigismund, king of the
   Romans and of Hungary, etc., and most devoted advocate and defender of
   the universal church, as long as it seems to the said general council
   to be for the good of the unity of God's church that he should be so
   condemned. The said council reserves the right to declare and inflict
   other punishments that should be imposed for the said crimes and faults
   in accordance with canonical sanctions, according as the rigour of
   justice or the counsel of mercy may advise.

   [Decree to the effect that none of the three contenders for the papacy
   may be re-elected as pope]

   The said holy synod decrees, determines and ordains for the good of
   unity in God's church that neither the lord Baldassare de Cossa,
   recently John XXIII, nor Angelo Correr nor Peter de Luna,
   called Gregory XII and Benedict XIII by their respective obediences,
   shall ever be re-elected as pope. If the contrary happens, it is by
   this very fact null and void. Nobody, of whatever dignity or
   pre-eminence even if he be emperor, king, cardinal or pontiff, may ever
   adhere to or obey them or any one of them, contrary to this decree,
   under pain of eternal damnation and of being a supporter of the said
   schism. Let those who presume to the contrary, if there are any in the
   future, also be firmly proceeded against in other ways, even by
   invoking the secular arm. [28 ]

SESSION 13 - 15 June 1415

   [Condemnation of communion under both kinds, recently revived among the
   Bohemians by Jakoubek of Stribro]

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father and Son and holy
   Spirit, Amen. Certain people, in some parts of the world, have rashly
   dared to assert that the christian people ought to receive the holy
   sacrament of the eucharist under the forms of both bread and wine. They
   communicate the laity everywhere not only under the form of bread but
   also under that of wine, and they stubbornly assert that they should
   communicate even after a meal, or else without the need of a fast,
   contrary to the church's custom which has been laudably and sensibly
   approved, from the church's head downwards, but which they damnably try
   to repudiate as sacrilegious. Therefore this present general council of
   Constance, legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit, wishing to
   provide for the safety of the faithful against this error, after long
   deliberation by many persons learned in divine and human law, declares,
   decrees and defines that, although Christ instituted this venerable
   sacrament after a meal and ministered it to his apostles under the
   forms of both bread and wine, nevertheless and notwithstanding this,
   the praiseworthy authority of the sacred canons and the approved custom
   of the church have and do retain that this sacrament ought not to be
   celebrated after a meal nor received by the faithful without fasting,
   except in cases of sickness or some other necessity as permitted by law
   or by the church. Moreover, just as this custom was sensibly introduced
   in order to avoid various dangers and scandals, so with similar or even
   greater reason was it possible to introduce and sensibly observe the
   custom that, although this sacrament was received by the faithful under
   both kinds in the early church, nevertheless later it was received
   under both kinds only by those confecting it, and by the laity only
   under the form of bread. For it should be very firmly believed, and in
   no way doubted, that the whole body and blood of Christ are truly
   contained under both the form of bread and the form of wine. Therefore,
   since this custom was introduced for good reasons by the church and
   holy fathers, and has been observed for a very long time, it should be
   held as a law which nobody may repudiate or alter at will without the
   church's permission. To say that the observance of this custom or law
   is sacrilegious or illicit must be regarded as erroneous. Those who
   stubbornly assert the opposite of the aforesaid are to be confined as
   heretics and severely punished by the local bishops or their officials
   or the inquisitors of heresy in the kingdoms or provinces in which
   anything is attempted or presumed against this decree, according to the
   canonical and legitimate sanctions that have been wisely established in
   favour of the catholic faith against heretics and their supporters.

   [That no priest, under pain of excommunication, may communicate the
   people under the forms of both bread and wine]

   This holy synod also decrees and declares, regarding this matter, that
   instructions are to be sent to the most reverend fathers and lords in
   Christ, patriarchs, primates, archbishops, bishops, and their vicars in
   spirituals, wherever they may be, in which they are to be commissioned
   and ordered on the authority of this sacred council and under pain of
   excommunication, to punish effectively those who err against this
   decree. They may receive back into the church's fold those who have
   gone astray by communicating the people under the forms of both bread
   and wine, and have taught this, provided they repent and after a
   salutary penance, in accordance with the measure of their fault, has
   been enjoined upon them. They are to repress as heretics, however, by
   means of the church's censures and even if necessary by calling in the
   help of the secular arm, those of them whose hearts have become
   hardened and who are unwilling to return to penance.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   From this point on the council becomes a duly convened ecumenical
   council, all previous sessions being ultra-vires.

SESSION 14 - 4 July 1415

   [29 ]

   [Uniting of the followers of pope Gregory XII and of the former pope
   John XXIII, now that both men have abdicated]

   In order that the reunion of the church may be possible and that a
   beginning may be made which is fitting and pleasing to God, since the
   most important part of any matter is its beginning, and in order that
   the two obediences--namely the one claiming that the lord John XXIII
   was formerly pope and the other claiming that the lord Gregory XII is
   pope--may be united together under Christ as head, this most holy
   general synod of Constance, legitimately assembled in the holy Spirit
   and representing the catholic church, accepts in all matters
   the convoking, authorising, approving and confirming that is now being
   made in the name of the lord who is called Gregory XII by those
   obedient to him, insofar as it seems to pertain to him to do this,
   since the certainty obtained by taking a precaution harms nobody and
   benefits all, and it decrees and declares that the aforesaid two
   obediences are joined and united in the one body of our lord Jesus
   Christ and of this sacred universal general council, in the name of the
   Father and of the Son and of the holy Spirit.

   [Decree stating that the election of the Roman pontiff is to be made in
   the manner and form to be laid down by the sacred council, and that the
   council shall not be dissolved until the election of the next Roman
   pontiff has been made]

   The most holy general synod of Constance, etc., enacts, pronounces,
   ordains and decrees, in order that God's holy church may be provided
   for better, more genuinely and more securely, that the next election of
   the future Roman pontiff is to be made in the manner, form, place, time
   and way that shall be decided upon by the sacred council; that the same
   council can and may henceforth declare fit, accept and designate, in
   the manner and form that then seems suitable, any persons for the
   purposes of this election, whether by active or by passive voice, of
   whatever state or obedience they are or may have been, and any other
   ecclesiastical acts and all other suitable things, notwithstanding any
   proceedings, penalties or sentences; and that the sacred council shall
   not be dissolved until the said election has been held. The said holy
   synod therefore exhorts and requires the most victorious prince lord
   Sigismund, king of the Romans and of Hungary, as the church's devoted
   advocate and as the sacred council's defender and protector, to direct
   all his efforts to this end and to promise on his royal word that he
   wishes to do this and to order letters of his majesty to be made out
   for this purpose.

   [The council approves Gregory XII's resignation]

   The most holy general synod of Constance, legitimately assembled in the
   holy Spirit, representing the universal catholic church, accepts,
   approves and commends, in the name of the Father, the Son and the holy
   Spirit, the cession renunciation and resignation made on behalf of the
   lord who was called Gregory XII in his obedience, by the magnificent
   and powerful lord Charles Malatesta. here present, his irrevocable
   procurator for this business, of the right, title and possession that
   he had, or may have had, in regard to the papacy. [30 ]

SESSION 15 - 6 July 1415

   [Sentence condemning 260 articles Wyclif] [31 ]

   The books and pamphlets of John Wyclif, of cursed memory, were
   carefully examined by the doctors and masters of Oxford university.
   They collected 260 unacceptable articles from these books and pamphlets
   and condemned them in scholastic form. This most holy general synod of
   Constance, representing the catholic church, legitimately assembled in
   the holy Spirit for the purpose of extirpating schism, errors and
   heresies, has had all these articles examined many times by many most
   reverend fathers, cardinals of the Roman church, bishops, abbots,
   masters of theology, doctors of both laws, and very many other notable
   persons from various universities. It was found that some, indeed many,
   of the articles thus examined were and are notoriously heretical and
   have already been condemned by holy fathers, some are offensive to the
   ears of the devout and some are rash and seditious. This holy synod,
   therefore, in the name of our lord Jesus Christ, repudiates and
   condemns, by this perpetual decree, the aforesaid articles and each one
   of them in particular; and it forbids each and every Catholic
   henceforth, under pain of anathema, to preach, teach, or hold the said
   articles or any one of them. The said holy synod orders local
   ordinaries and inquisitors of heresy to be vigilant in carrying out
   these things and duly observing them, insofar as each one is
   responsible, in accordance with the law and canonical sanctions. Let
   anyone who rashly violates the aforesaid decrees and sentences of this
   sacred council be punished, after due warning, by the local ordinaries
   on the authority of this sacred council, notwithstanding any privilege.
   [32 ]

   [Articles of John Wyclif selected from the 260]

   1. Just as Christ is God and man at the same time, so the consecrated
   host is at the same time the body of Christ and true bread. For it is
   Christ's body at least in figure and true bread in nature; or, which
   comes to the same thing, it is true bread naturally and Christ's body
   figuratively.

   2. Since heretical falsehood about the consecrated host is the most
   important point in individual heresies, I therefore declare to modern
   heretics, in order that this falsehood may be eradicated from the
   church, that they cannot explain or understand an accident without a
   subject. And therefore all these heretical sects belong to the number
   of those who ignore the fourth chapter of John: We worship what we
   know.

   3. I boldly foretell to all these sects and their accomplices that even
   by the time Christ and all the church triumphant come at the final
   judgment riding at the trumpet blast of the angel Gabriel, they shall
   still not have proved to the faithful that the sacrament is an accident
   without a subject.

   4. Just as John was Elias in a figurative sense and not in person, so
   the bread on the altar is Christ's body in a figurative sense. And the
   words, This is my body, are unambiguously figurative, just like the
   statement "John is Elias".

   5. The fruit of this madness whereby it is pretended that there can be
   an accident without a subject is to blaspheme against God, to
   scandalise the saints and to deceive the church by means of false
   doctrines about accidents.

   6. Those who claim that the children of the faithful dying without
   sacramental baptism will not be saved, are stupid and presumptuous in
   saying this.

   7. The slight and short confirmation by bishops, with whatever extra
   solemnised rites, was introduced at the devil's suggestion so that the
   people might be deluded in the church's faith and the solemnity and
   necessity of bishops might be believed in the more.

   8. As for the oil with which bishops anoint boys and the linen cloth
   which goes around the head, it seems that this is a trivial rite which
   is unfounded in scripture; and that this confirmation, which was
   introduced after the apostles, blasphemes against God.

   9. Oral confession to a priest, introduced by Innocent [33 ] , is not
   as necessary to people as he claimed. For if anyone offends his brother
   in thought, word or deed, then it suffices to repent in thought, word
   or deed.

   10. It is a grave and unsupported practice for a priest to hear the
   confessions of the people in the way that the Latins use.

   11. In these words, You are clean, but not all are, the devil has laid
   a snare of the unfaithful ones in order to catch the Christian's foot.
   For he introduced private confession, which cannot be justified, and
   after the person's malice has been revealed to the confessor, as he
   decreed in the law, it is not revealed to the people.

   12. It is a probable conjecture that a person who lives rightly is a
   deacon or a priest. For just as I infer that this person is John, so I
   recognise by a probable conjecture that this person, by his holy life,
   has been placed by God in such an office or state.

   13. The probable evidence for such a state is to be taken from proof
   provided by the person's deeds and not from the testimony of the person
   ordaining him. For God can place someone in such a state without the
   need of an instrument of this kind, no matter whether the instrument is
   worthy or unworthy. There is no more probable evidence than the
   person's life. Therefore if there is present a holy life and catholic
   doctrine, this suffices for the church militant. (Error at the
   beginning and at the end.)

   14. The bad life of a prelate means that his subjects do not receive
   orders and the other sacraments. They can receive them from such
   persons, however, when there is urgent need, if they devoutly beseech
   God to supply on behalf of his diabolical ministers the actions and
   purpose of the office to which they have bound themselves by oath.

   15. People of former times would copulate with each other out of desire
   for temporal gain or for mutual help or to relieve concupiscence, even
   when they had no hope of offspring; for they were truly copulating as
   married persons. [34 ]

   16. The words, I will take you as wife, are more suitable for the
   marriage contract than, I take you as wife. And the first words ought
   not to be annulled by the second words about the present, when someone
   contracts with one wife in the words referring to the future and
   afterwards with another wife in those referring to the present.

   17. The pope, who falsely calls himself the servant of God's servants,
   has no status in the work of the gospel but only in the work of the
   world. If he has any rank, it is in the order of demons, of those who
   serve God rather in a blameworthy way.

   18. The pope does not dispense from simony or from a rash vow, since he
   is the chief simoniac who rashly vows to preserve, to his damnation,
   his status here on the way. (Error at the end.)

   19. That the pope is supreme pontiff is ridiculous. Christ approved
   such a dignity neither in Peter nor in anyone else.

   20. The pope is antichrist made manifest. Not only this particular
   person but also the multitude of popes, from the time of the endowment
   of the church, of cardinals, of bishops and of their other accomplices,
   make up the composite, monstrous person of antichrist. This is not
   altered by the fact that Gregory and other popes, who did many good and
   fruitful things in their lives, finally repented.

   21. Peter and Clement, together with the other helpers in the faith,
   were not popes but God's helpers in the work of building up the church
   of our lord Jesus Christ.

   22. To say that papal pre-eminence originated with the faith of the
   gospel is as false as to say that every error arose from the original
   truth.

   23. There are twelve procurators and disciples of antichrist: the pope,
   cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, archdeacons, officials,
   deans, monks, canons with their two-peaked hats, the recently
   introduced pseudo-friars, and pardoners.

   24. It is clear that whoever is the humbler, of greater service to the
   church, and the more fervent in Christ's love towards his church, is
   the greater in the church militant and to be reckoned the most
   immediate vicar of Christ.

   25. Whoever holds any of God's goods unjustly, is taking the things of
   others by rapine, theft or robbery.

   26. Neither the depositions of witnesses, nor a judge's sentence, nor
   physical possession, nor inheritance, nor an exchange between persons,
   nor a gift, nor all such things taken together, confer dominion or a
   right to anything upon a person without grace. (An error, if it is
   understood as referring to sanctifying grace.)

   27. Unless the interior law of charity is present, nobody has more or
   less authority or righteousness on account of charters or bulls. We
   ought not to lend or give anything to a sinner so long as we know that
   he is such, for thus we would be assisting a traitor of our God.

   28. Just as a prince or a lord does not keep the title of his office
   while he is in mortal sin, except in name and equivocally, so it is
   with a pope, bishop or priest while he has fallen into mortal sin.

   29. Everyone habitually in mortal sin lacks dominion of any kind and
   the licit use of an action, even if it be good in its kind.

   30. It is known from the principles of the faith that a person in
   mortal sin, sins mortally in every action.

   31. In order to have true secular dominion, the lord must be in a state
   of righteousness. Therefore nobody in mortal sin is lord of anything.

   32. All modern religious necessarily become marked as hypocrites. For
   their profession demands that they fast, act and clothe themselves in a
   particular way, and thus they observe everything differently from other
   people.

   33. All private religion as such savours of imperfection and sin
   whereby a person is indisposed to serve God freely.

   34. A private religious order or rule savours of a blasphemous and
   arrogant presumption towards God. And the religious of such orders dare
   to exalt themselves above the apostles by the hypocrisy of defending
   their religion.

   35. Christ does not teach in scripture about any kind of religious
   order in antichrist's chapter. Therefore it is not his good pleasure
   that there should be such orders. The chapter is composed, however, of
   the following twelve types: the pope, cardinals, patriarchs,
   archbishops, bishops, archdeacons, officials, deans, monks, canons,
   friars of the four orders, and pardoners.

   36. I infer as evident from the faith and works of the four
   sects--which are the caesarean clergy, the various monks, the various
   canons, and the friars-that nobody belonging to them is a member of
   Christ in the catalogue of the saints, unless he forsakes in the end
   the sect which he stupidly embraced.

   37. Paul was once a pharisee but abandoned the sect for the better sect
   of Christ, with his permission. This is the reason why cloistered
   persons, of whatever sect or rule, or by whatever stupid vow they may
   be bound, ought freely to cast off these chains, at Christ's command,
   and freely join the sect of Christ.

   38. It is sufficient for the laity that at some times they give tithes
   of their produce to God's servants. In this way they are always giving
   to the church, even if not always to the caesarean clergy deputed by
   the pope or by his dependents.

   39. The powers that are claimed by the pope and the other four new
   sects are pretended and were diabolically introduced in order to seduce
   subjects; such are excommunications by caesarean prelates, citations,
   imprisoning, and the sale of money rents.

   40. Many simple priests surpass prelates in such power. Indeed, it
   appears to the faithful that greatness of spiritual power belongs more
   to a son who imitates Christ in his way of life than to a prelate who
   has been elected by cardinals and similar apostates.

   41. The people may withhold tithes, offerings and other private alms
   from unworthy disciples of Christ, since God's law requires this. The
   curse or censure imposed by antichrist's disciples is not to be feared
   but rather is to be received with joy. The lord pope and bishops and
   all religious or simple clerics, with titles to perpetual possession,
   ought to renounce them into the hands of the secular arm. If they
   stubbornly refuse, they ought to be compelled to do so by the secular
   lords.

   42. There is no greater heretic or antichrist than the cleric who
   teaches that it is lawful for priests and levites of the law of grace
   to be endowed with temporal possessions. The clerics who teach this are
   heretics or blasphemers if ever there were any.

   43. Temporal lords not only can take away goods of fortune from a
   church that is habitually sinning, nor is it only lawful for them to do
   so, but indeed they are obliged to do so under pain of eternal
   damnation.

   44. God does not approve that anyone be judged or condemned by civil
   law.

   45. If an objection is made against those who oppose endowments for the
   church, by pointing to Benedict, Gregory and Bernard, who possessed few
   temporal goods in poverty, it may be said in reply that they repented
   at the end. If you object further that I merely pretend that these
   saints finally repented of their falling away from God's law in this
   way, then you may teach that they are saints and I will teach that they
   repented at the end.

   46. If we ought to believe in sacred scripture and in reason, it is
   clear that Christ's disciples do not have the authority to exact
   temporal goods by means of censures, and those who attempt this are
   sons of Eli and of Belial.

   47. Each essence has one suppositum, following which another
   suppositum, equal to the first, is produced. This is the most perfect
   immanent action possible to nature.

   48. Each essence, whether corporeal or incorporeal, is common to three
   supposita; and the properties, the accidents and the operations inhere
   in common in all of them.

   49. God cannot annihilate anything, nor increase or diminish the world,
   but he can create souls up to a certain number, and not beyond it.

   50. It is impossible for two corporeal substances to be co-extensive,
   the one continuously at rest in a place and the other continuously
   penetrating the body of Christ at rest.

   51. Any continuous mathematical line is composed of two, three or four
   contiguous points, or of only a simply finite number of points; and
   time is, was and will be composed of contiguous instants. It is not
   possible that time and a line, if they exist, are composed of in this
   way. (The first part is a philosophical error, the last part is an
   error with regard to God's power.)

   52. It must be supposed that one corporeal substance was formed at its
   beginning as composed of indivisibles, and that it occupies every
   possible place.

   53. Every person is God.

   54. Every creature is God.

   55. Every being is everywhere, since every being is God.

   56. All things that happen, happen from absolute necessity.

   57. A baptised child foreknown as damned will necessarily live long
   enough to sin in the holy Spirit, wherefore it will merit to be
   condemned for ever. Thus no fire can burn the child until that time or
   instant.

   58. I assert as a matter of faith that everything that will happen,
   will happen of necessity. Thus if Paul is foreknown as damned, he
   cannot truly repent; that is, he cannot cancel the sin of final
   impenitence by contrition, or be under the obligation not to have the
   sin.

   [Sentence against John Hus]

   The most holy general council of Constance, divinely assembled and
   representing the catholic church, for an everlasting record. Since a
   bad tree is wont to bear bad fruit, as truth itself testifies, so it is
   that John Wyclif, of cursed memory, by his deadly teaching, like a
   poisonous root, has brought forth many noxious sons, not in Christ
   Jesus through the gospel, as once the holy fathers brought forth
   faithful sons, but rather contrary to the saving faith of Christ, and
   he has left these sons as successors to his perverse teaching. This
   holy synod of Constance is compelled to act against these men as
   against spurious and illegitimate sons, and to cut away their errors
   from the Lord's field as if they were harmful briars, by means of
   vigilant care and the knife of ecclesiastical authority, lest they
   spread as a cancer to destroy others. Although, therefore, it was
   decreed at the sacred general council recently held at Rome [35 ] that
   the teaching of John Wyclif, of cursed memory, should be condemned and
   the books of his containing this teaching should be burnt as heretical;
   although his teaching was in fact condemned and his books burnt as
   containing false and dangerous doctrine; and although a decree of this
   kind was approved by the authority of this present sacred council [36 ]
   ; nevertheless a certain John Hus, here present in person at this
   sacred council, who is a disciple not of Christ but rather of the
   heresiarch John Wyclif, boldly and rashly contravening the condemnation
   and the decree after their enactment, has taught, asserted and preached
   many errors and heresies of John Wyclif which have been condemned both
   by God's church and by other reverend fathers in Christ, lord
   archbishops and bishops of various kingdoms, and masters in theology at
   many places of study. He has done this especially by publicly resisting
   in the schools and in sermons, together with his accomplices, the
   condemnation in scholastic form of the said articles of John Wyclif
   which has been made many times at the university of Prague, and he has
   declared the said John Wyclif to be a catholic man and an evangelical
   doctor, thus supporting his teaching, before a multitude of clergy and
   people. He has asserted and published certain articles listed below and
   many others, which are condemned and which are, as is well known,
   contained in the books and pamphlets of the said John Hus. Full
   information has been obtained about the aforesaid matters, and there
   has been careful deliberation by the most reverend fathers in Christ,
   lord cardinals of the holy Roman church, patriarchs archbishops,
   bishops and other prelates and doctors of holy scripture and of both
   laws, in large numbers. This most holy synod of Constance therefore
   declares and defines that the articles listed below, which have been
   found on examination, by many masters in sacred scripture, to be
   contained in his books and pamphlets written in his own hand, and which
   the same John Hus at a public hearing, before the fathers and prelates
   of this sacred council, has confessed to be contained in his books and
   pamphlets, are not catholic and should not be taught to be such but
   rather many of them are erroneous, others scandalous, others offensive
   to the ears of the devout, many of them are rash and seditious, and
   some of them are notoriously heretical and have long ago been rejected
   and condemned by holy fathers and by general councils, and it strictly
   forbids them to be preached, taught or in any way approved. Moreover,
   since the articles listed below are explicitly contained in his books
   or treatises, namely in the book entitled De ecclesia and in his other
   pamphlets, this most holy synod therefore reproves and condemns the
   aforesaid books and his teaching, as well as the other treatises and
   pamphlets written by him in Latin or in Czech, or translated by one or
   more other persons into any other language, and it decrees and
   determines that they should be publicly and solemnly burnt in the
   presence of the clergy and people in the city of Constance and
   elsewhere. On account of the above, moreover, all his teaching is and
   shall be deservedly suspect regarding the faith and is to be avoided by
   all of Christ's faithful. In order that this pernicious teaching may be
   eliminated from the midst of the church, this holy synod also orders
   that local ordinaries make careful inquiry about treatises and
   pamphlets of this kind, using the church's censures and even if
   necessary the punishment due for supporting heresy, and that they be
   publicly burnt when they have been found. This same holy synod decrees
   that local ordinaries and inquisitors of heresy are to proceed against
   any who violate or defy this sentence and decree as if they were
   persons suspected of heresy.

   [Sentence of degradation against J. Hus]

   Moreover, the acts and deliberations of the inquiry into heresy against
   the aforesaid John Hus have been examined. There was first a faithful
   and full account made by the commissioners deputed for the case and by
   other masters of theology and doctors of both laws, concerning the acts
   and deliberations and the depositions of very many trustworthy
   witnesses. These depositions were openly and publicly read out to the
   said John Hus before the fathers and prelates of this sacred council.
   It is very clearly established from the depositions of these witnesses
   that the said John has taught many evil, scandalous and seditious
   things, and dangerous heresies, and has publicly preached them during
   many years. This most holy synod of Constance, invoking Christ's name
   and having God alone before its eyes, therefore pronounces, decrees
   and defines by this definitive sentence, which is here written down,
   that the said John Hus was and is a true and manifest heretic and has
   taught and publicly preached, to the great offence of the divine
   Majesty, to the scandal of the universal church and to the detriment of
   the catholic faith, errors and heresies that have long ago been
   condemned by God's church and many things that are scandalous,
   offensive to the ears of the devout, rash and seditious, and that he
   has even despised the keys of the church and ecclesiastical censures.
   He has persisted in these things for many years with a hardened heart.
   He has greatly scandalised Christ's faithful by his obstinacy since,
   bypassing the church's intermediaries, he has made appeal directly to
   our lord Jesus Christ, as to the supreme judge, in which he has
   introduced many false, harmful and scandalous things to the contempt of
   the apostolic see, ecclesiastical censures and the keys. This holy
   synod therefore pronounces the said John Hus, on account of the
   aforesaid and many other matters, to have been a heretic and it judges
   him to be considered and condemned as a heretic, and it hereby condemns
   him. It rejects the said appeal of his as harmful and scandalous and
   offensive to the church's jurisdiction. It declares that the said John
   Hus seduced the christian people, especially in the kingdom of Bohemia,
   in his public sermons and in his writings; and that he was not a true
   preacher of Christ's gospel to the same christian people, according to
   the exposition of the holy doctors, but rather was a seducer. Since
   this most holy synod has learnt from what it has seen and heard, that
   the said John Hus is obstinate and incorrigible and as such does not
   desire to return to the bosom of holy mother the church, and is
   unwilling to abjure the heresies and errors which he has publicly
   defended and preached, this holy synod of Constance therefore declares
   and decrees that the same John Hus is to be deposed and degraded from
   the order of the priesthood and from the other orders held by him. It
   charges the reverend fathers in Christ, the archbishop of Milan and the
   bishops of Feltre Asti, Alessandria, Bangor and Lavour with duly
   carrying out the degradation in the presence of this most holy synod,
   in accordance with the procedure required by law.

   [Sentence condemning J. Hus to the stake]

   This holy synod of Constance, seeing that God's church has nothing more
   that it can do, relinquishes John Hus to the judgment of the secular
   authority and decrees that he is to be relinquished to the secular
   court.

   [Condemned articles of J. Hus]

   1. There is only one holy universal church, which is the total number
   of those predestined to salvation. It therefore follows that the
   universal holy church is only one, inasmuch as there is only one number
   of all those who are predestined to salvation.

   2. Paul was never a member of the devil, even though he did certain
   acts which are similar to the acts of the church's enemies.

   3. Those foreknown as damned are not parts of the church, for no part
   of the church can finally fall away from it, since the predestinating
   love that binds the church together does not fail.

   4. The two natures, the divinity and the humanity, are one Christ.

   5. A person foreknown to damnation is never part of the holy church,
   even if he is in a state of grace according to present justice; a
   person predestined to salvation always remains a member of the church,
   even though he may fall away for a time from adventitious grace, for he
   keeps the grace of predestination.

   6. The church is an article of faith in the following sense: to regard
   it as the convocation of those predestined to salvation, whether or not
   it be in a state of grace according to present justice.

   7. Peter neither was nor is the head of the holy catholic church.

   8. Priests who live in vice in any way pollute the power of the
   priesthood, and like unfaithful sons are untrustworthy in their
   thinking about the church's seven sacraments, about the keys, offices,
   censures, customs, ceremonies and sacred things of the church, about
   the veneration of relics, and about indulgences and orders.

   9. The papal dignity originated with the emperor, and the primacy and
   institution of the pope emanated from imperial power.

   10. Nobody would reasonably assert of himself or of another, without
   revelation, that he was the head of a particular holy church; nor is
   the Roman pontiff the head of the Roman church.

   11. It is not necessary to believe that any particular Roman pontiff is
   the head of any particular holy church, unless God has predestined him
   to salvation.

   12. Nobody holds the place of Christ or of Peter unless he follows his
   way of life, since there is no other discipleship that is more
   appropriate nor is there another way to receive delegated power from
   God, since there is required for this office of vicar a similar way of
   life as well as the authority of the one instituting.

   13. The pope is not the manifest and true successor of the prince of
   the apostles, Peter, if he lives in a way contrary to Peter's. If he
   seeks avarice, he is the vicar of Judas Iscariot. Likewise, cardinals
   are not the manifest and true successors of the college of Christ's
   other apostles unless they live after the manner of the apostles,
   keeping the commandments and counsels of our lord Jesus Christ.

   14. Doctors who state that anybody subjected to ecclesiastical censure,
   if he refuses to be corrected, should be handed over to the judgment of
   the secular authority, are undoubtedly following in this the chief
   priests, the scribes and the pharisees who handed over to the secular
   authority Christ himself, since he was unwilling to obey them in all
   things, saying, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death; these
   gave him to the civil judge, so that such men are even greater
   murderers than Pilate.

   15. Ecclesiastical obedience was invented by the church's priests,
   without the express authority of scripture.

   16. The immediate division of human actions is between those that are
   virtuous and those that are wicked. Therefore, if a man is wicked and
   does something, he acts wickedly; if he is virtuous and does something,
   he acts virtuously. For just as wickedness, which is called crime or
   mortal sin, infects all the acts of a wicked man, so virtue gives life
   to all the acts of a virtuous man.

   17. A priest of Christ who lives according to his law, knows scripture
   and has a desire to edify the people, ought to preach, notwithstanding
   a pretended excommunication. And further on: if the pope or any
   superior orders a priest so disposed not to preach, the subordinate
   ought not to obey.

   18. Whoever enters the priesthood receives a binding duty to preach;
   and this mandate ought to be carried out, notwithstanding a pretended
   excommunication.

   19. By the church's censures of excommunication, suspension and
   interdict the clergy subdue the laity, for the sake of their own
   exaltation, multiply avarice protect wickedness and prepare the way for
   antichrist. The clear sign of this is the fact that these censures come
   from antichrist. In the legal proceedings of the clergy they are called
   fulminations, which are the principal means whereby the clergy proceed
   against those who uncover antichrist's wickedness, which the clergy has
   for the most part usurped for itself.

   20. If the pope is wicked, and especially if he is foreknown to
   damnation, then he is a devil like Judas the apostle, a thief and a son
   of perdition and is not the head of the holy church militant since he
   is not even a member of it.

   21. The grace of predestination is the bond whereby the body of the
   church and each of its members is indissolubly joined with the head.

   22. The pope or a prelate who is wicked and foreknown to damnation is a
   pastor only in an equivocal sense, and truly is a thief and a robber.

   23. The pope ought not to be called "most holy" even by reason of his
   office, for otherwise even a king ought to be called "most holy" by
   reason of his office and executioners and heralds ought to be called
   "holy", indeed even the devil would be called "holy" since he is an
   official of God.

   24. If a pope lives contrary to Christ, even if he has risen through a
   right and legitimate election according to the established human
   constitution, he would have risen by a way other than through Christ,
   even granted that he entered upon office by an election that had been
   made principally by God. For, Judas Iscariot was rightly and
   legitimately elected to be an apostle by Jesus Christ who is God, yet
   he climbed into the sheepfold by another way.

   25. The condemnation of the forty-five articles of John Wyclif, decreed
   by the doctors, is irrational and unjust and badly done and the reason
   alleged by them is feigned, namely that none of them is catholic but
   each one is either heretical or erroneous or scandalous.

   26. The viva voce agreement upon some person, made according to human
   custom by the electors or by the greater part of them, does not mean by
   itself that the person has been legitimately elected or that by this
   very fact he is the true and manifest successor or vicar of the apostle
   Peter or of another apostle in an ecclesiastical office. For, it is to
   the works of the one elected that we should look irrespective of
   whether the manner of the election was good or bad. For, the more
   plentifully a person acts meritoriously towards building up the church,
   the more copiously does he thereby have power from God for this.

   27. There is not the least proof that there must be one head ruling the
   church in spiritual matters who always lives with the church militant.

   28. Christ would govern his church better by his true disciples
   scattered throughout the world, without these monstrous heads.

   29. The apostles and faithful priests of the Lord strenuously governed
   the church in matters necessary for salvation before the office of pope
   was introduced, and they would continue to do this until the day of
   judgment if--which is very possible--there is no pope.

   30. Nobody is a civil lord, a prelate or a bishop while he is in mortal
   sin.

   [Sentence condemning John Petit's proposition, "Any tyrant-']

   This most holy synod wishes to proceed with special care to the
   eradication of errors and heresies which are growing in various parts
   of the world, as is its duty and the purpose for which it has
   assembled. It has recently learnt that various propositions have been
   taught that are erroneous both in the faith and as regards good morals,
   are scandalous in many ways and threaten to subvert the constitution
   and order of every state. Among these propositions this one has been
   reported: Any tyrant can and ought to be killed, licitly and
   meritoriously, by any of his vassals or subjects, even by means of
   plots and blandishments or flattery, notwithstanding any oath taken, or
   treaty made with the tyrant, and without waiting for a sentence or a
   command from any judge. This holy synod, wishing to oppose this error
   and to eradicate it completely, declares, decrees and defines, after
   mature deliberation, that this doctrine is erroneous in the faith and
   with regard to morals, and it rejects and condemns the doctrine as
   heretical, scandalous and seditious and as leading the way through
   perjury to frauds, deceptions, lies and betrayals. It declares, decrees
   and defines, moreover, that those who stubbornly assert this very
   pernicious doctrine are heretics and are to be punished as such
   according to canonical and legitimate sanctions. [37 ]

SESSION 20 - 21 November 1415

   [A warning is decreed against the duke of Austria, on behalf of the
   bishop of Trent.]

SESSION 21 - 30 May 1416

   [Sentence condemning Jerome of Prague]

   In the name of the Lord, Amen. Christ our God and saviour, the true
   vine whose Father is the vine-dresser, said when teaching his disciples
   and other followers in these matters: If anyone does not abide in me,
   he shall be cast forth as a branch and shall wither. This holy synod of
   Constance is following the teaching and carrying out the commands of
   this sovereign teacher and master in this case of inquiry into heresy
   which was started by the same holy synod. It notes the public talk and
   loud outcry against the said masterJerome of Prague, master of arts,
   layman. From the acts and proceedings of the case it is evident that
   the said Jerome has held, asserted and taught various heretical and
   erroneous articles, which were long ago condemned by holy fathers, some
   of which are blasphemous, others scandalous and others offensive to the
   ears of the devout as well as rash and seditious. They were long ago
   asserted, preached and taught by John Wyclif and John Hus, of cursed
   memory, and were included in various of their books and pamphlets.
   These articles, doctrines and books of the aforesaid John
   Wyclif and John Hus, as well as the memory of Wyclif, and finally the
   person of Hus, were condemned and damned by this same holy synod and
   its sentence of heresy. The said Jerome later, during the course of
   this inquiry, in this holy synod, approved and consented to this
   sentence of condemnation and acknowledged and professed the true,
   catholic and apostolic faith. He anathematised all heresy, especially
   that for which he had been defamed-and he confessed himself
   defamed--and which John Wyclif and John Hus had taught and held in the
   past in their works, sermons and pamphlets, and on account of which the
   said Wyclif and Hus, together with their dogmas and errors, had been
   condemned as heretical by this same holy synod, and their teaching
   likewise condemned. He professed acceptance of every condemnation of
   the aforesaid things and swore that he would remain in the truth of the
   faith, and that if he ever dared to think or preach anything to the
   contrary then he wished to submit to the severity of canon law and to
   be bound to eternal punishment. He offered and gave this profession of
   his, written in his own hand to this holy synod. Many days after his
   profession and abjuration, however, like a dog returning to its vomit,
   he asked for a public hearing to be granted to him in this same holy
   synod, in order that he might vomit forth in public the deadly poison
   which lay hidden within his breast. The hearing was granted to him and
   he asserted, said and professed in effect, at a public assembly of the
   same synod, that he had wrongly consented to the aforesaid sentence
   condemning the said Wyclif and John Hus and that he had lied in
   approving the sentence. He did not fear to state that he had lied.
   Indeed, he revoked now and for eternity his confession, approval and
   profession regarding the condemnation of the two men. He asserted that
   he had never read any heresy or error in the books of the said Wyclif
   and John Hus, even though it was clearly proved, before his profession
   to the sentence on the two men, that he had carefully studied, read and
   taught their books and it is clear that many errors and heresies are
   contained in them. The said Jerome professed, however, that he held and
   believed what the church holds and believes regarding the sacrament of
   the altar and the transubstantiation of the bread into the body of
   Christ, saying that he believed in Augustine and the other doctors of
   the church more than in Wyclif and Hus. It is evident from the above
   that the said Jerome adhered to the condemned Wyclif and Hus and their
   errors, and that he was and is a supporter of them. This holy synod has
   therefore decreed and now declares that the said Jerome is to be cast
   away as a branch that is rotten, withered and separated from the vine;
   and it pronounces, declares and condemns him as a heretic who has
   relapsed into heresy and as an excommunicated and anathematised person.

   May this judgment come forth from the face of him who sits on the
   throne, and from his mouth proceeds a double-edged sword, whose scales
   are just and weights are true, who will come to judge the living and
   the dead, our lord Jesus Christ, Amen. The Lord is just and loves just
   deeds, his face looks on righteousness. But the Lord looks on those who
   do evil so as to cut off their remembrance from the earth. Let there
   perish, says the holy prophet, the memory of him who did not remember
   to show mercy and who persecuted the poor and needy. How much more
   should there perish the memory of Peter de Luna, called by some
   Benedict XIII, who persecuted and disturbed all people and the
   universal church? For, how greatly he has sinned against God's church
   and the entire christian people, fostering, nourishing and continuing
   the schism and division of God's church How ardent and frequent have
   been the devout and humble prayers, exhortations and requests of kings,
   princes and prelates with which he has been warned in charity, in
   accordance with the teaching of the gospel, to bring peace to the
   church, to heal its wounds and to reconstitute its divided parts into
   one structure and one body, as he had sworn to do, and as for a long
   time it was within his power to do ! He was unwilling, however, to
   listen to their charitable admonitions. How many were the persons
   afterwards sent to attest to him! Because he did not listen at all even
   to these, it has been necessary, in accordance with the aforesaid
   evangelical teaching of Christ, to say to the church, since he has not
   listened even to her, that he should be treated as a heathen and a
   publican. All these things have been clearly proved by the articles
   coming from the inquiry into faith and the schism held before this
   present synod, regarding the above and other matters brought against
   him, as well as by their truth and notoriety. The proceedings have been
   correct and canonical, all the acts have been correctly and carefully
   examined and there has been mature deliberation. Therefore this same
   holy general synod, representing the universal church and sitting as a
   tribunal in the aforesaid inquiry, pronounces, decrees and declares by
   this definitive sentence written here, that the same Peter de Luna,
   called Benedict XIII as has been said, has been and is a perjurer, a
   cause of scandal to the universal church, a promoter and breeder of the
   ancient schism, that long established fission and division in God's
   holy church, an obstructer of the peace and unity of the said church, a
   schismatic disturber and a heretic, a deviator from the faith, a
   persistent violator of the article of the faith One holy catholic
   church, incorrigible, notorious and manifest in his scandal to God's
   church, and that he has rendered himself unworthy of every title, rank,
   honour and dignity, rejected and cut off by God, deprived by the law
   itself of every right in any way belonging to him in the papacy or
   pertaining to the Roman pontiff and the Roman church, and cut off from
   the catholic church like a withered member. This same holy synod,
   moreover, as a precautionary measure, since according to himself he
   actually holds the papacy, deprives, deposes and casts out the said
   Peter from the papacy and from being the supreme pontiff of the Roman
   church and from every title, rank, honour, dignity, benefice and office
   whatsoever. It forbids him to act henceforth as the pope or as the
   supreme and Roman pontiff. It absolves and declares to be absolved all
   Christ's faithful from obedience to him, and from every duty of
   obedience to him and from oaths and obligations in any way made to him.
   It forbids each and every one of Christ's faithful to obey, respond to
   or attend to, as if he were pope, the said Peter de Luna, who is a
   notorious, declared and deposed schismatic and incorrigible heretic, or
   to sustain or harbour him in any way contrary to the aforesaid, or to
   offer him help, advice or good will. This is forbidden under pain of
   the offender being counted as a promoter of schism and heresy and of
   being deprived of all benefices, dignities and ecclesiastical or
   secular honours, and under other penalties of the law, even if the
   dignity is that of a bishop, a patriarch, a cardinal, a king or the
   emperor. If they act contrary to this prohibition, they are by this
   very fact deprived of these things, on the authority of this decree and
   sentence, and they incur the other penalties of the law. This holy
   synod, moreover, declares and decrees that all and singular
   prohibitions and all processes, sentences, constitu- tions, censures
   and any other things whatsoever that were issued by him and might
   impede the aforesaid, are without effect; and it invalidates, revokes
   and annuls them; saving always the other penalties which the law
   decrees for the above cases.

SESSION 38 - 28 July 1417

   [Decree about the right to vote of the deputies of the kings of Castile
   and Aragon, concerning which agreement had not been reached among the
   said deputies in the previous session; decrees about other lesser
   matters.]

SESSION 39 - 9 October 1417

   [On general councils]

   The frequent holding of general councils is a pre-eminent means of
   cultivating the Lord's patrimony. It roots out the briars, thorns and
   thistles of heresies, errors and schisms, corrects deviations, reforms
   what is deformed and produces a richly fertile crop for the Lord's
   vineyard. Neglect of councils, on the other hand, spreads and fosters
   the aforesaid evils. This conclusion is brought before our eyes by the
   memory of past times and reflection on the present situation. For this
   reason we establish, enact, decree and ordain, by a perpetual edict,
   that general councils shall be held henceforth in the following way.
   The first shall follow in five years immediately after the end of this
   council, the second in seven years immediately after the end of the
   next council, and thereafter they are to be held every ten years for
   ever. They are to be held in places which the supreme pontiff is
   bound to nominate and assign within a month before the end of each
   preceding council, with the approval and consent of the council, or
   which, in his default, the council itself is bound to nominate. Thus,
   by a certain continuity, there will always be either a council in
   existence or one expected within a given time. If perchance emergencies
   arise, the time may be shortened by the supreme pontiff, acting on the
   advice of his brothers, the cardinals of the Roman church, but it may
   never be prolonged. Moreover, he may not change the place assigned for
   the next council without evident necessity. If an emergency arises
   whereby it seems necessary to change the place--for example in the case
   of a siege, war, disease or the like--then the supreme pontiff may,
   with the consent and written endorsement of his aforesaid brothers or
   of two-thirds of them, substitute another place which is suitable and
   fairly near to the place previously assigned. It must, however, be
   within the same nation unless the same or a similar impediment exists
   throughout the nation. In the latter case he may summon the council to
   another suitable place which is nearby but within another nation, and
   the prelates and other persons who are customarily summoned to a
   council will be obliged to come to it as if it had been the place
   originally assigned. The supreme pontiff is bound to announce and
   publish the change of place or the shortening of time in a legal and
   solemn form within a year before the date assigned, so that the
   aforesaid persons may be able to meet and hold the council at the
   appointed time.

   [Provision to guard against future schisms]

   If it happens--though may it not!--that a schism arises in the future
   in such a way that two or more persons claim to be supreme pontiffs,
   then the date of the council, if it is more than a year off, is to be
   brought forward to one year ahead; calculating this from the day on
   which two or more of them publicly assumed the insignia of their
   pontificates or on which they began to govern. All prelates and others
   who are bound to attend a council shall assemble at the council without
   the need for any summons, under pain of the law's sanctions and of
   other penalties which may be imposed by the council, and let the
   emperor and other kings and princes attend either in person or through
   official deputies, as if they had been besought, through the bowels of
   the mercy of our lord Jesus Christ, to put out a common fire. Each of
   those claiming to be the Roman pontiff is bound to announce and
   proclaim the council as taking place at the end of the year, as
   mentioned, in the previously assigned place; he is bound to do this
   within a month after the day on which he came to know that one or more
   other persons had assumed the insignia of the papacy or was
   administering the papacy; and this is under pain of eternal damnation,
   of the automatic loss of any rights that he had acquired in the papacy,
   and of being disqualified both actively and passively from all
   dignities. He is also bound to make the council known by letter to his
   rival claimant or claimants, challenging him or them to a judicial
   process, as well as to all prelates and princes, insofar as this is
   possible. He shall go in person to the place of the council at the
   appointed time, under pain of the aforesaid penalties, and shall not
   depart until the question of the schism has been fully settled by the
   council. None of the contenders for the papacy, moreover shall preside
   as pope at the council. Indeed, in order that the church may rejoice
   more freely and quickly in one undisputed pastor, all the contenders
   for the papacy are suspended by law as soon as the council has begun,
   on the authority of this holy synod, from all administration; and let
   not obedience be given in any way by anyone to them, or to any one of
   them until the question has been settled by the council.

   If it happens in the future that the election of a Roman pontiff is
   brought about through fear, which would weigh upon even a steadfast
   man, or through pressure, then we declare that it is of no effect or
   moment and cannot be ratified or approved by subsequent consent even if
   the state of fear ceases. The cardinals, however, may not proceed to
   another election until a council has reached a decision about the
   election, unless the person elected resigns or dies. If they do proceed
   to this second election, then it is null by law and both those making
   the second election and the person elected, if he embarks upon his
   reign as pope, are deprived by law of every dignity, honour and
   rank--even cardinalatial or pontifical--and are thereafter ineligible
   for the same, even the papacy itself; and nobody may in any way obey as
   pope the second person elected, under pain of being a fosterer of
   schism. In such a case the council is to provide for the election of a
   pope. It is lawful, however, and indeed all the electors are bound, or
   at least the greater part of them, to move to a safe locality and to
   make a statement about the said fear. The statement is to be made in a
   prominent place before public notaries and important persons as well as
   before a multitude of the people. They are to do this as quickly as
   they can without danger to their persons, even if there is a threat of
   danger to all their goods. They shall state in their allegation the
   nature and extent of the fear and shall solemnly swear that the
   allegation is true that they believe they can prove it and that they
   are not making it out of malice or calumny. Such an allegation of fear
   cannot be delayed in any way until after the next council.

   After they have moved and have alleged the fear in the above form, they
   are bound to summon the person elected to a council. If a council is
   not due for more than a year after their summons, then its date shall
   be brought forward by the law itself to only a year ahead, in the way
   explained above. The elected person is bound under pain of the
   aforesaid penalties, and the cardinals under pain of automatically
   losing the cardinalate and all their benefices, to announce and
   proclaim the council within a month after the summons, in the way
   mentioned above, and to make it known as soon as possible. The
   cardinals and other electors are bound to come in person to the place
   of the council, at a suitable time, and to remain there until the end
   of the affair.

   The other prelates are bound to answer the cardinals' summons, as
   mentioned above, if the person elected fails to issue a summons. The
   latter will not preside at the council since he will have been
   suspended by law from all government of the papacy from the time the
   council begins, and he is not to be obeyed by anyone in any matter
   under pain of the offender becoming a promoter of schism. If the
   aforesaid emergencies arise within a year before the beginning of a
   council-namely that more than one person claim to be pope or that
   someone has been elected through fear or pressure--then those who claim
   to be pope, or the one elected through fear or pressure, as well as the
   cardinals, are deemed by law as having been summoned to the council.
   They are bound, moreover, to appear in person at the council, to
   explain their case and to await the council's judgment. But if some
   emergency happens during the above occurrences whereby it is necessary
   to change the place of the council--for example a siege or war or
   disease or some such--then nevertheless all the aforesaid persons, as
   well as all prelates and others who are obliged to attend a council,
   are bound to assemble at a neighbouring place suitable for the council,
   as has been said above. Moreover, the greater part of the prelates who
   have moved to a particular place within a month may specify it as the
   place of the council to which they and others are bound to come, just
   as if it had been the place first assigned. The council, after it has
   thus been summoned and has assembled and become acquainted with the
   cause of the schism, shall bring a suit of contumacy against the
   electors or those claiming to be pope or the cardinals, if perchance
   they fail to come. It shall then pronounce judgment and shall punish,
   even beyond the aforesaid penalties and in such a way that the
   fierceness of the punishment acts as an example to others, those who
   are to blame--no matter of what state or rank or pre-eminence, whether
   ecclesiastical or secular, they may be--in starting or fostering the
   schism, in their administering or obeying, in their supporting those
   who governed or in making an election against the aforesaid
   prohibition, or who lied m their allegations of fear.

   The disturbance caused by fear or pressure at a papal election corrodes
   and divides, in a lamentable way, the whole of Christianity. In order
   that it may be assiduously avoided, we have decided to decree, in
   addition to what has been said above, that if anyone brings to bear or
   causes, or procures to be brought about, fear or pressure or violence
   of this kind upon the electors in a papal election, or upon any one of
   them, or has the matter ratified after it has been done, or advises or
   acts in support of it, or knowingly receives or defends someone who has
   done this, or is negligent in enforcing the penalties mentioned
   below--no matter of what state or rank or pre-eminence the offender may
   be, even if it be imperial or regal or pontifical, or any other
   ecclesiastical or secular dignity he may hold--then he automatically
   incurs the penalties contained in pope Boniface VIII's constitution
   which begins Felicis, and he shall be effectively punished by them.

   Any city--even if it be Rome itself, though may it not be!--or any
   other corporation that gives aid, counsel or support to someone who
   does these things, or that does not have such an offender punished
   within a month, insofar as the enormity of the crime demands and there
   exists the possibility of inflicting the punishment, shall
   automatically be subject to ecclesiastical interdict. Furthermore the
   city, apart from the one mentioned above, shall be deprived of the
   episcopal dignity, notwithstanding any privileges to the contrary. We
   wish, moreover, that this decree be solemnly published at the end of
   every general council and that it be read out and publicly announced
   before the start of a conclave, wherever and whenever the election of a
   Roman pontiff is about to take place.

   [On the profession to be made by the pope]

   Since the Roman pontiff exercises such great power among mortals, it is
   right that he be bound all the more by the incontrovertible bonds of
   the faith and by the rites that are to be observed regarding the
   church's sacraments. We therefore decree and ordain, in order that the
   fullness of the faith may shine in a future Roman pontiff with singular
   splendour from the earliest moments of his becoming pope, that
   henceforth whoever is to be elected Roman pontiff shall make the
   following confession and profession in public, in front of his
   electors, before his election is published.

   In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father and Son and holy
   Spirit. Amen. In the year of our Lord's nativity one thousand etc., I,
   N., elected pope, with both heart and mouth confess and profess to
   almighty God, whose church I undertake with his assistance to govern,
   and to blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, that as long as I am in
   this fragile life I will firmly believe and hold the catholic faith,
   according to the traditions of the apostles, of the general councils
   and of other holy fathers, especially of the eight holyuniversal
   councils-namely the first at

   Nicaea, the second at

   Constantinople, the third at

   Ephesus, the fourth at

   Chalcedon, the fifth and sixth at

   Constantinople, the seventh at

   Nicaea and the eighth at

   Constantinople--as well as of the general councils at the

   Lateran,

   Lyons and

   Vienne,

   and I will preserve this faith unchanged to the last dot and will
   confirm, defend and preach it to the point of death and the shedding of
   my blood, and likewise I will follow and observe in every way the rite
   handed down of the ecclesiastical sacraments of the catholic church.
   This my profession and confession, written at my orders by a notary of
   the holy Roman church, I have signed below with my own hand. I
   sincerely offer it on this altar N. to you, almighty God, with a pure
   mind and a devout conscience, in the presence of the following. Made
   etc.

   [That prelates may not be translated without their consent]

   When prelates are translated, there is commonly both spiritual and
   temporal loss and damage of a grave nature for the churches from which
   they are transferred. The prelates, moreover, sometimes do not maintain
   the rights and liberties of their churches as carefully as they
   otherwise might, out of fear of being translated. The importunity of
   certain people who seek their own good, not that of Jesus Christ, may
   mean that the Roman pontiff is deceived in such a matter, as one
   ignorant of the facts, and so is easily led astray. We therefore
   determine and ordain, by this present decree, that henceforth bishops
   and superiors ought not to be translated unwillingly without a grave
   and reasonable cause which, after the person in question has been
   summoned, is to be inquired into and decided upon with the advice of
   the cardinals of the holy Roman church, or the greater part of them,
   and with their written endorsement. Lesser prelates, such as abbots and
   others with perpetual benefices, ought not to be changed, moved or
   deposed without a just and reasonable cause that has been inquired
   into.

   We add, moreover, that for abbots to be changed the written endorsement
   of the cardinals is necessary--just as it is necessary for bishops, as
   has been said-saving, however, the constitutions and privileges of any
   churches, monasteries and orders.

   [On spoils and procurations]

   Papal reservations as well as the exacting and receiving of
   procurations which are due to ordinaries and other lesser prelates, by
   reason of a visitation, and of spoils on deceased prelates and other
   clerics, are seriously detrimental to churches, monasteries and other
   benefices and to churchmen. We therefore declare, by this present
   edict, that it is reasonable and in the public interest that
   reservations made by the pope, as well as exactions and collections of
   this kind made by collectors and others appointed or to be appointed by
   apostolic authority, are henceforth in no way to occur or to be
   attempted. Indeed, procurations of this kind, as well as spoils and the
   goods of any prelates found at their deaths, even if they are cardinals
   or members of the papal household or officials or any other clerics
   whatsoever, in the Roman curia or outside it, no matter where or when
   they die, are to belong to and to be received by, fully and freely,
   those persons to whom they would and ought to belong with the ending of
   the aforesaid reservations, mandates and exactions. We forbid the
   exaction of such spoils on prelates even inferior ones and others,
   which are outside and contrary to the form of common law. However, the
   constitution of pope Boniface VIII of happy memory, beginning
   Praesenti, which was published with this specially in mind, is to
   remain in force.

SESSION 40 - 30 OCTOBER 1417

   [Reforms to be made by the pope together with the council before it is
   dissolved]

   The most holy synod of Constance [40 ] declares and decrees that the
   future supreme Roman pontiff, who by God's grace is to be elected very
   soon, together with this sacred council or those to be deputed by the
   individual nations, is bound to reform the church in its head and in
   the Roman curia, according to justice and the good government of the
   church, before this council is dissolved, under the topics contained in
   the following articles, which were at various times put forward by the
   nations by way of reforms.

   1. First, the number, quality and nationality of the lord cardinals.

   2. Next, reservations of the apostolic see.

   3. Next, annates, common services and petty services.

   4. Next, collations to benefices and expectative graces.

   5. Next, the cases that are, or are not, to be heard at the Roman
   curia.

   6. Next, appeals to the Roman curia.

   7. Next, the offices of chancery and penitentiary.

   8. Next, exemptions and incorporations made at the time of the schism.

   9. Next, commendams.

   10. Next, confirmation of elections. [41 ]

   11. Next, intercalary fruits.

   12. Next, not alienating goods of the Roman church and of other
   churches.

   13. Next, for what reasons and how a pope can be corrected or deposed.

   14. Next, the eradication of simony.

   15. Next, dispensations.

   16. Next, revenues of the pope and the cardinals.

   17. Next, indulgences.

   18. Next, tithes.

   With this addition, that when the nations have deputed their
   representatives as

   mentioned above, the others may freely return to their own countries
   with the

   pope's permission.

   [That the election of the Roman pontiff may be begun, notwithstanding
   the absence of Peter de Luna's cardinals]

   The most holy general synod of Constance notes what was previously
   agreed upon at Narbonne concerning the church's unity and the admission
   to this synod of the cardinals of the obedience of Peter de Luna,
   called Benedict XIII in his obedience. It notes, too, that after the
   notorious expulsion of the said Peter de Luna, the aforesaid cardinals
   who had been summoned before the expulsion according to the terms of
   the agreement, did not come within three months and more after the
   aforesaid expulsion. The synod therefore decrees and declares that,
   notwithstanding their absence, it will proceed to the election of the
   Roman pontiff on the authority of the said synod and according to what
   has been decided by the same synod. It declares, however, that if they
   arrive before the election of the future supreme pontiff has been
   completed, and if they adhere to the council, they are to be admitted
   to the aforesaid election together with the other cardinals, according
   to the directives of the law and what shall be decided by the council.

   [On the manner and form of electing the pope]

   For the praise, glory and honour of almighty God and for the peace and
   unity of the universal church and of the whole christian people. The
   election of the future Roman and supreme pontiff is soon to be held. We
   wish that it may be confirmed with greater authority and by the assent
   of many persons and that, mindful as we are of the state of the church,
   no doubts or scruples may later remain in people's minds regarding the
   said election but rather that a secure, true full and perfect union of
   the faithful may result from it. Therefore this most holy general synod
   of Constance, mindful of the common good and with the special and
   express consent and the united wish of the cardinals of the holy Roman
   church present at the same synod, and of the college of cardinals and
   of all the nations at this present council, declares, ordains and
   decrees that, for this time only, at the election of the Roman and
   supreme pontiff, there shall be added to the cardinals six prelates or
   other honourable churchmen in holy orders, from each of the nations
   currently present and named at the same synod, who are to be chosen by
   each of the said nations within ten days. This same holy synod gives
   power to all these people, insofar as it is necessary, to elect the
   Roman pontiff according to the form here laid down. That is to say, the
   person is to be regarded as the Roman pontiff by the universal church
   without exception who is elected and admitted by two-thirds of the
   cardinals present at the conclave and by two-thirds of those from each
   nation who are to be and have been added to the cardinals. Moreover,
   the election is not valid nor is the person elected to be regarded as
   supreme pontiff unless two-thirds of the cardinals present at the
   conclave, and two-thirds of those from each nation who should be and
   have been added to the same cardinals, agree to elect him as Roman
   pontiff. The synod also declares, ordains and decrees that the votes of
   any persons cast at the election are null unless, as has been said,
   two-thirds of the cardinals, and two-thirds of those from each nation
   who should be and have been added to them, agree, directly or by way of
   addition, upon one person. This must be added, moreover, that the
   prelates and other persons who should be and have been added to the
   cardinals for the election, are bound to observe all and singular
   apostolic constitutions, even penal ones, which have been promulgated
   regarding the election of the Roman pontiff, just as the cardinals
   themselves are bound to observe them, and they are bound to their
   observance. The said electors, both cardinals and others, are also
   bound to swear, before they proceed to the election, that in attending
   to the business of the election, they will proceed with pure and
   sincere minds--since it is a question of creating the vicar Jesus
   Christ, the successor of the blessed Peter, the governor of the
   universal church and the leader of the Lord's flock--and that they
   firmly believe it will benefit the public good of the universal church
   if they entirely prescind from all affection for persons of any
   particular nation, or other inordinate affections, as well as from
   hatred and graces or favours bestowed, in order that by their ministry
   a beneficial and suitable pastor may be provided for the universal
   church. This same holy synod, mindful of this notorious vacancy in the
   Roman church, fixes and assigns the next ten days for all and singular
   cardinals of the holy Roman church, whether present here or absent, and
   the other electors mentioned above, to enter into the conclave which is
   to be held in this city of Constance, in the commune's principal
   building which has already been allocated for this purpose. The synod
   ordains, declares and decrees that within these next ten days the
   aforesaid electors, both cardinals and others mentioned above, must
   enter into the conclave for the purpose of holding the election and of
   doing and carrying out all the other matters according as the laws
   ordain and decree in all things, besides those mentioned above
   regarding the cardinals and other electors, concerning the election of
   a Roman pontiff. The same holy synod wishes all these laws to remain in
   force after the above matters have been observed. For this time,
   however, it approves, ordains, establishes and decrees this particular
   form and manner of election. The same holy synod, in order to remove
   all scruples, makes and declares fit for actively and passively
   carrying out all legitimate acts at the same synod, insofar as this is
   necessary, all those who are present at the same synod as well as those
   who will come and adhere to it, always saving the other decrees of this
   same sacred council, and it will supply for any defects, if perchance
   any shall occur in the above, notwithstanding any apostolic
   constitutions, even those published in general councils, and other
   constitutions to the contrary.

SESSION 43

   [42 ]

- 23 MARCH 1418

   [Certain statutes promulgated on the reform of the church]

   On exemptions

   Martin, bishop and servant of the servants of God. We note that from
   the time of the death of pope Gregory XI, our predecessor of happy
   memory, some Roman pontiffs, or those who claimed to be and were
   reputed as such in their various obediences, either of their own will
   or on account of the importunity of petitioners, have granted exemption
   from the jurisdiction of their ordinaries to certain churches,
   monasteries, chapters, convents, priories, benefices, places and
   persons, which were in no way exempt in the time of the said Gregory,
   to the great detriment of the ordinaries in question. We wish to avoid
   damage of this kind. We therefore revoke, with the approval of this
   sacred council, all exemptions that were first granted after the said
   Gregory XI's death, by any persons whomsoever claiming to be Roman
   pontiffs, even if perchance we ourselves with full knowledge approved
   or renewed the exemptions, without the party in question being heard,
   to any cathedral churches, monasteries (even those that were exempt but
   were later made subject to a monastery of a different order or
   tradition), chapters, convents, prelacies, benefices, places and
   persons whatsoever, if they had enjoyed no exemption before they were
   exempted in this way, but were simply subject to ordinary jurisdiction,
   and had no beginning before that time. We except, however, exemptions
   that were made or granted either by way of confirmation, increase or
   addition, or concerning which the matter was ordained by the competent
   authority, after the interested parties had presented themselves and
   been heard, or to which the ordinaries consented, to a whole order or
   to churches, monasteries, chapters, convents, benefices and places
   founded after the aforesaid time by way of or on condition of exemption
   or with a new foundation in mind, or to universities and colleges of
   scholars. We also revoke, with the approval of this sacred council, all
   perpetual exemptions granted by the pope through inferior persons. We
   revoke them even if unresolved suits about them are pending, and we end
   these suits. We return the churches, monasteries and other aforesaid
   places to the former jurisdiction of their ordinaries. We do not wish
   to prejudice by this in any way other exemptions held or granted before
   the death of the said Gregory. In future, however, we do not intend to
   grant exemptions unless the case has been examined and the interested
   parties have been summoned.

   On unions and incorporations

   Martin, etc. It is not possible to give a certain rule about unions and
   incorporations made or granted after Gregory XI's death. We shall
   therefore revoke them, with due regard to justice, even though the
   authority of the apostolic see may have been involved, on the plea of
   the interested parties, unless they were made for good and true reasons
   or unless the interested persons themselves have obtained benefices
   united in this way.

   On intercalary fruits

   Martin, etc. Next, we leave the fruits and revenues coming from
   churches, monasteries and benefices during a vacancy to be disposed of
   in accordance with the law and customs or privileges. We forbid them to
   be applied to us or to the apostolic camera.

   On simoniacs

   Martin, etc. Many constitutions have been issued in the past against
   the evil of simony, but they have not been able to eradicate the
   disease. We wish to attend carefully to this matter in the future
   according as we are able to. We therefore declare, with the approval of
   this sacred council, that persons ordained in a simoniacal fashion are
   automatically suspended from exercising their orders. Simoniacal
   elections, postulations, confirmations and provisions that are
   henceforth made to or in respect of any churches, monasteries,
   dignities, parsonages, offices or ecclesiastical benefices are rendered
   null by the law itself and nobody acquires any rights through them.
   Those who have been thus promoted, confirmed or provided may not
   receive their fruits but are bound to restore them as though they had
   received things that had been unjustly taken. We decree, moreover, that
   both those who give and those who receive money in this matter of
   simony automatically incur the sentence of excommunication, even though
   their rank be pontifical or cardinalatial.

   On dispensations

   Martin, etc. Since benefices are granted by reason of the duties
   attached to them, we consider it absurd that those who obtain benefices
   refuse or neglect to carry out their duties. We therefore revoke, with
   the approval of this sacred council, all dispensations, granted by any
   persons whomsoever claiming to be Roman pontiffs, to any persons
   elected to, confirmed in or provided to churches, monasteries,
   conventual priories, deaneries, archdeaconries or any other benefices
   for which a particular order ought to be bestowed, or to which one is
   attached, whereby the persons in question are dispensed from receiving
   the episcopal consecration or the abbatial blessing or the other orders
   that ought to be bestowed or are attached. This does not include,
   however, the dispensations granted according to the form of Boniface
   VIII's constitution beginning Cum ex eo We decree that within six
   months from the publication of this our constitution, for those who are
   presently holding such appointments, and within the time laid down by
   the law for those who will hold them in the future, the persons
   concerned are to have themselves consecrated or blessed or promoted to
   some other required order. Otherwise they are deprived by the law
   itself of the said churches, monasteries, dignities, parsonages,
   offices and benefices. These may then be freely conferred on other
   persons or provision may be made for them. However, other published
   constitutions on this matter are to remain in force.

   On tithes and other dues

   Martin, etc. We command and order the strict observance of the laws
   which forbid tithes and other dues to be imposed on churches and
   ecclesiastics by persons lower than the pope. For ourselves, moreover,
   we shall in no way impose them generally on the whole clergy unless
   there is a grave and serious reason and an advantage for the universal
   church in doing so, and then with the advice, consent and written
   endorsement of our brothers, the cardinals of the holy Roman church,
   and the prelates whose advice can conveniently be obtained. This should
   not happen especially in any kingdom or province where the prelates in
   question, or the majority of them, have not been consulted or have not
   consented. In this way they may only be levied by ecclesiastics acting
   on the authority of the apostolic see.

   On the life and probity of clerics

   Martin, etc. Among the various faults of clerics and prelates this one
   has especially taken root, namely that many of them despise an
   appearance of ecclesiastical decency in their dress and delight in what
   is unbecoming. They seek to conform to the laity and they exhibit
   outwardly in their dress whatever they are thinking in their minds.
   Therefore, with the approval of this sacred council, we renew and order
   the careful observance of all the laws currently in force regarding the
   clothing, tonsure and habits of clerics, as to both shape and colour,
   and their hair-styles and the style and uprightness of their lives.
   These laws have been heeded far too little by both the secular and the
   regular clergy. Especially we order to be utterly abolished, with the
   same council's approval, the abuse whereby in certain regions some
   clerics and churchmen, both secular and regular, and even (which we
   deplore still more) prelates of churches, wear long gloves that are
   unnecessarily large and sumptuous, extending to their elbows, and
   clothes with slits at the back and sides, with furs covering the edges
   even of the slit parts. Moreover, they are not afraid to attend the
   divine offices in churches--even in the churches in which they are
   beneficed--in such clothes together with their surplices and other
   garments worn for worship and the church's services. We condemn this
   unbecoming way of dressing for all churchmen and we forbid the wearing
   of such garments. Those who do otherwise are to be punished as
   transgressors of the canons. We decree in particular that if any
   beneficed person, or any holder of an office in a church, dares to
   attend the divine office in such clothing, then he shall know that he
   is suspended from receiving his ecclesiastical incomes for one month
   for each such occasion, and the fruits of these incomes are to be
   applied to the fabric of the church in question.

   Martin, etc. We decree and declare with the approval of this sacred
   council, that the demands of this same sacred council. regarding the
   articles contained in the reform decree promulgated on Saturday 30
   October [43 ] of last year, have been and are met by the various
   decrees, statutes and ordinances, both those which have been read out
   in this present session and those upon which agreement has been reached
   with the individual nations of the council. [44 ] We wish these
   decrees, statutes and ordinances to be deposited in our chancellery and
   that letters in public form, under the seal of our vice-chancellor, be
   drawn up and handed over to those who wish to have them.

SESSION 44 - 19 April 1418

   [Decree on the place of the next council]

   Martin, etc. We wish and desire to put into effect a decree of this
   general council [45 ] which lays down, among other things, that general
   councils must always be held in the place which the supreme pontiff,
   with the consent and approval of the council, is bound to depute and
   assign, within the month before the end of this council, as the place
   for the next council after the end of the present one. With the consent
   and approval of this present council, we therefore, by this present
   decree, depute and assign the city of Pavia for this purpose, and we
   ordain and decree that prelates and others who ought to be summoned to
   general councils are obliged to go to Pavia at the aforesaid time. Let
   nobody therefore ... If anyone however . . . Given and enacted at
   Constance, in the place of this public session . . .

SESSION 45

   [46 ]

- 22 April 1418

   [Sentence dissolving the council, and the granting of indulgences]

   Martin, etc. We dissolve the council, as the sacred council itself
   requires, for reasons that are certain, reasonable and just. We give
   permission, with the council's approval, to each and every person at
   the council to return home. Furthermore, on the authority of almighty
   God and of his blessed apostles Peter and Paul and on our authority, we
   grant to each and every person who has taken part in this sacred
   council and its business a full absolution of all his sins, once in his
   life, provided he takes advantage of the absolution in the correct form
   within two months of his hearing about it. We grant the same at the
   hour of death. This is to be understood as applying to both lords and
   members of their households; provided that they fast on each Friday for
   a year from the day they come to know of this indulgence, in the case
   of those who seek the absolution for while they are alive, and for
   another year in the case of those who seek it for the hour of death,
   unless they are legitimately prevented from doing so, in which case
   they should perform other pious works. After the second year, they
   ought to fast on Fridays until the end of their lives or to perform
   other pious works. Let nobody therefore . . . If anyone however . . .
   Given and enacted at Constance in the place of this public session. ..

FOOTNOTES

   1 This footnote is not from Tanner. This council was occasioned by The
   Schism begun when the cardinals who had elected Urban VI pope on 8th
   April 1378 and who had all repeatedly recognised him subsequently,
   decided in view of his offensive zeal for reform to claim that the
   pressure they had been under during his election had invalidated it. In
   September 1378 they elected Robert of Genoa [anti] pope Clement VII.
   Urban VI excommunicated them all and appointed a new college of
   cardinals. There then continued two lines of popes with supporting
   cardinals. Fed up with this bipartite division of christendom the
   "council" of Pisa in 1409 made it tripartite beginning another line

   The legitimate line ran : Urban VI, Boniface IX, Innocent VII, Gregory
   XII.

   The first line of antipopes ran :Clement VII, Benedict XIII.

   The second line of antipopes ran : Alexander V, who was succeeded by
   antipope John XXIII.

   It should be remembered that those assembled at Constance did not
   constitute an ecumenical council until the bull of Gregory XII was
   proclaimed on 4 July 1415 in what in Tanner is called "Session 14".

   2 i.e. for the few weeks of 1378 that intervened between his election
   and his electors' repudiation of the election.

   17 Here follow the appointments of the council's ministers and
   officials

   18 John XXIII had fled from Constance on 20 March 1415

   19 and the general reform of God's church in head and members adds Asd.
   These words are not found even in the reliable codices of the Basle
   epitome (see Hardt IV, prologue 15 ff.)

   20 This paragraph is in Asd, but in fact the matter was only proposed,
   not decided upon (see Hardt, IV 90).

   21 The following were also approved at this session : a proposition
   concerning matters about Hus and Wyclif to be treated at the next
   session; a decree about writing letters to kings and princes in the
   name of the council, about the pope's flight and about the continuing
   integrity of the council; a decree to the effect that pope John should
   be brought back by the emperor to the council of Constance.

   22 Regarding this article, the reasons for the condemnation are
   included in the acts as follows: The first part is scandalous and
   presumptuous inasmuch as it speaks in general terms and without
   distinctions; the second part is errorneous inasmuch as it asserts that
   beggin is not permitted to friars.

   23 Regarding this article, the acts include the following reasons for
   the condemnation: It is an error if one understands by the Roman church
   the universal church or a general council, or inasmuch as it would deny
   the primacy of the supreme pontiff over the other individual churches.

   24 In 1412 (Msi, 27, 505-508)

   25 This condemnation is not in Asd

   26 These 260 articles condemned by the university of Oxford in 1411
   (see J. A. Robson, Wyclif and the Oxford Schools, Cambridge 1961,
   244-246) are not to be found in any versions of the council's acts.
   Indeed, the French nation said that it knew nothing about them, and for
   this reason the same topic was taken up again in the 15th session (see
   Hardt 4, 156 and 191; Finke II 34, 40 and 362. H-L wrongly affirms [7,
   226] that this decree was passsed in the 9th session. See the 15th
   session below.

   27 In Hardt this decree follows the sentencing of pope John to be
   removed and deposed; H-L (7, 248 n.), on the other hand, correctly
   affirms that it preceded the sentence, as the heading of the decree
   shows.

   28 There follows a separate decree on electing four judges for
   summoning absent prelates.

   29 Tanner curiously says "At this session pope Gregory XII, through his
   legate Charles Malatesta, approved the council of Constance and
   solemnly renounced the papacy." The actual word used was convoco. See
   my introduction (2).

   30 The following decrees were also promulgated at this session for the
   purpose of confirming Gregory XII's resignation and of uniting the
   followers of the two obediences: Legal proceedings in the two
   obediences, arising from the schism, are declared ended. Decree stating
   that the process for electing the Roman pontiff, when the see is
   vacant, may not begin without the council's consent (this decree
   accords with the decrees promulgated in the earlier session). The
   council ratifies all that Gregory XII did, canonically and according to
   reason, within his actual obedience. The decree that Gregory XII may
   not be re-elected was not made on the grounds of incapacity on the part
   of the said lord Gregory. The council reserves to itself, and declares
   that it will indeed see to, the resolution of problems where two or
   more persons from different obediences hold the same title. The council
   accepts and admits as cardinals the lord Gregory and his cardinals.
   That the lord Gregory's officials shall retain their offices. That
   nobody may depart from the council without the council's permission.
   That the emperor Sigismund is to attend to the council's safety. Decree
   stating that the council requires Peter de Luna (Benedict XIII) to
   resign .

   31 The whole of this sentence condemning John Wyclif, together with the
   articles selected from the 260, is not in Asd; but the articles are
   published also in H-L 7, 308-313.

   32 See above, session 8 (p. 415). In Hardt (4, 400 and 408) this second
   condemnation of John Wyclif is not clearly distinguished from the
   condemnation of John Hus which follows immediately in the same session.

   33 Innocent III; see Lateran council IV, constitution 21 (see above, p.
   245)

   34 but they were not copulating as married persons Msi

   35 Held in 1412 (Msi 27, 505-508

   36 Session 8 [before the council became ecumenical]

   37 In this session various matters were also agreed upon concerning the
   ordering and protecting of the council's work: Decree on silence;
   Constitution of the council against those who plunder or despoil
   persons coming to or returning from the council.

   38 The Caroline Constitution on ecclesiastical liberty, promulgated by
   the emperor Charles IV in 1377, was published by Hardt among the acts
   of the council (4, 523-525). On the confirmation discussed at this
   session and afterwards promulgated, see Hardt 4, 562-583

   39 The articles of Narbonne concerning the unity of the church, which
   were agreed between the emperor Sigismund and the envoys of the council
   of Constance on the one side, and the envoys of the kings and princes
   of Benedict XIII's obedience on the other side, were published by the
   council in a general assembly on 13 December 145 (see Hardt 4, 584).
   They are printed in Hardt 2, 542-554

   40 The most holy general synod of Constance, legitimately assembled in
   the holy Spirit, representing the universal church Asd.

   41 This article comes fifth in the changed order in Asd.

   42 On 22 February 1418 Martin V's bull Inter cunctas was promulgated
   against the followers of John Wyclif and John Hus. It was addressed to
   all archbishops, bishops and inquisitors. Included in it were the 45
   articles of Wyclif condemned in the 8th session and the 30 articles of
   Hus condemned in the 15th session. All suspects were to answer 39
   questions, which were enumerated in the bull, on these articles (see
   Hardt 4, 1518-1531; H-L 7, 507-529; D 657-689).

   43 Session 40

   44 Those agreed upon in the council by Martin V--with the Spanish,
   French, German and English nations--have also been published in
   Raccolta di concordati su matene ecclesiastiche tra la S. Sede e le
   autorita civili, edited by A. Mercati, I Roma 1954, 144-168 (see H-L 7,
   535-565).

   45 Session 39

   46 At the beginning of this session the Poles petitioned for a solemn
   confirmation of the condemnation as heretical of John Falckenberg's
   doctrine on tyrannicide. This doctrine had already been condemned by
   the individual nations but not by the council. Pope Martin's reply was
   as follows: The aforesaid lord our pope said, in answer to these
   proposals, protestations, requests and suggestions, after silence had
   been imposed on all (since some were saying much and causing a
   disturbance), and by way of replying to the aforesaid points, that he
   wished to hold and inviolably observe, and never to contravene in any
   way, each and every thing that had been determined, concluded and
   decreed in a conciliar way, in matters of faith, by this present sacred
   general council of Constance. The pope approves the things done thus in
   a conciliar way, and he ratifies all things about matters of the faith
   that were done in the council in a conciliar way and not otherwise or
   in some other way (Hardt 4, 1557).
