The General Council of Ephesus, 431

Introduction

   Nestorius, who had been condemned in a council at Rome on 11 August
   430, asked the emperor Theodosius II to summon this council. The
   emperor therefore decided to summon it together with his co-emperor
   Valentinian III and with the agreement of Pope Celestine I.
   Theodosius's letter of 19 November 430 requested all those who had been
   summoned to be present at Ephesus on 7 June 431, the feast of
   Pentecost.
   On 22 June, however, before the arrival either of the Roman legates or
   the eastern bishops led by John of Antioch, Cyril of Alexandria began
   the council. Nestorius was summoned three times but did not come. His
   teaching was examined and judgment passed upon it, which 197 bishops
   subscribed at once and others later accepted.
   Shortly afterwards John of Antioch and the easterners arrived: they
   refused communion with Cyril and set up another council. The Roman
   legates (the bishops Arcadius and Projectus and the priest Philip), on
   arriving, joined Cyril and confirmed the sentence against Nestorius.
   Then the council in its fifth session on 17 July excommunicated John
   and his party.
   The documents of the Cyrilline council, the only one which is
   ecumenical, are included below and are as follows.
   The central dogmatic act of the council is its judgment about whether
   the second letter of Cyril to Nestorius, or Nestorius's second letter
   to Cyril, was in conformity with the Nicene creed which was recited at
   the opening of the council's proceedings.
   Cyril's letter was declared by the fathers to be in agreement with
   Nicaea,
   Nestorius's was condemned
   Both are here printed. Mention is made of Cyril's letter in the
   definition of Chalcedon.
   The 12 anathemas and the preceding explanatory letter, which had been
   produced by Cyril and the synod of Alexandria in 430 and sent to
   Nestorius, were read at Ephesus and included in the proceedings.
   The decision about Nestorius.
   The letter of the council advising all the bishops, clergy and people
   about the condemnation of John of Antioch; and some paragraphs dealing
   with the discipline of the Nestorian party.
   A decree on the faith, approved in the sixth session on 22 July, which
   confirmed the Nicene creed, ordered adherence to that alone and forbade
   the production of new creeds.
   A definition against the Messalians.
   A decree about the autonomy of the church of Cyprus.
   Both councils sent legates to the emperor Theodosius, who approved
   neither and sent the bishops away. Nestorius had already been given
   permission to revisit his monastery at Antioch, and on 25 October 431
   Maximianus was ordained patriarch at Constantinople. The decrees of the
   council were approved by Pope Sixtus III shortly after his own
   ordination on 31 July 432.
   The reconciliation between the Cyrilline party and the eastern bishops
   was not easy. In the end, on 23 April 433, Cyril and John of Antioch
   made peace. John's profession of faith was accepted by Cyril and became
   the doctrinal formula of union. It is included here, together with
   Cyril's letter in which he at some length praises John's profession and
   accepts it, adding to it some explanation about his own expressions;
   this letter is mentioned in the definition of Chalcedon. Shortly
   afterwards, probably in 436, Nestorius was definitely sent into exile
   by the emperor .
   The English translation is from the Greek text, which is the more
   authoritative version.

Second letter of Cyril to Nestorius

[Declared by the council of Ephesus to be in agreement with Nicaea]

   Cyril sends greeting in the Lord to the most religious and reverend
   fellow-minister Nestorius
   I understand that there are some who are talking rashly of the
   reputation in which I hold your reverence, and that this is frequently
   the case when meetings of people in authority give them an opportunity.
   I think they hope in this way to delight your ears and so they spread
   abroad uncontrolled expressions. They are people who have suffered no
   wrong, but have been exposed by me for their own profit, one because he
   oppressed the blind and the poor, a second because he drew a sword on
   his mother, a third because he stole someone else's money in collusion
   with a maidservant and since then has lived with such a reputation as
   one would hardly wish for one's worst enemy. For the rest I do not
   intend to spend more words on this subject in order not to vaunt my own
   mediocrity above my teacher and master or above the fathers. For
   however one may try to live, it is impossible to escape the malice of
   evil people, whose mouths are full of cursing and bitterness and who
   will have to defend themselves before the judge of all.
   But I turn to a subject more fitting to myself and remind you as a
   brother in Christ always to be very careful about what you say to the
   people in matters of teaching and of your thought on the faith. You
   should bear in mind that to scandalise even one of these little ones
   that believe in Christ lays you open to unendurable wrath. If the
   number of those who are distressed is very large, then surely we should
   use every skill and care to remove scandals and to expound the healthy
   word of faith to those who seek the truth. The most effective way to
   achieve this end will be zealously to occupy ourselves with the words
   of the holy fathers, to esteem their words, to examine our words to see
   if we are holding to their faith as it is written, to conform our
   thoughts to their correct and irreproachable teaching.
   The holy and great synod, therefore, stated that
   1. the only begotten Son, begotten of God the Father according to
   nature, true God from true God, the light from the light, the one
   through whom the Father made all things, came down, became incarnate,
   became man,
   2. suffered, rose on the third day and ascended to heaven.
   1. We too ought to follow these words and these teachings and consider
   what is meant by saying that the Word from God took flesh and became
   man. For we do not say that the nature of the Word was changed and
   became flesh, nor that he was turned into a whole man made of body and
   soul. Rather do we claim that the Word in an unspeakable, inconceivable
   manner united to himself hypostatically flesh enlivened by a rational
   soul, and so became man and was called son of man, not by God's will
   alone or good pleasure, nor by the assumption of a person alone. Rather
   did two different natures come together to form a unity, and from both
   arose one Christ, one Son. It was not as though the distinctness of the
   natures was destroyed by the union, but divinity and humanity together
   made perfect for us one Lord and one Christ, together marvellously and
   mysteriously combining to form a unity. So he who existed and was
   begotten of the Father before all ages is also said to have been
   begotten according to the flesh of a woman, without the divine nature
   either beginning to exist in the holy virgin, or needing of itself a
   second begetting after that from his Father. (For it is absurd and
   stupid to speak of the one who existed before every age and is
   coeternal with the Father, needing a second beginning so as to exist.)
   The Word is said to have been begotten according to the flesh, because
   for us and for our salvation he united what was human to himself
   hypostatically and came forth from a woman. For he was not first
   begotten of the holy virgin, a man like us, and then the Word descended
   upon him; but from the very womb of his mother he was so united and
   then underwent begetting according to the flesh, making his own the
   begetting of his own flesh.
   2. In a similar way we say that he suffered and rose again, not that
   the Word of God suffered blows or piercing with nails or any other
   wounds in his own nature (for the divine, being without a body, is
   incapable of suffering), but because the body which became his own
   suffered these things, he is said to have suffered them for us. For he
   was without suffering, while his body suffered. Something similar is
   true of his dying. For by nature the Word of God is of itself immortal
   and incorruptible and life and life-giving, but since on the other hand
   his own body by God's grace, as the apostle says, tasted death for all,
   the Word is said to have suffered death for us, not as if he himself
   had experienced death as far as his own nature was concerned (it would
   be sheer lunacy to say or to think that), but because, as I have just
   said, his flesh tasted death. So too, when his flesh was raised to
   life, we refer to this again as his resurrection, not as though he had
   fallen into corruption--God forbid--but because his body had been
   raised again.
   So we shall confess one Christ and one Lord. We do not adore the man
   along with the Word, so as to avoid any appearance of division by using
   the word "with". But we adore him as one and the same, because the body
   is not other than the Word, and takes its seat with him beside the
   Father, again not as though there were two sons seated together but
   only one, united with his own flesh. If, however, we reject the
   hypostatic union as being either impossible or too unlovely for the
   Word, we fall into the fallacy of speaking of two sons. We shall have
   to distinguish and speak both of the man as honoured with the title of
   son, and of the Word of God as by nature possessing the name and
   reality of sonship, each in his own way. We ought not, therefore, to
   split into two sons the one Lord Jesus Christ. Such a way of presenting
   a correct account of the faith will be quite unhelpful, even though
   some do speak of a union of persons. For scripture does not say that
   the Word united the person of a man to himself, but that he became
   flesh. The Word's becoming flesh means nothing else than that he
   partook of flesh and blood like us; he made our body his own, and came
   forth a man from woman without casting aside his deity, or his
   generation from God the Father, but rather in his assumption of flesh
   remaining what he was.
   This is the account of the true faith everywhere professed. So shall we
   find that the holy fathers believed. So have they dared to call the
   holy virgin, mother of God, not as though the nature of the Word or his
   godhead received the origin of their being from the holy virgin, but
   because there was born from her his holy body rationally ensouled, with
   which the Word was hypostatically united and is said to have been
   begotten in the flesh. These things I write out of love in Christ
   exhorting you as a brother and calling upon you before Christ and the
   elect angels, to hold and teach these things with us, in order to
   preserve the peace of the churches and that the priests of God may
   remain in an unbroken bond of concord and love.

Second letter of Nestorius to Cyril

[condemned by the council of Ephesus]

   Nestorius sends greeting in the Lord to the most religious and reverend
   fellow-minister Cyril. I pass over the insults against us contained in
   your extraordinary letter. They will, I think, be cured by my patience
   and by the answer which events will offer in the course of time. On one
   matter, however, I cannot be silent, as silence would in that case be
   very dangerous. On that point, therefore avoiding longwindedness as far
   as I can, I shall attempt a brief discussion and try to be as free as
   possible from repelling obscurity and undigestible prolixity. I shall
   begin from the wise utterances of your reverence, setting them down
   word for word. What then are the words in which your remarkable
   teaching finds expression ?
   "The holy and great synod states that the only begotten Son, begotten
   of God the Father according to nature, true God from true God, the
   light from the light, the one through whom the Father made all things,
   came down, became incarnate, became man, suffered, rose."
   These are the words of your reverence and you may recognise them. Now
   listen to what we say, which takes the form of a brotherly exhortation
   to piety of the type of which the great apostle Paul gave an example in
   addressing his beloved Timothy: "Attend to the public reading of
   scripture, to preaching, to teaching. For by so doing you will save
   both yourself and your hearers". Tell me, what does "attend" mean? By
   reading in a superficial way the tradition of those holy men (you were
   guilty of a pardonable ignorance), you concluded that they said that
   the Word who is coeternal with the Father was passible. Please look
   more closely at their language and you will find out that that divine
   choir of fathers never said that the consubstantial godhead was capable
   of suffering, or that the whole being that was coeternal with the
   Father was recently born, or that it rose again, seeing that it had
   itself been the cause of resurrection of the destroyed temple. If you
   apply my words as fraternal medicine, I shall set the words of the holy
   fathers before you and shall free them from the slander against them
   and through them against the holy scriptures.
   "I believe", they say, "also in our Lord Jesus Christ, his only
   begotten Son". See how they first lay as foundations "Lord" and "Jesus"
   and "Christ" and "only begotten" and "Son", the names which belong
   jointly to the divinity and humanity. Then they build on that
   foundation the tradition of the incarnation and resurrection and
   passion. In this way, by prefixing the names which are common to each
   nature, they intend to avoid separating expressions applicable to
   sonship and lordship and at the same time escape the danger of
   destroying the distinctive character of the natures by absorbing them
   into the one title of "Son". In this Paul was their teacher who, when
   he remembers the divine becoming man and then wishes to introduce the
   suffering, first mentions "Christ", which, as I have just said, is the
   common name of both natures and then adds an expression which is
   appropriate to both of the natures. For what does he say ? "Have this
   mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus who though he was
   in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be
   grasped", and so on until, "he became obedient unto death, even death
   on a cross". For when he was about to mention the death, to prevent
   anyone supposing that God the Word suffered, he says "Christ", which is
   a title that expresses in one person both the impassible and the
   passible natures, in order that Christ might be called without
   impropriety both impassible and passible impassible in godhead,
   passible in the nature of his body.
   I could say much on this subject and first of all that those holy
   fathers, when they discuss the economy, speak not of the generation but
   of the Son becoming man. But I recall the promise of brevity that I
   made at the beginning and that both restrains my discourse and moves me
   on to the second subject of your reverence. In that I applaud your
   division of natures into manhood and godhead and their conjunction in
   one person. I also applaud your statement that God the Word needed no
   second generation from a woman, and your confession that the godhead is
   incapable of suffering. Such statements are truly orthodox and equally
   opposed to the evil opinions of all heretics about the Lord's natures.
   If the remainder was an attempt to introduce some hidden and
   incomprehensible wisdom to the ears of the readers, it is for your
   sharpness to decide. In my view these subsequent views seemed to
   subvert what came first. They suggested that he who had at the
   beginning been proclaimed as impassible and incapable of a second
   generation had somehow become capable of suffering and freshly created,
   as though what belonged to God the Word by nature had been destroyed by
   his conjunction with his temple or as though people considered it not
   enough that the sinless temple, which is inseparable from the divine
   nature, should have endured birth and death for sinners, or finally as
   though the Lord's voice was not deserving of credence when it cried out
   to the Jews: "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it
   up.'' He did not say, "Destroy my godhead and in three days it will be
   raised up."
   Again I should like to expand on this but am restrained by the memory
   of my promise. I must speak therefore but with brevity. Holy scripture,
   wherever it recalls the Lord's economy, speaks of the birth and
   suffering not of the godhead but of the humanity of Christ, so that the
   holy virgin is more accurately termed mother of Christ than mother of
   God. Hear these words that the gospels proclaim: "The book of the
   generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham." It is clear
   that God the Word was not the son of David. Listen to another witness
   if you will: "Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born
   Jesus, who is called the Christ. " Consider a further piece of
   evidence: "Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When
   his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, she was found to be with
   child of the holy Spirit." But who would ever consider that the godhead
   of the only begotten was a creature of the Spirit? Why do we need to
   mention: "the mother of Jesus was there"? And again what of: "with Mary
   the mother of Jesus"; or "that which is conceived in her is of the holy
   Spirit"; and "Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt"; and
   "concerning his Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the
   flesh"? Again, scripture says when speaking of his passion: "God
   sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he
   condemned sin in the flesh"; and again "Christ died for our sins" and
   "Christ having suffered in the flesh"; and "This is", not "my godhead",
   but "my body, broken for you".
   Ten thousand other expressions witness to the human race that they
   should not think that it was the godhead of the Son that was recently
   killed but the flesh which was joined to the nature of the godhead.
   (Hence also Christ calls himself the lord and son of David: " 'What do
   you think of the Christ ? Whose son is he ?' They said to him, 'The son
   of David.' Jesus answered and said to them, 'How is it then that David
   inspired by the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, "The Lord said to my
   Lord, sit at my right hand"?'". He said this as being indeed son of
   David according to the flesh, but his Lord according to his godhead.)
   The body therefore is the temple of the deity of the Son, a temple
   which is united to it in a high and divine conjunction, so that the
   divine nature accepts what belongs to the body as its own. Such a
   confession is noble and worthy of the gospel traditions. But to use the
   expression "accept as its own" as a way of diminishing the properties
   of the conjoined flesh, birth, suffering and entombment, is a mark of
   those whose minds are led astray, my brother, by Greek thinking or are
   sick with the lunacy of Apollinarius and Arius or the other heresies or
   rather something more serious than these.
   For it is necessary for such as are attracted by the name "propriety"
   to make God the Word share, because of this same propriety, in being
   fed on milk, in gradual growth, in terror at the time of his passion
   and in need of angelical assistance. I make no mention of circumcision
   and sacrifice and sweat and hunger, which all belong to the flesh and
   are adorable as having taken place for our sake. But it would be false
   to apply such ideas to the deity and would involve us in just
   accusation because of our calumny.
   These are the traditions of the holy fathers. These are the precepts of
   the holy scriptures. In this way does someone write in a godly way
   about the divine mercy and power, "Practise these duties, devote
   yourself to them, so that all may see your progress''. This is what
   Paul says to all. The care you take in labouring for those who have
   been scandalised is well taken and we are grateful to you both for the
   thought you devote to things divine and for the concern you have even
   for those who live here. But you should realise that you have been
   misled either by some here who have been deposed by the holy synod for
   Manichaeism or by clergy of your own persuasion. In fact the church
   daily progresses here and through the grace of Christ there is such an
   increase among the people that those who behold it cry out with the
   words of the prophet, "The earth will be filled with the knowledge of
   the Lord as the water covers the sea". As for our sovereigns, they are
   in great joy as the light of doctrine is spread abroad and, to be
   brief, because of the state of all the heresies that fight against God
   and of the orthodoxy of the church, one might find that verse fulfilled
   "The house of Saul grew weaker and weaker and the house of David grew
   stronger and stronger".
   This is our advice from a brother to a brother. "If anyone is disposed
   to be contentious", Paul will cry out through us to such a one, "we
   recognize no other practice, neither do the churches of God". I and
   those with me greet all the brotherhood with you in Christ. May you
   remain strong and continue praying for us, most honoured and reverent
   lord.

Third letter of Cyril to Nestorius

[Read at the council of Ephesus and included in the proceedings . We omit the
preface of the letter]

   We believe in one God . . .[Nicene Creed]
   Following in all points the confessions of the holy fathers, which they
   made with the holy Spirit speaking in them, and following the direction
   of their opinions and going as it were in the royal way, we say that
   the only-begotten Word of God, who was begotten from the very essence
   of the Father, true God from true God, the light from the light and the
   one through whom all things in heaven and earth were made, for our
   salvation came down and emptying himself he became incarnate and was
   made man. This means that
     * he took flesh from the holy virgin and made it his own, undergoing
       a birth like ours from her womb and coming forth a man from a
       woman.
     * He did not cast aside what he was, but although he assumed flesh
       and blood, he remained what he was, God in nature and truth.
     * We do not say that his flesh was turned into the nature of the
       godhead or that the unspeakable Word of God was changed into the
       nature of the flesh. For he (the Word) is unalterable and
       absolutely unchangeable and remains always the same as the
       scriptures say. For although visible as a child and in swaddling
       cloths, even while he was in the bosom of the virgin that bore him,
       as God he filled the whole of creation and was fellow ruler with
       him who begot him. For the divine is without quantity and dimension
       and cannot be subject to circumscription.

   We confess the Word to have been made one with the flesh
   hypostatically, and we adore one Son and Lord, Jesus Christ. We do not
   divide him into parts and separate man and God in him, as though the
   two natures were mutually united only through a unity of dignity and
   authority; that would be an empty expression and nothing more. Nor do
   we give the name Christ in one sense to the Word of God and in another
   to him who was born of woman, but we know only one Christ, the Word
   from God the Father with his own flesh. As man he was anointed with us,
   even though he himself gives the Spirit to those who are worthy to
   receive it and not in measure, as the blessed evangelist John says.
   But we do not say that the Word of God dwelt as in an ordinary man born
   of the holy virgin, in order that Christ may not be thought of as a
   God-bearing man. For even though "the Word dwelt among us", and it is
   also said that in Christ dwelt "all the fullness of the godhead
   bodily", we understand that, having become flesh, the manner of his
   indwelling is not defined in the same way as he is said to dwell among
   the saints, he was united by nature and not turned into flesh and he
   made his indwelling in such a way as we may say that the soul of man
   does in his own body.
   There is therefore one Christ and Son and Lord, but not with the sort
   of conjunction that a man might have with God as unity of dignity or
   authority. Equality of honour by itself is unable to unite natures. For
   Peter and John were equal in honour to each other, being both of them
   apostles and holy disciples, but they were two, not one. Neither do we
   understand the manner of conjunction to be one of juxtaposition for
   this is not enough for natural union. Nor yet is it a question of
   relative participation, as we ourselves, being united to the Lord, are
   as it is written in the words of scripture "one spirit with him".
   Rather do we deprecate the term "conjunction" as being inadequate to
   express the idea of union.
   Nor do we call the Word from God the Father, the God or Lord of Christ.
   To speak in that way would appear to split into two the one Christ and
   Son and Lord and we might in this way fall under the charge of
   blasphemy, making him the God and Lord of himself. For, as we have
   already said, the Word of God was united hypostatically with the flesh
   and is God of all and Lord of the universe, but is neither his own
   slave or master. For it is foolish or rather impious to think or to
   speak in this way. It is true that he called the Father "God" even
   though he was himself God by nature and of his being, we are not
   ignorant of the fact that at the same time as he was God he also became
   man, and so was subject to God according to the law that is suitable to
   the nature of manhood. But how should he become God or Lord of himself?
   Consequently as man and as far as it was fitting for him within the
   limits of his self-emptying it is said that he was subject to God like
   ourselves. So he came to be under the law while at the same time
   himself speaking the law and being a lawgiver like God.
   When speaking of Christ we avoid the expression: "I worship him who is
   carried because of the one who carries him; because of him who is
   unseen, I worship the one who is seen." It is shocking to say in this
   connexion: "The assumed shares the name of God with him who assumes."
   To speak in this way once again divides into two Christs and puts the
   man separately by himself and God likewise by himself. This saying
   denies openly the union, according to which one is not worshipped
   alongside the other, nor do both share in the title "God", but Jesus
   Christ is considered as one, the only begotten Son, honoured with one
   worship, together with his own flesh.
   We also confess that the only begotten Son born of God the Father,
   although according to his own nature he was not subject to suffering,
   suffered in the flesh for us according to the scriptures, and was in
   his crucified body, and without himself suffering made his own the
   sufferings of his own flesh, for "by the grace of God he tasted death
   for all". For that purpose he gave his own body to death though he was
   by nature life and the resurrection, in order that, having trodden down
   death by his own unspeakable power, he might first in his own flesh
   become the firstborn from the dead and "the first fruits of them that
   sleep". And that he might make a way for human nature to return to
   incorruption by the grace of God, as we have just said, "he tasted
   death for all" and on the third day he returned to life, having robbed
   the underworld. Accordingly, even though it is said that "through man
   came the resurrection of the dead", yet we understand that man to have
   been the Word which came from God, through whom the power of death was
   overcome. At the right time he will come as one Son and Lord in the
   glory of the Father, to judge the world in justice, as it is written.
   We will necessarily add this also. Proclaiming the death according to
   the flesh of the only begotten Son of God, that is Jesus Christ, and
   professing his return to life from the dead and his ascension into
   heaven, we offer the unbloody worship [sacrificii servitutem] in the
   churches and so proceed to the mystical thanksgivings and are
   sanctified having partaken of the holy flesh [corpus] and precious
   blood of Christ, the saviour of us all. This we receive not as ordinary
   flesh, heaven forbid, nor as that of a man who has been made holy and
   joined to the Word by union of honour, or who had a divine indwelling,
   but as truly the life-giving and real flesh of the Word [ut vere
   vivificatricem et ipsius Verbi propriam factam.]. For being life by
   nature as God, when he became one with his own flesh, he made it also
   to be life-giving, as also he said to us: "Amen I say to you, unless
   you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood" . For we must
   not think that it is the flesh of a man like us (for how can the flesh
   of man be life-giving by its own nature?), but as being made the true
   flesh [vere proprium eius factam] of the one who for our sake became
   the son of man and was called so.
   For we do not divide up the words of our Saviour in the gospels among
   two hypostases or persons. For the one and only Christ is not dual,
   even though he be considered to be from two distinct realities, brought
   together into an unbreakable union. In the same sort of way a human
   being, though he be composed of soul and body, is considered to be not
   dual, but rather one out of two. Therefore, in thinking rightly, we
   refer both the human and divine expressions to the same person. For
   when he speaks about himself in a divine manner as "he that sees me
   sees the Father", and "I and the Father are one", we think of his
   divine and unspeakable nature, according to which he is one with his
   own Father through identity of nature and is the "image and impress and
   brightness of his glory". But when, not dishonouring the measure of his
   humanity, he says to the Jews: "But now you seek to kill me, a man who
   has spoken the truth to you", again no less than before, we recognise
   that he who, because of his equality and likeness to God the Father is
   God the Word, is also within the limits of his humanity. For if it is
   necessary to believe that being God by nature he became flesh, that is
   man ensouled with a rational soul, whatever reason should anyone have
   for being ashamed at the expressions uttered by him should they happen
   to be suitable to him as man ? For if he should reject words suitable
   to him as man, who was it that forced him to become a man like us? Why
   should he who submitted himself to voluntary self-emptying for our
   sake, reject expressions that are suitable for such self-emptying? All
   the expressions, therefore, that occur in the gospels are to be
   referred to one person, the one enfleshed hypostasis of the Word. For
   there is one Lord Jesus Christ, according to the scriptures.
   Even though he is called "the apostle and high priest of our
   confession", as offering to the God and Father the confession of faith
   we make to him and through him to the God and Father and also to the
   holy Spirit, again we say that he is the natural and only-begotten Son
   of God and we shall not assign to another man apart from him the name
   and reality of priesthood. For he became the "mediator between God and
   humanity" and the establisher of peace between them, offering himself
   for an odour of sweetness to the God and Father. Therefore also he
   said: "Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body you have
   prepared for me; [in burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin you have no
   pleasure]. Then I said, 'Behold I come to do your will, O God', as it
   is written of me in the volume of the book". For our sake and not for
   his own he brought forward his own body in the odour of sweetness.
   Indeed, of what offering or sacrifice for himself would he have been in
   need, being as God superior to all manner of sin? For though "all have
   sinned and fall short of the glory of God", and so we are prone to
   disorder and human nature has fallen into the weakness of sin, he is
   not so and consequently we are behind him in glory. How then can there
   be any further doubt that the true lamb was sacrificed for us and on
   our behalf? The suggestion that he offered himself for himself as well
   as for us is impossible to separate from the charge of impiety. For he
   never committed a fault at all, nor did he sin in any way. What sort of
   offering would he need then since there was no sin for which offering
   might rightly be made?
   When he says of the Spirit, "he will glorify me", the correct
   understanding of this is not to say that the one Christ and Son was in
   need of glory from another and that he took glory from the holy Spirit,
   for his Spirit is not better than he nor above him. But because he used
   his own Spirit to display his godhead through his mighty works, he says
   that he has been glorified by him, just as if any one of us should
   perhaps say for example of his inherent strength or his knowledge of
   anything that they glorify him. For even though the Spirit exists in
   his own hypostasis and is thought of on his own, as being Spirit and
   not as Son, even so he is not alien to the Son. He has been called "the
   Spirit of truth", and Christ is the truth, and the Spirit was poured
   forth by the Son, as indeed the Son was poured forth from the God and
   Father. Accordingly the Spirit worked many strange things through the
   hand of the holy apostles and so glorified him after the ascension of
   our lord Jesus Christ into heaven. For it was believed that he is God
   by nature and works through his own Spirit. For this reason also he
   said: "He (the Spirit) will take what is mine and declare it to you".
   But we do not say that the Spirit is wise and powerful through some
   sharing with another, for he is all perfect and in need of no good
   thing. Since he is the Spirit of the power and wisdom of the Father,
   that is the Son, he is himself, evidently, wisdom and power.
   Therefore, because the holy virgin bore in the flesh God who was united
   hypostatically with the flesh, for that reason we call her mother of
   God, not as though the nature of the Word had the beginning of its
   existence from the flesh (for "the Word was in the beginning and the
   Word was God and the Word was with God", and he made the ages and is
   coeternal with the Father and craftsman of all things), but because, as
   we have said, he united to himself hypostatically the human and
   underwent a birth according to the flesh from her womb. This was not as
   though he needed necessarily or for his own nature a birth in time and
   in the last times of this age, but in order that he might bless the
   beginning of our existence, in order that seeing that it was a woman
   that had given birth to him united to the flesh, the curse against the
   whole race should thereafter cease which was consigning all our earthy
   bodies to death, and in order that the removal through him of the
   curse, "In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children", should demonstrate
   the truth of the words of the prophet: "Strong death swallowed them
   Up", and again, "God has wiped every tear away from all face". It is
   for this cause that we say that in his economy he blessed marriage and,
   when invited, went down to Cana in Galilee with his holy apostles.
   We have been taught to hold these things by
     * the holy apostles and evangelists and by
     * all the divinely inspired scriptures and by the true confession of
     * the blessed fathers.

   To all these your reverence ought to agree and subscribe without any
   deceit. What is required for your reverence to anathematise we subjoin
   to this epistle.
   Twelve Anathemas Proposed by Cyril and accepted by the Council of
   Ephesus
   1. If anyone does not confess that Emmanuel is God in truth, and
   therefore that the holy virgin is the mother of God (for she bore in a
   fleshly way the Word of God become flesh, let him be anathema.
   2. If anyone does not confess that the Word from God the Father has
   been united by hypostasis with the flesh and is one Christ with his own
   flesh, and is therefore God and man together, let him be anathema.
   3. If anyone divides in the one Christ the hypostases after the union,
   joining them only by a conjunction of dignity or authority or power,
   and not rather by a coming together in a union by nature, let him be
   anathema.
   4. If anyone distributes between the two persons or hypostases the
   expressions used either in the gospels or in the apostolic writings,
   whether they are used by the holy writers of Christ or by him about
   himself, and ascribes some to him as to a man, thought of separately
   from the Word from God, and others, as befitting God, to him as to the
   Word from God the Father, let him be anathema.
   5. If anyone dares to say that Christ was a God-bearing man and not
   rather God in truth, being by nature one Son, even as "the Word became
   flesh", and is made partaker of blood and flesh precisely like us, let
   him be anathema.
   6. If anyone says that the Word from God the Father was the God or
   master of Christ, and does not rather confess the same both God and
   man, the Word having become flesh, according to the scriptures, let him
   be anathema.
   7. If anyone says that as man Jesus was activated by the Word of God
   and was clothed with the glory of the Only-begotten, as a being
   separate from him, let him be anathema.
   8. If anyone dares to say that the man who was assumed ought to be
   worshipped and glorified together with the divine Word and be called
   God along with him, while being separate from him, (for the addition of
   "with" must always compel us to think in this way), and will not rather
   worship Emmanuel with one veneration and send up to him one doxology,
   even as "the Word became flesh", let him be anathema.
   9. If anyone says that the one Lord Jesus Christ was glorified by the
   Spirit, as making use of an alien power that worked through him and as
   having received from him the power to master unclean spirits and to
   work divine wonders among people, and does not rather say that it was
   his own proper Spirit through whom he worked the divine wonders, let
   him be anathema.
   10. The divine scripture says Christ became "the high priest and
   apostle of our confession"; he offered himself to God the Father in an
   odour of sweetness for our sake. If anyone, therefore, says that it was
   not the very Word from God who became our high priest and apostle, when
   he became flesh and a man like us, but as it were another who was
   separate from him, in particular a man from a woman, or if anyone says
   that he offered the sacrifice also for himself and not rather for us
   alone (for he who knew no sin needed no offering), let him be
   anathema.
   11. If anyone does not confess that the flesh of the Lord is
   life-giving and belongs to the Word from God the Father, but maintains
   that it belongs to another besides him, united with him in dignity or
   as enjoying a mere divine indwelling, and is not rather life-giving, as
   we said, since it became the flesh belonging to the Word who has power
   to bring all things to life, let him be anathema.
   12. If anyone does not confess that the Word of God suffered in the
   flesh and was crucified in the flesh and tasted death in the flesh and
   became the first born of the dead, although as God he is life and
   life-giving, let him be anathema.

The judgment against Nestorius

   The holy synod said: As, in addition to all else, the excellent
   Nestorius has declined to obey our summons and has not received the
   holy and God-fearing bishops we sent to him, we have of necessity
   started upon an investigation of his impieties. We have found him out
   thinking and speaking in an impious fashion, from his letters, from his
   writings that have been read out, and from the things that he has
   recently said in this metropolis which have been witnessed to by
   others; and as a result we have been compelled of necessity both by
     * the canons
     * and by the letter of our most holy father and fellow servant
       Celestine, bishop of the church of the Romans, to issue this sad
       condemnation against him, though we do so with many tears.

   Our lord Jesus Christ, who has been blasphemed by him, has determined
   through this most holy synod that the same Nestorius should be stripped
   of his episcopal dignity and removed from the college of priests.
   _______________________________________________________________________

Synodical letter about the expulsion of the eastern bishops (et al.)

   The holy and ecumenical synod, gathered together in Ephesus at the
   behest of the most pious princes, [sends greeting] to the bishops,
   priests, deacons and the whole people in every province and city.
   When we had gathered together in accordance with the pious decree in
   the metropolis of Ephesus, some separated themselves from us, a little
   more than thirty in number. The leader of this apostasy was John,
   bishop of Antioch, and their names are as follows: First the same John,
   bishop of Antioch in Syria, [the names of 33 other eastern bishops
   follow]
   These men, despite the fact that they were members of the
   ecclesiastical community, had no licence either to do harm through
   their priestly dignity or to do good, because some among their number
   had already been deposed. Their support of the views of Nestorius and
   Celestius was clearly shown by their refusal to condemn Nestorius
   together with us. By a common decree the sacred synod has expelled them
   from ecclesiastical communion and deprived them of the exercise of
   their priestly office, through which they have been able to harm some
   and help others.
   Since it is necessary that those who were absent from the synod and
   remained in the country or the city, on account of their own church
   affairs or because of their health, should not be ignorant of the
   decisions formulated concerning these matters, we make it known to your
   holinesses that if any metropolitan of a province dissents from the
   holy and ecumenical synod and attaches himself to the assembly of the
   revolters, or should do so later, or should he have adopted the
   opinions of Celestius, or do so in the future, such a one is deprived
   of all power to take steps against the bishops of his province. He is
   thereby cast out by the synod from all ecclesiastical communion and is
   deprived of all ecclesiastical authority. Instead he is to be subjected
   to the bishops of his own province and the surrounding metropolitans,
   provided they be orthodox, even to the extent of being completely
   deposed from the rank of bishop.
   If any provincial bishops have absented themselves from the holy synod
   and have either attached themselves or attempted to attach themselves
   to the apostasy, or after subscribing the deposition of Nestorius have
   returned to the assembly of apostates, these, according to the decision
   of the holy synod, are to be deprived of the priesthood and deposed
   from their rank.
   If any clerics either in city or country have been suspended by
   Nestorius and those with him from their priesthood because of their
   orthodoxy, we have thought it right that these should regain their
   proper rank; and in general we decree that those clerics who are in
   agreement with the orthodox and ecumenical synod should in no way be
   subject to those bishops who have revolted or may revolt from it. If
   any clerics should apostatise and in private or in public dare to hold
   the views of Nestorius or Celestius, it is thought right that such
   should stand deposed by the holy synod.
   Whoever have been condemned of improper practices by the holy synod or
   by their own bishops, and have been uncanonically restored to communion
   and rank by Nestorius or his sympathisers, with their habitual lack of
   discrimination, such persons we have decreed gain nothing by this and
   are to remain deposed as before.
   Similarly if anyone should wish in any way to upset the decisions in
   each point taken in the holy synod of Ephesus, the holy synod decides
   that if they are bishops or clerics they should be completely deprived
   of their own rank and if they are laity they should be excommunicated.

Definition of the faith at Nicaea [6th session 22 July 431]

   The synod of Nicaea produced this creed: We believe ... [the Nicene
   Creed follows]
   It seems fitting that all should assent to this holy creed. It is pious
   and sufficiently helpful for the whole world. But since some pretend to
   confess and accept it, while at the same time distorting the force of
   its expressions to their own opinion and so evading the truth, being
   sons of error and children of destruction, it has proved necessary to
   add testimonies from the holy and orthodox fathers that can fill out
   the meaning they have given to the words and their courage in
   proclaiming it. All those who have a clear and blameless faith will
   understand, interpret and proclaim it in this way.
   When these documents had been read out, the holy synod decreed the
   following:
    1. It is not permitted to produce or write or compose any other creed
       except the one which was defined by the holy fathers who were
       gathered together in the holy Spirit at Nicaea.
    2. Any who dare to compose or bring forth or produce another creed for
       the benefit of those who wish to turn from Hellenism or Judaism or
       some other heresy to the knowledge of the truth, if they are
       bishops or clerics they should be deprived of their respective
       charges and if they are laymen they are to be anathematised.
    3. In the same way if any should be discovered, whether bishops,
       clergy or laity, thinking or teaching the views expressed in his
       statement by the priest Charisius about the incarnation of the
       only-begotten Son of God or the disgusting, perverted views of
       Nestorius, which underlie them, these should be subject to the
       condemnation of this holy and ecumenical synod. A bishop clearly is
       to be stripped of his bishopric and deposed, a cleric to be deposed
       from the clergy, and a lay person is to be anathematised, as was
       said before.
   _______________________________________________________________________

Definition against the impious Messalians or Euchites

   The most pious and religious bishops Valerian and Amphilochius came
   together to us and made a joint enquiry about the so called Messalians
   or Euchites or Enthusiasts, or whatever name this appalling heresy goes
   under, who dwell in the region of Pamphylia. We made investigation and
   the god-fearing and reverent Valerian produced a synodical document
   concerning these people, which had been drawn up in great
   Constantinople in the time of Sisinnius of blessed memory. When this
   had been read out in the presence of all, it was agreed that it had
   been well made and was correct. We all agreed, as did the most
   religious bishops Valerian and Amphilochius and all the pious bishops
   of the provinces of Pamphylia and Lycaonia, that what had been
   inscribed in the synodical document should be confirmed and in no way
   disobeyed, clearly without prejudice to the acts of Alexandria.
   Consequently those anywhere in that province who subscribed to the
   heresy of the Messalians or Enthusiasts, or who were suspected of the
   disease, whether clerical or lay, are to come together; if they sign
   the anathemas according to what was promulgated in the aforementioned
   synod, should they be clergy they should remain such and if laity they
   are to remain in communion. But if they decline and do not
   anathematise, if they are presbyters or deacons or hold any other rank
   in the church, they are to forfeit their clerical status and grade and
   communion, and if they are laity let them be anathematised.
   In addition, those who have been condemned are not to be permitted to
   govern monasteries, lest tares be sown and increase. The vigorous and
   zealous execution of all these decrees is enjoined upon the reverent
   bishops Valerian and Amphilochius and the other reverent bishops
   throughout the whole province. Furthermore it seemed good that the
   filthy book of this heresy, which has been published and is called by
   them Asceticon, should be anathematised, as being composed by heretics,
   a copy of which the most pious and religious Valerian brought with him.
   Any other production savouring of the like impiety which is found
   anywhere is to be treated similarly.
   In addition, when they come together, they should commit clearly to
   writing whatever conduces to the creation of concord, communion and
   order. But if any discussion should arise in connexion with the present
   business among the most godly bishops Valerian, Amphilochius and the
   other reverent bishops in the province, and if something difficult or
   ambiguous crops up, then in such a case it seems good that the godly
   bishops of Lycia and Lycaonia should be brought in, and the
   metropolitan of whatever province these choose should not be left out.
   In this way the disputed questions should through their means be
   brought to an appropriate solution.
   _______________________________________________________________________

Resolution : that the bishops of Cyprus may themselves conduct ordinations.

   The holy synod declared:
   The most reverent bishop Rheginus and with him Zenon and Evagrius,
   revered bishops of the province of Cyprus, have brought forward what is
   both an innovation against the ecclesiastical customs and the canons of
   the holy fathers and concerns the freedom of all. Therefore, since
   common diseases need more healing as they bring greater harm with them,
   if it has not been a continuous ancient custom for the bishop of
   Antioch to hold ordinations in Cyprus--as it is asserted in memorials
   and orally by the religious men who have come before the synod -- the
   prelates of the holy churches of Cyprus shall, free from molestation
   and violence, use their right to perform by themselves the ordination
   of reverent bishops for their island, according to the canons of the
   holy fathers and the ancient custom.
   The same principle will be observed for other dioceses and provinces
   everywhere. None of the reverent bishops is to take possession of
   another province which has not been under his authority from the first
   or under that of his predecessors. Any one who has thus seized upon and
   subjected a province is to restore it, lest the canons of the fathers
   be transgressed and the arrogance of secular power effect an entry
   through the cover of priestly office. We must avoid bit by bit
   destroying the freedom which our lord Jesus Christ the liberator of all
   people, gave us through his own blood. It is therefore the pleasure of
   the holy and ecumenical synod to secure intact and inviolate the rights
   belonging to each province from the first, according to the custom
   which has been in force from of old. Each metropolitan has the right to
   take a copy of the proceedings for his own security. If any one
   produces a version which is at variance with what is here decided, the
   holy and ecumenical synod unanimously decrees it to be of no avail.

Formula of union between Cyrill and John of Antioch

   We will state briefly what we are convinced of and profess about
     * the God-bearing virgin and
     * the manner of the incarnation of the only begotten Son of God --
          + not by way of addition but in the manner of a full statement,
            even as we have received and possess it from of old from
          + the holy scriptures and from
          + the tradition of the holy fathers,
          + adding nothing at all to the creed put forward by the holy
            fathers at Nicaea.

   For, as we have just said, that creed is sufficient both for the
   knowledge of godliness and for the repudiation of all heretical false
   teaching. We shall speak not presuming to approach the unapproachable;
   but we confess our own weakness and so shut out those who would
   reproach us for investigating things beyond the human mind.
   We confess, then, our lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God
   perfect God and perfect man of a rational soul and a body, begotten
   before all ages from the Father in his godhead, the same in the last
   days, for us and for our salvation, born of Mary the virgin, according
   to his humanity, one and the same consubstantial with the Father in
   godhead and consubstantial with us in humanity, for a union of two
   natures took place. Therefore we confess one Christ, one Son, one Lord.
   According to this understanding of the unconfused union, we confess the
   holy virgin to be the mother of God because God the Word took flesh and
   became man and from his very conception united to himself the temple he
   took from her. As to the evangelical and apostolic expressions about
   the Lord, we know that theologians treat some in common as of one
   person and distinguish others as of two natures, and interpret the
   god-befitting ones in connexion with the godhead of Christ and the
   lowly ones with his humanity.

Letter of Cyril to John of Antioch about peace

   Having read these holy phrases and finding ourselves in agreement (for
   "there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism"), we have given glory to
   God who is the saviour of all and rejoice together that our churches
   and yours are at one in professing the same faith as the inspired
   scriptures and the tradition of our holy fathers. But since I
   discovered that there are some always eager to find fault, who buzz
   around like angry wasps and spit forth evil words against me, to the
   effect that I say that the holy body of Christ came down from heaven
   and not from the holy virgin, I thought it necessary in answer to them
   to say a little about this matter to you.
   O fools, whose only competence is in slander! How did you become so
   perverted in thought and fall into such a sickness of idiocy? For you
   must surely know that almost all our fight for the faith arose in
   connexion with our insistence that the holy virgin is the mother of
   God. But if we claim that the holy body of our common saviour Christ is
   born from heaven and was not of her, why should she still be considered
   God-bearer? For whom indeed did she bear, if it is untrue that she bore
   Emmanuel according to the flesh? It is rather they who speak such
   nonsense against me who deserve to be ridiculed. For the holy prophet
   Isaiah does not lie when he says, "Behold a virgin shall conceive and
   bear a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted
   God with us". Again the holy Gabriel speaks total truth when he says to
   the blessed virgin: "Do not fear, Mary. You have found favour with God,
   and behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you will
   call his name Jesus . For he will save his people from their sins".
   But when we say that our lord Jesus Christ came from heaven and above,
   we do not apply such expressions as "from above" and "from heaven" to
   his holy flesh. Rather do we follow the divine Paul who clearly
   proclaimed: "The first man was of the earth, earthly, the second man is
   the Lord from heaven".
   We also recall our Saviour who said: "No one has gone up into heaven
   except him who came down from heaven, the son of man". Yet he was born,
   as I have just said, from the holy virgin according to the flesh.
   But since God the Word, who came down from above and from heaven,
   "emptied himself, taking the form of a slave", and was called son of
   man though all the while he remained what he was, that is God (for he
   is unchangeable and immutable by nature), he is said to have come down
   from heaven, since he is now understood to be one with his own flesh,
   and he has therefore been designated the man from heaven, being both
   perfect in godhead and perfect in humanity and thought of as in one
   person. For there is one lord Jesus Christ, even though we do not
   ignore the difference of natures, out of which we say that the
   ineffable union was effected. As for those who say that there was a
   mixture or confusion or blending of God the Word with the flesh, let
   your holiness see fit to stop their mouths. For it is quite likely that
   some should spread it abroad that I have thought or said such things.
   But I am so far from thinking anything of the kind that I think that
   those are quite mad who suppose that "a shadow of change" is
   conceivable in connexion with the divine nature of the Word. For he
   remains what he is always and never changes, nor could he ever change
   or be susceptible of it. Furthermore we all confess that the Word of
   God is impassible though in his all-wise economy of the mystery he is
   seen to attribute to himself the sufferings undergone by his own flesh.
   So the all-wise Peter speaks of "Christ suffering for us in the flesh"
   and not in the nature of his unspeakable godhead. For in order that he
   might be believed to be the saviour of all, in accordance with our
   economic appropriation, as I said, he refers to himself the sufferings
   of his own flesh, in much the same way as is suggested through the
   voice of the prophet coming as it were from him in advance: "I gave my
   back to the smiters and my cheeks to blows; I hid not my face from
   shame and spitting" .
   Let your holiness be persuaded and let no one else cherish any doubt,
   that we everywhere follow the opinions of the holy fathers especially
   those of our blessed and glorious father Athanasius, with whose
   opinions we differ not in the slightest. I would have added many of
   their testimonies, proving my opinions from theirs, had I not feared
   that the length of the letter would be made tedious thereby. We do not
   permit anyone in any way to upset the defined faith or the creed drawn
   up by the holy fathers who assembled at Nicaea as the times demanded.
   We give neither ourselves nor them the licence to alter any expression
   there or to change a single syllable, remembering the words: "Remove
   not the ancient landmarks which your fathers have set".
   For it was not they that spoke, but the Spirit of God the Father, who
   proceeds from him and who is not distinct from the Son in essence. We
   are further confirmed in our view by the words of our holy spiritual
   teachers. For in the Acts of the Apostles it is written: "When they
   came to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia and the Spirit of Jesus did
   not permit them". And the divine Paul writes as follows: "Those who are
   in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, you are
   in the spirit, if the Spirit of God really dwells in you. And anyone
   who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him". When,
   therefore, any of those who love to upset sound doctrine pervert my
   words to their way of thinking, your holiness should not be surprised
   at this, but should remember that the followers of every heresy extract
   from inspired scripture the occasion of their error, and that all
   heretics corrupt the true expressions of the holy Spirit with their own
   evil minds and they draw down on their own heads an inextinguishable
   flame.
   Since therefore we have learnt that even the letter of our glorious
   father Athanasius to the blessed Epictetus, which is completely
   orthodox, has been corrupted and circulated by some, with the result
   that many have been injured therefore, thinking it both useful and
   necessary for the brethren, we have despatched to your holiness
   accurate copies of the original, unadulterated writings which we have.

Excerpt from the Council of Chalcedon

   The Council of Chalcedon "has accepted the synodical letters of the
   blessed Cyril, pastor of the church in Alexandria, to Nestorius and to
   the Orientals, as being well-suited to refuting Nestorius's mad folly
   and to providing an interpretation for those who in their religious
   zeal might desire understanding of the saving creed.".
