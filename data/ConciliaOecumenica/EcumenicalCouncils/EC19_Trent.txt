The General Council of Trent, 1545-63

   THE BULL OF INDICTION
   OF THE SACRED OECUMENICAL AND GENERAL COUNCIL OF TRENT
   UNDER THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, PAUL III
   PAUL, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the future memory
   hereof.
   At the beginning of this our pontificate,--which, not for any merits of
   our own, but of its own great goodness, the providence of Almighty God
   hath committed unto us,--already perceiving unto what troubled times,
   and unto how many embarrassments in almost all our affairs, our
   pastoral solicitude and watchfulness were called; we would fain indeed
   have remedied the evils wherewith the Christian commonweal had been
   long afflicted, and well-nigh overwhelmed; but we too, as men compassed
   with infirmity, felt our strength unequal to take upon us so heavy a
   burthen. For, whereas we saw that peace was needful to free and
   preserve the commonweal from the many impending dangers, we found all
   replete with enmities and dissensions; and, above all, the (two)
   princes, to whom God has entrusted well-nigh the whole direction of
   events, at enmity with each other. Whereas we deemed it necessary that
   there should be one fold and one shepherd, for the Lord's flock in
   order to [Page 2] maintain the Christian religion in its integrity, and
   to confirm within us the hope of heavenly things; the unity of the
   Christian name was rent and well-nigh torn asunder by schisms,
   dissensions, heresies. Whereas we could have wished to see the
   commonwealth safe and guarded against the arms and insidious designs of
   the Infidels, yet, through our transgressions and the guilt of us
   all,--the wrath of God assuredly hanging over our sins,--Rhodes had
   been lost; Hungary ravaged; war both by land and sea had been
   contemplated and planned against Italy, Austria, and Illyria; whilst
   our impious and ruthless enemy the Turk was never at rest, and looked
   upon our mutual enmities and dissensions as his fitting opportunity for
   carrying out his designs with success. Wherefore, having been, as we
   have said, called upon to guide and govern the bark of Peter, in so
   great a tempest, and in the midst of so violent an agitation of the
   waves of heresies, dissensions, and wars; and, not relying sufficiently
   on our own strength, we, first of all, cast our cares upon the Lord,
   that He might sustain us, and furnish our soul with firmness and
   strength, our understanding with prudence and wisdom. Then, recalling
   to mind that our predecessors, men endowed with admirable wisdom and
   sanctity, had often, in the extremest perils of the Christian
   commonweal, had recourse to ecumenical councils and general assemblies
   of bishops, as the best and most opportune remedy, we also fixed our
   mind on holding a general council; and having consulted the opinions of
   those princes whose consent seemed to us to be specially useful and
   opportune for this our project; when we found them, at that time, not
   averse from so holy a work, we, as our letters and records attest,
   indicted an ecumenical council, and a general assembly of those bishops
   and other Fathers whose duty it is to assist thereat, to be opened at
   the city of Mantua, on the tenth of the calends of June, in the year
   1537 of our Lord's Incarnation, and the third of our pontificate;
   having an almost assured hope that, when assembled there in the name of
   the Lord, He, as He promised, would be in the midst of us, and, in His
   goodness and mercy, easily dispel, by the breath of His [Page 3] mouth,
   all the storms and dangers of the times. But,--as the enemy of mankind
   ever sets his snares against holy enterprises, --at the very outset,
   contrary to all our hopes and expectations, the city of Mantua was
   refused us, unless we would submit to certain conditions,--as described
   in other letters of ours,--which conditions were utterly alien to the
   institutes of our predecessors, to the state of the times, to our own
   dignity and liberty, that of this holy see, and of the ecclesiastical
   character. We were, therefore, necessitated to find another place, and
   to make choice of some other city ; andwhereas one fit and suitable did
   not immediately present itself, we were obliged to prorogue the
   celebration of the council unto the ensuing calends of November.
   Meanwhile the Turk, our cruel and perpetual enemy, attacked Italy with
   a vast fleet; took, sacked, ravaged several cities of Apulia, and
   carried off numbers into captivity; whilst we, in the midst of the
   greatest alarm, and the general danger, were engaged in fortifying our
   shores, and in furnishing assistance to the neighbouring states. But
   not therefore did we meanwhile cease to consult with the Christian
   princes, and to exhort them to inform us, what, in their opinion, would
   be a suitable place wherein to hold the council: and whereas their
   opinions were various and wavering, and there seemed to be needless
   delay, we, with the best intentions, and, as we also think, with the
   most judicious prudence, fixed on Vicenza, a wealthy city granted to us
   by the Venetians, and which, by their valour, authority, and power,
   offered in a special manner both unobstructed access, and a safe and
   free place of residence for all. But, as too much of the time appointed
   had already passed away; and it was necessary to signify to all the
   fresh city that had been chosen; and, whereas the approaching calends
   of November precluded our having the opportunity of making the
   announcement of this change public, and winter was now near; we were
   again constrained to defer, by another prorogation, the time for
   opening the Council, to the next ensuing Spring, that is, to the next
   calends of May. This having been firmly resolved upon and decreed;
   considering,--whilst preparing ourselves, and [Page 4] arranging all
   other matters for conducting and celebrating that assembly in a proper
   manner under the divine assistance,--that it was a point of great
   importance, both as regards the celebration of the Council, and the
   general weal of Christendom, that the Christian princes should be
   united together in peace and concord; We ceased not to implore and
   conjure our most beloved sons in Christ, Charles, ever August, the
   emperor of the Romans, and Francis, the most Christian king, the two
   main supports and stays of the Christian name, to meet together for a
   conference between them and us; and, with both of them, by letters,
   Nuncios, and our Legates a latere selected from amongst our venerable
   brethren, did we very often strive to move them to lay aside their
   jealousies and animosities; to unite in strict alliance and holy
   friendship; and to succour the tottering cause of Christendom: for as
   it was to preserve this especially, that God had bestowed on them their
   power, if they neglected to do this, and directed not all their
   counsels to the common weal of Christians, a bitter and severe account
   would they have to render unto Him. They, yielding at last to our
   prayers, repaired to Nice; whither we also, for the cause of God and to
   bring about peace, undertook a long journey, though sorely unsuited to
   our advanced age. Meanwhile, as the time fixed for the Council,--the
   calends to wit of May,--drew nigh, we did not neglect to send to
   Vicenza three Legates a latere,--men of the greatest virtue and
   authority, chosen from the number of our own brethren, the cardinals of
   the holy Roman Church,--to open the Council; to receive the prelates as
   they arrived from various parts; and to transact and attend to such
   matters as they should deem necessary, until we, on our return from our
   journey and message of peace, should be able ourselves to direct
   everything with greater precision. We, in the mean time, applied
   ourselves to that holy and most necessary work, the negotiation of
   peace; and this with all the zeal, the affection, and the earnestness
   of our soul. God is our witness, on whose clemency we relied, when we
   exposed ourselves to the dangers of that journey at the peril of our
   life: our conscience is our witness, which herein, at least, cannot
   reproach us with having either neglected, or not sought for, an
   opportunity of effecting a reconciliation: the [Page 5] princes
   themselves are our witnesses, whom we so often and so earnestly
   conjured by our Nuncios, letters, legates, admonitions, exhortations,
   and by all kinds of entreaties, to lay aside their jealousies, to unite
   in alliance, and with combined zeal and forces to succour the Christian
   commonweal, which was now reduced to the greatest and most urgent
   danger. And witnesses too are those watchings and cares, those labours
   of our soul both by day and night, and those grievous solicitudes,
   which we have already endured to such an extent in this business and
   cause; and yet our councils and acts have not as yet brought about the
   wished-for result. For so hath it seemed good to the Lord our God, who,
   however, we still hope will cast a more favourable eye on our wishes.
   For ourselves, we, as far as in us lay, have not, indeed, herein
   omitted anything that was due from our pastoral office. And if there be
   any who interpret in any other sense our endeavours after peace, we are
   indeed grieved; but, in our grief, we return thanks to that Almighty
   God, who, as a pattern and a lesson of patience unto us, willed that
   His own apostles should be accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the
   name of Jesus who is our peace. However, in that our meeting and
   conference at Nice, though, by reason of our sins, a true and lasting
   peace could not be concluded between the two princes, yet was a truce
   for ten years agreed upon; under favour of which having our hopes, that
   both the sacred council might be celebrated more commodiously, and
   further that peace might be perfectly established by the authority of
   the council, we were urgent with those princes to come themselves to
   the council, to bring with them those of their prelates who accompanied
   them, and to summon the absent. They having excused themselves upon
   both these points,--for that it was at that time, necessary for them to
   return to their kingdoms, and that the prelates whom they had with
   them, being wearied and exhausted by the journey and its expenses, must
   needs refresh and recruit themselves,--exhorted us to decree yet
   another prorogation of the time for opening the council. And whereas we
   had some difficulty to yield herein, in the interim we received letters
   from our legates [Page 6] at Vicenza, announcing that, although the day
   for opening the council had arrived, nay had long since passed by,
   barely one or two prelates had repaired to Vicenza from any of the
   foreign nations. Upon receiving this information, seeing that the
   council could not, under any circumstances, be held at that time, we
   accorded to the said princes, that the time for celebrating the council
   should be deferred till next holy Easter, the feast of the Resurrection
   of the Lord. Of which our ordinance and prorogation, the decretal
   letters were given and published at Genoa, in the year of the
   Incarnation of our Lord, MDXXXVIII, on the fourth of the calends of
   July. And this delay we granted the more readily, because each of the
   princes promised us to send an ambassador to us at Rome; in order that
   those things which were necessary for the perfect re-establishment of
   peace,--all of which could not, on account of the shortness of the
   time, be completed at Nice,--might be treated of and negotiated more
   conveniently at Rome in our presence. And for this reason also, they
   both begged of us, that the negotiation of peace might precede the
   celebration of the council; for that, peace once established, the
   council itself would then be much more useful and salutary to the
   Christian commonweal. It was, indeed, this hope of peace, thus held out
   to us, that ever moved us to assent to the wishes of those princes; a
   hope which was greatly increased by the kindly and friendly interview
   between those two princes after our departure from Nice; the news of
   which was to us a source of very great joy, and so confirmed us in our
   good hope, that we believed that God, at length, had hearkened to our
   prayers, and had graciously received our earnest wishes for peace. The
   conclusion, then, of this peace was both desired and urged; and as it
   was the opinion not only of the two princes aforenamed, but also of our
   most dear son in Christ, Ferdinand, King of the Romans, that the
   business of the council ought not to be entered upon until after peace
   had been established; whilst all the parties urged upon us, by letters
   and their ambassadors, again to appoint a further prorogation of the
   time; and the most serene emperor was especially urgent, representing
   that he had promised those who dissent from Catholic unity, that he
   would interpose his mediation with us, to the end that some plan of
   [Page 7] concord might be devised, which could not be accomplished
   satisfactorily before his return to Germany: impelled throughout by the
   same desire of peace, and by the wishes of so mighty princes, and,
   above all, seeing that not even on the said feast of the Resurrection
   had any other prelates assembled at Vicenza, we, now avoiding the word
   prorogation, so often repeated in vain, chose rather to suspend the
   celebration of the general council during our own good pleasure, and
   that of the Apostolic See. We accordingly did so, and despatched our
   letters touching such suspension to each of the above-named princes, on
   the tenth day of June, MDXXXIX, as from the tenor thereof may be
   clearly seen. This necessary suspension, then, having been made by us,
   whilst we were looking forward to that more suitable time, and to that
   conclusion of peace which was later to bring both dignity and numbers
   to the council, and more immediate safety to the Christian commonweal;
   the affairs of Christendom meanwhile fell day by day into a worse
   state. The Hungarians, upon the death of their king, had invited the
   Turk; King Ferdinand had declared war against them; a part of Belgium
   had been incited to revolt against the most serene emperor, who, to
   crush that rebellion, traversed France on the most friendly and
   harmonious terms with the most Christian king, and with great show of
   mutual good will towards each other; and, having reached Belgium,
   thence passed into Germany, where he commenced holding diets of the
   princes and cities of Germany, with the view of treating of that
   concord of which he had spoken to us. But as there was now no longer
   scarcely any hope of peace, and the scheme of procuring and treating of
   a re-union in those diets seemed only adapted to excite greater
   discord, we were led to revert to our former remedy, a general council;
   and, by our legates, cardinals of the holy Roman Church, we proposed
   this to the emperor himself; and this we did especially and finally in
   the diet of Ratisbon, at which our beloved son, Cardinal Gaspar
   Contarini, of the title of St. Praxedes, acted as our legate with very
   great learning and integrity. For, whereas what we had previously
   feared now come to pass,--that by the advice of that diet we were
   called upon to declare that certain of the articles, maintained by the
   dissenters from the Church, were to be tolerated until they should be
   examined and decided upon [Page 8] by an ecumenical council; and
   whereas neither Christian and Catholic truth, nor our own dignity and
   that of the Apostolic See, would suffer us to yield this,---we chose
   rather to command that a proposal should be openly made, that a council
   should be held as soon as possible. Nor, indeed, had we ever any other
   sentiment or wish, but that an ecumenical and general council should be
   convened on the very first opportunity. For we hoped that both peace
   might thereby be restored to the Christian people, and to the Christian
   religion its integrity; yet were we wishful to hold that council with
   the good wishes and favour of the Christian princes. And whilst looking
   forward to those good wishes, whilst watching for that hidden time, for
   the time of thy good pleasure, 0 God, we were at last forced to the
   conclusion, that every time is well pleasing unto God wherein
   deliberations are entered upon touching holy things, and such as relate
   to Christian piety. Wherefore, upon beholding with the bitterest grief
   of soul, that the affairs of Christendom were daily hurrying on to a
   worse state; Hungary overwhelmed by the Turk; Germany endangered; all
   the other states oppressed with terror and affliction; we resolved to
   wait no longer for the consent of any prince, but to look solely to the
   will of God, and the good of the Christian commonweal. Accordingly, as
   we no longer had the city of Vicenza, and were desirous, in our choice
   of a fresh place for holding the council, to have regard both to the
   common welfare of Christians, and also to the troubles of the German
   nation; and seeing, upon several places being proposed, that they (the
   Germans) wished for the city of Trent, we,---though of opinion that
   every thing might be transacted more commodiously in Cisalpine
   Italy,---nevertheless yielded up our will, with paternal charity, to
   their demands. Accordingly, we have chosen the city of Trent as that
   wherein an ecumenical council is to be held on the ensuing calends of
   November: fixing upon that place as a convenient one whereat the
   bishops and prelates can assemble very easily indeed from Germany, and
   from the other nations bordering on Germany, and without difficulty
   from France, Spain, and the other remoter provinces. And in fixing
   [Page 9] the day for the council, we have had regard that there should
   be time both for publishing this our decree throughout the Christian
   nations, and for allowing all prelates an opportunity of repairing to
   Trent. Our motive for not prescribing that a whole year should expire
   before changing the place of the council,--as by certain constitutions
   has been aforetime regulated,---was this, that we were unwilling that
   our hope should be any longer delayed of applying some remedy to the
   Christian commonwealth, suffering as it is under so many disasters and
   calamities. And yet we observe the times; we acknowledge the
   difficulties. We know that what may be looked for from our councils is
   a matter of uncertainty. But, seeing that it is written, commit thy way
   to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it, we have resolved
   rather to trust in the clemency and mercy of God, than to distrust our
   own weakness. For, upon engaging in good works, it often happens, that
   what human councils fail in, the divine power accomplishes. Wherefore,
   relying and resting on the authority of that Almighty God, Father, and
   Son, and Holy Ghost, and on the authority of His blessed apostles,
   Peter and Paul, (an authority) which we also exercise on earth; with
   the advice also and assent of our venerable brethren, the cardinals of
   the holy Roman Church; after having removed and annulled, as by these
   presents we do remove and annul, the suspension aforenamed, we indict,
   announce, convoke, appoint, and decree a sacred, ecumenical and general
   council,--to be opened on the ensuing calends of November of the
   present year, MDXLII, from the Incarnation of the Lord,--in the city of
   Trent, a place commodious, free, and convenient for all nations; and to
   be there prosecuted, concluded, and completed, with God's help, to His
   glory and praise, and the welfare of the whole Christian people;
   requiring, exhorting, admonishing all, of every country, as well our
   venerable brethren the patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and our
   beloved sons the abbots, as also all others soever, unto whom, by right
   or privilege, the power has been granted of sitting in general
   councils, and of delivering their sentiments therein; enjoining
   moreover, and strictly command- [Page 10] ing them, by virtue of the
   oath which they have taken to us and to this holy See, and in virtue of
   holy obedience, and under the other pains, which, by law or custom, are
   usually passed and proposed in the celebration of councils, against
   those who do not attend, that they are, undoubtedly to repair to and to
   be present themselves in person at this sacred council--unless they
   shall happen to be hindered by some just impediment, of which, however,
   they shall be obliged to furnish proof--or at all events by their own
   lawful deputies and proctors. And we also beseech the aforenamed
   emperor, and the most Christian king, as also the other kings, dukes,
   and princes, whose presence, now if ever, would be of especial
   advantage to the most holy faith of Christ, and of all Christians;
   conjuring them by the bowels of the mercy of God and of our Lord Jesus
   Christ,--the truth of whose faith, and whose religion are now so sorely
   assailed both from within and without,--that, if they would have the
   Christian commonweal safe, if they feel themselves bound and obliged,
   by the Lord's great benefits towards them, they abandon not His own
   cause and interests; and come themselves to the celebration of the
   sacred council, where their piety and virtue would be greatly conducive
   to the common good, to their own welfare, and that of others, both in
   time and eternity. But if, which we hope may not be the case, they
   shall be unable to come in person, let them at least send, with an
   authoritative commission, as their ambassadors, men of weight, who may
   each in the council represent the person of his prince with prudence
   and dignity. But above all, let this--which is a thing very easy on
   their parts--be their care, that, from their respective kingdoms and
   provinces, the bishops and prelates set forth without tergiversation
   and delay; a request which God Himself, and we, have a right to obtain
   from the prelates and princes of Germany in a special manner; for as it
   is principally on their account, and at their instance, that the
   council has been indicted and convoked, and in the very city which they
   desired, let them not think it burthensome to celebrate and adorn it
   with the presence of their whole body. That [Page 11] thus,--with God
   going before us in our deliberations, and holding before our minds the
   light of His own wisdom and truth,--we may, in the said sacred
   ecumenical council, in a better and more com-modious manner, treat of,
   and, with the charity of all conspiring to one end, deliberate and
   discuss, execute and bring to the desired issue, speedily and happily,
   whatsoever appertains to the integrity and truth of the Christian
   religion; the restoration of good and the correction of evil manners;
   the peace, unity, and concord both of Christian princes and peoples;
   and whatsoever is needful for repelling those assaults of barbarians
   and infidels, with which they seek the overthrow of all Christendom.
   And that this our letter, and the contents thereof, may come to the
   knowledge of all whom it concerns, and that no one may plead as an
   excuse ignorance thereof, especially also as there may not perhaps be
   free access to all, unto whom our letter ought to be individually
   communicated; we will and ordain, that in the Vatican Basilica of the
   prince of the apostles, and in the Lateran Church, at the time when the
   multitude of the people is wont to assemble there to hear the divine
   service, it be publicly read in a loud voice by officers of our court,
   or by certain public notaries; and, after having been read, be affixed
   to the doors of the said churches, also to the gates of the apostolic
   Chancery, and to the usual place in the Campo di Fiore, where it shall
   for some time hang exposed to be read and seen by all; and, when
   removed thence, copies thereof shall still remain affixed in the same
   places. For we will that, by being thus read, published, and affixed,
   the letter aforesaid shall oblige and bind, after the interval of two
   months from the day of being published and affixed, all and each of
   those whom it includes, even as if it had been communicated and read to
   them in person. And we ordain and decree, that an unhesitating and
   undoubting faith be given to copies thereof written, or subscribed, by
   the hand of a public notary, and guaranteed by the seal of some
   ecclesiastic constituted in authority. Wherefore, let no one infringe
   this our letter of indiction, announcement, convocation, statute,
   decree, mandate, precept, and prayer, or [Page 12] with rash daring go
   contrary thereunto. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let
   him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of His
   blessed apostles Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in
   the year MDXLII of the Lord's Incarnation, on the eleventh of the
   calends of June, in the eighth year of our pontificate.

   SESSION THE FIRST
   OF THE OECUMENICAL AND GENERAL
   COUNCIL OF TRENT
   Celebrated under the sovereign Pontiff, Paul III, on the thirteenth day
   of the month of December, in the year of the Lord, 1545.
   DECREE TOUCHING THE OPENING OF THE COUNCIL
   Doth it please you,--unto the praise and glory of the holy and
   undivided Trinity, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost ; for the increase
   and exaltation of the Christian faith and religion; for the extirpation
   of heresies; for the peace and union of the Church; for the reformation
   of the Clergy and Christian people; for the depression and extinction
   of the enemies of the Christian name,--to decree and declare that the
   sacred and general council of Trent do begin, and hath begun?
   They answered: It pleaseth us.
   [Page 13]
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   And whereas the solemnity of the Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ is
   near, and other festivals of the closing and opening year follow
   thereupon, doth it please you, that the first ensuing session be held
   on the Thursday after the Epiphany, which will be the seventh of the
   month of January, in the year of the Lord MDXLVI?
   They answered: It pleaseth us.
   SESSION THE SECOND
   Celebrated on the seventh day of the month of January,1546.
   DECREE TOUCHING THE MANNER OF LIVING,
   AND OTHER MATTERS TO BE OBSERVED, DURING THE COUNCIL
   The sacred and holy Synod of Trent--lawfully assembled in the Holy
   Ghost, the same three legates of the Apostolic See presiding
   therein--recognising, with the blessed apostle James, that Every best
   gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the father
   of lights, who, to those who ask of him wisdom, giveth to all
   abundantly, and upbraideth them not; and knowing withal that The fear
   of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, hath ordained and decreed, that
   all and each of the faithful of Christ, assembled in the city of Trent,
   be exhorted, as they are hereby exhorted, to amend themselves of their
   evils and sins heretofore committed, and to walk henceforth in the fear
   of the Lord; not to fulfil the lusts of the flesh; to be instant in
   prayer; to confess more frequently; to receive the sacrament of the
   Eucharist; to visit churches; to fulfil, in fine, as far as each one
   shall be able, the commandments of the Lord; and, furthermore, to pray
   daily in private for peace between Christian princes, and for the unity
   of the Church: and as regards the bishops, and all others soever
   constituted in the priestly order, who are celebrating together an
   ecumenical council in this city, that they give heed to apply
   themselves assiduously to the praises [Page 14] of God; to offer up
   victims, praises, and prayers; to celebrate the sacrifice of the mass
   on each Sunday at least, the day whereon God made the light, rose again
   from the dead, and poured forth the Holy Ghost upon the disciples;
   making, as the same Holy Ghost enjoins by the apostle, supplications,
   prayers, intercessions, thanksgiving, for our most holy lord the Pope,
   for the emperor, for kings, and others who are placed in high stations,
   and for all men, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, may enjoy
   peace, and see an increase of faith. Furthermore, it exhorts that they
   fast at least on every Friday, in memory of the passion of the Lord,
   and give alms to the poor: further, on every Thursday there shall be
   celebrated, in the cathedral church, the mass of the Holy Ghost, with
   the litanies and other prayers appointed for this end; and on the same
   day there shall be said, in the other churches, at least the litanies
   and prayers; and during the time that the sacred services are being
   performed, let there be no talking or conversing together, but with
   mouth and mind association with the celebrant. And forasmuch as It
   behoveth bishops to be blameless, sober, chaste, ruling well their own
   household, (the Council) exhorts also that, above all, each observe
   sobriety at table, and moderation in diet; further, that, whereas idle
   conversations are often wont to arise there, the reading of the divine
   Scriptures be introduced, even at the tables of bishops; and let each
   teach and charge his servants not to be quarrelsome, given to wine,
   immodest, covetous, proud, blasphemous, and lovers of pleasures; in
   fine, let them shun vice and follow after virtue, and in dress,
   demeanour, and in all their actions show forth modesty, as becomes the
   servants of the servants of God.
   Moreover, whereas it is the chief care, solicitude, and intention of
   this sacred and holy council, that, the darkness of heresies, which
   during so many years has covered the earth, being dispelled, the light,
   brightness, and purity of Catholic truth may, by the assistance of
   Jesus Christ, who is the true light, shine forth; and that those things
   which need reformation may be reformed; the said Synod exhorts all
   Catholics here assembled, [Page 15] and to be assembled, and especially
   those skilled in sacred letters, that by sedulous meditation they
   ponder diligently within themselves, by what ways and means the
   intention of the Synod may be best carried out and obtain the desired
   effect; that, in the most prompt and prudent manner, the things to be
   condemned, may be condemned; and those to be approved of be approved;
   that so, throughout the whole world, all may, with one mouth, and with
   the same confession of faith, glorify God, and the Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.
   And in delivering their sentiments, when the priests of the Lord are
   sitting together in the place of benediction, no one--agreeably to the
   statute of the council of Toledo--ought either to be boisterous by
   immoderate outcries, or to cause disturbance by tumult; none to be
   contentious with false, vain, or obstinate disputation; but let
   whatsoever is said be so tempered by the mildest utterance of the words
   spoken, that neither the hearers may be offended, nor the rectitude of
   a correct judgment be warped by the mind being troubled.
   Furthermore, this sacred Synod has ordained and decreed, that if it
   should chance to happen that any do not sit in their due places, and
   (thus) deliver their sentiments, even under the word Placet, (It
   pleaseth us,) are present at the Congregations, and take part in any
   other act whatsoever during the council, none shall thereby be
   prejudiced, none acquire a new right.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   After this, the next Session was indicted for Thursday, the fourth of
   the ensuing February.
   SESSION THE THIRD,
   Celebrated on the fourth day of the month of February, in the year
   1546.
   DECREE TOUCHING THE SYMBOL OF FAITH
   In the Name of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, Father, and Son, and
   Holy Ghost.
   This sacred and holy, ecumenical, and general Synod of [Page 16]
   Trent,--lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same three legates of
   the Apostolic See presiding therein,--considering the magnitude of the
   matters to be treated of, especially of those comprised under the two
   heads, of the extirpating of heresies, and the reforming of manners,
   for the sake of which chiefly It is assembled, and recognizing with the
   apostles, that Its wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but
   against the spirits of wickedness in the high places, exhorts, with the
   same apostle, all and each above all things, to be strengthened in the
   Lord, and in the might of his power, in all things taking the shield of
   faith, wherewith they may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of
   the most wicked one, and to take the helmet of salvation, with the
   sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Wherefore, that this its
   pious solicitude may begin and proceed by the grace of God, It ordains
   and decrees that, before all other things, a confession of faith is to
   be set forth; following herein the examples of the Fathers, who have
   been wont, in the most sacred coucils, at the beginning of the Actions
   thereof, to oppose this shield against heresies; and with this alone,
   at times, have they drawn the unbelieving to the faith, overthrown
   heretics, and confirmed the faithful. For which cause, this council has
   thought good, that the Symbol of faith which the holy Roman Church
   makes use of,--as being that principle wherein all who profess the
   faith of Christ necessarily agree, and that firm and alone foundation
   against which the gates of hell shall never prevail,--be expressed in
   the very same words in which it is read in all the churches. Which
   Symbol is as follows: I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker
   of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible; and in one
   Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, and born of the Father
   before all ages; God of God, light of light, true God of true God;
   begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father, by whom all things
   were made: who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from the
   heavens, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of [Page 17] the Virgin
   Mary, and was made man: crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, he
   suffered and was buried; and he rose again on the third day, according
   to the Scriptures; and he ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right
   hand of the Father ; and again he will come with glory to judge the
   living and the dead; of whose kingdom there shall be no end: and in the
   Holy Ghost the Lord, and the giver of life, who proceedeth from the
   Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is adored
   and glorified; who spoke by the prophets and one holy Catholic and
   Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins; and
   I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to
   come. Amen.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   The same sacred and holy, ecumenical, and general Synod of
   Trent,--lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same three legates of
   the Apostolic See presiding therein, -- understanding that many
   prelates in divers places are girt for their journey, and that some
   also are on their way hither; and considering that all that may be
   decreed by the said sacred Synod may seem to be in so much the greater
   estimation and honour with all men, as it shall have been sanctioned
   and confirmed by a more numerous and fuller council and attendance of
   Fathers, has resolved and decreed, that the next Session after the
   present be celebrated on the Thursday after Laetare Sunday next; but
   that, in the interim, the discussion and examination of those things
   which it shall seem fit to the said Synod to discuss and examine be not
   deferred.
   SESSION THE FOURTH
   Celebrated on the eighth day of the month of April, in the year
   MDXLVI.
   DECREE CONCERNING THE CANONICAL SCRIPTURES
   The sacred and holy, ecumenical, and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the Same three legates of the Apostolic
   Sec presiding therein,--keeping this [Page 18] always in view, that,
   errors being removed, the purity itself of the Gospel be preserved in
   the Church; which (Gospel), before promised through the prophets in the
   holy Scriptures, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, first
   promulgated with His own mouth, and then commanded to be preached by
   His Apostles to every creature, as the fountain of all, both saving
   truth, and moral discipline; and seeing clearly that this truth and
   discipline are contained in the written books, and the unwritten
   traditions which, received by the Apostles from the mouth of Christ
   himself, or from the Apostles themselves, the Holy Ghost dictating,
   have come down even unto us, transmitted as it were from hand to hand;
   (the Synod) following the examples of the orthodox Fathers, receives
   and venerates with an equal affection of piety, and reverence, all the
   books both of the Old and of the New Testament--seeing that one God is
   the author of both --as also the said traditions, as well those
   appertaining to faith as to morals, as having been dictated, either by
   Christ's own word of mouth, or by the Holy Ghost, and preserved in the
   Catholic Church by a continuous succession. And it has thought it meet
   that a list of the sacred books be inserted in this decree, lest a
   doubt may arise in any one's mind, which are the books that are
   received by this Synod. They are as set down here below: of the Old
   Testament: the five books of Moses, to wit, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
   Numbers, Deuteronomy; Josue, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings, two of
   Paralipomenon, the first book of Esdras, and the second which is
   entitled Nehemias; Tobias, Judith, Esther, Job, the Davidical Psalter,
   consisting of a hundred and fifty psalms; the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
   the Canticle of Canticles, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaias, Jeremias,
   with Baruch; Ezechiel, Daniel; the twelve minor prophets, to wit, Osee,
   Joel, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Micheas, Nahum, Habacuc, Sophonias, Aggaeus,
   Zacharias, Malachias; two books of the Machabees, the first and the
   second. Of the New Testament: the four Gospels, according [Page 19] to
   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles written by Luke
   the Evangelist; fourteen epistles of Paul the apostle, (one) to the
   Romans, two to the Corinthians, (one) to the Galatians, to the
   Ephesians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians, two to the
   Thessalonians, two to Timothy, (one) to Titus, to Philemon, to the
   Hebrews; two of Peter the apostle, three of John the apostle, one of
   the apostle James, one of Jude the apostle, and the Apocalypse of John
   the apostle. But if any one receive not, as sacred and canonical, the
   said books entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be
   read in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin
   vulgate edition; and knowingly and deliberately contemn the traditions
   aforesaid; let him be anathema. Let all, therefore, understand, in what
   order, and in what manner, the said Synod, after having laid the
   foundation of the Confession of faith, will proceed, and what
   testimonies and authorities it will mainly use in confirming dogmas,
   and in restoring morals in the Church.
   DECREE CONCERNING THE EDITION, AND THE USE, OF THE SACRED BOOKS
   Moreover, the same sacred and holy Synod,--considering that no small
   utility may accrue to the Church of God, if it be made known which out
   of all the Latin editions, now in circulation, of the sacred books, is
   to be held as authentic,--ordains and declares, that the said old and
   vulgate edition, which, by the lengthened usage of so many years, has
   been approved of in the Church, be, in public lectures, disputations,
   sermons and expositions, held as authentic; and that no one is to dare,
   or presume to reject it under any pretext whatever.
   Furthermore, in order to restrain petulant spirits, It decrees, that no
   one, relying on his own skill, shall,--in matters of faith, and of
   morals pertaining to the edification of Christian doctrine, --wresting
   the sacred Scripture to his own senses, presume to interpret the said
   sacred Scripture contrary to that sense which holy mother
   Church,--whose it is to judge of the true sense and interpretation of
   the holy Scriptures,--hath held and doth hold; [Page 20] or even
   contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers; even though such
   interpretations were never (intended) to be at any time published.
   Contraveners shall be made known by their Ordinaries, and be punished
   with the penalties by law established.
   And wishing, as is just, to impose a restraint, in this matter, also on
   printers, who now without restraint,--thinking, that is, that
   whatsoever they please is allowed them,--print, without the license of
   ecclesiastical superiors, the said books of sacred Scripture, and the
   notes and comments upon them of all persons indifferently, with the
   press ofttimes unnamed, often even fictitious, and what is more
   grievous still, without the author's name; and also keep for
   indiscriminate sale books of this kind printed elsewhere; (this Synod)
   ordains and decrees, that, henceforth, the sacred Scripture, and
   especially the said old and vulgate edition, be printed in the most
   correct manner possible; and that it shall not be lawful for any one to
   print, or cause to be printed, any books whatever, on sacred matters,
   without the name of the author; nor to sell them in future, or even to
   keep them, unless they shall have been first examined, and approved of,
   by the Ordinary; under pain of the anathema and fine imposed in a canon
   of the last Council of Lateran: and, if they be Regulars, besides this
   examination and approval, they shall be bound to obtain a license also
   from their own superiors, who shall have examined the books according
   to the form of their own statutes. As to those who lend, or circulate
   them in manuscript, without their having been first examined, and
   approved of, they shall be subjected to the same penalties as printers:
   and they who shall have them in their possession or shall read them,
   shall, unless they discover the authors, be themselves regarded as the
   authors. And the said approbation of books of this kind shall be given
   in writing; and for this end it shall appear authentically at the
   beginning of the book, whether the book be written, or printed; and all
   this, that is, both the approbation and the examination, shall be done
   gratis, that so what ought to be approved, may be approved, and what
   ought to be condemned, may be condemned.
   Besides the above, wishing to repress that temerity, by which the words
   and sentences of sacred Scripture are turned and [Page 21] twisted to
   all sorts of profane uses, to wit, to things scurrilous, fabulous,
   vain, to flatteries, detractions, superstitions, impious and diabolical
   incantations, sorceries, and defamatory libels; (the Synod) commands
   and enjoins, for the doing away with this kind of irreverence and
   contempt, and that no one may hence forth dare in any way to apply the
   words of sacred Scripture to these and such like purposes; that all men
   of this description, profaners and violators of the word of God, be by
   the bishops restrained by the penalties of law, and others of their own
   appointment.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   Likewise, this sacred and holy Synod resolves and decrees, that the
   next ensuing Session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the
   next most sacred festival of Pentecost.
   Celebrated on the seventeenth day of the month of June, in the year
   MDXLVI.
   DECREE CONCERNING ORIGINAL SIN
   That our Catholic faith, without which it is impossible to please God,
   may, errors being purged away, continue in its own perfect and spotless
   integrity, and that the Christian people may not be carried about with
   every wind of doctrine; whereas that old serpent, the perpetual enemy
   of mankind, amongst the very many evils with which the Church of God is
   in these our times troubled, has also stirred up not only new, but even
   old, dissensions touching original sin, and the remedy thereof; the
   sacred and holy, ecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the three same legates of the Apostolic
   See presiding therein,--wishing now to come to the reclaiming of the
   erring, and the confirming of the wavering,--following the testimonies
   of the sacred [Page 22] Scriptures, of the holy Fathers, of the most
   approved councils, and the judgment and consent of the Church itself,
   ordains, confesses, and declares these things touching the said
   original sin:
   1. If any one does not confess that the first man, Adam, when he had
   transgressed the commandment of God in Paradise, immediately lost the
   holiness and justice wherein he had been constituted; and that he
   incurred, through the offence of that prevarication, the wrath and
   indignation of God, and consequently death, with which God had
   previously threatened him, and, together with death, captivity under
   his power who thenceforth had the empire of death, that is to say, the
   devil, and that the entire Adam, through that offence of prevarication,
   was changed, in body and soul, for the worse; let him be anathema.
   2. If any one asserts, that the prevarication of Adam injured himself
   alone, and not his posterity; and that the holiness and justice,
   received of God, which he lost, he lost for himself alone, and not for
   us also; or that he, being defiled by the sin of disobedience, has only
   transfused death, and pains of the body, into the whole human race, but
   not sin also, which is the death of the soul; let him be
   anathema:--whereas he contradicts the apostle who says; By one man sin
   entered into the world, and by sin death, and so death passed upon all
   men, in whom all have sinned.
   3. If any one asserts, that this sin of Adam,--which in its origin is
   one, and being transfused into all by propogation, not by imitation, is
   in each one as his own, --is taken away either by the powers of human
   nature, or by any other remedy than the merit of the one mediator, our
   Lord Jesus Christ, who hath reconciled us to God in his own blood, made
   unto us justice, santification, and redemption; or if he denies that
   the said merit of Jesus Christ is applied, both to adults and to
   infants, by the sacrament of baptism rightly administered in the form
   of the church; let him be anathema: For there is no other name under
   heaven given to men, whereby we must be [Page 23] saved. Whence that
   voice; Behold the lamb of God behold him who taketh away the sins of
   the world; and that other; As many as have been baptized, have put on
   Christ.
   4. If any one denies, that infants, newly born from their mothers'
   wombs, even though they be sprung from baptized parents, are to be
   baptized; or says that they are baptized indeed for the remission of
   sins, but that they derive nothing of original sin from Adam, which has
   need of being expiated by the laver of regeneration for the obtaining
   life everlasting,--whence it follows as a consequence, that in them the
   form of baptism, for the remission of sins, is understood to be not
   true, but false, --let him be anathema. For that which the apostle has
   said, By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and so
   death passed upon all men in whom all have sinned, is not to be
   understood otherwise than as the Catholic Church spread everywhere hath
   always understood it. For, by reason of this rule of faith, from a
   tradition of the apostles, even infants, who could not as yet commit
   any sin of themselves, are for this cause truly baptized for the
   remission of sins, that in them that may be cleansed away by
   regeneration, which they have contracted by generation. For, unless a
   man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the
   kingdom of God.
   5. If any one denies, that, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   which is conferred in baptism, the guilt of original sin is remitted;
   or even asserts that the whole of that which has the true and proper
   nature of sin is not taken away; but says that it is only rased, or not
   imputed; let him be anathema. For, in those who are born again, there
   is nothing that God hates; because, There is no condemnation to those
   who are truly buried together with Christ by baptism into death; who
   walk not according to the flesh, but, putting off the old man, and
   putting on the new who is created according to God, are made inno-[Page
   24]cent, immaculate, pure, harmless, and beloved of God, heirs indeed
   of God, but joint heirs with Christ; so that there is nothing whatever
   to retard their entrance into heaven. But this holy synod confesses and
   is sensible, that in the baptized there remains concupiscence, or an
   incentive (to sin); which, whereas it is left for our exercise, cannot
   injure those who consent not, but resist manfully by the grace of Jesus
   Christ; yea, he who shall have striven lawfully shall be crowned. This
   concupiscence, which the apostle sometimes calls sin, the holy Synod
   declares that the Catholic Church has never understood it to be called
   sin, as being truly and properly sin in those born again, but because
   it is of sin, and inclines to sin.
   This same holy Synod doth nevertheless declare, that it is not its
   intention to include in this decree, where original sin is treated of,
   the blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary, the mother of God; but that the
   constitutions of Pope Sixtus IV., of happy memory, are to be observed,
   under the pains contained in the said constitutions, which it renews.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION
   CHAPTER I.
   On the Institution of a Lectureship of Sacred Scripture, and of the
   liberal arts.
   The same sacred and holy Synod, adhering to the pious constitutions of
   the Sovereign Pontiffs, and of approved councils, and embracing and
   adding to them; that the heavenly treasure of the sacred books, which
   the Holy Ghost has with the greatest liberality delivered unto men, may
   not lie neglected, hath or-[Page 25]dained and decreed, that,--in those
   churches where there is found to be a prebend, prestimony, or other
   stipend under whatsoever name, destined for lecturers in sacred
   theology,--the bishops, archbishops, primates, and other Ordinaries of
   those places shall force and compel, even by the substraction of the
   fruits, those who hold such prebend, prestimony, or stipend, to expound
   and interpret the said sacred Scripture, either personally, if they be
   competent, or otherwise by a competent substitute, to be chosen by the
   said bishops, archbishops, primates, and other Ordinaries of those
   places. But, for the future, let not such prebend, prestimony, or
   stipend be bestowed save on competent persons, and those who can
   themselves discharge that office; and otherwise let the provision made
   be null and void.
   But in metropolitan, or cathedral churches, if the city be
   distinguished and populous,--and also in collegiate churches which are
   in any large town, even though they may not belong to any diocese,
   provided the clergy be numerous there,--wherein there is no such
   prebend, prestimony, or stipend set aside for this purpose, let the
   first prebend that shall become vacant in any way soever, except by
   resignation, and to which some other incompatible duty is not attached,
   be understood to be ipso facto set apart and devoted to that purpose
   for ever. And in case that in the said churches there should not be
   any, or not any sufficient, prebend, let the metropolitan, or the
   bishop himself, by assigning thereunto the fruits of some simple
   benefice,--the obligations thereto belonging being nevertheless
   discharged,--or by the contributions of the beneficiaries of his city
   and diocese, or otherwise, as may be most convenient, provide in such
   wise, with the advice of his chapter, as that the said lecture of
   sacred Scripture be had; yet so that whatsoever other lectures there
   may be, whether established by custom, or in any other way, be not by
   any means therefore omitted.
   As to churches, whose annual revenues are slight, and where the number
   of the clergy and laity is so small, that a lectureship of Theology
   cannot be conveniently had therein, let them at least have a master--to
   be chosen by the bishop, with the advice of the chapter--to teach
   grammar gratuitously to clerics, and other poor scholars, that so they
   may afterwards, with God's blessing, [Page 26] pass on to the said
   study of sacred Scripture. And for this end, either let the fruits of
   some simple benefice be assigned to that master of grammar,--which
   fruits he shall receive so long as he continues teaching, provided
   however, that the said benefice be not deprived of the duty due to
   it,--or let some suitable remuneration be paid him out of the episcopal
   or capitular revenue; or in fine let the bishop himself devise some
   other method suited to his church and diocese; that so this pious,
   useful, and profitable provision may not be, under any colourable
   pretext whatever, neglected.
   In the monasteries also of monks, let there be in like manner a lecture
   on sacred Scripture, where this can be conveniently done: wherein of
   the abbots be negligent, let the bishops of the places, as the
   delegates herein of the Apostolic See, compel them thereto by suitable
   remedies. And in the convents of other Regulars, in which studies can
   conveniently flourish, let there be in like manner a lectureship of
   sacred Scripture; which lectureship shall be assigned, by the general
   or provincial chapters, to the more able masters.
   In the public colleges also, wherein a lectureship so honourable, and
   the most necessary of all, has not hitherto been instituted, let it be
   established by the piety and charity of the most religious princes and
   governments, for the defence and increase of the Catholic faith, and
   the preservation and propagation of sound doctrine; and where such
   lectureship, after being once instituted, has been neglected, let it be
   restored. And that impiety may not be disseminated under the semblance
   of piety, the same holy Synod ordains, that no one be admitted to this
   office of lecturing, whether in public or in private, without having
   been previously examined and approved of by the bishop of the place, as
   to his life, conversation, and knowledge: which however is not to be
   understood of lecturers in convents of monks. Furthermore, those who
   are teaching the said sacred Scripture, as long as they teach publicly
   in the schools, as also the scholars who are studying in those schools,
   shall fully enjoy [Page 27] and possess, though absent, all the
   privileges accorded by common law, as regards the reception of the
   fruits of their prebends and benefices.
   CHAPTER II.
   On Preachers of the word of God, and on Questors of alms.
   But seeing that the preaching of the Gospel is no less necessary to the
   Christian commonwealth than the reading thereof; and whereas this is
   the principal duty of bishops; the same holy Synod hath resolved and
   decreed, that all bishops, archbishops, primates, and all other
   prelates of the churches be bound personally--if they be not lawfully
   hindered--to preach the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ. But if it should
   happen that bishops, and the others aforesaid, be hindered by any
   lawful impediment, they shall be bound, in accordance with the form
   prescribed by the general Council (of Lateran), to appoint fit persons
   to discharge wholesomely this office of preaching. But if any one
   through contempt do not execute this, let him be subjected to rigorous
   punishment.
   Archpriests, curates, and all those who in any manner soever hold any
   parochial, or other, churches, which have the cure of souls, shall, at
   least on the Lord's days, and solemn feasts, either personally, or if
   they be lawfully hindered, by others who are competent, feed the people
   committed to them, with wholesome words, according to their own
   capacity, and that of their people; by teaching them the things which
   it is necessary for all to knew unto salvation, and by announcing to
   them with briefness and plainness of discourse, the vices which they
   must avoid, and the virtues which they must follow after, that they may
   escape everlasting punishment, and obtain the glory of heaven. And if
   any one of the above neglect to discharge this duty,--even though he
   may plead, on whatsoever ground, that he [Page 28] is exempt from the
   jurisdiction of the bishop, and even though the churches may be, in
   whatsoever way, said to be exempted, or haply annexed or united to a
   monastery that is even out of the diocese,--let not the watchful
   pastoral solicitude of the bishops be wanting, provided those churches
   be really within their diocese; lest that word be fulfilled; The little
   ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.
   Wherefore, if, after having been admonished by the bishop, they shall
   neglect this their duty for the space of three months, let them be
   compelled by ecclesiastical censures, or otherwise, at the discretion
   of the said bishop; in such wise that even-if this seem to him
   expedient-a fair remuneration be paid, out of the fruits of the
   benefices, to some other person to discharge that office, until the
   principal himself repenting shall fulfil his own duty.
   But should there be found to be any parochial churches, subject to
   monasteries which are not in any diocese, if the abbots and Regular
   prelates be negligent in the matters aforesaid, let them be compelled
   thereto by the metropolitans, in whose provinces the said dioceses are
   situated, as the delegate for that end of the Apostolic See; nor let
   custom, or exemption, or appeal, or reclamation, or action of recovery
   be of effect to impede the execution of this decree; until by a
   competent judge,--who shall proceed summarily, and examine only into
   the truth of the (matter of) fact,--the case shall have been taken
   cognizance of, and decided.
   Regulars, of whatsoever order they may be, may not preach even in the
   churches of their own orders, unless they have been examined and
   approved of as regards their life, manners, and knowledge, by their own
   superiors, and with his license; with which license they shall be bound
   to present themselves personally before the bishops, and beg a blessing
   from them, before they begin to preach. But, (to preach) in churches
   which are not those of their own orders, besides the license of their
   own superiors they shall be obliged to have also the license of the
   bishop, without which they may not on any account preach in the said
   churches which belong not to their own orders: but bishops shall grant
   [Page 29] the said license gratuitously.
   But if, which God forbid, a preacher should spread errors, or scandals,
   amongst the people, let the bishop interdict his preaching, even though
   he preach in a monastery of his own, or of another, order: whereas, if
   he preach heresies, let him proceed against him according to the
   appointment of the law, or the custom of the place, even though the
   said preacher should plead that he is exempted by a general, or
   special, privilege: in which case the bishop shall proceed by apostolic
   authority, and as the delegate of the Apostolic See. But let bishops be
   careful, that a preacher be not annoyed, either by false accusations,
   or in any other way calumniously; or have any just cause of complaint
   against them.
   Furthermore, let bishops be on their guard not to permit any
   one,--whether of those, who, being Regulars in name, live nevertheless
   out of their monasteries, and the obedience of their religious
   institute, or secular priests, unless they be known to them, and are of
   approved morals and doctrine,--to preach in their own city, and
   diocese, even under the pretext of any privilege whatsoever; until the
   holy Apostolic See has been consulted by the said bishops thereon; from
   which See it is not likely that unworthy persons can extort any such
   privileges, except by suppressing the truth, or by uttering what is
   false.
   Those who quest for alms--who are also commonly called Questors-of
   whatsoever condition they may be, shall not in any way presume, either
   personally, or by another, to preach; and Contraveners shall, any
   privileges notwithstanding, be wholly restrained by suitable remedies,
   by the bishop and Ordinaries of the places.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   The sacred and holy Synod also ordains and decrees, that the first
   ensuing Session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the feast
   of the blessed apostle James.
   The Session was afterwards prorogued to the thirteenth of January,
   MDXLVII.
   Celebrated on the thirteenth day of the month of January, 1547.
   DECREE ON JUSTIFICATION
   Proem.
   Whereas there is, at this time, not without the shipwreck of many
   souls, and grievous detriment to the unity of the Church, a certain
   erroneous doctrine disseminated touching Justification; the sacred and
   holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the
   Holy Ghost,--the most reverend lords, Giammaria del Monte, bishop of
   Palaestrina, and Marcellus of the title of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem,
   priest, cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and legates apostolic a
   latere, presiding therein, in the name of our most holy father and lord
   in Christ, Paul III., by the providence of God, Pope,-purposes, unto
   the praise and glory of Almighty God, the tranquillising of the Church,
   and the salvation of souls, to expound to all the faithful of Christ
   the true and sound doctrine touching the said Justification; which
   (doctrine) the sun of justice, Christ Jesus, the author and finisher of
   our faith, taught, which the apostles transmitted, and which the
   Catholic Church, the Holy Ghost reminding her thereof, has always
   retained; most strictly forbidding that any henceforth presume to
   believe, preach, or teach, otherwise than as by this present decree is
   defined and declared.
   CHAPTER I.
   On the Inability of Nature and of the Law to justify man.
   The holy Synod declares first, that, for the correct and sound
   understanding of the doctrine of Justification, it is necessary [Page
   31] that each one recognise and confess, that, whereas all men had lost
   their innocence in the prevarication of Adam-having become unclean,
   and, as the apostle says, by nature children of wrath, as (this Synod)
   has set forth in the decree on original sin,-they were so far the
   servants of sin, and under the power of the devil and of death, that
   not the Gentiles only by the force of nature, but not even the Jews by
   the very letter itself of the law of Moses, were able to be liberated,
   or to arise, therefrom; although free will, attenuated as it was in its
   powers, and bent down, was by no means extinguished in them.
   CHAPTER II.
   On the dispensation and mystery of Christ's advent.
   Whence it came to pass, that the heavenly Father, the father of mercies
   and the God of all comfort, when that blessed fulness of the time was
   come, sent unto men, Jesus Christ, His own Son-who had been, both
   before the Law, and during the time of the Law, to many of the holy
   fathers announced and promised-that He might both redeem the Jews who
   were under the Law, and that the Gentiles, who followed not after
   justice, might attain to justice, and that all men might receive the
   adoption of sons. Him God hath proposed as a propitiator, through faith
   in his blood, for our sins, and not for our sins only, but also for
   those of the whole world.
   CHAPTER III.
   Who are justified through Christ.
   But, though He died for all, yet do not all receive the benefit of His
   [Page 32] death, but those only unto whom the merit of His passion is
   communicated. For as in truth men, if they were not born propagated of
   the seed of Adam, would not be born unjust,-seeing that, by that
   propagation, they contract through him, when they are conceived,
   injustice as their own,-so, if they were not born again in Christ, they
   never would be justified; seeing that, in that new birth, there is
   bestowed upon them, through the merit of His passion, the grace whereby
   they are made just. For this benefit the apostle exhorts us, evermore
   to give thanks to the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers
   of the lot of the saints in light, and hath delivered us from the power
   of darkness, and hath translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his
   love, in whom we have redemption, and remission of sins.
   CHAPTER IV.
   A description is introduced of the Justification of the impious, and of
   the Manner thereof under the law of grace.
   By which words, a description of the Justification of the impious is
   indicated,-as being a translation, from that state wherein man is born
   a child of the first Adam, to the state of grace, and of the adoption
   of the sons of God, through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our Saviour.
   And this translation, since the promulgation of the Gospel, cannot be
   effected, without the laver of regeneration, or the desire thereof, as
   it is written; unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost,
   he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.
   CHAPTER V.
   On the necessity, in adults, of preparation for Justification, and
   whence it proceeds.
   The Synod furthermore declares, that in adults, the beginning of the
   said Justification is to be derived from the prevenient [Page 33] grace
   of God, through Jesus Christ, that is to say, from His vocation,
   whereby, without any merits existing on their parts, they are called;
   that so they, who by sins were alienated from God, may be disposed
   through His quickening and assisting grace, to convert themselves to
   their own justification, by freely assenting to and co-operating with
   that said grace: in such sort that, while God touches the heart of man
   by the illumination of the Holy Ghost, neither is man himself utterly
   without doing anything while he receives that inspiration, forasmuch as
   he is also able to reject it; yet is he not able, by his own free will,
   without the grace of God, to move himself unto justice in His sight.
   Whence, when it is said in the sacred writings: Turn ye to me, and I
   will turn to you, we are admonished of our liberty; and when we answer;
   Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted, we confess that
   we are prevented by the grace of God.
   CHAPTER VI.
   The manner of Preparation.
   Now they (adults) are disposed unto the said justice, when, excited and
   assisted by divine grace, conceiving faith by hearing, they are freely
   moved towards God, believing those things to be true which God has
   revealed and promised,-and this especially, that God justifies the
   impious by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;
   and when, understanding themselves to be sinners, they, by turning
   themselves, from the fear of divine justice whereby they are profitably
   agitated, to consider the mercy of God, are raised unto hope, confiding
   that God will be propitious to them for Christ's sake; and they begin
   to love Him as the fountain of all justice; and are therefore moved
   against sins by a certain hatred and detestation, to wit, by that
   penitence which must be performed before baptism: lastly, when they
   purpose to receive baptism, [Page 34] to begin a new life, and to keep
   the commandments of God. Concerning this disposition it is written; He
   that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and is a rewarder to them
   that seek him; and, Be of good faith, son, thy sins are forgiven thee;
   and, The fear of the Lord driveth out sin; and, Do penance, and be
   baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy
   Ghost; and, Going, therefore, teach ye all nations, baptizing them in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; finally,
   Prepare your hearts unto the Lord.
   CHAPTER VII.
   What the justification of the impious is, and what are the causes
   thereof.
   This disposition, or preparation, is followed by Justification itself,
   which is not remission of sins merely, but also the sanctification and
   renewal of the inward man, through the voluntary reception of the
   grace, and of the gifts, whereby man of unjust becomes just, and of an
   enemy a friend, that so he may be an heir according to hope of life
   everlasting.
   Of this Justification the causes are these: the final cause indeed is
   the glory of God and of Jesus Christ, and life everlasting; while the
   efficient cause is a merciful God who washes and sanctifies
   gratuitously, signing, and anointing with the holy Spirit of promise,
   who is the pledge of our inheritance; but the meritorious cause is His
   most beloved only-begotten, our Lord Jesus Christ, who, when we were
   enemies, for the exceeding charity wherewith he loved us, merited
   Justification for us by His most holy Passion on the wood of the cross,
   and made satisfaction for us unto God the Father; the instru-[Page
   35]mental cause is the sacrament of baptism, which is the sacrament of
   faith, without which (faith) no man was ever justified; lastly, the
   alone formal cause is the justice of God, not that whereby He Himself
   is just, but that whereby He maketh us just, that, to wit, with which
   we being endowed by Him, are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and we
   are not only reputed, but are truly called, and are, just, receiving
   justice within us, each one according to his own measure, which the
   Holy Ghost distributes to every one as He wills, and according to each
   one's proper disposition and co-operation. For, although no one can be
   just, but he to whom the merits of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ
   are communicated, yet is this done in the said justification of the
   impious, when by the merit of that same most holy Passion, the charity
   of God is poured forth, by the Holy Spirit, in the hearts of those that
   are justified, and is inherent therein: whence, man, through Jesus
   Christ, in whom he is ingrafted, receives, in the said justification,
   together with the remission of sins, all these (gifts) infused at once,
   faith, hope, and charity. For faith, unless hope and charity be added
   thereto, neither unites man perfectly with Christ, nor makes him a
   living member of His body. For which reason it is most truly said, that
   Faith without works is dead and profitless; and, In Christ Jesus
   neither circumcision, availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith
   which worketh by charity. This faith, Catechumen's beg of the
   Church-agreeably to a tradition of the apostles-previously to the
   sacrament of Baptism; when they beg for the faith which bestows life
   everlasting, which, without hope and charity, faith cannot bestow:
   whence also do they immediately hear that word of Christ; If thou wilt
   enter into life, keep the commandments. Wherefore, when receiving true
   and Christian justice, they are bidden, immediately on being born
   again, to preserve it pure and spotless, as the first robe given them
   through Jesus Christ in lieu of that which [Page 36] Adam, by his
   disobedience, lost for himself and for us, that so they may bear it
   before the judgment-seat of our Lord Jesus Christ, and may have life
   everlasting.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   In what manner it is to be understood, that the impious is justified by
   faith, and gratuitously.
   And whereas the Apostle saith, that man is justified by faith and
   freely, those words are to be understood in that sense which the
   perpetual consent of the Catholic Church hath held and expressed; to
   wit, that we are therefore said to be justified by faith, because faith
   is the beginning of human salvation, the foundation, and the root of
   all Justification; without which it is impossible to please God, and to
   come unto the fellowship of His sons: but we are therefore said to be
   justified freely, because that none of those things which precede
   justification-whether faith or works-merit the grace itself of
   justification. For, if it be a grace, it is not now by works,
   otherwise, as the same Apostle says, grace is no more grace.
   CHAPTER IX.
   Against the vain confidence of Heretics.
   But, although it is necessary to believe that sins neither are
   remitted, nor ever were remitted save gratuitously by the mercy of God
   for Christ's sake; yet is it not to be said, that sins are forgiven, or
   have been forgiven, to any one who boasts of his confidence and
   certainty of the remission of his sins, and rests on that alone; seeing
   that it may exist, yea does in our day exist, amongst heretics and
   schismatics; and with great vehemence is this vain confidence, and one
   alien from all godliness, preached up in opposition to the Catholic
   Church. But neither [Page 37] is this to be asserted,-that they who are
   truly justified must needs, without any doubting whatever, settle
   within themselves that they are justified, and that no one is absolved
   from sins and justified, but he that believes for certain that he is
   absolved and justified; and that absolution and justification are
   effected by this faith alone: as though whoso has not this belief,
   doubts of the promises of God, and of the efficacy of the death and
   resurrection of Christ. For even as no pious person ought to doubt of
   the mercy of God, of the merit of Christ, and of the virtue and
   efficacy of the sacraments, even so each one, when he regards himself,
   and his own weakness and indisposition, may have fear and apprehension
   touching his own grace; seeing that no one can know with a certainty of
   faith, which cannot be subject to error, that he has obtained the grace
   of God.
   CHAPTER X.
   On the increase of Justification received.
   Having, therefore, been thus justified, and made the friends and
   domestics of God, advancing from virtue to virtue, they are renewed, as
   the Apostle says, day by day; that is, by mortifying the members of
   their own flesh, and by presenting them as instruments of justice unto
   sanctification, they, through the observance of the commandments of God
   and of the Church, faith co-operating with good works, increase in that
   justice which they have received through the grace of Christ, and are
   still further justified, as it is written; He that is just, let him be
   justified still; and again, Be not afraid to be justified even to
   death; and also, Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not
   by faith only. And this increase of justification holy Church begs,
   when she prays, "Give unto us, O Lord, increase of faith, hope, and
   charity."
   [Page 38]
   CHAPTER XI.
   On keeping the Commandments, and on the necessity and possibility
   thereof.
   But no one, how much soever justified, ought to think himself exempt
   from the observance of the commandments; no one ought to make use of
   that rash saying, one prohibited by the Fathers under an anathema,-that
   the observance of the commandments of God is impossible for one that is
   justified. For God commands not impossibilities, but, by commanding,
   both admonishes thee to do what thou are able, and to pray for what
   thou art not able (to do), and aids thee that thou mayest be able;
   whose commandments are not heavy; whose yoke is sweet and whose burthen
   light. For, whoso are the sons of God, love Christ; but they who love
   him, keep his commandments, as Himself testifies; which, assuredly,
   with the divine help, they can do. For, although, during this mortal
   life, men, how holy and just soever, at times fall into at least light
   and daily sins, which are also called venial, not therefore do they
   cease to be just. For that cry of the just, Forgive us our trespasses,
   is both humble and true. And for this cause, the just themselves ought
   to feel themselves the more obligated to walk in the way of justice, in
   that, being already freed from sins, but made servants of God, they are
   able, living soberly, justly, and godly, to proceed onwards through
   Jesus Christ, by whom they have had access unto this grace. For God
   forsakes not those who have been once justified by His grace, unless he
   be first forsaken by them. Wherefore, no one ought to flatter himself
   up with faith alone, fancying that by faith alone he is made an heir,
   and will obtain the inheritance, even though he suffer not with Christ,
   that so he may be also glori-[Page 39]fied with him. For even Christ
   Himself, as the Apostle saith, Whereas he was the son of God, learned
   obedience by the things which he suffered, and being consummated, he
   became, to all who obey him, the cause of eternal salvation. For which
   cause the same Apostle admonishes the justified, saying; Know you not
   that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the
   prize? So run that you may obtain. I therefore so run, not as at an
   uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air, but I chastise my
   body, and bring it into subjection; lest perhaps, when I have preached
   to others, I myself should become a cast-away. So also the prince of
   the apostles, Peter; Labour the more that by good works you may make
   sure your calling and election. For doing those things, you shall not
   sin at any time. From which it is plain, that those are opposed to the
   orthodox doctrine of religion, who assert that the just man sins,
   venially at least, in every good work; or, which is yet more
   insupportable, that he merits eternal punishments; as also those who
   state, that the just sin in all their works, if, in those works, they,
   together with this aim principally that God may be gloried, have in
   view also the eternal reward, in order to excite their sloth, and to
   encourage themselves to run in the course: whereas it is written, I
   have inclined my heart to do all thy justifications for the reward:
   and, concerning Moses, the Apostle saith, that he looked unto the
   reward.
   CHAPTER XII.
   That a rash presumptuousness in the matter of Predestination is to be
   avoided.
   No one, moreover, so long as he is in this mortal life, ought so far to
   presume as regards the secret mystery of divine predestination, as to
   determine for certain that he is assuredly in [Page 40] the number of
   the predestinate; as if it were true, that he that is justified, either
   cannot sin any more, or, if he do sin, that he ought to promise himself
   an assured repentance; for except by special revelation, it cannot be
   known whom God hath chosen unto Himself.
   CHAPTER XIII.
   On the gift of Perseverance.
   So also as regards the gift of perseverance, of which it is written, He
   that shall persevere to the end, he shall be saved:-which gift cannot
   be derived from any other but Him, who is able to establish him who
   standeth that he stand perseveringly, and to restore him who
   falleth:-let no one herein promise himself any thing as certain with an
   absolute certainty; though all ought to place and repose a most firm
   hope in God's help. For God, unless men be themselves wanting to His
   grace, as he has begun the good work, so will he perfect it, working
   (in them) to will and to accomplish. Nevertheless, let those who think
   themselves to stand, take heed lest they fall, and, with fear and
   trembling work out their salvation, in labours, in watchings, in
   almsdeeds, in prayers and oblations, in fastings and chastity: for,
   knowing that they are born again unto a hope of glory, but not as yet
   unto glory, they ought to fear for the combat which yet remains with
   the flesh, with the world, with the devil, wherein they cannot be
   victorious, unless they be with God's grace, obedient to the Apostle,
   who says; We are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the
   flesh; for if you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if by
   the spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.
   [Page 41]
   CHAPTER XIV.
   On the fallen, and their restoration.
   As regards those who, by sin, have fallen from the received grace of
   Justification, they may be again justified, when, God exciting them,
   through the sacrament of Penance they shall have attained to the
   recovery, by the merit of Christ, of the grace lost: for this manner of
   Justification is of the fallen the reparation: which the holy Fathers
   have aptly called a second plank after the shipwreck of grace lost.
   For, on behalf of those who fall into sins after baptism, Christ Jesus
   instituted the sacrament of Penance, when He said, Receive ye the Holy
   Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and whose
   sins you shall retain, they are retained. Whence it is to be taught,
   that the penitence of a Christian, after his fall, is very different
   from that at (his) baptism; and that therein are included not only a
   cessation from sins, and a detestation thereof, or, a contrite and
   humble heart, but also the sacramental confession of the said sins,-at
   least in desire, and to be made in its season,-and sacerdotal
   absolution; and likewise satisfaction by fasts, alms, prayers, and the
   other pious exercises of a spiritual life; not indeed for the eternal
   punishment,-which is, together with the guilt, remitted, either by the
   sacrament, or by the desire of the sacrament,-but for the temporal
   punishment, which, as the sacred writings teach, is not always wholly
   remitted, as is done in baptism, to those who, ungrateful to the grace
   of God which they have received, have grieved the Holy Spirit, and have
   not feared to violate the temple of God. Concerning which penitence it
   is written; Be mindful whence thou art fallen; do penance, and do the
   first works. And again; The sorrow that is according to [Page 42] God
   worketh penance steadfast unto salvation. And again; Do penance, and
   bring forth fruits worthy of penance.
   CHAPTER XV.
   That, by every mortal sin, grace is lost, but not faith.
   In opposition also to the subtle wits of certain men, who, by pleasing
   speeches and good words, seduce the hearts of the innocent, it is to be
   maintained, that the received grace of Justification is lost, not only
   by infidelity whereby even faith itself is lost, but also by any other
   mortal sin whatever, though faith be not lost; thus defending the
   doctrine of the divine law, which excludes from the kingdom of God not
   only the unbelieving, but the faithful also (who are) fornicators,
   adulterers, effeminate, liers with mankind, thieves, covetous,
   drunkards, railers, extortioners, and all others who commit deadly
   sins; from which, with the help of divine grace, they can refrain, and
   on account of which they are separated from the grace of Christ.
   CHAPTER XVI.
   On the fruit of Justification, that is, on the merit of good works, and
   on the nature of that merit.
   Before men, therefore, who have been justified in this manner,-whether
   they have preserved uninterruptedly the grace received, or whether they
   have recovered it when lost,-are to be set the words of the Apostle:
   Abound in every good work, knowing that your labour is not in vain in
   the Lord; for God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and
   the love which you have shown in his name; and, do not lose your
   confidence, which hath a great reward. And, for this cause, life
   eternal is to be proposed to those working well unto [Page 43] the end,
   and hoping in God, both as a grace mercifully promised to the sons of
   God through Jesus Christ, and as a reward which is according to the
   promise of God Himself, to be faithfully rendered to their good works
   and merits. For this is that crown of justice which the Apostle
   declared was, after his fight and course, laid up for him, to be
   rendered to him by the just judge, and not only to him, but also to all
   that love his coming. For, whereas Jesus Christ Himself continually
   infuses his virtue into the said justified,-as the head into the
   members, and the vine into the branches,-and this virtue always
   precedes and accompanies and follows their good works, which without it
   could not in any wise be pleasing and meritorious before God,-we must
   believe that nothing further is wanting to the justified, to prevent
   their being accounted to have, by those very works which have been done
   in God, fully satisfied the divine law according to the state of this
   life, and to have truly merited eternal life, to be obtained also in
   its (due) time, if so be, however, that they depart in grace: seeing
   that Christ, our Saviour, saith: If any one shall drink of the water
   that I will give him, he shall not thirst for ever; but it shall become
   in him a fountain of water springing up unto life everlasting. Thus,
   neither is our own justice established as our own as from ourselves;
   nor is the justice of God ignored or repudiated: for that justice which
   is called ours, because that we are justified from its being inherent
   in us, that same is (the justice) of God, because that it is infused
   into us of God, through the merit of Christ. Neither is this to be
   omitted,-that although, in the sacred writings, so much is attributed
   to good works, that Christ promises, that even he that shall give a
   drink of cold water to one of his least ones, shall not lose his
   reward; and the Apostle testifies that, That which is at present
   momentary and light of our tribulation, worketh for us above measure
   exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; nevertheless God forbid that a
   Christian should either trust or glory in himself, and not in the Lord,
   whose bounty towards all [Page 44] men is so great, that He will have
   the things which are His own gifts be their merits. And forasmuch as in
   many things we all offend, each one ought to have before his eyes, as
   well the severity and judgment, as the mercy and goodness (of God);
   neither ought any one to judge himself, even though he be not conscious
   to himself of anything; because the whole life of man is to be examined
   and judged, not by the judgment of man, but of God, who will bring to
   light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
   counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise from God,
   who, as it is written, will render to every man according to his works.
   After this Catholic doctrine on Justification, which whoso receiveth
   not faithfully and firmly cannot be justified, it hath seemed good to
   the holy Synod to subjoin these canons, that all may know not only what
   they ought to hold and follow, but also what to avoid and shun.
   ON JUSTIFICATION
   CANON I.-If any one saith, that man may be justified before God by his
   own works, whether done through the teaching of human nature, or that
   of the law, without the grace of God through Jesus Christ; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON II.-If any one saith, that the grace of God, through Jesus
   Christ, is given only for this, that man may be able more easily to
   live justly, and to merit eternal life, as if, by free will without
   grace, he were able to do both, though hardly indeed and with
   difficulty; let him be anathema.
   CANON III.-If any one saith, that without the prevenient inspiration of
   the Holy Ghost, and without his help, man can believe, hope, love, or
   be penitent as he ought, so as that the grace of Justification may be
   bestowed upon him; let him be anathema.
   [Page 45] CANON IV.-If any one saith, that man's free will moved and
   excited by God, by assenting to God exciting and calling, nowise
   co-operates towards disposing and preparing itself for obtaining the
   grace of Justification; that it cannot refuse its consent, if it would,
   but that, as something inanimate, it does nothing whatever and is
   merely passive; let him be anathema.
   CANON V.-If any one saith, that, since Adam's sin, the free will of man
   is lost and extinguished; or, that it is a thing with only a name, yea
   a name without a reality, a figment, in fine, introduced into the
   Church by Satan; let him be anathema.
   CANON VI.-If any one saith, that it is not in man's power to make his
   ways evil, but that the works that are evil God worketh as well as
   those that are good, not permissively only, but properly, and of
   Himself, in such wise that the treason of Judas is no less His own
   proper work than the vocation of Paul; let him be anathema.
   CANON VII.-If any one saith, that all works done before Justification,
   in whatsoever way they be done, are truly sins, or merit the hatred of
   God; or that the more earnestly one strives to dispose himself for
   grace, the more grievously he sins: let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that the fear of hell,-whereby, by
   grieving for our sins, we flee unto the mercy of God, or refrain from
   sinning,-is a sin, or makes sinners worse; let him be anathema.
   CANON IX.-If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is
   justified; in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is required to
   co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of Justification, and
   that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed
   by the movement of his own will; let him be anathema.
   CANON X.-If any one saith, that men are just without the justice of
   Christ, whereby He merited for us to be justified; or that it is by
   that justice itself that they are formally just; let him be anathema.
   [Page 46] CANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by
   the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission
   of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured
   forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or
   even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of
   God; let him be anathema.
   CANON XII.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but
   confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ's sake; or,
   that this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON XIII.-If any one saith, that it is necessary for every one, for
   the obtaining the remission of sins, that he believe for certain, and
   without any wavering arising from his own infirmity and disposition,
   that his sins are forgiven him; let him be anathema.
   CANON XIV.-If any one saith, that man is truly absolved from his sins
   and justified, because that he assuredly believed himself absolved and
   justified; or, that no one is truly justified but he who believes
   himself justified; and that, by this faith alone, absolution and
   justification are effected; let him be anathema.
   CANON XV.-If any one saith, that a man, who is born again and
   justified, is bound of faith to believe that he is assuredly in the
   number of the predestinate; let him be anathema.
   CANON XVI.-If any one saith, that he will for certain, of an absolute
   and infallible certainty, have that great gift of perseverance unto the
   end,-unless he have learned this by special revelation; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON XVII.-If any one saith, that the grace of Justification is only
   attained to by those who are predestined unto life; but that all others
   who are called, are called indeed, but receive not grace, as being, by
   the divine power, predestined unto evil; let him be anathema.
   CANON XVIII.-If any one saith, that the commandments of God are, even
   for one that is justified and constituted in grace, impossible to keep;
   let him be anathema.
   [Page 47] CANON XIX.-If any one saith, that nothing besides faith is
   commanded in the Gospel; that other things are indifferent, neither
   commanded nor prohibited, but free; or, that the ten commandments
   nowise appertain to Christians; let him be anathema.
   CANON XX.-If any one saith, that the man who is justified and how
   perfect soever, is not bound to observe the commandments of God and of
   the Church, but only to believe; as if indeed the Gospel were a bare
   and absolute promise of eternal life, without the condition of
   observing the commandments ; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXI.-If any one saith, that Christ Jesus was given of God to men,
   as a redeemer in whom to trust, and not also as a legislator whom to
   obey; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXII.-If any one saith, that the justified, either is able to
   persevere, without the special help of God, in the justice received; or
   that, with that help, he is not able; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXIII.-lf any one saith, that a man once justified can sin no
   more, nor lose grace, and that therefore he that falls and sins was
   never truly justified; or, on the other hand, that he is able, during
   his whole life, to avoid all sins, even those that are venial,-except
   by a special privilege from God, as the Church holds in regard of the
   Blessed Virgin; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXIV.-If any one saith, that the justice received is not
   preserved and also increased before God through good works; but that
   the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification
   obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON XXV.-If any one saith, that, in every good work, the just sins
   venially at least, or-which is more intolerable still-mortally, and
   consequently deserves eternal punishments; and that for this cause only
   he is not damned, that God does not impute those works unto damnation;
   let him be anathema.
   CANON XXVI.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good
   works done in God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from
   God, through His mercy and the merit of Jesus Christ, if so be that
   they persevere to the end in well [Page 48] doing and in keeping the
   divine commandments; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXVII.-If any one saith, that there is no mortal sin but that of
   infidelity; or, that grace once received is not lost by any other sin,
   however grievous and enormous, save by that of infidelity ; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON XXVIII.-If any one saith, that, grace being lost through sin,
   faith also is always lost with it; or, that the faith which remains,
   though it be not a lively faith, is not a true faith; or, that he, who
   has faith without charity, is not a Chris taught; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXIX.-If any one saith, that he, who has fallen after baptism, is
   not able by the grace of God to rise again; or, that he is able indeed
   to recover the justice which he has lost, but by faith alone without
   the sacrament of Penance, contrary to what the holy Roman and universal
   Church-instructed by Christ and his Apostles-has hitherto professed,
   observed, and taugh; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXX.-If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification has
   been received, to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted, and the
   debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise, that there
   remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged either in
   this world, or in the next in Purgatory, before the entrance to the
   kingdom of heaven can be opened (to him); let him be anathema.
   CANON XXXI.-If any one saith, that the justified sins when he performs
   good works with a view to an eternal recompense; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXXII.-If any one saith, that the good works of one that is
   justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not
   also the good merits of him that is justified; or, that the said
   justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of God
   and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose [Page 49] living member he is,
   does not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the
   attainment of that eternal life,-if so be, however, that he depart in
   grace,-and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema.
   CANON XXXIII.-If any one saith,that,by the Catholic doctrine touching
   Justification, by this holy Synod inset forth in this present decree,
   the glory of God, or the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ are in any way
   derogated from, and not rather that the truth of our faith, and the
   glory in fine of God and of Jesus Christ are rendered (more)
   illustrious; let him be anathema.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION
   CHAPTER I.
   It is meet that prelates reside in their own churches; if they act
   otherwise, the penalties of the ancient law are renewed against them,
   and fresh penalties decreed.
   The same sacred and holy Synod,-the same legates of the Apostolic See
   presiding,-wishing to apply itself to restore ecclesiastical
   discipline, which is exceedingly relaxed, and to amend the depraved
   manners of the clergy and Christian people, has thought it fit to begin
   with those who preside over the greater churches; for the integrity of
   those who govern, is the safety of the governed. Trusting, therefore,
   that by the mercy of our Lord and God, and the provident vigilance of
   His own vicar on earth, it will surely for the future happen, that
   those who are most worthy,-and whose previous life, in every stage
   thereof, from their infancy to their riper years, having been laudably
   passed in the exercises of ecclesiastical discipline, bears testimony
   in their favour,-will be assumed unto the government of churches, in
   accordance with the venerable ordinances of the Fathers, for that it is
   a burthen whose weight would be formidable even unto angels: (the
   Synod) admonishes all those who, under whatsoever name and title, are
   set over any [Page 50] patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, and
   cathedral churches, and hereby accounts all such admonished, that,
   taking heed to themselves, and to the whole flock, wherein the Holy
   Ghost hath placed them to rule the Church of God which he hath
   purchased with his own blood, they be vigilant, as the Apostle enjoins,
   that they labour in all things, and fulfil their ministry: but let them
   know, that fulfil it they cannot, if like hirelings they abandon the
   flocks committed to them, and apply not themselves to the keeping of
   their own sheep, whose blood will be required at their hands, by the
   Supreme Judge; seeing that it is most certain that, if the wolf have
   devoured the sheep, the shepherd's excuse will not be admitted, that he
   knew not thereof.
   And yet, for as much as some are to be found at this time, who-as is
   grievously to be lamented-forgetful even of their own salvation, and
   preferring earthly things to heavenly, and things human before divine,
   wander about in various courts, or, their fold forsaken, and the care
   of the sheep committed to them neglected, keep themselves occupied with
   the solicitudes of temporal affairs; it hath seemed good to the sacred
   and holy Synod to renew, as by virtue of the present decree It doth
   renew, the ancient canons promulgated against non-residents, which
   (canons) have, through the disorders of the times and of men, well nigh
   fallen into desuetude; and furthermore, in order to the more fixed
   residence of the same, and for the reforming of manners in the church,
   it hath seemed good to appoint and ordain in the manner following:-If
   any one, by whatsoever dignity, degree, and pre-eminence distinguished,
   shall, by remaining six months together out of his own diocese, all
   lawful impediment, or just and reasonable causes ceasing, be absent
   from a patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, or cathedral church, under
   what title soever, cause, name, or right committed to him, he shall
   ipso jure incur the penalty of the forfeiture of a fourth part of one
   year's fruits, to be applied, by an ecclesiastical [Page 51] superior,
   to the fabric of the church and to the poor of the place. And if he
   continue absent in this way during six other months, he shall thereupon
   forfeit another fourth part of the fruits to be applied in like manner.
   But if the contumacy proceed yet further, the metropolitan shall, for
   the subjecting him to a severer censure of the sacred canons, be
   obliged to denounce his absent suffragan bishops, and the oldest
   resident suffragan bishop to denounce his absent metropolitan, to the
   Roman pontiff, either by letter or by messenger, within the space of
   three months, under the penalty, to be ipso facto incurred, of being
   interdicted from entering into the church; that he, by the authority of
   his own supreme See, may proceed against the said non-resident
   prelates, according as the greater or less contumacy of each may
   require, and provide the said churches with more useful pastors, as he
   shall know in the Lord to be salutary and expedient.
   CHAPTER II.
   It is not lawful for any one who holds a benefice requiring personal
   residence to absent himself, save for a just cause to be approved of by
   the bishop, who even then shall, for the cure of souls, substitute a
   vicar in his stead, withdrawing a portion of the fruits.
   Those inferior to bishops, who hold by title, or in commendam, any
   ecclesiastical benefices requiring personal residence whether by law or
   custom, shall be compelled, by their Ordinaries, to reside, by suitable
   legal remedies; as to them shall seem expedient for the good government
   of the churches and the advancement of the service of God, taking into
   account the character of the places and persons; and to no one shall
   any perpetual privileges, or indults, in favour of non-residence, or of
   receiving the fruits during absence, be of avail: temporary indulgences
   and dispensations, however, granted solely for true and reasonable
   causes, and which are to be legitimately proved before the Ordinary,
   shall remain in force; in which cases [Page 52] nevertheless, it shall
   be the office of bishops, as delegated in this matter by the Apostolic
   See, to provide that, by deputing competent vicars, and by assigning
   them a suitable portion of the fruits, the cure of souls be nowise
   neglected; no privilege or exemption whatever being of avail to any in
   this regard.
   CHAPTER III.
   The excesses of Secular clerics and of Regulars who live out of their
   monasteries, shall be corrected by the Ordinary of the place.
   The prelates of the churches shall apply themselves prudently and
   diligently to correct the excesses of their subjects; and no Secular
   cleric, under pretext of a personal privilege, or any Regular, living
   out of his monastery, shall, under pretext of a privilege of his order,
   be accounted, if he transgress, exempt from being visited, punished,
   and corrected, in accordance with the ordinances of the canons, by the
   Ordinary of the place, as being delegated hereunto by the Apostolic
   See.
   CHAPTER IV.
   Bishops and other greater prelates shall visit any churches whatsoever,
   as often as there shall be need; everything which might hinder this
   decree being abrogated.
   The Chapters of cathedral, and of other greater, churches, and the
   members thereof, shall not be able,-by any exemptions, customs,
   judgments, oaths, concordates, which only bind the authors thereof and
   not also their successors,-to screen themselves from being capable of
   being, in accordance with the ordinances of the canons, visited,
   corrected, and amended, as often as shall be needful, even with
   apostolical authority, by their own bishops, and other greater
   prelates, by themselves alone, or with those whom they shall see fit to
   have accompany them.
   [Page 53]
   CHAPTER V.
   Bishops shall neither exercise any pontifical function, nor ordain, in
   another diocese.
   It shall not be lawful for any bishop, under the plea of any privilege
   soever, to exercise pontifical functions in the diocese of another,
   save by the express permission of the Ordinary of the place, and in
   regard to those persons only who are subject to that same Ordinary: if
   the contrary shall have been done, the bishop shall be ipso facto
   suspended from the exercise of episcopal functions, and those so
   ordained (be similarly suspended) from the exercise of their orders.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   Doth it please you, that the next ensuing Session be celebrated on
   Thursday, the fifth day after the first Sunday of the approaching Lent,
   which (Thursday) will be the third day of the month of March? They
   answered: It pleaseth us.
   DECREE ON THE SACRAMENTS
   Proem.
   For the completion of the salutary doctrine on Justification, which was
   promulgated with the unanimous consent of the Fathers in the last
   preceding Session, it hath seemed suitable to treat of the most holy
   Sacraments of the Church, through which all true justice either begins,
   or being begun is increased, or being lost is repaired. With this view,
   in order to destroy the errors and to extirpate the heresies, which
   have appeared [Page 54] in these our days on the subject of the said
   most holy sacraments,-as well those which have been revived from the
   heresies condemned of old by our Fathers, as also those newly invented,
   and which are exceedingly prejudicial to the purity of the Catholic
   Church, and to the salvation of souls,-the sacred and holy, oecumenical
   and general Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the
   same legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein, adhering to the
   doctrine of the holy Scriptures, to the apostolic traditions, and to
   the consent of other councils and of the Fathers, has thought fit that
   these present canons be established and decreed; intending, the divine
   Spirit aiding, to publish later the remaining canons which are wanting
   for the completion of the work which It has begun.
   ON THE SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL
   CANON I.-If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law were not
   all instituted by Jesus Christ, our Lord; or, that they are more, or
   less, than seven, to wit, Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist,
   Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, and Matrimony; or even that any one of
   these seven is not truly and properly a sacrament; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON II.-If any one saith, that these said sacraments of the New Law
   do not differ from the sacramnets of the Old Law, save that the
   ceremonies are different, and different the outward rites; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON III.-If any one saith, that these seven sacraments are in such
   wise equal to each other, as that one is not in any way more worthy
   than another; let him be anathema.
   CANON IV.-If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New Law are not
   necessary unto salvation, but superfluous; and that, without them, or
   without the desire thereof, men obtain of God, through faith alone, the
   grace of justification;-though all (the sacraments) are not ineed
   necessary for every individual; let him be anathema.
   CANON V.-If any one saith, that these sacraments were instituted for
   the sake of nourishing faith alone; let him be anathema.
   [Page 55] CANON VI.-If any one saith, that the sacraments of the New
   Law do not contain the grace which they signify; or, that they do not
   confer that grace on those who do not place an obstacle thereunto; as
   though they were merely outward signs of grace or justice received
   through faith, and certain marks of the Christian profession, whereby
   believers are distinguished amongst men from unbelievers; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON VII.-If any one saith, that grace, as far as God's part is
   concerned, is not given through the said sacraments, always, and to all
   men, even though they receive them rightly, but (only) sometimes, and
   to some persons; let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that by the said sacraments of the New
   Law grace is not conferred through the act performed, but that faith
   alone in the divine promise suffices for the obtaining of grace; let
   him be anathema.
   CANON IX.-If any one saith, that, in the three sacrments, Baptism, to
   wit, Confirmation, and Order, there is not imprinted in the soul a
   character, that is, a certain spiritual and indelible Sign, on account
   of which they cannot be repeated; let him be anathema.
   CANON X.-If any one saith, that all Christians have power to administer
   the word, and all the sacraments; let him be anathema.
   CANON XI.-If any one saith, that, in ministers, when they effect, and
   confer the sacraments, there is not required the intention at least of
   doing what the Church does; let him be anathema.
   CANON XII.-If any one saith, that a minister, being in mortal sin,-if
   so be that he observe all the essentials which belong to the effecting,
   or conferring of, the sacrament,-neither effects, nor confers the
   sacrament; let him be anathema.
   CANON XIII.-If any one saith, that the received and approved rites of
   the Catholic Church, wont to be used in the solemn [Page 56]
   administration of the sacraments, may be contemned, or without sin be
   omitted at pleasure by the ministers, or be changed, by every pastor of
   the churches, into other new ones; let him be anathema.
   ON BAPTISM
   CANON I.-If any one saith, that the baptism of John had the same force
   as the baptism of Christ; let him be anathema.
   CANON II.-If any one saith, that true and natural water is not of
   necessity for baptism, and, on that account, wrests, to some sort of
   metaphor, those words of our Lord Jesus Christ; Unless a man be born
   again of water and the Holy Ghost; let him be anathema.
   CANON III.-If any one saith, that in the Roman church, which is the
   mother and mistress of all churches, there is not the true doctrine
   concerning the sacrament of baptism; let him be anathema.
   CANON IV.-If any one saith, that the baptism which is even given by
   heretics in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Ghost, with the intention of doing what the Church doth, is not true
   baptism; let him be anathema.
   CANON V.-If any one saith, that baptism is free, that is, not necessary
   unto salvation; let him be anathema.
   CANON VI.-If any one saith, that one who has been baptized cannot, even
   if he would, lose grace, let him sin ever so much, unless he will not
   believe; let him be anathema.
   CANON VII.-If any one saith, that the baptized are, by baptism itself,
   made debtors but to faith alone, and not to the observance of the whole
   law of Christ; let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that the baptized are freed from all the
   precepts, whether written or transmitted, of holy Church, in such wise
   that they are not bound to observe them, unless they have chosen of
   their own accord to submit themselves thereunto; let him be anathema.
   [Page 57] CANON IX.-If any one saith, that the resemblance of the
   baptism which they have received is so to be recalled unto men, as that
   they are to understand, that all vows made after baptism are void, in
   virtue of the promise already made in that baptism; as if, by those
   vows, they both derogated from that faith which they have professed,
   and from that baptism itself; let him be anathema.
   CANON X.-If any one saith, that by the sole remembrance and the faith
   of the baptism which has been received, all sins committed after
   baptism are either remitted, or made venial; let him be anathema.
   CANON XI.-If any one saith, that baptism, which was true and rightly
   conferred, is to be repeated, for him who has denied the faith of
   Christ amongst Infidels, when he is converted unto penitence; let him
   be anathema.
   CANON XII.-If any one saith, that no one is to be baptized save at that
   age at which Christ was baptized, or in the very article of death; let
   him be anathema.
   CANON XIII.-If any one saith, that little children, for that they have
   not actual faith, are not, after having received baptism, to be
   reckoned amongst the faithful; and that, for this cause, they are to be
   rebaptized when they have attained to years of discretion; or, that it
   is better that the baptism of such be omitted, than that, while not
   believing by their own act, they should be bapized in the faith alone
   of the Church; let him be anathema.
   CANON XIV.-If any one saith, that those who have been thus baptized
   when children, are, when they have grown up, to be asked whether they
   will ratify what their sponsors promised in their names when they were
   baptized; and that, in case they answer that they will not, they are to
   be left to their own will; and are not to be compelled meanwhile to a
   Christian life by any other penalty, save that they be excluded from
   the participation of the Eucharist, and of the other sacraments, until
   they repent; let him be anathema.
   [Page 58]
   ON CONFIRMATION
   CANON I.-If any one saith, that the confirmation of those who have been
   baptized is an idle ceremony, and not rather a true and proper
   sacrament; or that of old it was nothing more than a kind of catechism,
   whereby they who were near adolescence gave an account of their faith
   in the face of the Church; let him be anathema.
   CANON II.-If any one saith, that they who ascribe any virtue to the
   sacred chrism of confirmation, offer an outrage to the Holy Ghost; let
   him be anathema.
   CANON III.-If any one saith, that the ordinary minister of holy
   confirmation is not the bishop alone, but any simple priest soever; let
   him be anathema.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION
   The same sacred and holy Synod, the same legates also presiding,
   purposing to prosecute, unto the praise of God, and the increase of the
   Christian religion, the work which It hath begun touching residence and
   reformation, has thought good to ordain as follows,-saving always, in
   all things, the authority of the Apostolic See.
   CHAPTER I.
   Who is capable of governing Cathedral churches.
   No one shall be assumed unto the government of Cathedral churches, but
   one that is born of lawful wedlock, is of mature age, and endowed with
   gravity of manners, and skill in letters, agreeably to the constitution
   of Alexander III., which begins, Cum in cunctis, promulgated in the
   Council of Lateran.
   [Page 59]
   CHAPTER II.
   The holders of several Cathedral churches are commanded to resign all
   but one, in a given manner and time.
   No one, by whatsoever dignity, grade, or pre-eminence distinguished,
   shall presume, in contravention of the institutes of the sacred canons,
   to accept and to hold at the same time several Metropolitan, or
   Cathedral, churches, whether by title, or in commendam, or under any
   other name whatsoever; seeing that he is to be accounted exceedingly
   fortunate whose lot it is to rule one church well and fruitfully, and
   unto the salvation of the souls committed to him. But as to those who
   now hold several churches contrary to the tenor of the present decree,
   they shall be bound, retaining the one which they may prefer, to resign
   the rest, within six months if they are at the free disposal of the
   Apostolic See, in other cases within the year; otherwise those
   churches, the one last obtained only excepted, shall be from that
   moment deemed vacant.
   CHAPTER III.
   Benefices shall be conferred solely on capable individuals.
   Inferior Ecclesiastical Benefices, especially such as have the cure of
   souls, shall be conferred on persons worthy and capable, and who can
   reside on the spot and exercise personally the said cure; in accordance
   with the Constitution of Alexander IIl., in the Council of Lateran,
   which begins, Quia nonnulli; and that other of Gregory X., published in
   the General Council of Lyons, which begins, Licet Canon. A collation,
   or provision, made otherwise, shall be wholly annulled: and let the
   ordinary collator know, that he will himself incur the penalties set
   down in the Constitution of the General Council (of Lateran), which
   begins, Grave nimis.
   [Page 60]
   CHAPTER IV.
   The retainer of several Benefices contrary to the Canons, shall be
   deprived thereof.
   Whosoever shall for the future presume to accept, or to retain at the
   same time several cures, or otherwise incompatible Ecclesiastical
   Benefices, whether by way of union for life, or in perpetual commendam,
   or under any other name or title whatsoever, in contravention of the
   appointment of the sacred Canons, and especially of the Constitution of
   Innocent III., beginning, De multa, shall be ipso jure deprived of the
   said benefices, according to the disposition of the said constitution,
   and also by virtue of the present Canon.
   CHAPTER V.
   The holders of several Benefices with cure of souls shall exhibit their
   dispensations to the Ordinary, who shall provide the churches with a
   Vicar, assigning a suitable portion of the fruits.
   The Ordinaries of the places shall strictly compel all those who hold
   several cures, or otherwise incompatible, Ecclesiastical Benefices to
   exhibit their dispensations; and they shall otherwise proceed according
   to the Constitution of Gregory X., published in the General Council of
   Lyons, beginning Ordinarii, which (Constitution) this holy Synod thinks
   ought to be renewed, and doth renew; adding further, that the said
   Ordinaries are by all means to provide, even by deputing fit vicars and
   by assigning a suitable portion of the fruits, that the cure of souls
   be not in any way neglected, and that the said benfices be nowise
   defrauded of the services due to them: no appeals, privileges, or
   exemptions whatsoever, even with a commission of special judges, and
   inhibitions from the same, being of avail to any one in the matters
   aforenamed.
   [Page 61]
   CHAPTER VI.
   What unions of Benefices shall be accounted valid.
   Unions in perpetuity, made within forty years, may be examined into by
   the Ordinaries, as delegated by the Apostolic See, and such as shall
   have been obtained by surreption or obreption shall be declared null.
   Now those are to be presumed to have been surreptitiously obtained,
   which having been granted within the aforenamed period, have not as yet
   been carried into effect wholly, or in part, as also those which shall
   henceforth be made at the instance of any person soever, unless it
   shall be certain that they have been made for lawful, or otherwise
   reasonable causes, which are to be verified before the Ordinary of the
   place, those persons being summoned whose interests are concerned: and
   therefore (such unions) shall be altogether of no force, unless the
   Apostolic See shall have declared otherwise.
   CHAPTER VII.
   United Ecclesiastical Benefices shall be visited: the cure thereof
   shall be exercised even by perpetual vicars; who shall be deputed
   thereunto with a portion, to be assigned even upon a specific
   property.
   Ecclesiastical Benefices with cures, which are found to have been
   always united and annexed to Cathedral, Collegiate, or other churches,
   or to monasteries, benefices, colleges, or other pious places of what
   sort soever, shall be visited every year by the Ordinaries of those
   places; who shall apply themselves sedulously to provide that the cure
   of souls be laudably exercised by competent vicars, and those even
   perpetual, unless the said Ordinaries shall deem it expedient for the
   good of the churches that it be otherwise,-which (vicars) shall be
   deputed thereunto by those Ordinaries, with a provision consisting of a
   third part of the fruits, or of a greater or less proportion, at the
   discretion [Page 62] of the said Ordinaries, which (portion) is to be
   assigned even upon a specific property; no appeals, privileges,
   exemptions, even with a commission of judges, and inhibitions from the
   same, being of any avail in the matters abovenamed.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   Churches shall be repaired: the cure of souls sedulously discharged.
   The Ordinaries of the places shall be bound to visit every year, with
   apostolic authority, all churches whatsoever, in whatsoever manner
   exempted; and to provide by suitable legal remedies that whatever needs
   repairs, be repaired; and that those churches be not in any way
   defrauded of the Cure of souls, if such be annexed thereunto, or of
   other services due to them;-all appeals, privileges, customs, even
   those that have a prescription from time immemorial, commission of
   judges, and inhibitions from the same, being utterly set aside.
   CHAPTER IX.
   The duty of consecration not to be delayed.
   Those who have been promoted to the greater churches shall receive the
   rite of consecration within the time prescribed by law, and any delays
   granted, extending beyond the period of six months, shall be of no
   avail to any one.
   CHAPTER X.
   When a See is vacant, Chapters shall not grant 'reverends' to any
   unless straitened because of a Benefice obtained, or about to be
   obtained: various penalties on contraveners.
   It shall not be lawful for Chapters of churches, when a see is vacant,
   to grant,-whether by ordinance of common law, or by virtue of any
   privilege or custom whatsoever,-a license for [Page 63] ordination, or
   letters dimissory, or "reverend," as some call them, within a year from
   the day of that vacancy, to any one who is not straitened (for time),
   by occasion of some ecclesistical benefice received, or about to be
   received. Otherwise, the contravening Chapter shall be subjected to an
   ecclesiastical interdict; and the persons so ordained, if they have
   been constituted in minor orders, shall not enjoy any clerical
   privilege, especially in criminal causes; whilst those constituted in
   the greater orders shall be, ipso jure, suspended from the exercise
   thereof, during the pleasure of the next appointed prelate.
   CHAPTER XI.
   Faculties for promotion shall not avail any one without a just cause.
   Faculties, for being promoted (to orders) by any prelate whatsoever,
   shall be of no avail but to those who have a lawful cause-which is to
   be expressed in their letters-why they cannot be ordained by their own
   bishops; and even then they shall not be ordained but by a bishop who
   is resident in his own diocese, or by him who exercises the pontifical
   functions for him, and after having undergone a previous careful
   examination.
   CHAPTER XII.
   Faculties for not being promoted shall not exceed a year.
   Faculties granted for not being promoted (to orders) shall avail for a
   year only, except in the cases by law provided.
   [Page 64]
   CHAPTER XIII.
   Individuals by whomsoever presented shall not be instituted without
   being previously examined and approved of by the Ordinary; with certain
   exceptions.
   Persons presented, or elected, or nominated by any ecclesiastics
   soever, even by Nuncios of the Apostolic See, shall not be instituted,
   or confirmed in, or admitted to any ecclesiastical benefices
   whatsoever, even under the plea of any privilege soever, or custom,
   which may even have a prescription from time immemorial, unless they
   shall have been first examined, and found fit, by the Ordinaries of the
   places. And no one shall be able to screen himself, by means of an
   appeal, from being bound to undergo that examination. Those, however,
   are to be excepted, who are presented, elected, or nominated by
   universities, or by colleges for general studies.
   CHAPTER XIV.
   The civil causes of exempted persons which may be taken cognizance of
   by bishops.
   In the causes of exempted persons, the Constitution of Innocent IV.,
   beginning Volentes, set forth in the general Council of Lyons, shall be
   observed,-which Constitution this sacred and holy Synod hath thought
   ought to be renewed, and doth hereby renew it; adding further, that, in
   civil causes relative to wages, and to persons in distress, clerics,
   whether Seculars, or Regulars who live out of their
   monasteries,-howsoever exempted, and even though they may have upon the
   spot a special judge deputed by the Apostolic See; and in other causes,
   if they have no such judge,-may be brought before the Ordinaries of the
   places, and be constrained and compelled by course of law to [Page 65]
   pay what they owe; no privileges, exemptions, commissions of
   conservators, and inhibitions therefrom, being of any force whatever in
   opposition to the (regulations) aforesaid.
   CHAPTER XV.
   Ordinaries shall take care that all manner of hospitals, even those
   exempted, be faithfully governed by their adminstrators.
   The Ordinaries shall take care that all hospitals whatsoever be
   faithfully and diligently governed by their own administrators, by what
   names soever called, and in what way soever exempted: observing herein
   the form of the Constitution of the Council of Vienne, which begins,
   Quia contingit, which this holy Synod hath thought fit to renew, and
   doth hereby renew, together with the derogations therein contained.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   This sacred and holy Synod hath also resolved and decreed that the next
   ensuing Session be held and celebrated on Thursday, the fifth day after
   the coming Sunday in Albis (Low Sunday), which will be the twenty-first
   of the month of April of the present year, MDXLVII.
   BULL WITH FACULTY TO TRANFER THE COUNCIL
   Paul, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to our venerable brother
   Giammaria, bishop of Palaestrina, and to our beloved sons, Marcellus of
   the title of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, priest, and Reginald of Saint
   Mary in Cosmedin, deacon, cardinals, our Legates, a latere, and those
   of the Apostolic See, health and apostolical benediction.
   We, by the providence of God, presiding over the government of the
   universal Church, though with merits unequal thereunto, account it a
   part of our office that, if anything of more than common moment have to
   be settled touching the Christian [Page 66] commonweal, it be done not
   only at a suitable season, but also in a convenient and fit place.
   Wherefore, whereas We lately, with the advice and consent of our
   venerable brethren the cardinals of the holy Roman Church,-upon hearing
   that peace had been made between our most dear sons in Christ, Charles
   the Emperor of the Romans, ever august, and Francis the most Christian
   King of the French,-took off and removed the suspension of the
   celebration of the sacred oecumenical and universal Council, which we
   had on another occasion, for reasons then stated, indicted with the
   advice and consent aforesaid, for the city of Trent, and which was, for
   certain other reasons at that time also named, suspended, upon the like
   advice and consent, unto another more opportune and suitable time to be
   declared by us: being ourselves unable, from being at that time
   lawfully hindered, to repair to the above-named city in person, and to
   be present at that Council, We, by the same advice, appointed and
   deputed you as Legates a latere on our behalf and that of the Apostolic
   See, in that Council; and we sent you unto that same city as angels of
   peace, as in divers our letters thereupon is more fully set forth:
   wishing to provide seasonably that so holy a work as the celebration of
   such a Council may not be hindered through the incommodiousness of the
   place, or otherwise in any other manner, We, of our proper motion, and
   certain knowledge, and the plenitude of apostolic authority, and with
   the advice and consent aforesaid, by the tenor of these presents do,
   with apostolic authority, concede to you all together, or to two of
   you, upon the other being detained by a lawful impediment, or maybe
   absent therefrom, full and unrestrained power and faculty, to transfer
   and change, when soever you shall see cause, the aforesaid Council from
   the city of Trent to any other more Convenient, suitable, or safe City,
   as to you shall seem fit, and to suppress and dissolve that which is
   held in the said city of Trent; as also to prohibit, even under
   ecclesiastical pains and censures, the prelates and other members of
   the said Council, from proceeding to any further measures therein in
   the said sity of Trent; and also to continue, hold, and celebrate the
   same Council in the other city as aforesaid unto which it shall have
   been transferred and changed, and [Page 67] to summon thereunto the
   prelates and other members of the said Council of Trent, even under the
   pain of perjury and of the other penalties named in the letters of
   Indiction of that Council; to preside and proceed, in the Council thus
   translated and changed, in the name and by the authority aforesaid, and
   to perform, regulate, ordain, and execute the other things mentioned
   above, and the things thereunto necessary and suitable in accordance
   with the contents and tenor of the previous letters which have been on
   other occasion addressed unto you: declaring that We will hold as
   ratified and pleasing whatsoever by you shall have been done,
   regulated, ordained, in the matters aforesaid, and will, with God's
   help, cause it to be inviolably observed; any apostolical Constitutions
   and ordinances, and other things whatsoever to the contrary
   notwithstanding. Wherefore, let no one soever infringe this letter of
   our grant, or with rash daring go contrary thereto. But if any one
   shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the
   indignation of Almighty God, and of the blessed Peter and Paul, His
   apostles.

   SESSION THE EIGHTH,
   Celebrated on the eleventh day of the month of March, in the year
   MDXLVII.
   DECREE CONCERNING THE TRANSLATION OF THE COUNCIL
   Doth it please you to decree and declare, that, from the foregoing
   statements and other allegations, a disease of the kind stated is so
   plainly and notoriously certain, that the prelates cannot without
   danger of their lives remain in this city, and that [Page 68] therefore
   they cannot and ought not to be detained therein against their wills?
   And considering moreover the withdrawal of many prelates since the
   Session last held, and the protests made in the general congregations
   by very many other prelates, who wish by all means to depart hence
   through fear of the said disease, who cannot justly be detained; and by
   whose departure the Council would either be dissolved, or, from the
   small number of the prelates, its beneficial progress be hindered; and
   considering also the imminent danger to life, and the other notoriously
   true and legitimate reasons alleged in the said congregations by
   certain of the Fathers; doth it please you, in like manner, to decree
   and declare, that, for the preservation and prosecution of the said
   Council, and for the safety of the lives of the said prelates, this
   Council be transferred for a time to the city of Bologna, as being a
   place better provided, more healthy, and fit, and that the translation
   have effect from this day forth, and that the Session, already indicted
   for the twentyfirst of April ought to be celebrated, and be celebrated,
   there on that appointed day; and that the further matters be proceeded
   with in order, until it shall seem expedient, to our most holy Lord and
   to the sacred Council, that the said Council may, and ought to, be
   brought back to this, or to some other place, taking council also
   thereupon with the most invincible Emperor, the most Christian king,
   and with the other Christian kings and princes? They answered: It
   pleaseth us.
   SESSION THE NINTH,
   Celebrated at Bologna, on the twenty-first day of the month of April,
   MDXLVII.
   DECREE FOR THE PROROGATION OF THE SESSION
   This sacred and holy, ecumenical and general Synod, which lately was
   assembled in the city of Trent, and is now lawfully assembled in the
   Holy Ghost at Bologna, the same most reverend Lords Giammaria del
   Monte, bishop of Palaestrina, and Marcellus, of the title of the Holy
   Cross in Jerusalem, priest, [Page 69] cardinals of the holy Roman
   Church, and Legates apostolic a latere, presiding therein in the name
   of our most holy Father in Christ, and Lord, Paul III., by the
   providence of God, Pope; considering that, on the eleventh day of the
   month of March of the present year, in a general and public Session
   celebrated in the said city of Trent, in the usual place, all the
   formalities being observed in the usual manner; (the Synod) ,-for
   causes then pressing, urgent, and legitimate, and with the
   interposition also of the authority of the holy Apostolic See,
   specially also granted to the said most reverend Presidents,-decreed
   and ordained, that the Council was to be transferred, as it did
   transfer it, from that place to this city, and likewise that the
   Session,-indicted there for this twenty-first day of April, that Canons
   touching the matters of the Sacraments and of Reformation, whereon It
   had purposed to treat, might be established and promulgated,-ought to
   be celebrated in this city of Bologna; and considering that some of the
   Fathers who have been accustomed to be present at this Council,-being
   some engaged in their own Churches during these last days of the great
   week (of Lent), and of the Paschal solemnity, and some also detained by
   other hindrances, -have not as yet come hither, but who nevertheless,
   it is to be hoped, will shortly be present; and that, from this cause,
   it has happened that the said matters of the Sacraments and of
   Reformation could not be examined and discussed in an assembly of
   prelates as numerous as the holy Synod desired: wherefore, to the end
   that all things may be done with mature deliberation, with due dignity
   and gravity, (the Synod) hath resolved, and doth resolve, that it is
   good, opportunie, and expedient, that the aforenamed Session, which, as
   has been said, was to have been celebrated on this day, be deferred and
   prorogued, as it is now deferred and prorogued, to the Thursday within
   the approaching octave of Pentecost, for the expediting of the matters
   aforesaid; which day It has deemed, and deems, to be most opportune for
   the business to be transacted, and most convenient especially for the
   Fathers who are absent; adding however, that this holy Synod may and
   can, even in a private congregation, limit and abridge the said term,
   at Its will and pleasure, as It shall think expedient for the business
   of the Council.
   SESSION THE TENTH,
   Celebrated at Bologna on the second day of the month of June, MDXLVII.
   DECREE FOR THE PROROGATION OF THE SESSION
   Although this sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod hath
   decreed, that the Session which was to have been celebrated, in this
   illustrious city of Bologna, on the twenty-first day of the month of
   April last, on the subject of the Sacraments and of Reformation, in
   accordance with the decree promulgated in public Session in the city of
   Trent, should be deferred and prorogued to this present day, for
   certain reasons, and especially on account of the absence of some of
   the Fathers, who it was hoped would in a short time be present;
   wishing, however, even yet to deal kindly with those who have not come,
   the same sacred and holy Synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost,
   the same cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and Legates of the
   Apostolic See, presiding therein, resolves and decrees, that the said
   Session, which It had decreed to celebrate on this the second day of
   the month of June of this present year 1547, be deferred and prorogued,
   and It doth hereby defer and prorogue it, to the Thursday after the
   feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which will be the
   fifteenth of September next; for the expediting of the aforesaid and
   other matters; yet so, however, that the prosecution of the discussion
   and examination, as well of those things which relate to dogmas, as of
   those which regard reformation, shall not meanwhile be suspended; and
   that the said holy Synod freely may and can, at Its will and pleasure,
   even in a private congregation, abridge or prorogue the said term.
   On the fourteenth day of September, MDXLVII, in a general Congregation
   held at Bologna, the Session, which was to have been held on the
   following day, was prorogued during the good pleasure of the sacred
   Council.
   [Page 71]
   BULL FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT, UNDER THE SOVEREIGN
   PONTIFF, JULIUS III
   Julius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the future memory
   hereof.
   Whereas, in order to remove the dissensions touching our religion,
   which for a long time have prevailed in Germany to the disturbance and
   scandal of the whole Christian world, it seems good, opportune, and
   expedient,-as also our most dearly beloved son in Christ, Charles the
   Emperor of the Romans, ever august, has caused to be signified to us by
   his letters and ambassadors,-to bring back to the city of Trent, the
   sacred, oecumenical, (and) general Council indicted by our predecessor,
   Pope Paul III., of happy memory, and begun, regulated, and continued,
   by Us, who then enjoyed the honour of the Cardinalate, and conjointly
   with two other Cardinals of the holy Roman Church, presided in the name
   of our said predecessor, in the said Council, wherein several public
   and solemn Sessions were held, and several decrees promulgated as well
   on the subject of faith as of Reformation, and also many things
   relating to both subjects examined and discussed;-We,-unto whom, as
   Sovereign Pontiff for the time, it appertains to indict and direct
   general Councils,-that we may, unto the praise and glory of Almighty
   God, procure the peace of the Church and the increase of the Christian
   faith and of the orthodox religion, and may, as far as in us lies,
   consult with fatherly care for the tranquillity of Germany,-a province
   indeed which, in times past, was never second to any in Christendom, in
   cultivating true religion, and the doctrine of the sacred Councils and
   holy Fathers, and in exhibiting due obedience and reverence to the
   chief Pontiffs, the vicars on earth of Christ our Redeemer; hoping
   that, by the grace and bounty of God, all Christian kings and princes
   will approve of, favour and aid our just and pious wishes herein: We,
   by the bowels of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, exhort, require,
   and admonish our venerable brethren the patri-[Page 72]archs,
   archbishops, bishops, and our beloved sons the abbots, and all and each
   of the others, who of right, or custom, or privilege, ought to be
   present at General Councils, and whom our said predecessor, in his
   letters of indiction and any others soever made and published on this
   subject, willed to be present at the Council, to convene and assemble,
   where there is no lawful impediment, in the same city of Trent, and to
   apply themselves without any delay whatever to the continuation and
   prosecution of the said Council, on the next ensuing calends of May,
   which day we appoint, determine on, and assign, after mature
   deliberation, and of our own certain knowledge, and the plenitude of
   apostolic authority, and with the advice and consent of our venerable
   brethren the Cardinals of the said holy Roman Church, for resuming and
   prosecuting the said Council in the state wherein it now is. For We
   shall make it our special care, that, at the same time, in the said
   city, there be always present our Legates, through whom,-if we shall be
   unable, on account of our age, state of health, and the necessities of
   the Apostolic See, to be personally present,-we shall, under the
   guidance of the Holy Ghost, preside over the said Council; any
   translation and suspension of the said Council, and any other things
   whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding, and especially those things
   which it was the will of our predecessor should not create any
   obstacle, as expressed in his letters aforesaid, which, with all and
   each of the clauses and decrees therein contained, we will and decree
   to continue in force, and we do, as far as there is need thereof,
   hereby renew them; declaring moreover null and void whatsoever may be
   attempted, wittingly or ignorantly, by whatsoever person, or by
   whatsoever authority, against these presents. Let no one, therefore,
   infringe this our letter of exhortation, requisition, monition,
   statute, declaration, renewal, will, and decree, or with rash daring go
   contrary thereunto. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let
   him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of His
   blessed apostles, Peter and Paul.

   ROM. AMASEUS.
   SESSION THE ELEVENTH,
   Of the sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Council of Trent,
   celebrated on the calends of May, MDLI, being the first held under the
   Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III.
   DECREE FOR RESUMING THE COUNCIL
   Doth it please you, unto the praise and glory of the holy and undivided
   Trinity, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, for the increase and
   exaltation of the Christian faith and religion, that the sacred,
   oecumenical, and general Council of Trent be, agreeably to the form and
   tenor of the letters of our most holy lord, resumed, and that further
   matters be proceeded with? They answered: It pleaseth us.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   Doth it please you that the next ensuing Session be held and celebrated
   on the ensuing calends of September? They answered: It pleaseth us.
   SESSION THE TWELFTH,
   Being the second under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated
   on the first day of September, MDLI.
   The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent,-lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legate and nuncios of the
   Apostolic See presiding therein,-having, in [Page 74] the Session last
   held, decreed, that this next Session was to be on this day celebrated,
   and that further matters were to be proceeded with; whereas It has
   hitherto delayed to proceed, on account of the absence of the
   illustrious German nation,-whose interests are principally
   concerned,-and on account of the assemblage of the Fathers not being
   numerous; now rejoicing in the Lord, and giving deserved thanks to that
   same Almighty God, for the arrival, a little before this day, of our
   venerable brethren and sons in Christ, the Archbishops of Mayence and
   Treves,-electoral princes of the holy Roman Empire,-and also of several
   other bishops of that country and of other provinces; and conceiving a
   firm hope that very many other prelates, both of Germany and of other
   nations, will, impelled by the requirements of their office and by this
   example, in a few days arrive; (the Synod) indicts the next session for
   the fortieth day from this present, which will be the eleventh of
   October next:-and prosecuting the said Council in the state wherein it
   now is, whereas in the preceding Sessions decrees were passed touching
   the seven sacraments of the New Law in general, and on baptism and
   confirmation in particular, It resolves and decrees, that It will
   discuss and treat of the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist, and
   also, as regards Reformation, of the other matters which relate to the
   more easy and commodious residence of prelates. And It admonishes and
   exhorts all the Fathers, that, after the example of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, they meanwhile give themselves to fasting and prayer, so far at
   least as human weakness will permit, that so God, who is blessed for
   evermore, being at length appeased, may vouchsafe to bring back the
   hearts of men to the acknowledgment of His own true faith, to the unity
   of holy mother Church, and to the rule of righteous living.
   SESSION THE THIRTEENTH,
   Being the third under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated on
   the eleventh day of October, MDLI.
   DECREE CONCERNING THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
   The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent,-lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legate, and nuncios of the
   Apostolic See presiding therein, although the end for which It
   assembled, not without the special guidance and governance of the Holy
   Ghost, was, that It might set forth the true and ancient doctrine
   touching faith and the sacraments, and might apply a remedy to all the
   heresies, and the other most grievous troubles with which the Church of
   God is now miserably agitated, and rent into many and various parts;
   yet, even from the outset, this especially has been the object of Its
   desires, that It might pluck up by the roots those tares of execrable
   errors and schisms, with which the enemy hath, in these our calamitous
   times, oversown the doctrine of the faith, in the use and worship of
   the sacred and holy Eucharist, which our Saviour, notwithstanding, left
   in His Church as a symbol of that unity and charity, with which He
   would fain have all Christians be mentally joined and united together.
   Wherefore, this sacred and holy Synod delivering here, on this
   venerable and divine sacrament of the Eucharist, that sound and genuine
   doctrine, which the Catholic Church,-instructed by our Lord Jesus
   Christ Himself, and by His apostles, and taught by the Holy Ghost, who
   day by day brings to her mind all truth, has always retained, and will
   preserve even to the end of the world, forbids all the faithful of
   Christ, to presume to believe, teach, or preach henceforth concerning
   the holy Eucharist, otherwise than as is explained and defined in this
   present decree.
   [Page 76]
   CHAPTER I.
   On the real presence of our Lord Jesus Christ in the most holy
   sacrament of the Eucharist.
   In the first place, the holy Synod teaches, and openly and simply
   professes, that, in the august sacrament of the holy Eucharist, after
   the consecration of the bread and wine, our Lord Jesus Christ, true God
   and man, is truly, really, and substantially contained under the
   species of those sensible things. For neither are these things mutually
   repugnant,-that our Saviour Himself always sitteth at the right hand of
   the Father in heaven, according to the natural mode of existing, and
   that, nevertheless, He be, in many other places, sacramentally present
   to us in his own substance, by a manner of existing, which, though we
   can scarcely express it in words, yet can we, by the understanding
   illuminated by faith, conceive, and we ought most firmly to believe, to
   be possible unto God: for thus all our forefathers, as many as were in
   the true Church of Christ, who have treated of this most holy
   Sacrament, have most openly professed, that our Redeemer instituted
   this so admirable a sacrament at the last supper, when, after the
   blessing of the bread and wine, He testified, in express and clear
   words, that He gave them His own very Body, and His own Blood; words
   which,-recorded by the holy Evangelists, and afterwards repeated by
   Saint Paul, whereas they carry with them that proper and most manifest
   meaning in which they were understood by the Fathers,-it is indeed a
   crime the most unworthy that they should be wrested, by certain
   contentions and wicked men, to fictitious and imaginary tropes, whereby
   the verity of the flesh and blood of Christ is denied, contrary to the
   universal sense of the Church, which, as the pillar and ground of
   truth, has detested, as satanical, these inventions devised by impious
   men; she recognising, with a mind ever grateful and unforgetting, this
   most excellent benefit of Christ.
   [Page 77]
   CHAPTER II.
   On the reason of the Institution of this most holy Sacrament.
   Wherefore, our Saviour, when about to depart out of this world to the
   Father, instituted this Sacrament, in which He poured forth as it were
   the riches of His divine love towards man, making a remembrance of his
   wonderful works; and He commanded us, in the participation thereof, to
   venerate His memory, and to show forth his death until He come to judge
   the world. And He would also that this sacrement should be received as
   the spiritual food of souls, whereby may be fed and strengthened those
   who live with His life who said, He that eateth me, the same also shall
   live by me; and as an antidote, whereby we may be freed from daily
   faults, and be preserved from mortal sins. He would, furthermore, have
   it be a pledge of our glory to come, and everlasting happiness, and
   thus be a symbol of that one body whereof He is the head, and to which
   He would fain have us as members be united by the closest bond of
   faith, hope, and charity, that we might all speak the same things, and
   there might be no schisms amongst us.
   CHAPTER III.
   On the excellency of the most holy Eucharist over the rest of the
   Sacraments.
   The most holy Eucharist has indeed this in common with the rest of the
   sacraments, that it is a symbol of a sacred thing, and is a visible
   form of an invisible grace; but there is found in the Eucharist this
   excellent and peculiar thing, that the other sacraments have then first
   the power of sanctifying when one uses them, whereas in the Eucharist,
   before being used, there is the [Page 78] Author Himself of sanctity.
   For the apostles had not as yet received the Eucharist from the hand of
   the Lord, when nevertheless Himself affirmed with truth that to be His
   own body which He presented (to them). And this faith has ever been in
   the Church of God, that, immediately after the consecration, the
   veritable Body of our Lord, and His veritable Blood, together with His
   soul and divinity, are under the species of bread and wine; but the
   Body indeed under the species of bread, and the Blood under the species
   of wine, by the force of the words; but the body itself under the
   species of wine, and the blood under the species of bread, and the soul
   under both, by the force of that natural connexion and concomitancy
   whereby the parts of Christ our Lord, who hath now risen from the dead,
   to die no more, are united together; and the divinity, furthermore, on
   account of the admirable hypostatical union thereof with His body and
   soul. Wherefore it is most true, that as much is contained under either
   species as under both; for Christ whole and entire is under the species
   of bread, and under any part whatsoever of that species; likewise the
   whole (Christ) is under the species of wine, and under the parts
   thereof.
   CHAPTER IV.
   On Transubstantiation.
   And because that Christ, our Redeemer, declared that which He offered
   under the species of bread to be truly His own body, therefore has it
   ever been a firm belief in the Church of God, and this holy Synod doth
   now declare it anew, that, by the consecration of the bread and of the
   wine, a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the
   substance of the body of Christ our Lord, and of the whole substance of
   the wine into the substance of His blood; which conversion is, by the
   holy Catholic Church, suitably and properly called Transubstantiation.
   [Page 79]
   CHAPTER V.
   On the cult and veneration to be shown to this most holy Sacrament.
   Wherefore, there is no room left for doubt, that all the faithful of
   Christ may, according to the custom ever received in the Catholic
   Church, render in veneration the worship of latria, which is due to the
   true God, to this most holy sacrament. For not therefore is it the less
   to be adored on this account, that it was instituted by Christ, the
   Lord, in order to be received: for we believe that same God to be
   present therein, of whom the eternal Father, when introducing him into
   the world, says; And let all the angels of God adore him; whom the Magi
   falling down, adored; who, in fine, as the Scripture testifies, was
   adored by the apostles in Galilee.
   The holy Synod declares, moreover, that very piously and religiously
   was this custom introduced into the Church, that this sublime and
   venerable sacrament be, with special veneration and solemnity,
   celebrated, every year, on a certain day, and that a festival; and that
   it be borne reverently and with honour in processions through the
   streets, and public places. For it is most just that there be certain
   appointed holy days, whereon all Christians may, with a special and
   unusual demonstration, testify that their minds are grateful and
   thankful to their common Lord and Redeemer for so ineffable and truly
   divine a benefit, whereby the victory and triumph of His death are
   represented. And so indeed did it behove victorious truth to celebrate
   a triumph over falsehood and heresy, that thus her adversaries, at the
   sight of so much splendour, and in the midst of so great joy of the
   universal Church, may either pine away weakened and broken; or, touched
   with shame and confounded, at length repent.
   [Page 80]
   CHAPTER VI.
   On reserving the Sacrament of the sacred Eucharist, and bearing it to
   the Sick.
   The custom of reserving the holy Eucharist in the sacrarium is so
   ancient, that even the age of the Council of Nicaea recognised that
   usage. Moreover, as to carrying the sacred Eucharist itself to the
   sick, and carefully reserving it for this purpose in churches, besides
   that it is exceedingly conformable to equity and reason, it is also
   found enjoined in numerous councils, and is a very ancient observance
   of the Catholic Church. Wherefore, this holy Synod ordains, that this
   salutary and necessary custom is to be by all means retained.
   CHAPTER VII.
   On the preparation to be given that one may worthily receive the sacred
   Eucharist.
   If it is unbeseeming for any one to approach to any of the sacred
   functions, unless he approach holily; assuredly, the more the holiness
   and divinity of this heavenly sacrament are understood by a Christian,
   the more diligently ought he to give heed that he approach not to
   receive it but with great reverence and holiness, especially as we read
   in the Apostle those words full of terror; He that eateth and drinketh
   unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself. Wherefore, he who
   would communicate, ought to recall to mind the precept of the Apostle;
   Let a man prove himself. Now ecclesiastical usage declares that
   necessary proof to be, that no one, conscious to himself [Page 81] of
   mortal sin, how contrite soever he may seem to himself, ought to
   approach to the sacred Eucharist without previous sacramental
   confession. This the holy Synod hath decreed is to be invariably
   observed by all Christians, even by those priests on whom it may be
   incumbent by their office to celebrate, provided the opportunity of a
   confessor do not fail them; but if, in an urgent necessity, a priest
   should celebrate without previous confession, let him confess as soon
   as possible.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   On the use of this admirable Sacrament.
   Now as to the use of this holy sacrament, our Fathers have rightly and
   wisely distinguished three ways of receiving it. For they have taught
   that some receive it sacramentally only, to wit sinners: others
   spiritually only, those to wit who eating in desire that heavenly bread
   which is set before them, are, by a lively faith which worketh by
   charity, made sensible of the fruit and usefulness thereof: whereas the
   third (class) receive it both sacramentally and spiritually, and these
   are they who so prove and prepare themselves beforehand, as to approach
   to this divine table clothed with the wedding garment. Now as to the
   reception of the sacrament, it was always the custom in the Church of
   God, that laymen should receive the communion from priests; but that
   priests when celebrating should communicate themselves; which custom,
   as coming down from an apostolical tradition, ought with justice and
   reason to be retained. And finally this holy Synod with true fatherly
   affection admonishes, exhorts, begs, and beseeches, through the bowels
   of the mercy of our God, that all and each of those who bear the
   Christian name would now at length agree and be of one mind in this
   sign of unity, in this bond of charity, in this symbol of concord; and
   that mindful of the so great majesty, and the so [Page 82] exceeding
   love of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave His own beloved soul as the
   price of our salvation, and gave us His own flesh to eat, they would
   believe and venerate these sacred mysteries of His body and blood with
   such constancy and firmness of faith, with such devotion of soul, with
   such piety and worship as to be able frequently to receive that
   supersubstantial bread, and that it may be to them truly the life of
   the soul, and the perpetual health of their mind; that being
   invigorated by the strength thereof, they may, after the journeying of
   this miserable pilgrimage, be able to arrive at their heavenly country,
   there to eat, without any veil, that same bread of angels which they
   now eat under the sacred veils.
   But forasmuch as it is not enough to declare the truth, if errors be
   not laid bare and repudiated, it hath seemed good to the holy Synod to
   subjoin these canons, that all, -the Catholic doctrine being already
   recognised,-may now also understand what are the heresies which they
   ought to guard against and avoid.
   ON THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST
   CANON I.-If any one denieth, that, in the sacrament of the most holy
   Eucharist, are contained truly, really, and substantially, the body and
   blood together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   consequently the whole Christ; but saith that He is only therein as in
   a sign, or in figure, or virtue; let him be anathema.
   CANON lI.-If any one saith, that, in the sacred and holy sacrament of
   the Eucharist, the substance of the bread and wine remains conjointly
   with the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, and denieth that
   wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance of the bread
   into the Body, and of the whole substance of the wine into the
   Blood-the species Only of the bread and wine remaining-which conversion
   indeed the Catholic Church most aptly calls Transubstantiation; let him
   be anathema.
   CANON III.-If any one denieth, that, in the venerable sacrament of the
   Eucharist, the whole Christ is contained under each [Page 83] species,
   and under every part of each species, when separated; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON IV.-If any one saith, that, after the consecration is completed,
   the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ are not in the admirable
   sacrament of the Eucharist, but (are there) only during the use, whilst
   it is being taken, and not either before or after; and that, in the
   hosts, or consecrated particles, which are reserved or which remain
   after communion, the true Body of the Lord remaineth not; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON V.-If any one saith, either that the principal fruit of the most
   holy Eucharist is the remission of sins, or, that other effects do not
   result therefrom; let him be anathema.
   CANON VI.-If any one saith, that, in the holy sacrament of the
   Eucharist, Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, is not to be adored
   with the worship, even external of latria; and is, consequently,
   neither to be venerated with a special festive solemnity, nor to be
   solemnly borne about in processions, according to the laudable and
   universal rite and custom of holy church; or, is not to be proposed
   publicly to the people to be adored, and that the adorers thereof are
   idolators; let him be anathema.
   CANON VII.-If any one saith, that it is not lawful for the sacred
   Eucharist to be reserved in the sacrarium, but that, immediately after
   consecration, it must necessarily be distributed amongst those present;
   or, that it is not lawful that it be carried with honour to the sick;
   let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.-lf any one saith, that Christ, given in the Eucharist, is
   eaten spiritually only, and not also sacramentally and really; let him
   be anathema.
   CANON IX.-If any one denieth, that all and each of Christ's faithful of
   both sexes are bound, when they have attained to years of discretion,
   to communicate every year, at least at Easter, in accordance with the
   precept of holy Mother Church; let him be anathema.
   [Page 84] CANON X.-If any one saith, that it is not lawful for the
   celebrating priest to communicate himself; let him be anathema.
   CANON XI.-lf any one saith, that faith alone is a sufficient
   preparation for receiving the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist; let
   him be anathema. And for fear lest so great a sacrament may be received
   unworthily, and so unto death and condemnation, this holy Synod ordains
   and declares, that sacramental confession, when a confessor may be had,
   is of necessity to be made beforehand, by those whose conscience is
   burthened with mortal sin, how contrite even soever they may think
   themselves. But if any one shall presume to teach, preach, or
   obstinately to assert, or even in public disputation to defend the
   contrary, he shall be thereupon excommunicated.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION
   CHAPTER I.
   Bishops shall apply themselves with prudence to reform the manners of
   their subjects: from the correction of those bishops there shall be
   appeal.
   The same sacred and holy Synod,-lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost,
   the same legate and nuncios of the Apostolic See presiding
   therein,-purposing to ordain certain things which relate to the
   jurisdiction of bishops, in order that they may, in accordance with the
   decree of the last Session, so much the more willingly reside in the
   churches committed to them, by how much they shall be able, with
   greater ease and convenience, to rule and to keep in propriety of life
   and conversation those subject to them, thinks it meet that the bishops
   be first of all admonished to bear in mind, that they are pastors and
   not strikers, and that they ought so to preside over those subject to
   them, as not to lord it over them, but to love them as sons and
   brethren; and to strive, by exhortation and admonition, [Page 85] to
   deter them from what is unlawful, that they may not be obliged, should
   they transgress, to coerce them by due punishments. Towards whom,
   however, should they happen to sin in any manner through human frailty,
   that injunction of the apostle is by bishops to be observed, that they
   reprove, entreat, rebuke them in all kindness and doctrine; seeing that
   benevolence towards those to be corrected often effects more than
   austerity; exhortation more than menace; charity more than power. But
   if, on account of the grievousness of the transgression, there be need
   of the rod, then is rigour to be tempered with gentleness, judgment
   with mercy, severity with lenit; that so discipline, so salutary and
   necessary for the people, may be preserved without harshness; and they
   who are chastened may be amended, or, if they will not repent, that
   others, by the wholesome example of their punishment, may be deterred
   from vices; since it is the office of a pastor, at once vigilant and
   kind, to apply first of all gentle fomentations to the disorders of his
   sheep, and afterwards to proceed to sharper and more violent remedies,
   when the grievousness of the distempers may require them; but if not
   even these are effectual in removing those disorders, then is he to
   free the other sheep at least from the danger of contagion. Whereas,
   therefore, those guilty of crimes, ordinarily, in order to avoid
   punishment, and to evade the judgments of their bishops, affect to have
   subjects of complaint and grievances, and, under the subterfuge of an
   appeal, impede the process of the judge, (this Synod) in order to
   prevent a remedy which was instituted for the protection of innocence,
   from being abused to the defence of wickedness, and that this their
   craft and tergiversation may be met, hath ordained and decreed that: In
   causes relative to visitation and correction, or to competency or
   incompetency, as also in criminal causes, there shall be no appeal,
   before the definitive sentence, from the bishop or his vicar general in
   spirituals, against any interlocutory sentence, or other (alleged)
   grievance, whatsoever; neither shall the bishop, nor his vicar, be
   bound to defer to any [Page 86] such appeal, as being frivolous; but
   they may proceed to ulterior measures, that appeal, or any inhibition
   whatsoever emanating from a judge of appeal, as also every usage and
   custom even immemorial, to the contrary notwithstanding; except it be
   that the said grievance cannot be repaired by the definitive sentence,
   or that there is no appeal from the said definitive sentence; in which
   cases the statutes of the ancient canons shall remain untouched.
   CHAPTER II.
   An appeal from the bishop in criminal causes, when to be committed to
   the Metropolitan, or to one of the nearest bishops.
   A case of appeal-where there is room for such appeal-from the sentence
   of the bishop, or that of his vicar general, shall, if it happen to be
   a case committed by apostolic authority to judges on the spot, be
   referred to the metropolitan, or even to his vicar general in
   spirituals; or if that metropolitan be for some cause suspected, or be
   distant more than two days' journey as settled by law, or if it be from
   him that the appeal is made, the case shall be committed to one of the
   nearest bishops, or to the vicars thereof, but not to inferior judges.
   CHAPTER III.
   The acts of the first instance shall, within thirty days, be given
   gratuitously to the accused appellant.
   The accused who is in a criminal cause an appellant from the bishop, or
   from his vicar general in spirituals, shall absolutely produce, before
   the judge to whom he has appealed, the acts of the first instance; and
   the judge shall by no means proceed, without having seen them, to the
   absolution of the accused. And he, from whom the appeal is made, shall
   furnish on the demand (of the appellant), the said acts gratuitously
   within thirty days; otherwise the said case of appeal shall be
   terminated without them, in the way that justice may require.
   [Page 87]
   CHAPTER IV.
   In what manner clerics are, on account of grievous crimes, to be
   degraded from sacred Orders.
   And whereas crimes so grievous are sometimes committed by
   ecclesiastics, that, on account of the atrocity thereof, they have to
   be deposed from sacred orders, and delivered over to a secular court;
   in which case a certain number of bishops is, according to the Canons,
   required; and whereas, should there be a difficulty in assembling them
   all, the due execution of the law would be retarded; whilst, should
   they on any occasion be able to be present, their residence would be
   interrupted; therefore hath the Synod resolved and decreed, that it
   shall be lawful for a bishop, by himself or by his vicar general in
   spirituals, without the presence even of other bishops, to proceed
   against a cleric, even against one who is raised to the sacred order of
   the priesthood, even to his condemnation, as also to his verbal
   deposition; and he shall be able by himself to proceed even to actual
   and solemn degradation from the said ecclesiastical orders and degrees,
   in the cases wherein the presence of other bishops, in a specific
   number, is required by the Canons; taking, however, to himself, and
   being assisted therein by, a like number of abbots, who have the right
   of using the mitre and crosier by apostolic privilege, if so be that
   they can be found in the city, or diocese, and can conveniently be
   present; or in their default, (being assisted) by (a like number of)
   others persons constituted in ecclesiastical dignity, who are of weight
   by their age and recommended by their knowledge of law.
   CHAPTER V.
   The bishop shall take summary cognizance of graces whereby a sin, or a
   punishment, is remitted.
   And because it sometimes happens that, under false pleas, which
   notwithstanding seem probable enough, certain persons [Page 88]
   fraudulently obtain graces, whereby the punishments inflicted on them
   by the just severity of their bishops are either wholly remitted, or
   are mitigated; and whereas it is a thing not to be borne, that a lie,
   which is so exceedingly displeasing to God, should not only itself go
   unpunished, but even obtain for him that tells it, the pardon of
   another crime; the Synod hath for this cause ordained and decreed as
   follows: That a bishop, resident in his own church, shall of himself,
   as the delegate of the Apostolic See, take cognizance even summarily of
   the surreption or obreption of any grace, obtained under false
   pretences, for the absolution of any public crime or delinquency, into
   which he himself had instituted an inquiry; or for the remission of a
   punishment to which he has himself condemned the criminal; and he shall
   not admit the said grace, after that it shall have been lawfully
   ascertained, that it was obtained by the statement of what is false, or
   by the suppression of the truth.
   CHAPTER VI.
   A bishop shall not be personally cited, save in a case involving
   deposition, or deprivation.
   And whereas the subjects of a bishop, even though they have been justly
   chastened, do often nevertheless bear him a violent hatred, and, as if
   they had suffered some wrong at his hands, object false accusations
   against him, in order that they may annoy him by whatsoever means lie
   in their power,-the fear which annoyance doth for the most part render
   the bishop more backward in inquiring into and punishing delinquencies;
   therefore, that a bishop may not be compelled-both to his own great
   inconvenience and that of his Church-to abandon the flock entrusted to
   him, and that he may not be forced-not without the diminution of the
   episcopal dignity-to wander from place to place, (the Synod) hath thus
   ordained and decreed: That a [Page 89] bishop, even though he be
   proceeded against ex officio, or by way of inquiry, or denunciation, or
   accusation, or in any other way whatsoever, shall not be cited or
   warned to appear in person, except for a cause for which he might have
   to be deposed from, or deprived of, his office.
   CHAPTER VII.
   The qualifications of witnesses against a bishop are described.
   In a criminal cause, witnesses shall not be received against a bishop,
   whether as to the information, or proofs, or other process affecting
   the principal point of the case, unless their testimony agree, and they
   be of a good life, in good esteem and reputation; and if they shall
   have made any deposition through hatred, rashness, or interest, they
   shall be subjected to grievous punishments.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   Important episcopal causes shall be taken cognizance of by the Supreme
   Pontiff.
   The causes of bishops, when, on account of the quality of the crime
   objected, they have to appear (in person), shall be carried before the
   Sovereign Pontiff, and be by him decided.
   DECREE FOR POSTPONING THE DEFINITION OF FOUR ARTICLES TOUCHING THE
   SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST, AND FOR GIVING A SAFE-CONDUCT TO
   PROTESTANTS
   The same holy Synod,-desiring to pluck out of the field of the Lord all
   the errors which like thorns have sprung up again on the subject of
   this most holy sacrament, and wishing to provide for the salvation of
   all the faithful, her daily prayers being devoutly offered up to
   Almighty God for this end,-amongst the other articles, relative to this
   sacrament, which have been treated of with the most diligent inquiry
   into Catholic truth; very many and most accurate conferences, according
   to [Page 89] the importance of the matters, having been held, and the
   sentiments also of the most eminent theologians having been
   ascertained; has likewise treated of these following: whether it be
   necessary to salvation, and be prescribed of divine right, that all the
   faithful of Christ receive the said venerable sacrament under both
   species. And; whether he who communicates under either species receive
   less than he who communicates under both. And; whether holy Mother
   Church hath erred, by communicating, under the species of bread only,
   the laity, and priests when not celebrating. And; whether little
   children also are to be communicated. But whereas those, of the most
   noble province of Germany, who call themselves Protestants, desire to
   be heard by the holy Synod upon these said articles before they are
   defined, and for this end have asked for the public faith from the
   Synod, that they may be allowed to come hither in safety, dwell in this
   city, speak freely and set forth their sentiments before the Synod, and
   afterwards depart when they please; this holy Synod,-although It has
   looked forward with great earnestness for many months past for their
   coming, nevertheless, as an affectionate mother that groaneth and
   travaileth, most ardently desiring and labouring after this, that,
   amongst those who bear the Christian name, there may be no schisms, but
   that, even as all acknowledge the same God and Redeemer, so may all say
   the same thing, believe the same, think the same,-trusting in the mercy
   of God, and hoping that the result will be that they may be brought
   back to the most holy and salutary concord of one faith, hope, and
   charity, (and) yielding to them herein, hath, as far as the said Synod
   is concerned, given and granted, according to their request; a public
   assurance and faith, which they call a safe-conduct, of the tenor which
   will be set down below; and for their sakes It hath postponed the
   definition of those articles to the second next Session, which, that
   they may conveniently be present thereat, It hath indicted for the
   festival of the conversion of Saint Paul, which will be on the
   twenty-fifth day of the month of January of the ensuing year. And It
   furthermore ordains, that the [Page 91] sacrifice of the mass, on
   account of the close connexion between the two subjects, shall be
   treated of in the same Session; and that meanwhile It will treat of the
   sacraments of Penance and Extreme Unction in the next Session, which It
   hath decreed is to be held on the festival of Saint Catharine, virgin
   and martyr, which will be the twenty-fifth of November; and that at the
   same time, in both Sessions, the matter of reformation shall be
   proceeded with.
   SAFE-CONDUCT GRANTED TO PROTESTANTS
   The sacred and holy, general Synod of Trent,-lawfully assembled in the
   Holy Ghost, the same Legate and Nuncios of the holy Apostolic See
   presiding therein,-grants, as far as regards the holy Synod itself, to
   all and each one throughout the whole of Germany, whether ecclesiastics
   or Seculars, of whatsoever degree, estate, condition, quality they be,
   who may wish to repair to this oecumenical and general Council, the
   public faith and full security, which they call a safe-conduct, with
   all and each of the necessary and suitable clauses and decrees, even
   though they ought to be expressed specifically and not in general
   terms, and which it is Its wish shall be considered as expressed, so as
   that they may and shall have it in their power in all liberty to
   confer, make proposals, and treat on those things which are to be
   treated of in the said Synod; to come freely and safely to the said
   oecumenical Council, and there remain and abide, and propose therein,
   as well in writing as by word of mouth, as many articles as to them
   shall seem good, and to confer and dispute, without any abuse or
   contumely, with the Fathers, or with those who may have been selected
   by the said holy Synod; as also to withdraw whensoever they shall think
   fit. It hath furthermore seemed good to the holy Synod, that if, for
   their greater liberty and security, they desire that certain judges be
   deputed on their behalf, in regard of crimes whether committed, or that
   may be committed, by them, they shall themselves nominate those who are
   favourable towards them, even though the said crimes should be ever so
   enormous and should savour of heresy.
   SESSION THE FOURTEENTH,
   Being the fourth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated
   on the twenty-fifth of November, MDLI.
   ON THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENTS OF PENANCE AND EXTREME UNCTION
   Doctrine on the Sacrament of Penance.
   The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, -lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legate and Nuncios of the holy
   Apostolic See presiding therein, --although, in the decree concerning
   Justification, there has been, through a certain kind of necessity, on
   account of the affinity of the subjects, much discourse introduced
   touching the sacrament of Penance; nevertheless, so great, in these our
   days, is the multitude of various errors relative to this sacrament,
   that it will be of no small public utility to have given thereof a more
   exact and full definition, wherein, all errors having been, under the
   protection of the Holy Ghost, pointed out and extirpated, Catholic
   truth may be made clear and resplendent; which (Catholic truth) this
   holy Synod now sets before all Christians to be perpetually retained.
   CHAPTER I.
   On the necessity, and on the institution of the Sacrament of Penance.
   If such, in all the regenerate, were their gratitude towards God, as
   that they constantly preserved the justice received in baptism by His
   bounty and grace; there would not have been need for another sacrament,
   besides that of baptism itself, to be instituted for the remission of
   sins But because God, rich in mercy, knows our frame, He hath bestowed
   a remedy of life even on [Page 93] those who may, after baptism, have
   delivered themselves up to the servitude of sin and the power of the
   devil, --the sacrament to wit of Penance, by which the benefit of the
   death of Christ is applied to those who have fallen after baptism.
   Penitence was in deed at all times neccessary, in order to attain to
   grace and justice, for all men who had defiled themselves by any mortal
   sin, even for those who begged to be washed by the sacrament of Baptism
   ; that so, their perverseness renounced and amended, they might, with a
   hatred of sin and a godly sorrow of mind, detest so great an offence of
   God. Wherefore the prophet says; Be converted and do penance for all
   your iniquities, and iniquity shall not be your ruin. The Lord also
   said; Except you do penance, you shall also likewise perish; and Peter,
   the prince of the apostoles, reconmending penitence to sinners who were
   about to be initiated by baptism, said; Do penance, and be baptized
   every one you. Nevertheless, neither before the coming of Christ was
   penitance a sacrament, nor is it such, since His coming, to any
   previously to baptism. But the Lord then principally instituted the
   sacrament of penance, when, being raised from the dead, He breathed
   upon His disciples, saying Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose sins you
   shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain,
   they are retained. By which action so signal, and words so clear, the
   consent of all the Fathers has ever understood, that the power of
   forgiving and retaining sins was communicated to the apostles and their
   lawful successors, for the reconciling of the faithful who have fallen
   after baptism. And the Catholic Church with great reason repudiated and
   condemned as heretics, the Novatians, who of old obstinately denied
   that power of forgiving. Wherefore, this holy Synod, approving of and
   re ceiving as most true this meaning of those words of our Lord,
   condemns the fanciful interpretations of those who, in opposition to
   the institution of this sacrament, falsely wrest those words to the
   power of preaching the word of God, and of an nouncing the Gospel of
   Christ.
   [Page 93]
   CHAPTER II.
   On the difference between the Sacrament of Penance and that of Baptism
   For the rest, this sacrament is clearly seen to be different from
   baptism in many respects: for besides that it is very widely different
   indeed in matter and form, which constitute the essence of a sacrament,
   it is beyond doubt certain that the minister of baptism need not be a
   judge, seeing that the Church exercises judgment on no one who has not
   entered therein through the gate of baptism. For, what have I, saith
   the apostle, to do to judge them that are without? It is otherwise with
   those who are of the household of the faith, whom Christ our Lord has
   once, by the laver of baptism, made the members of His own body; for
   such, if they should afterwards have defiled themselves by any crime,
   He would no longer have them cleansed by a repetition of baptism--that
   being nowise lawful in the Catholic Church-but be placed as criminals
   before this tribunal; that, by the sentence of the priests, they might
   be freed, not once, but as often as, being penitent, they should, from
   their sins committed, flee thereunto. Furthermore, one is the fruit of
   baptism, and another that of penance. For, by baptism putting on
   Christ, we are made therein entirely a new creature, obtaining a full
   and entire remission of all sins: unto which newness and entireness,
   however, we are no ways able to arrive by the sacrament of Penance,
   without many tears and great labours on our parts, the divine justice
   demanding this; so that penance has justly been called by holy Fathers
   a laborious kind of baptism. And this sacrament of Penance is, for
   those who have fallen after baptism, necessary unto salvation; as
   baptism itself is for those who have not as yet been regenerated.
   [Page 92]
   CHAPTER III.
   On the parts, and on the fruit of this Sacrament.
   The holy synod doth furthermore teach, that the form of the sacrament
   of penance, wherein its force principally consists, is placed in those
   words of the minister, I absolve thee, &c: to which words indeed
   certain prayers are, according to the custom of holy Church, laudably
   joined, which nevertheless by no means regard the essence of that form,
   neither are they neces sary for the administration of the sacrament
   itself. But the acts of the penitent himself, to wit, contrition,
   confession and satisfaction, are as it were the matter of this
   sacrament. Which acts, inasmuch as they are, by God's institution,
   required in the penitent for the integrity of the sacrament, and for
   the full and perfect remission of sins, are for this reason called the
   parts of penance. But the thing signified indeed and the effect of this
   sacrament, as far as regards its force and efficacy, is reconciliation
   with God, which sometimes, in persons who are pious and who receive
   this sacrament with devotion, is wont to be followed by peace and
   serenity of conscience, with exceed ing consolation of spirit. The holy
   Synod, whilst delivering these things touching the parts and the effect
   of this sacrament, condemns at the same time the opinions of those who
   contend, that, the terrors which agitate the conscience, and faith, are
   the parts of penance.
   CHAPTER IV.
   On Contrition.
   Contrition, which holds the first place amongst the aforesaid acts of
   the penitent, is a sorrow of mind, and a detestation for sin committed,
   with the purpose of not sinning for the future. [Page 96] This movement
   of contrition was at all times necessary for obtaining the pardon of
   sins; and, in one who has fallen after baptism, it then at length
   prepares for the remissions of sins, when it is united with confidence
   in the divine mercy, and with the desire of performing the other things
   which are required for rightly receiving this sacrament. Wherefore the
   holy Synod declares, that this contrition contains not only a cessation
   from sin, and the purpose and the beginning of a new life, but also a
   hatred of the old, agreeably to that saying; Cast away from you all
   your iniquities, wherein you have transgressed, and make to yourselves
   a new heart and a new spirit. And assuredly he who has considered those
   cries of the saints; To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil
   before thee, I have laboured in my groaning, every night I will wash my
   bed, I will recount to thee all my years, in the bitterness of my soul,
   and others of this kind, will easily understand that they flowed from a
   certain vehement hatred of their past life, and from an exceeding
   detestation of sins. The Synod teaches moreover, that, although it
   sometimes happen that this contrition is perfect through charity, and
   reconciles man with God before this sacrament be actually received, the
   said reconciliation, nevertheless, is not to be ascribed to that
   contrition, independently of the desire of the sacrament which is
   included therein. And as to that imperfect contrition, which is called
   attrition, because that it is commonly conceived either from the
   consideration of the turpitude of sin, or from the fear of hell and of
   punishment, It declares that if, with the hope of pardon, it exclude
   the wish to sin, it not only does not make a man a hypocrite, and a
   greater sinner, but that it is even a gift of God, and an impulse of
   the Holy Ghost, --who does not indeed as yet dwell in the penitent, but
   only moves him, --whereby the penitent being assisted prepares a way
   for himself unto justice. And although this (attrition) cannot of
   itself, without the sacrament of penance, conduct the sinner to
   justification, yet does it dispose him to obtain the grace of God in
   the sacrament of [Page 97] Penance. For, smitten profitably with this
   fear, the Ninivites, at the preaching of Jonas, did fearful penance and
   obtained mercy from the Lord. Wherefore falsely do some calumniate
   Catholic writers, as if they had maintained that the sacrament of
   Penance confers grace without any good motion on the part of those who
   receive it: a thing which the Church of God never taught, or thought:
   and falsely also do they assert that contrition is extorted and forced,
   not free and voluntary.
   CHAPTER V.
   On Confession.
   From the institution of the sacrament of Penance as already explained,
   the universal Church has always understood, that the entire confession
   of sins was also instituted by the Lord, and is of divine right
   necessary for all who have fallen after baptism; because that our Lord
   Jesus Christ, when about to ascend from earth to heaven, left priests
   His own vicars, as presidents and judges, unto whom all the mortal
   crimes, into which the faithful of Christ may have fallen, should be
   carried, in order that, in accordance with the power of the keys, they
   may pronounce the sentence of forgiveness or retention of sins. For it
   is manifest, that priests could not have exercised this judgment
   without knowledge of the cause; neither indeed could they have observed
   equity in enjoining punishments, if the said faithful should have
   declared their sins in general only, and not rather specifically, and
   one by one. Whence it is gathered that all the mortal sins, of which,
   after a diligent examination of themselves, they are conscious, must
   needs be by penitents enumerated in confession, even though those sins
   be most [Page 98] hidden, and committed only against the two last
   precepts of the decalogue,--sins which sometimes wound the soul more
   grievously, and are more dangerous, than those which are committed
   outwardly. For venial sins, whereby we are not excluded from the grace
   of God, and into which we fall more frequently, although they be
   rightly and profitably, and without any presumption declared in
   confession, as the custom of pious persons demonstrates, yet may they
   be omitted without guilt, and be expiated by many other remedies. But,
   whereas all mortal sins, even those of thought, render men children of
   wrath, and enemies of God, it is necessary to seek also for the pardon
   of them all from God, with an open and modest confession. Wherefore,
   while the faithful of Christ are careful to confess all the sins which
   occur to their memory, they without doubt lay them all bare before the
   mercy of God to be pardoned: whereas they who act otherwise, and
   knowingly keep back certain sins, such set nothing before the divine
   bounty to be forgiven through the priest: for if the sick be ashamed to
   show his wound to the physician, his medical art cures not that which
   it knows not of. We gather furthermore, that those circumstances which
   change the species of the sin are also to be explained in confession,
   because that, without them, the sins themselves are neither entirely
   set forth by the penitents, nor are they known clearly to the judges;
   and it cannot be that they can estimate rightly the grievousness of the
   crimes, and impose on the penitents, the punishment which ought to be
   inflicted, on account of them. Whence it is unreasonable to teach, that
   these circumstances have been invented by idle men; or, that one
   circumstance only is to be confessed, to wit, that one has sinned
   against a brother. But it is also impious to assert, that confession,
   enjoined to be made in this manner, is impossible, or to call it a
   slaughter-house of consciences: for it is certain, that in the Church
   nothing else is required of penitents, but that, after each has
   examined himself diligently, and searched all the folds and recesses of
   his conscience, he confess those sins by which he shall remember that
   he has mortally offended [Page 99] his Lord and God: whilst the other
   sins, which do not occur to him after diligent thought, are understood
   to be included as a whole in that same confession; for which sins we
   confidently say with the prophet; From my secret sins cleanse me, O
   Lord. Now, the very difficulty of a confession like this, and the shame
   of making known one's sins, might indeed seem a grievous thing, were it
   not alleviated by the so many and so great advantages and consolations,
   which are most assuredly bestowed by absolution upon all who worthily
   approach to this sacrament. For the rest, as to the manner of
   confessing secretly to a priest alone, although Christ has not
   forbidden that a person may,--in punishment of his sins, and for his
   own humi liation, as well for an example to others as for the
   edification of the Church that has been scandalized,--confess his sins
   publicly, nevertheless this is not commanded by a divine precept;
   neither would it very prudent to enjoin by any human law, that sins,
   especially such as are secret, should be made known by a public
   confession. Wherefore, whereas the secret sacramental confession, which
   was in use from the beginning in holy Church, and is still also in use,
   has always been commended by the most holy and the most ancient Fathers
   with a great and unanimous consent, the vain calumny of those is
   manifestly refuted, who are not ashamed to teach, that confession is
   alien from the divine command, and is a human invention, and that it
   took its rise from the Fathers assembled in the Council of Lateran: for
   the Church did not, through the Council of Lateran, ordain that the
   faithful of Christ should confess,--a thing which it knew to be
   necessary, and to be instituted of divine right,--but that the precept
   of confession should be complied with, at least once a year, by all and
   each, when they have attained to years of discretion. Whence,
   throughout the whole Church, the salutary custom is, to the great
   benefit of the souls of the faithful, now observed, of confessing at
   that most sacred and most acceptable time of Lent,--a custom which this
   holy Synod most highly approves of and embraces, as pious and worthy of
   being retained.
   [Page 100]
   CHAPTER VI.
   On the ministry of this Sacrament, and on Absolution.
   But, as regards the minister of this sacrament, the holy Synod declares
   all these doctrines to be false, and utterly alien from the truth of
   the Gospel, which perniciously extend the ministry of the keys to any
   others soever besides bishops and priests; imagining, contrary to the
   institution of this sacrament, that those words of our Lord, Whatsoever
   you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven, and
   whatsoever you shall loose upon earth shall be loosed also in heaven,
   and, Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and whose
   sins you shall retain, they are retained,were in such wise addressed to
   all the faithful of Christ indifferently and indiscriminately, as that
   every one has the power of forgiving sins,-public sins to wit by
   rebuke, provided he that is rebuked shall acquiesce, and secret sins by
   a voluntary confession made to any individual whatsoever. It also
   teaches, that even priests, who are in mortal sin, exercise, through
   the virtue of the Holy Ghost which was bestowed in ordination, the
   office of forgiving sins, as the ministers of Christ; and that their
   sentiment is erroneous who contend that this power exists not in bad
   priests. But although the absolution of the priest is the dispensation
   of another's bounty, yet is it not a bare ministry only, whether of
   announcing the Gospel, or of declaring that sins are forgiven, but is
   after the manner of a judicial act, whereby sentence is pronounced by
   the priest as by a judge: and therefore the penitent ought not so to
   confide in his own personal faith, as to think that,--even though there
   be no contrition on his part, or no intention on the part of the priest
   of acting seriously and absolving truly,--he is nevertheless truly and
   in God's sight absolved, on account of his faith alone. For neither
   would [Page 101] faith without penance bestow any remission of sins;
   nor would he be otherwise than most careless of his own salvation, who,
   knowing that a priest but absolved him in jest, should not care fully
   seek for another who would act in earnest.
   CHAPTER VII.
   On the Reservation of Cases.
   Wherefore, since the nature and order of a judgment require this, that
   sentence be passed only on those subject (to that judicature), it has
   ever been firmly held in the Church of God, and this Synod ratifies it
   as a thing most true, that the absolution, which a priest pronounces
   upon one over whom he has not either an ordinary or a deligated
   jurisdiction, ought to be of no weight whatever. And it hath seemed to
   our most holy Fathers to be of great importance to the discipline of
   the Christian people, that certain more atrocious and more heinous
   crimes should be absolved, not by all priests, but only by the highest
   priests: whence the Sovereign Pontiffs, in virtue of the supreme power
   delivered to them in the universal Church, were deservedly able to
   reserve, for their special judgment, certain more grievous cases of
   crimes. Neither is it to be doubted,--seeing that all things, that are
   from God, are well ordered-but that this same may be lawfully done by
   all bishops, each in his own diocese, unto edification, however, not
   unto destruction, in virtue of the authority, above (that of) other
   inferior priests, delivered to them over their subjects, especially as
   regards those crimes to which the censure of excommunication is
   annexed. But it is consonant to the divine authority, that this
   reservation of cases have effect, not merely in external polity, but
   also in God's sight. Nevertheless, for fear lest any may perish on this
   account, it has always been very piously observed in the said Church of
   God, that there be no reservation at the point [Page 102] of death, and
   that therefore all priests may absolve all penitents whatsoever from
   every kind of sins and censures whatever: and as, save at that point of
   death, priests have no power in reserved cases, let this alone be their
   endeavour, to persuade penitents to repair to superior and lawful
   judges for the benefit of absolution.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   On the necessity and on the fruit of Satisfaction.
   Finally, as regards satisfaction,--which as it is, of all the parts of
   penance, that which has been at all times recommended to the Christian
   people by our Fathers, so is it the one especially which in our age is,
   under the loftiest pretext of piety, impugned by those who have an
   appearance of godliness, but have denied the power thereof,--the holy
   Synod declares, that it is wholly false, and alien from the word of
   God, that the guilt is never forgiven by the Lord, without the whole
   punishment also being therewith pardoned. For clear and illustrious
   examples are found in the sacred writings, whereby, besides by divine
   tradition, this error is refuted in the plainest manner possible. And
   truly the nature of divine justice seems to demand, that they, who
   through ignorance have sinned before baptism, be received into grace in
   one manner; and in another those who, after having been freed from the
   servitude of sin and of the devil, and after having received the gift
   of the Holy Ghost, have not feared, knowingly to violate the temple of
   God, and to grieve the Holy Spirit. And it beseems the divine clemency,
   that sins be not in such wise pardoned us without any sat is fac tion,
   as that, taking occasion therefrom, thinking sins less grievous, we,
   offering as it were an insult and an outrage to the Holy Ghost, should
   fall into more grievous sins, treasuring up wrath against the Jay of
   wrath. For, doubtless, these satisfactory punishments greatly recall
   from sin, and check as it were with a bridle, and make penitents more
   cautious and watchful for the future; they are also remedies for the
   remains [Page 103] of sin, and, by acts of the opposite virtues, they
   remove the habits acquired by evil living. Neither indeed was there
   ever in the Church of God any way accounted surer to turn aside the
   impending chastisement of the Lord, than that men should, with true
   sorrow of mind, practise these works of penitence. Add to these things,
   that, whilst we thus, by making satisfaction, suffer for our sins, we
   are made conformable to Jesus Christ, who satisfied for our sins, from
   whom all our sufficiency is; having also thereby a most sure pledge,
   that if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him. But
   neither is this satisfaction, which we discharge for our sins, so our
   own, as not to be through Jesus Christ. For we who can do nothing of
   ourselves, as of ourselves, can do all things, He cooperating, who
   strengthens us. Thus, man has not wherein to glory, but all our
   glorying is in Christ: in whom we live; in whom we merit; in whom we
   satisfy; bringing forth fruits worthy of penance, which from him have
   their efficacy; by him are offered to the Father; and through him are
   accepted by the Father. Therefore the priests of the Lord ought, as far
   as the Spirit and prudence shall suggest, to enjoin salutary and
   suitable satisfactions, according to the quality of the crimes and the
   ability of the penitent; lest, if haply they connive at sins, and deal
   too indulgently with penitents, by enjoining certain very light works
   for very grievous crimes, they be made partakers of other men 's sins.
   But let them have in view, that the satisfaction, which they impose, be
   not only for the preservation of a new life and a medicine of
   infirmity, but also for the avenging and punishing of past sins. For
   the ancient Fathers likewise both believe and teach, that the keys of
   the priests were given, not to loose only, but also to bind. But not
   therefore did they imagine that the sacrament of Penance is a tribunal
   of wrath or of punishments; even as no Catholic ever thought, by this
   kind of satisfactions on our parts, the efficacy of the merit and of
   the satisfaction of our Lord Jesus Christ is either obscured, [Page
   104] or in any way lessened: which when the innovators seek to
   understand, they in such wise maintain a new o be the est penance, as
   to Fake away the entire efficacy and use of satisfaction.
   CHAPTER IX.
   On Works of Satisfaction.
   The Synod teaches furthermore, that so great is the liberality of the
   divine munificence, that we are able through Jesus Christ to make
   satisfaction to God the Father, not only by punishments voluntarily
   undertaken of ourselves for the punishment of sin, or by those imposed
   at the discretion of the priest according to the measure of our
   delinquency, but also, which is a very great proof of love, by the
   temporal scourges inflicted of God, and borne patiently by us.
   ON THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION
   It hath also seemed good to the holy Synod, to subjoin, to the
   preceding doctrine on penance, the following on the sacrament of
   Extreme Unction, which by the Fathers was regarded as being the
   completion, not only of penance, but also of the whole Christian life,
   which ought to be a perpetual penance. First, therefore, as regards its
   institution, It declares and teaches, that our most gracious
   Redeemer,--who would have his servants at all times provided with
   salutary remedies against all the weapons of all their enemies,--as, in
   the other sacraments, He prepared the greatest aids, whereby, during
   life, Christians may preserve themselves whole from every more grievous
   spiritual evil, so did He guard the close of life, by the sacrament of
   Extreme Unction, as with a most firm defence. For though our adversary
   seeks and seizes opportunities, all our life long, to be able in any
   way to devour our souls; yet is there no time wherein he strains more
   vehemently all the powers of his craft to ruin us utterly, and, if he
   can possibly, to make us fall even from trust in the mercy of God, than
   when he perceives the end of our life to be at hand.
   [Page 105]
   CHAPTER I.
   On the Institution of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction.
   Now, this sacred unction of the sick was instituted by Christ our Lord,
   as truly and properly a sacrament of the new law, insinuated indeed in
   Mark, but recommended and promulgated to the faithful by James the
   Apostle, and brother of the Lord. Is any man, he saith, sick among you
   ? Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and let them pray over
   him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of
   faith shall save the sick man; and the Lord shall raise him up; and if
   he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him. In which words, as the
   Church has learned from apostolic tradition, received from hand to
   hand, he teaches the matter, the form, the proper minister, and the
   effect of this salutary sacrament. For the Church has understood the
   matter thereof to be oil blessed by a bishop. For the unction very
   aptly represents the grace of the Holy Ghost with which the soul of the
   sick person is invisibly anointed; and furthermore that whose words,
   "By this unction," &c. are the form.
   CHAPTER II.
   On the Effect of this Sacrament.
   Moreover the thing signified and the effect of this sacrament are
   explained in those words; And the prayer of faith shall save the sick
   man, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if he be in sins they shall
   be forgiven him. For the thing here signified is the grace of the Holy
   Ghost; whose anointing cleanses away sins, if there be any still to be
   expiated, as also the remains of sins; and raises up and strengthens
   the soul of the sick person, by exciting in him a great confidence in
   the [Page 106] divine mercy; whereby the sick being supported, bears
   more easily the inconveniences and pains of his sickness; and more
   readily resists the temptations of the devil who lies in wait for his
   heel; and at times obtains bodily health, when expedient for the
   welfare of the soul.
   CHAPTER III.
   On the Minister of this Sacrament, and on the time when it ought to be
   administered.
   And now as to prescribing who ought to receive, and who to administer
   this sacrament, this also was not obscurely delivered in the words
   above cited. For it is there also shown, that the proper ministers of
   this sacrament are the Presbyters of the Church; by which name are to
   be understood, in that place, not the elders by age, or the foremost in
   dignity amongst the people, but, either bishops, or priests by bishops
   rightly ordained by the imposition of the hands of the priesthood. It
   is also declared, that this unction is to be applied to the sick, but
   to those especially who lie in such danger as to seem to be about to
   depart this life: whence also it is called the sacrament of the
   departing. And if the sick should, after having received this unction,
   recover, they may again be aided by the succour of this sacrament, when
   they fall into another like danger of death. Wherefore, they are on no
   account to be hearkened to, who, against so manifest and clear a
   sentence of the apostle James, teach, either that this unction is a
   human figment or is a rite received from the Fathers which neither has
   a command from Cod, nor a promise of grace: nor those who assert that
   it has already ceased, as though it were only to be referred to the
   grace of healing in the primitive church; nor those who say that the
   rite and usage which the holy Roman Church observes in the
   administration of this sacrament is repugnant to the sentiment of the
   apostle James, and that it is therefore to be changed [Page 107] into
   some other: nor finally those who affirm that this Extreme Unction may
   without sin be contemned by the faithful : for all these things are
   most manifestly at variance with the perspicuous words of so great an
   apostle. Neither assuredly does the Roman Church, the mother and
   mistress of all other churches, observe aught in administering this
   unction,--as regards those things which constitute the substance of
   this sacrament,--but what blessed James has prescribed. Nor indeed can
   there be contempt of so great a sacrament without a heinous sin, and an
   injury to the Holy Ghost himself. These are the things which this holy
   oecumenical Synod professes and teaches and proposes to all the
   faithful of Christ, to be believed and held, touching the sacraments of
   Penance and Extreme Unction. And it delivers the following canons to be
   inviolably preserved; and condemns and anathematizes those who assert
   what is contrary thereto.
   ON THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF PENANCE
   CANON I.--If any one saith, that in the Catholic Church Penance is not
   truly and properly a sacrament, instituted by Christ our Lord for
   reconciling the faithful unto God, as often as they fall into sin after
   baptism; let him be anathema.
   CANON II.--If any one, confounding the sacraments, saith that baptism
   is itself the sacrament of Penance, as though these two Sacraments were
   not distinct, and that therefore Penance is not rightly called a second
   plank after shipwreck; let him be anathema.
   CANON III.--If any one saith, that those words of the Lord the Saviour,
   Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive, they are
   forgiven them, and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained, are
   not to be understood of the power of forgiving and of retaining sins in
   the Sacrament of penance, as the Catholic Church has always from the
   beginning understood them; but wrests them, contrary to the institution
   of this sacra ment, to the power of preaching the gospel; let him be
   anathema.
   [Page 108] CANON IV.--If any one denieth, that, for the entire and
   perfect remission of sins, there are required three acts in the
   penitent, which are as it were the matter of the sacrament of Penance,
   to wit, contrition, confession, and satisfaction, which are called the
   three parts of penance; or saith that there are two parts only of
   penance, to wit, the terrors with which the conscience is smitten upon
   being convinced of sin, and the faith, generated by the gospel, or by
   the absolution, whereby one believes that his sins are forgiven him
   through Christ; let him be anathema.
   CANON V.--If any one saith, that the contrition which is acquired by
   means of the examination, collection, and detestation of sins,--whereby
   one thinks over his years in the bitterness of his soul, by pondering
   on the grievousness, the multitude, the filthiness of his sins, the
   loss of eternal blessedness, and the eternal damnation which he has
   incurred, having therewith the purpose of a better life,--is not a true
   and profitable sorrow, does not prepare for grace, but makes a man a
   hypocrite and a greater sinner; in fine, that this (contrition) is a
   forced and not free and voluntary sorrow; let him be anathema.
   CANON VI.--If any one denieth, either that sacramental confession was
   instituted, or is necessary to salvation, of divine right; or saith,
   that the manner of confessing secretly to a priest alone, which the
   Church hath ever observed from the beginning, and doth observe, is
   alien from the institution and command of Christ, and is a human
   invention; let him be anathema.
   CANON VII.--If any one saith, that, in the sacrament of Penance, it is
   not necessary, of divine right, for the remission of sins, to confess
   all and singular the mortal sins which after due and diligent previous
   meditation are remembered, even those (mortal sins) which are secret,
   and those which are opposed to the two last commandments of the
   Decalogtie, as also the circumstances which change the species of a
   sin; but (saith) that such confession is only useful to instruct and
   console the penitent, and that it was of old only observed in order to
   impose a [Page 109] canonical satisfaction; or saith that they, who
   strive to confess all their sins, wish to leave nothing to the divine
   mercy to pardon ; or, finally, that it is not lawful to confess venial
   sins ; let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.--If any one saith, that the confession of all sins, such as
   it is observed in the Church, is impossible, and is a human tradition
   to be abolished by the godly; or that all and each of the faithful of
   Christ, of either sex, are not obliged thereunto once a year,
   conformably to the constitution of the great Council of Lateran, and
   that, for this cause, the faithful of Christ are to be persuaded not to
   con fess during Lent; let him be anathema.
   CANON IX.--If any one saith, that the sacramental absolution of the
   priest is not a judicial act, but a bare ministry of pronouncing and
   declaring sins to be forgiven to him who confesses; provided only he
   believe himself to be absolved, or (even though) the priest absolve not
   in earnest, but in joke; or saith, that the confession of the penitent
   is not required, in order that the priest may be able to absolve him;
   let him be anathema.
   CANON X.--If any one saith, that priests, who are in mortal sin, have
   not the power of binding and of loosing; or, that not priests alone are
   the ministers of absolution, but that, to all and each of the faithful
   of Christ is it said: Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth shall be
   bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall
   be loosed also in heaven; and, whose sins you shall forgive, they are
   forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained; by
   virtue of which words every one is able to absolve from sins, to wit,
   from public sins by reproof only, provided he who is reproved yield
   thereto, and from secret sins by a voluntary confession; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON XI.--If any one saith, that bishops have not the right of
   reserving cases to themselves, except as regards external polity, and
   that therefore the reservation of cases hinders not but that a priest
   may truly absolve from reserved cases; let him be anathema.
   [Page 110] CANON XII.--If any one saith, that God always remits the
   whole punishment together with the guilt, and that the satisfaction of
   penitents is no other than the faith whereby they apprehend that Christ
   has satisfied for them; let him be anathema.
   CANON XIII.--If any one saith, that satisfaction for sins, as to their
   temporal punishment, is nowise made to God, through the merits of Jesus
   Christ, by the punishments inflicted by Him, and patiently borne, or by
   those enjoined by the priest, nor even by those voluntarily undertaken,
   as by fastings, prayers, almsdeeds, or by other works also of piety;
   and that, therefore, the best penance is merely a new life; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON XIV.--If any one saith, that the satisfaction, by which enitents
   redeem their sins through Jesus Christ, are not a worship of God, but
   traditions of men, which obscure the doctrine of grace, and the true
   worship of God, and the benefit itself of the death of Christ; let him
   be anathema.
   CANON XV.--If any one saith, that the keys are given to the Church,
   only to loose, not also to bind; and that, therefore, priests act
   contrary to the purpose of the keys, and contrary to the institution of
   Christ, when they impose punishments on those who confess; and that it
   is a fiction, that, after the eternal punishment, has, by virtue of the
   keys, been removed, there remains for the most part a temporal
   punishment to be discharged; let him be anathema.
   ON THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION
   CANON I.--If any one saith, that Extreme Unction is not truly and
   properly a sacrament, instituted by Christ our Lord, and promulgated by
   the blessed apostle James; but is only a rite received from the
   Fathers, or a human figment; let him be anathema.
   [Page 111] CANON II.--If any one saith, that the sacred unction of the
   sick does not confer grace, nor remit sin, nor comfort(h) the sick; but
   that it has already ceased, as though it were of old only the grace of
   working Cures; let him be anathema.
   CANON III.--If any one saith, that the rite and usage of Extreme
   Unction, which the holy Roman Church observes, is repugnant to the
   sentiment of the blessed apostle James, and that is therefore to be
   changed, and may, without sin, be contemned by Christians; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON IV.--If any one saith, that the Presbyters of the Church, whom
   blessed James exhorts to be brought to anoint the sick, are not the
   priests who have been ordained by a bishop, but the elders in each
   community, and that for this Cause a priest alone is not the proper
   minister of Extreme Unction; let him be anathema.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION.
   Proem.
   It is the office of bishops to admonish their subjects, especially
   those appointed to the cure of souls, of their duty.
   Whereas it is properly the office of bishops to reprove the vices of
   all who are subject to them, this will have to be principally their
   care,--that clerics, especially those appointed to the cure of souls,
   be blameless; and that they do not, with their connivance, lead a
   disorderly life: for if they suffer them to be of evil and corrupt
   conversation, how shall they reprove the laity for their vices, when
   they themselves can be by one word silenced by them, for that they
   suffer clerics to be worse than they? And with what freedom shall
   priests be able to correct laymen, when they have to answer silently to
   themselves, that they have committed the very things which they
   reprove? Wherefore, bishops shall charge their clergy, of whatsoever
   rank they be, that they be a guide to the people of God committed to
   them, in conduct, conservation, and doctrine; being mindful of that
   which is written, Be holy for I also am holy. And, agreeably to the
   admonition of the apostle; Let them not give [Page 112] offence to any
   man, that their ministry be not blamed; but in all things let them
   exhibit themselves as the ministers of God, lest that saying of the
   prophet be fulfilled in them, The priests of God defile the
   sanctuaries, and despise the law. But, in order that the said bishops
   may be able to execute this with greater freedom, and may not be
   hindered therein under any pretext whatever, the same sacred and holy,
   ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent, the same legate and nuncios of
   the Apostolic See presiding therein, has thought fit that these canons
   following be established and decreed.
   CHAPTER I.
   If any, being prohibited, or interdicted, or suspended, advance to
   orders, they shall be punished.
   Whereas it is more beseeming and safe for one that is subject, by
   rendering due obedience to those set over him, to serve in an inferior
   ministry, than, to the scandal of those set over him, to aspire to the
   dignity of a more exalted degree; to him, unto whom the ascent to
   sacred orders shall have been interdicted by his own prelate, from
   whatsoever cause, be it even on account of some secret crime, or in
   what manner soever, even extra-judicially; and to him who shall have
   been suspended from his own orders, or ecclesiastical degrees and
   dignities; no license, conceded against the will of that said prelate,
   for causing himself to be promoted, nor any restoration to former
   orders, degrees, dignities and honours, shall be of any avail.
   CHAPTER II.
   If a bishop shall confer any orders whatsoever on one not subject to
   him, be he even his own domestic, without the express consent of that
   individual's proper prelate, both shall be subjected to an appointed
   punishment.
   And forasmuch as certain bishops of churches which are in partibus
   infidelium, (in the districts of unbelievers), having [Page 113]
   neither clergy nor Christian people, and being in a manner wanderers,
   having no fixed see, and seeking not the things of Christ, but other's
   sheep without the knowledge of their own pastor, finding themselves
   prohibited by this holy Synod from exercising episcopal functions in
   the diocese of another, without the express permission of the ordinary
   of the place, and then only in regard of those who are subject to the
   said ordinary, do, by an evasion and in contempt of the law, of their
   own rashness choose as it were an episcopal chair in a place which is
   not of any diocese, and presume to mark with the clerical character,
   and to promote even to the sacred orders of the priesthood, any that
   come unto them, even though they have no commendatory letters from
   their own bishops, or prelates; whence it for the most part comes to
   pass, that, persons being ordained who are but little fit, and are
   uninstructed and ignorant, and who have been rejected by their own
   bishops as incapable and unworthy, they are neither able rightly to
   perform the divine offices, nor to administer the sacraments of the
   Church: none of the bishops, who are called titular, even though they
   may reside, or tarry in a place within no diocese, even though it be
   exempted, or in a monastery of whatsoever order, shall, by virtue of
   any privilege granted them to promote during a certain time such as
   come unto them, be able to ordain, or to promote to any sacred or minor
   orders, or even to the first tonsure, the subject of another bishop,
   even under the pretext of his being his domestic fed constantly at his
   own table, without the express consent of, or without letters demissory
   from that individual's own bishop. The contravener shall be ipso jure
   suspended during a year from the exercise of pontifical functions; and
   the person so promoted shall in like manner be suspended from the
   exercise of the orders so received, for as long as to his own prelate
   shall seem fit.
   [Page 114]
   CHAPTER III.
   The bishop may suspend his clerics, who have been improperly promoted
   by another, if he find them incompetent.
   The bishop may suspend, for the time that shall seem to him fit, from
   the exercise of the orders received, and may interdict from ministering
   at the altar, or from exercising the functions of any order, any of his
   clerics, especially those who are in sacred orders, who have been,
   without his previous examination and commendatory letters, promoted by
   any authority whatsoever; even though they shall have been approved of
   as competent by him who has ordained them, but whom he himself shall
   find but little fit and able to celebrate the divine offices, or to
   administer the sacraments of the Church.
   CHAPTER IV.
   No cleric shall be exempt from the correction of the bishop, even out
   of the time of visitation.
   All prelates of the churches, who ought diligently to apply themselves
   to correct the excesses of their subjects,-and from whose jurisdiction,
   by the statutes of this holy Synod, no cleric is, under the pretext of
   any privilege soever, considered screened, so as not to be able to be
   visited, punished and corrected, in accordance with the appointments of
   the canons,--provided those prelates be resident in their own
   churches,--shall have power, as delegates for this end of the Apostolic
   See, to correct and punish, even out of the times of visitation, all
   Secular clerics,--howsoever exempted, who would otherwise be subject to
   their jurisdiction,--for their excesses, crimes, and delinquencies, as
   often as, and whensoever there shall be need; no exemptions,
   declarations, customs, sentences, oaths, concordates, which only bind
   the authors thereof, being of any avail to the said clerics, [Page 115]
   or to their relatives, chaplains, domestics, agents, or to any others
   whatsoever, in view and in consideration of the said exempted clerics.
   CHAPTER V.
   The jurisdiction of Conservators is confined within certain limits.
   Moreover, whereas sundry persons, under the plea that divers wrongs and
   annoyances are inflicted on them in their goods, possessions, and
   rights, obtain certain judges to be deputed by means of letters
   conservatory, to protect and defend them from the said annoyances and
   wrongs, and to maintain and keep them in possession, or
   quasi-possession, of their goods, property, and rights, without
   suffering them to be molested therein; and whereas they pervert these
   letters, in many ways, to an evil meaning quite opposed to the
   intention of the donor;--therefore, these letters conservatory,
   whatsoever be their clauses or decrees, whatsoever be the judges
   deputed, or under whatsoever other kind of pretext or colour, these
   letters may have been granted, shall not avail any, of what dignity and
   condition soever, even though a Chapter, so as to screen the party from
   being capable of being, in criminal and mixed causes, accused and
   summoned, and from being examined and proceeded against before his own
   bishop, or other ordinary superior; or prevent him from being liable to
   be freely summoned before the ordinary judge, in the matter of any
   rights which may be pleaded as his from having been ceded to him. In
   civil causes also, if he be the plaintiff, it shall nowise be lawful
   for him to bring up any one for judgment before his own judges
   conservatory. And if, in those causes wherein he shall be the
   defendant, it shall happen that the conservator chosen by him shall be
   declared by the plaintiff to be one suspected by him, or if any dispute
   shall have arisen between the judges themselves, the conservator [Page
   116] to wit and the ordinary, concerning competency of jurisdiction,
   the cause shall not be proceeded with, until by arbitrators, chosen in
   legal form, a decision shall have been come to relative to the said
   suspicion, or competency of jurisdiction. Neither shall these letters
   conservatory be of any avail to the said party's domestics--who are in
   the habit of screening themselves thereby--save to two only, and this
   provided they live at his proper cost. Neither shall any one enjoy the
   benefit of such letters longer than for five years. It shall also not
   be lawful for conservatory judges to have any fixed tribunal. As to
   causes which relate to wages and to destitute persons, the decree of
   this holy Synod thereupon shall remain in its full force. But general
   universities, colleges of doctors or scholars, places belonging to
   Regulars, as also hospitals wherein hospitality is actually exercised,
   and persons belonging to the said universities, colleges, places, and
   hospitals are not to be deemed included in this present canon, but are
   to be considered, and are, wholly exempted.
   CHAPTER VI.
   A penalty is decreed against clerics, who, being in sacred Orders, or
   holding benefices, do not wear a dress beseeming their Order.
   And forasmuch as, though the habit does not make the monk, it is
   nevertheless need ful that clerics always wear a dress suitable to
   their proper order, that by the decency of their outward apparel they
   may show forth the inward correctness of their morals; but to such a
   pitch, in these days, have the contempt of religion and the rashness of
   some grown, as that, making but little account of their own dignity,
   and of the clerical honour, they even wear in public the dress of
   laymen--setting their feet in different paths, one of God, the other of
   the flesh;-for this cause, all ecclesiastical persons, howsoever
   exempted, who are either in sacred orders or in possession of any
   manner of dignities, personates, or other offices, or benefices
   ecclesiastical; [Page 117] if, after having been admonished by their
   own bishop, even by a public edict, they shall not wear a becoming
   clerical dress, suitable to their order and dignity, and in conformity
   with the ordinance and mandate of the said bishop, they may, and ought
   to be, compelled thereunto, by suspension from their orders, office,
   benefice, and from the fruits, revenues, and proceeds of the said
   benefices; and also, if, after having been once rebuked, they offend
   again herein, (they are to be coerced) even by deprivation of the said
   offices and benefices; pursuant to the constitution of Clement V.
   published in the Council of Vienne, and beginning Quoniam, which is
   hereby renewed and enlarged.
   CHAPTER VII.
   Voluntary homicides are n ever to be ordained: in what manner
   involuntary homicides are to be ordained.
   Whereas too, he who has killed his neighbour on set purpose and by
   lying in wait for him, is to be taken away from the altar, (q) because
   he has voluntarily committed a homicide ; even though that crime have
   neither been proved by ordinary process of law, nor be otherwise
   public, but is secret, such an one can never be promoted to sacred
   orders; nor shall it be lawful to confer upon him any ecclesiastical
   benefices, even though they have no cure of souls; but he shall be for
   ever excluded from every ecclesiastical order, benefice, and office.
   But if it be alleged that the homicide was not committed purposely but
   accidentally, or when repelling force by force that he might defend
   himself from death, in such wise that, by a kind of right, a
   dispensation ought to be granted, even for the ministry of sacred
   orders, and of the altar, and for any kind of benefice whatever and
   dignity,-the case shall be committed to the Ordinary of the place, or,
   if there be a cause for it, to the metropolitan, or to the nearest
   bishop; who shall not be able [Page 118] to dispense, without having
   taking cognizance of the case, and after the prayers and allegations
   have been proved, and not otherwise.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   No one shall, by virtue of any privilege, punish the clerics of
   another.
   Furthermore, forasmuch as there are sundry persons,--some of whom even
   are true pastors, and have their own sheep,--who seek also to rule over
   the sheep of others, and at times give their attention in such wise to
   the subjects of others, as to neglect the care of their own; no one,
   even though he be of episcopal dignity, who may have by privilege the
   power of punishing the subjects of another, shall by any means proceed
   against clerics not subject to him,--especially against such as are in
   sacred orders,--be they guilty of crime ever so atrocious; except with
   the intervention of the proper bishop of the said clerics, if that
   bishop be resident in his own church, or of the person that may be
   deputed by the said bishop: otherwise, the proceedings, and all the
   consequences thereof, shall be wholly without effect.
   CHAPTER IX.
   The Benefices of one Diocese shall not, under any pretext, be united to
   the Benefices of another Diocese.
   And forasmuch as it is with very good reason that dioceses and parishes
   have been made distinct, and to each flock their proper pastors have
   been assigned, and to inferior churches their rectors, each to take
   care of his own sheep, that so ecclesiastical order may not be
   confounded, or one and the same church belong in some sort to two
   dioceses, not without grievous inconvenience to such as are subject
   thereunto; the benefices of one diocese, be they even parochial
   churches, perpetual vicarages, simple benefices, prestimonies, or
   prestimonial portions, shall [Page 119] not be united in perpetuity to
   a benefice, monastery, college, or even to a pious place, of another
   diocese, not even for the sake of augmenting divine worship, or the
   number of beneficiaries, or for any other cause whatsoever; thus herein
   explaining the decree of this holy Synod on the subject of these
   unions.
   CHAPTER X.
   Regular Benefices shall be conferred on Regulars.
   Benefices of Regulars that have been accustomed to be granted in title
   to professed Regulars, when they happen to become vacant by the death
   of the titulary incumbent, or by his resignation, or otherwise, shall
   be conferred on religious of that order only, or on persons who shall
   be absolutely bound to take the habit, and make that profession, and
   upon none others, that they may not wear a garment that is woven of
   woollen and linen together.
   CHAPTER XI.
   Those transferred to another order shall remain under obedience in
   enclosure, and shall be incapable of Secular Benefices.
   But forasmuch as Regulars, after being transferred from one order to
   another, ordinarily obtain permission easily from their superior to
   remain out of their monastery, whereby occasion is given of their
   wandering about and apostatizing; no prelate or superior of any order
   shall be allowed, by virtue of any faculty whatsoever, to admit any
   individual to the habit and to profession, except with the view that he
   shall remain perpetually in enclosure under obedience to his own
   superior, in the order itself to which he is transferred; and one so
   transferred, even though he be a canon Regular, shall be wholly
   incapable of Secular Benefices, even of cures.
   [Page 120]
   CHAPTER XII.
   No one shall obtain a right of patronage, except by means of a
   foundation, or an endowment.
   No one, moreover, of whatsoever ecclesiastical or Secular dignity, can,
   or ought to, obtain, or acquire a right of patronage, for any other
   reason whatever, but that he has founded, and built anew, a church,
   benefice, or chapel; or that he has competently endowed, out of his own
   proper and patrimonial resources, one already erected, which, however,
   is without a sufficient endowment. But, in case of such foundation or
   endowment, the institution thereof shall be reserved to the bishop, and
   not to some other inferior person.
   CHAPTER XIII.
   The Presentation shall be made to the Ordinary; otherwise the
   Presentation and Institution shall be null.
   Furthermore, it shall not be lawful for a patron, under pretext of any
   privilege whatsoever, to present any one, in any way, to the benefices
   which are under his right of patronage, except to the ordinary bishop
   of the place, to whom the providing for, or the institution to, the
   said benefice would, that privilege ceasing, of right belong; otherwise
   the presentation and institution, which may have followed, shall be
   null, and as such reputed.
   CHAPTER XIV.
   That the Mass, Order, and Reformation, shall be next treated of.
   The holy Synod declares, moreover, that, in the next Session, which It
   has already decreed is to beholden on the twenty-fifth [Page 121] day
   of January, of the ensuing year, MDLII,--It will, together with the
   sacrifice of the mass, also apply itself to, and treat of the sacrament
   of order, and that the subject of reformation will be prosecuted.
   SESSION THE FIFTEENTH,
   Being the fifth under thc Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III., celebrated on
   the twenty-fifth day of January, MDLlI.
   DECREE FOR PROROGUING THE SESSION
   Whereas, in pursuance of the decrees made in the last Sessions, this
   holy and universal Synod has, during these days, most accurately and
   diligently treated of the things which relate to the most holy
   sacrifice of the mass, and to the sacrament of order, with the view
   that, in the Session held on this day, It might publish, as the Holy
   Ghost should have suggested, decrees on these subjects, and on the four
   articles concerning the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist, which had
   been finally deferred to this Session ; and whereas it was thought
   that, in the interim, there would have presented themselves at this
   sacred and holy Council those who call themselves Protestants, for
   whose sake It had deferred the publication of the said articles, and to
   whom It had given the public faith, or a safe-conduct, that they might
   come freely and without any hesitation; nevertheless, seeing that they
   have not as yet come, and the holy Synod has been petitioned in their
   name, that the publication which was to have been made on this day, be
   deferred to the following Session, an assured hope being held out that
   they will certainly be present long before that Session, upon receiving
   in the meanwhile a safe-conduct in a more ample form :-The same holy
   Synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legate and
   Nuncios presiding, desiring nothing more ardently than to remove, from
   amongst the noble nation of Germany, all dissensions and schisms
   touchingreligion,and to provide for its tranquillity, peace and repose;
   being ready, should they come, both to receive [Page 122] them kindly,
   and to listen to them favourably, and trusting that they will come, not
   with the design of obstinately opposing the Catholic Faith, but of
   learning the truth, and that they will at last, as becomes those
   zealous for evangelical truth, acquiesce in the decrees and discipline
   of holy Mother Church; (this Synod) has deferred the next
   Session,--therein to publish and promulgate the matters
   aforesaid,--till the festival of St. Joseph, which will be on the
   nineteenth day of the month of March; in order that they may have
   sufficient time and leisure, not only to come, but also to propose,
   before that day arrives, whatsoever they may wish. And,- that It may
   take from them all cause for further delay, It freely gives and grants
   them the public faith,-or a safe-conduct, of the tenour and form
   hereafter set down. But it ordains and decrees, that, in the meantime,
   It will treat of the sacrament of matrimony,- and will give its
   decisions thereon, in addition to the publication of the above-named
   decrees, in the same Session, and will prosecute the subject of
   Reformation.
   SAFE-CONDUCT GIVEN TO THE PROTESTANTS
   The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,-lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legate and Nuncios of the
   Apostolic See presiding therein,--adhering to the safe-conduct given in
   the last Session but one, and enlarging it in the manner following,-
   certifies to all men,- that by the ten our of these presents, It grants
   and wholly concedes the public faith, and the fullest and most true
   security, which they entitle a safe-conduct, to all and singular the
   priests, electors,-princes, dukes, marquises, counts, barons, nobles,
   soldiers, commonalty, and to all other persons whatsoever, of what
   state, condition, or quality soever they may be, of the province and
   nation of Germany,- and to the cities and other places thereof, and to
   all other ecclesiastical and Secular persons,- especially those of the
   Confession of Augsburg,- who shall come, or shall be sent with them, to
   this General Council of Trent, and to those that shall set forth, or
   have already repaired hither,- by whatsoever name they are entitled, or
   may be designated,--to come freely to this city [Page 123] of Trent,
   and there to remain, abide, sojourn, and to propose, speak and treat
   of, examine and discuss, any matters whatsoever together with the said
   Synod, and freely to present and set forth all whatsoever they may
   think fit, and any articles what-ever, either in writing, or by word of
   mouth, and to explain, establish, and prove them by the sacred
   Scriptures, aiid by the words, passages, and reasons of the blessed
   Fathers, and to answer even, if it be needful, to the objections of the
   General Council; and to dispute, or to confer in charity, without any
   hindrance, with those who may have been selected by the Council, all
   opprobrious, railing, and contumelious laiiguage being utterly
   discarded; and in particular, that the controverted matters shall be
   treated of in the aforesaid Council of Trent, according to sacred
   Scripture, and the traditions of the apostles, approved Councils, the
   consent of the Catholic Church, and the authorities of the holy
   Fathers; with this further addition, that they shall not be punished
   under pretence of religion,- or of offences already committed, or that
   may be committed, in regard thereof; as also, that the divine offices
   shall not, on account of their presence, be in any way interrupted,
   either upon the road, or in any place during their progress, their
   stay, or their return, or in the city of Trent itself; and that, upon
   these matters being concluded, or before they are concluded,- if they,
   or any of them, shall wish, and whensoever such is their or his
   pleasure, or the command and leave of their superiors, to return to
   their own homes, they shall forthwith be able at their good pleasure,-
   to return freely and securely, without any let, obstacle, or delay,
   without injury done to their property, or to the honour also and
   persons of their attendants respectively,--notifying, however, this
   their purpose of withdrawing to those who shall be deputed hereunto by
   the said Synod, that so, without deceit or fraud, proper measures may
   be taken for their safety. The holy Synod also wills that all clauses
   whatsoever,- which may be necessary and useful for a full,- effectual,
   and sufficient security in coming, sojourning, and returning, be
   included and comprised, and be accounted as comprised, in this public
   faith and safe-conduct. It also expressly declares, with a view to
   their greater security, and the blessing of peace and reconciliation,
   that if, [Page 124] which God forbid, any one, or divers amongst them,
   should, either on the road when coming to Trent, or whilst sojourning
   at, or returning from, that same city, perpetrate or commit any heinous
   act, whereby the benefit of this public faith and assurance might be
   annulled and cease, that It wills and grants,- that the persons
   discovered in any such crime shall be forthwith punished by their own
   countrymen, and not by others, with a proportionate chastisement and a
   sufficient reparation, which the Synod on its part mayjustlyapprove of
   and commend-the form, conditions, and terms of the safe-conduct
   remaining wholly untouched thereby. It also reciprocally wills, that
   if, which God forbid, any one, or divers, of this Synod, should, either
   on the road, or whilst sojourning at, or returning therefrom,
   perpetrate or commit any heinous act, whereby the benefit of this
   public faith and assurance may be violated, or in any way set aside,
   the persons discovered in any such crime shall be forthwith punished by
   the Synod itself, and not by others,- with a proportionate chastisement
   and a sufficient reparation, which the Germans of the Confession of
   Augsburg, who may be present here at the time, may on their part justly
   approve of and commend,-the present form, conditions and terms of the
   safe-conduct remaining wholly untouched thereby. The said Synod also
   wills, that all and each of the ambassadors shall be allowed to go out
   of the city of Trent to take the air, as of ten as it shall be
   convenient or necessary, and to return thither; as also freely to send
   or despatch their messenger or messengers to any places whatsoever,
   according as their affairs may require, and to receive the said
   messengers or messenger, despatches or despatch, as often as they shall
   think fit; so as however one or more be associated therewith by the
   deputies of the Council,- to provide for the safety of the said
   couriers. And this safe-conduct and security shall stand good and
   endure, both from and during the time that they shall have been
   received under the care of the said Synod, and the protection of its
   agents; and further, after they have had a sufficient audience, and
   twenty days having expired after they have themselves asked, or after
   the Council, upon that audience had,- shall have given them notice, to
   return, It will, all deceit and fraud being entirely excluded,
   reconduct [Page 125] them, with God's help, from Trent to that place of
   safety which each may select for himself. All which things,- It
   promises and in good faith pledges Itself, shall be inviolably observed
   towards all and each of the faithful of Christ, towards all
   ecclesiastical and Secular princes, and towards all ecclesiastical and
   Secular persons, of whatsoever state and condition they may be, or by
   whatsoever name designated.
   Furthermore, It promises in sincere and good faith, without fraud or
   deceit, that the said Synod will neither openly nor covertly seek for
   any opportunity ; nor make use of, nor stiffer any one else to make use
   of, any authority, power, right, or statute, privilege of laws or
   canons, or of any Councils whatsoever, especially those of Constance
   and Sienna, under what form soever expressed,--to the prejudice in any
   way of this public faith, and niost full security, and of the public
   and free hearing, by this said Synod granted to the
   above-named;--derogating from the aforesaid in this regard and for this
   occasion.
   And if the holy Synod, or any member thereof,--or of their followers,
   of whatsoever condition, state or pre-eminence, shall violate --which
   may the Almighty forbid--the forms and terms of the security and safe-
   conduct as above set down, in any point or clause whatever, and a
   sufficient reparation shall not have forthwith followed,- and one that
   may with reason be approved of and praised by the (interested) parties
   themselves they may and shall hold the said Synod to have incurred all
   those penalties, which, by law human and divine, or by custom, the
   violators of such safe-conducts can possibly incur;--without there
   being any excuse or contrary allegation in this regard.
   SESSION THE SIXTEENTH,
   Being the sixth, and last under the Sovereign Pontiff, Julius III.,
   celebrated on the twenty-eighth day of April, MDLII.
   DECREE FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE COUNCIL
   The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the most reverend lords, Sebastian,
   Archbishop of Siponto, and Aloysius, Bishop of Verona, Apostolic
   Nuncios, presiding therein, as well in their own names as in that of
   the most reverend and illustrious lord, the Legate Marcellsu
   Crescenzio, Cardinal of the holy Roman Church, of the title of Saint
   Marcellus, who is absent by reason of a most grievous illness,--doubts
   not that it is well known to all Christians, that this ocecumenical
   Council of Trent was first convoked and assembled by Paul, of happy
   memory, and was afterwards, at the instance of the most august Emperor,
   Charles V., restored by our most holy lord, Julius III., for this cause
   especially, that It might bring back to its pristine state, religion
   which was miserably divided into diverse opinions in many parts of the
   world, and especially in Germany; and might amend the abuses and the
   most corrupt manners of Christians ; and whereas very many Fathers,
   without any regard to their personal labours and dangers, had for this
   end cheerfully assembled together from different countries, and the
   business was proceeded with earnestly and happily, in the midst of a
   great concurse of the faithful, and there was no slight hope that those
   Germans who had excited these novelties would come to the Council, and
   that so disposed as to acquiesce unanimously in the truthful reasons of
   the Church; when a kind of light, in fine, seemed to have dawned upon
   things; and the Christian commonwealth, before so cast-down and
   afflicted, began to lift up its head; of a sudden such tumults and wars
   were enkindled [Page 127] by the craft of the enemy of mankind, that
   the Synod was at much inconvenience compelled as it were to pause, and
   to interrupt its course, and all hope was taken away of further
   progress at that time; and so far was the holy Synod from remedying the
   evils and troubles existing amongst Christians, that, contrary to its
   intention, It irritated rather than calmed the minds of many. Whereas,
   therefore, the said holy Synod perceived that all places, and
   especially Germany, were in a flame with arms and discord; that almost
   all the German bishops, and in particular the Electoral Princes, had
   withdrawn from the Council, in order to provide for their own churches
   ; It resolved, not to struggle against so pressing a necessity, but to
   be silent till better times ; that so the Fathers, who could not now
   act, might return to their own churches to take care of their own
   sheep, and no longer wear away their time in unemployment, useless in
   both regards. And accordingly, for that the state of the times has so
   required, It decrees that the progress of this ocecumenial Synod of
   Trent shall be suspended during two years, as It doth suspend it by
   this present decree; with this condition however, that if things be
   settled sooner, and the former tranquillity restored, which It hopes
   will happen be fore long through the blessing of the all good and all
   powerful God, the progress of the Council shall be considered (as
   resumed, and) to have its full force, power and authority. But if,
   which may God forefend, the lawful impediments aforesaid shall not have
   been removed at the expiration of the two years, the said suspension
   shall, as soon as those impediments shall have ceased, be thereupon
   accounted removed, and the Council shall be, and be understood to be,
   restored to its full force and authority, without another fresh
   convocation thereof, the consent and authority of his Iloliness, and of
   the holy Aposotlic See, having been given to this decree. Meanwhile,
   however, this holy Synod exhorts all Christian princes, and all
   prelates, to observe, and respectively to cause to be observed, as far
   as they are concerned, in their own kingdoms, dominions, and churches,
   all and singular the things which have been hitherto ordained and
   decreed by this sacred oecumenical Council.
   [Page 128]
   BULL FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE COUNCIL OF TRENT, UNDER THE SOVEREIGN
   PONTIFF, PIUS IV
   Paul, Bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the perpeual memory
   hereof.
   Immediately on being called, by the alone mercy of God, to the
   Government of the Church, though unequal to so great a burthen, casting
   the eyes of our mind over every part of the Christian commonweal, and
   beholding, not without great horror, how far and wide the pestilence of
   heresy and schism had penetrated, and how much the morals of the
   Christian people stood in need of correction; we began, as the duty of
   our office required, to apply our care and thoughts to the means of
   extirpating the said heresies, of doing away with so great and so
   pernicious a schism, and of amending morals so much corrupted and
   depraved. And whereas we were sensible that, for the healing of these
   evils, that remedy was the most suitable which this Holy See had been
   accustomed to apply, we formed the resolution of convoking, and, with
   God's help, of celebrating an ocecumenical and general Council. That
   Council had indeed been already indicted by our predecessors, Paul
   III., of happy memory, and by Julius, his successor; but, having been
   often hindered and interrupted from various causes, It could not be
   brought to a conclusion. For Paul, after having indicted it first for
   the city of Mantua, then for Vicenza, he, for certain reasons expressed
   in his letters, first of all suspended, and afterwards transferred it
   to Trent. Then, after that the time of Its celebration had been, for
   certain reasons, then also postponed, at length, the suspension having
   been removed, It was begun, in the said city of Trent But, after a few
   Sessions had been held, and certain decrees made, the said Council
   afterwards, for certain reasons, with the concurrence also of the
   Apostolic See, transferred Itself to Bologna. But Julius, who succeeded
   him, recalled it to the same city of Trent, at which time certain other
   decrees were made. But as fresh tumults were raised in the neighbouring
   parts of Germany, and a most fierce war was enkindled in Italy and
   France, the Council was again suspended [Page 129] and postponed; the
   enemy of mankind, to wit, striving, and throwing difficulties upon
   difficulties and hindrances in the way, to retard at least as long as
   possible, though unable entirely to prevent, a thing so advantageous to
   the Church. But how greatly, meanwhile, the heresies were increased and
   multiplied, and propagated, how widely schism spread, we can neither
   think of, nor tell without the greatest sorrow of mind. But at length
   the Lord, good and merciful, who is never so angry as not to remember
   mercy, vouchsafed to grant peace and unanimity to Christian kings and
   princes. Which opportunity being offered us, we have, relying on His
   mercy conceived the strongest hope that, by the said means of a
   Council, an end may be put to these so grievous evils of the Church.
   We, therefore, have judged that the celebration thereof is no longer to
   be deferred; to the end that schisms and heresies may be taken away;
   that morals may be corrected and reformed; that peace may be pre-served
   amongst Christian princes. Wherefore, upon mature deliberation had with
   our venerable brethren the Cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and
   having also acquainted with this our purpose our most dearly beloved
   sons in Christ, Ferdinand, Emperor elect of the Romans, and other kings
   and princes whom,--even as we had promised ourselves from their
   exceeding piety and wisdom,--we found very ready to aid in the
   celebration of the said Council: We,--to the praise, honour, and glory
   of Almighty God, and for the good of the Universal Church, and relying
   on and supported by the authority of God Himself, and of the Blessed
   Apostles Peter and Paul, which (authority) we also exercise on
   earth,-indict a sacred oecumenical and general Council in the city of
   Trent for the next ensuing most sacred day of the Lord's Resurrection;
   and We ordain and appoint, that, all suspension soever removed, It be
   there celebrated. Wherefore, We do earnestly exhort and admonish in the
   Lord, and we do also strictly charge and command,--by virtue of holy
   obedience, and by the obligation of the oath which they have taken, and
   under the penalties which [Page 130] they know are appointed by the
   sacred canons against those who neglect to assemble at general
   Councils,--our venerable brethren of all nations, patriarchs,
   archbishops, bishops, and our beloved sons the abbots, and others who,
   by common law, or by privilege, or ancient custom, are allowed to sit,
   and give their opinion in a general Council, to meet, by the aforesaid
   day, there to celebrate a Council; unless they happen to be hindered by
   a lawful impediment, which impediment nevertheless they shall be bound
   to prove to the Synod by lawful proctors. We furthermore admonish all
   and each, whom it doth and may concern, that they fail not to be
   present at the Council. And we exhort and beseech our most dearly
   beloved sons in Christ, the Emperor elect of the Romans, and the other
   Christian kings and princes,--who it were sincerely to be wished could
   be present at the Council,--that, should they not be able to be
   themselves present thereat, they would send at least prudent, grave,
   and pious men as their ambassadors, to be present thereat in their
   name; and that they take diligent care, worthy of their piety, that the
   prelates of their kingdoms and dominions perform, without denial or
   delay, their duty to God and the Church at this so urgent a
   conjuncture: doubting not they will also provide that there be kept a
   safe and free passage through their kingdoms and dominions for the
   prelates and their domestics, attendants, and all others who are
   proceeding to or returning from the Council, and that they be treated
   and received in all places kindly and courteously; as we also will
   similarly provide as far as we are concerned, who have resolved not to
   omit anything that can by us, who have been placed in this position, be
   done towards the completion of so pious and salutary a work; seeking,
   as God knows, nothing else, proposing nothing else, in celebrating this
   Council, but the honour of God, the recovery and the salvation of the
   sheep that are scattered, and the perpetual tranquillity and repose of
   the Christian commonweal. And to the end that this letter, and the
   contents thereof may come to the knowledge of all whom it concerns, and
   that none may plead as an excuse that he knew not thereof, especially
   as there may not, perhaps, be free access to all, who ought to be made
   acquainted with this our letter: We will [Page 131] and ordain that, in
   the Vatican Basilica of the prince of the apostles, and in the Lateran
   Church, at the time when the people is wont to assemble there to be
   present at the solemnities of the mass, it be publicly read in a loud
   voice by officers of our court, or by certain public notaries; and that
   it be, after being read, affixed to the doors of the said churches,
   also to the gates of the apostolic Chancery, and to the usual place in
   the Campo di Fiore, where it shall for some time be left to be read by
   and made known to all men: and when removed thence, copies thereof
   shall remain affixed in those same places. For we will that, by being
   so read, published, and affixed, this letter shall oblige and bind,
   after an interval of two months from the day of being published and
   affixed, all and each of those whom it includes, even as if it had been
   communicated and read to them in person. And we ordain and decree,
   that, without any doubt, faith be given to copies thereof written, or
   subscribed, by the hand of a public notary, and guaranteed by the seal
   of some person constituted in ecclesiastical dignity. Wherefore, let no
   one infringe this our letter of indiction, statute, decree, precept,
   admonition and exhortation, or with rash daring go contrary thereunto.
   But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will
   incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of His Blessed Apostles,
   Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year MDLX of
   the Lord's Incarnation, on the third of the calends of December, in the
   first year of our Pontificate.

   SESSION THE SEVENTEENTH,
   Of the Holy, Oecumenical, and General Council of Trent, being the first
   under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on the eighteenth day
   of January, MDLXII.
   DECREE FOR CELEBRATING THE COUNCIL
   Doth it please you, unto the praise and glory of the Holy and Undivided
   Trinity, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, for the increase and
   exaltation of the faith, and of the Christian religion, that the
   sacred, ocecumenical, and general Council of Trent, lawfully assembled
   in the Holy Ghost, be, all manner of suspension removed, celebrated
   from this day-being the eighteenth of the month of January, in the year
   MDLXII from our Lord's Nativity, consecrated to the chair of Blessed
   Peter-according to the form and tenour of the letter of our most holy
   Lord, the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV.; and that, due order being
   observed, those things be treated of therein, which, the Legates and
   Presidents proposing, shall to the said holy Synod appear suitable and
   proper, for assuaging the calamities of these times, appeasing
   controversies concerning religion, restraining deceitful tongues,
   correcting the abuses of depraved manners, and for procuring for the
   Church a true and Christian peace? They answered: It pleaseth us.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   Doth it please you that the next ensuing Session be held and celebrated
   on the Thursday after the second Sunday of Lent, which will be on the
   twenty-sixth day of the month of February? They answered: It pleaseth
   us.
   under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on the twenty-sixth
   day of February, MDLXII.
   DECREE ON THE CHOICE OF BOOKS; AND FOR INVITING ALL MEN ON THE PUBLIC
   FAITH TO THE COUNCIL
   The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See
   presiding therein,--not confiding in human strength, but relying on the
   succour and assistance of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has promised that
   he would give to His Church a mouth and wisdom, hath especially in view
   to restore at length to its native purity and splendour, the doctrine
   of the Catholic faith, which is in many places defiled and obscured by
   the conflicting opinions of many who differ from each other; to bring
   back, to a better method of life, manners, which have divaricated from
   ancient usage; and to turn the heart of the fathers unto tke children,
   and the heart of the children unto the fathers. Whereas, then, first of
   all, it has noticed that the number of suspected and pernicious books,
   wherein an impure doctrine is Contained, and is disseminated far and
   wide, has in these days increased beyond measure, which indeed has been
   the cause that many censures have been, out of a godly zeal, published
   in divers provinces, and especially in the fair city of Rome,--and yet
   that no salutary remedy has availed against so great and pernicious a
   disorder; It hath thought good, that Fathers specially chosen for this
   inquiry, should carefully consider what ought to be done in the matter
   of censures and of books, and also in due time report thereon to this
   holy Synod; to the end that It may more easily separate the various and
   strange doctrines, as cockle from the wheat of Christian truth, and may
   more conveniently deliberate and determine, in regard thereof, that
   which shall seem best adapted to remove scruples from the minds of very
   many, and to do away with various causes of complaint. [Page 134] And
   the Synod wishes all this to come to the knowledge of all persons
   whatsoever, as by this present decree It doth make them cognizant
   thereof; in order that if any person may think himself in any way
   concerned, either in this matter of books and censures, or in the other
   things which It has declared beforehand are to be treated of in this
   General Council, he may not doubt but that he will be kindly listened
   to by the Holy Synod. And forasmuch as this said holy Synod heartily
   desires, and earnestly beseeches God for the things that are for the
   peace of the Church, that we all, acknowledging our common mother on
   earth, who cannot forget the sons of her womb, with one mouth may
   glorify Cod, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; It invites and
   exhorts, by the bowels of the mercy of our same God and Lord, all who
   hold not communion with us, unto concord and reconciliation, and to
   come unto this holy Synod; to embrace charity, which is the bond of
   perfection, and to show forth the peace of Christ rejoicing in thoir
   hearts, whereunto they are called, lit one body. Wherefore, in hearing
   this voice, not of man, but of the Holy Ghost, let them not harden
   their hearts, but, walking not after their own sense, nor pleasing
   themselves, let them be moved and converted by this so charitable and
   salutary an admonition of their own mother; for, as the holy Synod
   invites, so will It embrace them with all proofs of love. Moreover,
   this same holy Synod has decreed, that the public faith may be granted
   in a general congregation, and that It shall have the same force, and
   shall be of the same authority and weight as if it had been given and
   decreed in public Session.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   The same sacred and holy Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy
   Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See pre-[Page 135]siding
   therein, resolves and decrees, that the next ensuing Session be held
   and celebrated on the Thursday after the most sacred festival of the
   Ascension of our Lord, which will be on the fourteenth day of the month
   of May.
   SAFE-CONDUCT GRANTED TO THE GERMAN NATION
   In a General Congregation, on the fourth day of March, MDLXII.
   The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See
   presiding therein,--certifies to all men, that, by the tenour of these
   presents, It grants and wholly concedes the public faith, and the
   fullest and most true security, which they entitle a safe-conduct, to
   all and singular the priests, electors, princes, dukes, marquisses,
   counts, barons, nobles, soldiers, commonalty, and to all other persons
   whatsoever, of what state, condition, or quality soever they may be, of
   the province and nation of Germany, and to the cities and other places
   thereof, and to all the ecclesiastical and secular persons, especially
   those of the Confession of Augsburg, who shall come, or shall be sent
   with them to this General Council of Trent, and to those that shall set
   forth, or have already repaired hither, by whatsoever name they are
   entitled, or may be designated,--to Come freely to this city of Trent,
   and there to remain, abide, sojourn, and to propose, speak, and treat
   of, examine and discuss any matters whatsoever together with the said
   Synod, and freely to present and set forth all whatsoever they may
   think fit, and any articles whatever, either in writing or by word of
   mouth, and to explain, establish, and prove them by the sacred
   Scriptures, and by the words, passages, and reasons of the blessed
   Fathers, and to answer even, if it be needful, to the objections of the
   General Council, and to dispute, or to confer in charity, without any
   hindrance with those who have been selected by the Council, all
   opprobrious, railing, and contumelious language being utterly
   discarded; and, in particular, that the controverted matters shall be
   treated of, in the aforesaid Council of Trent, according to sacred
   Scripture, and the traditions of the apostles, [Page 136] approved
   Councils, the consent of the Catholic Church, and the authorities of
   the holy Fathers; with this further addition, that they shall not be
   punished under pretence of religion, or of offences already committed,
   or that may be committed, in regard thereof; as also, that the divine
   offices shall not, on account of their presence, be in any way
   interrupted, either upon the road, or in any place during their
   progress, their stay, or their return, or in the city of Trent itself ;
   and that, upon these matters being concluded, or before they are
   concluded, if they, or any of them, shall wish, and whensover such is
   their or his pleasure, or the command and leave of their superiors, to
   return to their own homes, they shall forthwith be able at their good
   pleasure, to return freely and securely, without any let, obstacle, or
   delay, without injury done to their property, or to the honour also and
   persons of their attendants respectively,--notifying, however, this
   their purpose of withdrawing, to those who shall be deputed hereunto by
   the said Synod, that so, without deceit or fraud, proper measures may
   be taken for their safety. The holy Synod also wills that all clauses
   whatsoever, which may be necessary and useful for a full, effectual,
   and sufficient security in coming, sojourning, and returning, be
   included and comprised, and be accounted as comprised, in this public
   faith and safe-conduct. It also expressly declares, with a view to
   their greater security, and the blessing of peace and reconciliation,
   that if, which God forbid, any one, or divers amongst them, should,
   either on the road when coming to Trent, or whilst sojourning at, or
   returning from that same city, perpetrate or commit any heinous act,
   whereby the benefit of this public faith and assurance might be
   annulled and quashed, that It wills and grants, that the persons
   discovered in any such crime shall be forthwith punished by their own
   countrymen, and not by others, with a proportionate chastisement and a
   sufficient reparation, which the Synod on its part may justly approve
   of and commend,--the form, conditions, and terms of their safe-conduct
   remaining wholly untouched thereby. It also reciprocally wills, that
   if, which God forbid, any one, or divers, of this Synod, should, either
   on the road, or whilst sojourning at, or returning therefrom,
   perpetrate or commit any heinous act, [Page 137] whereby the benefit of
   this public faith and assurance may be violated, or in any way set
   aside, the persons discovered in any such Crime shall be forthwith
   punished by the Synod itself, and not by others, with a proportionate
   chastisement and a sufficient reparation, which the Germans of the
   Confession of Augsburg, who may be present here at the time, may on
   their part justly approve of and commend,--the present form,
   Conditions, and terms of the safe-conduct remaining wholly untouched
   thereby. The said Synod also wills, that all and each of the
   ambassadors shall be allowed to go out of the City of Trent to take the
   air, as often as it shall be convenient or necessary, and to return
   thither; as also freely to send or despatch their messenger or
   messengers to any plaCes whatsoever, according as their affairs may
   require, and to receive the said messengers or messenger, despatches or
   despatch, as often as they shall think fit; so as however one or more
   be associated therewith by the deputies of the Council, to provide for
   the safety of the said couriers: and this safe-conduct and these
   securities shall stand good and endure, both from and during the time
   that they shall have been received under the Care of the said Synod,
   and the pro tection of its agents ; and further, after they have had a
   sufficient audience, and twenty days having expired after they have
   themselves asked, or after the Council, upon that audience had, shall
   have given them notice, to return, It will, all deceit and fraud being
   entirely excluded, reconduct them, with God's help, from Trent to that
   place of safety which each may select for himself. All which things It
   promises, and in good faith pledges Itself, shall be inviolably
   observed towards all and each of the faithful of Christ, towards all
   ecclesiastical and secular princes, and towards all other
   ecclesiastical and secular persons, of whatsoever state and condition
   they may be, or by whatsoever name designated.
   Furthermore, It promises in sincere and good faith, without fraud or
   deceit, that the said Synod will, neither openly nor covertly, seek for
   any opportunity, nor make use of, nor suffer any one else to make use
   of, any authority, power, right, or statute, privilege of laws or
   canons, or of any Councils whatsoever, especially those of Constance
   and Sienna, under [Page 138] what form soever expressed; to the
   prejudice in any way of this public faith, and most full security, and
   of the public and free hearing, by this said Synod granted to the
   above-named;--derogating from the aforesaid in this regard and for this
   occasion. And if the holy Synod, or any member thereof, or of their
   followers, of whatsoever condition, state, or pre-eminence, shall
   violate--which may the Almighty for fend-the form and terms of the
   security and safe-conduct as above set down, in any point or clause
   whatever, and a sufficient reparation shall not have forthwith
   followed, and one that may with reason be approved of and praised by
   the (interested) parties themselves; they may and shall hold the said
   Synod to have incurred all those penalties, which, by law human and
   divine, or by custom, the violators of such safe-conducts can possibly
   incur,--without there being any excuse, or Contrary allegation in this
   regard.
   EXTENSION THEREOF TO OTHER NATIONS
   The same sacred and holy Synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost,
   the same Legates a latere of the Apostolic See presiding therein,
   grants the public faith, or a safe-conduct, under the same form, and in
   the same terms, wherein it is granted to the Germans, to all and each
   of those others, who hold not communion with us in matters of faith, of
   whatsoever kingdoms, nations, provinces, Cities, and places they may
   be, wherein the contrary, to that which the holy Roman Church holds, is
   publicly and with impunity preached, taught, or believed.
   SESSION THE NINETEENTH,
   Being the third under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on
   the fourteenth day of May, MDLXII.
   DECREE FOR THE PROROGATION OF THE SESSION
   The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the Same Legatesof the Apostolic See
   presiding therein,--has, for cerain just and good reasons, thought fit
   to prorogue, and doth hereby prorogue, to the Thursday after the
   approaching solemnity of Corpus Christi, which will be the day before
   the nones of June, those decrees which were to have been on this day
   ordained and sanctioned in the present Session; and It notifies to all
   men, that, on the said day, a Session will be held and celebrated.
   Meanwhile, supplication is to be made to the God and Father of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the author of peace, that He would sanctify the hearts of
   all; that, by His help, the holy Synod may be enabled, both now and
   ever, to study and to perform those things which shall be unto His
   praise and glory.
   SESSION THE TWENTIETH,
   Being the fourth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on
   the fourth day of June, MDLXII.
   DECREE FOR THE PROROGATION OF THE SESSION
   The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See
   presiding therein,--by reason of various difficulties arising from
   divers causes, and also to the end that all things may proceed in a
   more befitting manner, and with greater deliberation; to wit, that
   dogmas may be treated of and ratified conjointly with what relates to
   Reformation; has decreed that whatsoever it shall seem fit to ordain,
   as well concerning Reformation, as concerning dogmas, shall be defined
   in the next Session, which It notifies to all men for the sixteenth day
   of the month of July next; adding, however, that this holy Synod freely
   may and can, at Its will and pleasure, as it shall judge expedient for
   the business of the Council, shorten, or lengthen, the said term, even
   in a general congregation.
   SESSION THE TWENTY-FIRST,
   Being the fifth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on
   the sixteenth day of July, MDLXII.
   [DECREE ON COMMUNION UNDER BOTH SPECIES, AND THE COMMUNION OF INFANTS]
   Note: This title is missing in the Waterworth translation, 1848
   edition.
   The sacred and holy, ocecumenical and general Synod of Trent,--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See
   presiding therein,-whereas, touching the tremendous and most holy
   sacrament of the Eucharist, there are in divers places, by the most
   wicked artifices of the devil, spread abroad certain monstrous errors,
   by reason of which, in some provinces, many are seen to have departed
   from the faith and obedience of the Catholic Church, It has thought
   fit, that what relates to communion under both species, and the
   com-munion of infants, be in this place set forth. Wherefore It forbids
   all the faithful in Christ to presume henceforth to believe, teach, or
   preach otherwise on these matters, than is in these decrees explained
   and defined.
   CHAPTER I.
   That laymen and clerics, when not sacrifising, are not bound, of divine
   right, to communion under both species.
   Wherefore, this holy Synod,--instructed by the Holy Spirit, who is the
   spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of
   godliness, and following the judgment and usage of the Church
   itself,--declares and teaches, that laymen, and clerics when not
   consecrating, are not obliged, by any divine precept, to receive the
   sacrament of the Eucharist under both species ; and that neither can it
   by any means be doubted, without injury to faith, that communion under
   either species [Page 141] is sufficient for them unto salvation. For,
   although Christ, the Lord, in the last supper, instituted and delivered
   to the apostles, this venerable sacrament in the species of bread and
   wine; not therefore do that institution and delivery tend thereunto,
   that all the faithful of Church be bound, by the institution of the
   Lord, to receive both species. But neither is it rightly gathered, from
   that discourse which is in the sixth of John,-however according to the
   various interpretations of holy Fathers and Doctors it be
   understood,--that the communion of both species was enjoined by the
   Lord : for He who said; Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
   drink his blood, you shall not have life in you (v. 54), also said; He
   that eateth this bread shall live for ever (v. 59); and He who said, He
   that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath everlasting life (v.
   55), also said; The bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of
   (lie world (v. 52); and, in fine,- He who said; He that eateth my flesh
   and drinketh my blood, abideth in me and I in him (v. 57), said,
   nevertheless; He that eateth this bread shall live for ever (v. 59.)
   CHAPTER II.
   The power of the Church as regards the dispensation of the Sacrament of
   the Eucharist.
   It furthermore declares, that this power has ever been in the Church,
   that, in the dispensation of the sacraments, their substance being
   untouched, it may ordain,--or change, what things soever it may judge
   most expedient, for the profit of those who receive, or for the
   veneration of the said sacraments, according to the difference of
   circumstances, times, and places. And this the Apostle seems not
   obscurely to have intimated, when he says; Let a man so account of us,
   as of the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of
   God. And indeed it [Page 142] is sufficiently manifest that he himself
   exercised this power,- as in many other things, so in regard of this
   very sacrament; when, after having ordained certain things touching the
   use thereof, he says; The rest I will set in order when I come.
   Wherefore, holy Mother Church, knowing this her authority in the
   administration of the sacraments, although the use of both species
   has,--from the beginning of the Christian religion, not been
   unfrequent, yet, in progress of time, that custom having been already
   very widely changed,--she, induced by weighty and just reasons,- has
   approved of this custom of communicating under one species, and decreed
   that it was to be held as a law; which it is not lawful to reprobate,
   or to change at plea sure, without the authority of the Church itself.
   CHAPTER III.
   That Christ whole and entire, and a true Sacrament are received under
   either species.
   It moreover declares, that although, as hath been already said, our
   Redeemer, in that last supper, instituted, and delivered to the
   apostles, this sacrament in two species, yet is to be acknowledged,
   that Christ whole and entire and a true sacrament are received under
   either species alone; and that therefore, as regards the fruit thereof,
   they, who receive one species alone, are not defrauded of any grace
   necessary to salvation.
   CHAPTER IV.
   That little Children are not bound to sacramental Communion.
   Finally, this same holy Synod teaches, that little children, who have
   not attained to the use of reason, are not by any necessity obliged to
   the sacramental communion of the Eucharist: [Page 143] forasmuch as,
   having been regenerated by th by the laver of baptism, and being
   incorporated with Christ, they cannot, at that age, lose the grace
   which they have already acquired of being the sons of God. Not
   therefore, however, is antiquity to be condemned, if, in some places,
   it, at one time, observed that custom; for as those most holy Fathers
   had a probable cause for what they did in respect of their times, so,
   assuredly, is it to be believed without controversy, that they did this
   without any necessity thereof unto salvation.
   ON COMMUNION UNDER BOTH SPECIES, AND ON THE COMMUNION OF INFANTS
   CANON I.--If any one saith, that, by the precept of God, or, by
   necessity of salvation, all and each of the faithful of Christ ought to
   receive both species of the most holy sacrament not consecrating; let
   him be anathema.
   CANON 11.--if any one saith, that the holy Catholic Church was not
   induced, by just causes and reasons, to communicate, under the species
   of bread only, laymen, and also clerics when not consecrating; let him
   be be anathema.
   CANON III.--If any one denieth, that Christ whole and entire -the
   fountain and author of all graces--is received under the one species of
   bread; because that-as some falsely assert--He is not received,
   according to the institution of Christ himself, under both species; let
   him be anathema.
   CANON IV.--If any one saith, that the communion of the Eucharist is
   necessary for little children, before they have arrived at years of
   discretion; let him be anathema.
   As regards, however, those two articles, proposed on another occasion,
   but which have not as yet been discussed; to wit, whether the reasons
   by which the holy Catholic Church was led to communicate, under the one
   species of bread only, laymen, [Page 144] and also priests when not
   celebrating, are in such wise to be adhered to, as that on no account
   is the use of the chalice to be allowed to any one soever; and,
   whether, in case that, for reasons beseeming and consonant with
   Christian charity, it appears that the use of the chalice is to be
   granted to any nation or kingdom, it is to be conceded under certain
   conditions ; and what are those conditions: this same holy Synod
   reserves the same to another time,--for the earliest opportunity that
   shall present itself,--to be examined and defined.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION
   Proem.
   The same sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of
   Trent,--lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the
   Apostolic See presiding therein,-has thought fit that, to the praise of
   Almighty God, and the adornment of holy Church, the things which follow
   be ordained at present, touching the business of Reformation.
   CHAPTER I.
   Bishops shall both confer orders, and give dimissory letters and
   testimonials gratis: their servants shall receive nothing therefrom,
   and notaries that which is fixed in this decree.
   Forasmuch as the ecclesiastical order ought to be free from every
   suspicion of covetousness, neither bishops, nor others, who confer
   orders, nor their ministers, shall, under any pretext, receive anything
   for the collation of any manner of orders, not even for the clerical
   tonsure, nor for letters dimissory, or testimonials, nor for the seal,
   nor for any other cause whatsoever, [Page 145] not even though it
   should be voluntarily offered. And notaries, --in those places only
   where the laudable custom of not receiving any thing does not
   prevail,--shall only be able to receive thc tenth part of a golden
   crown (aureus) for each dimissory letter, or testimonial ; provided
   still that there be no salary assigned them for the discharge of this
   office; and provided that no emolument, out of the payments to the
   notary, Can accrue, either directly or indirectly, to the bishop from
   the collation of the said orders. For in this case the Synod ordains
   that they are bound to give their labour altogether gratuitously;
   utterly quashing and prohibiting all taxes to the contrary, and all
   statutes, and customs, even though immemorial, of all places
   whatsoever, [Page 145] which may rather be called abuses and
   corruptions tending to simoniacal pravity; and they who shall act
   otherwise, shall, as well the givers as the receivers, ipso facto,
   incur, besides the divine punishment, the penalties by law inflicted.
   CHAPTER II.
   Those who have not wherewith to live, are excluded from sacred Orders.
   Whereas it beseems not those who are enrolled in the divine ministry,
   to beg, or to exercise any sordid trade, to the disgrace of their
   order; and whereas it is well known that very many, and that in very
   many places, are admitted to sacred orders almost without any selection
   whatever; who, by various artifices and deceits, pretend to have an
   ecclesiastical benefice, or even means sufficient; the holy Synod
   ordains, that henceforth no secular cleric, though otherwise fit as
   regards morals, knowledge, and age, shall be promoted to sacred orders,
   unless it be first legitimately certain, that he is in the peaceful
   possession of an ecclesiastical benefice sufficient for his honest
   livelihood: and he shall not be able to resign that benefice, without
   mentioning that he was promoted under the title thereof; nor shall that
   resignation be received, unless it be certain that he can live [Page
   146] conveniently from other sources; and any resignation made
   otherwise shall be null. As to those who have a patrimony, or a
   pension, they shall not henceforth be ordained, except such as the
   bishop shall consider ought to be received, in consideration of the
   necessity or the convenience of his churches; after having also first
   seen carefully to this, that they really enjoy that patrimony, or
   pension, and that they are such as to suffice for their sustenance: And
   the same may not in any case be alienated, extinguished, or remitted,
   without the permission of the bishop, until they shall have obtained a
   sufficient ecclesiastical benefice, or they shall have from some other
   source wherewith to live; renewing hereupon the penalties of the
   ancient canons.
   CHAPTER III.
   A method of increasing the daily distributions is prescribed; the
   persons to whom they shall be due: the contumacy of those who do not
   serve is punished.
   Whereas benefices were established in order to the performance of
   divine worship, and the offices of the Church; to the end that the
   divine worship may not in any respect be diminished, but due attention
   be paid thereunto in all things; the holy Synod ordains, that in
   churches, as well cathedral as collegiate, wherein there are no daily
   distributions, or so slight, that they are probably disregarded, a
   third part of the fruits and of all proceeds whatever, and revenues, as
   well of dignities, as of canonries, personates, portions, and offices,
   shall be set apart and converted to the purpose of daily distributions,
   to be divided amongst those who possess dignities and the others who
   are present at the divine service, according to that proportion which
   shall be settled by the bishop--even as the delegate of the Apostolic
   See--at the time of the very first deduction made from the fruits;
   saving, however, the customs of those churches wherein those who do not
   reside, or who do not serve, receive nothing, or less than a third: all
   exemptions, and any [Page 147] other customs, even though immemorial,
   and all appeals whatsoever notwithstanding. And upon the contumacy of
   those who do not serve increasing, they may be proceeded against
   according to the provision of the law, and of the sacred canons.
   CHAPTER IV.
   In what case Coadjutors are to be employed for the cure of souls.--The
   manner of erecting new parishes is set forth.
   In all parish churches, or those wherein baptism is administered, in
   which (churches) the people is so numerous, that one rector is not
   enough for the administration of the sacraments of the Church, and for
   the performance of divine worship, the bishops, even as delegates of
   the Apostolic See, shall compel the rectors, or others whom it may
   concern, to associate to themselves for this office, as many priests as
   shall be sufficient to administer the sacraments, and to celebrate the
   divine worship. As regards those churches, to which, on account of the
   distance, or the difficulties of the locality, the parishioners cannot,
   without great inconvenience, repair to receive the sacraments, and to
   hear the divine offices; the bishops may, even against the will of the
   rectors, establish new parishes, pursuant to the form of the
   constitution of Alexander III., which begins, Ad audientiam. And to
   those priests who shall have to be appointed afresh over the churches
   newly erected, a competent portion shall be assigned, according to the
   bishop's judgment, out of the fruits in any wise belonging to the
   Mother Church: and, if it be necessary, he may compel the people to
   contribute what may be sufficient for the sustenance of the said
   priests; every general or special reservation, or assignment, that may
   lie upon the said churches, notwithstanding. Neither shall ordinances
   and erections of this kind be prevented, or hindered, by means of any
   provisions, or even by virtue of any resignation, or by any other
   derogations, or suspensions whatsoever.
   [Page 148]
   CHAPTER V.
   Bishops shall be able to form perpetual unions, in the cases by law
   permitted.
   In order, also, that the state of those churches, wherein the sacred
   offices are administered unto God, may be maintained according to their
   dignity, the bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic See, may,
   according to form of law, make unions in perpetuity--without prejudice,
   however, to the incumbents--of any parochial churches whatsoever, and
   of those wherein baptism is administered, and of other benefices with
   or without cure, with (other) cures, on account of the poverty of those
   churches, and in the other cases by law permitted; even though the said
   churches, or benefices, be generally or specially reserved, or in what
   way soever applied: the which unions shall not be capable of being
   revoked, by virtue of any provision whatever, not even on account of
   any resignation, or derogation, or suspension.
   CHAPTER VI.
   To ignorant Rectors, Vicars shall be, for the time being, deputed with
   a portion of the fruits; those continuing to give scandal may be
   deprived of their benefices.
   Forasmuch as illiterate and unskilful rectors of parish churches are
   but little fit for the sacred offices; and others, by reason of the
   turpitude of their lives, rather destroy than edify; the bishops, even
   as the delegates of the Apostolic See, may depute to the said
   illiterate and unskilful rectors, if they be otherwise of a blameless
   life, coadjutors, or vicars for the time being, and assign the same a
   part of the fruits for their sufficient maintenance, or provide for
   them in some other manner, setting aside any appeal or exemption
   whatsoever. But, those who live shamefully and scandalously, they
   shall, after having first admo-[Page 149]nished them, restrain and
   punish; and, if they shall still continue incorrigible in their
   wickedness, they shall have power to deprive them of their benefices,
   according to the constitutions of the sacred canons, setting aside
   every exemption or appeal whatsoever.
   CHAPTER VII.
   Bishops shall transfer, together with their obligations, churches which
   cannot be restored; others they shall cause to be repaired.
   Whereas, also, very great care ought to be taken, lest those things
   which have been dedicated to sacred services, may, through the injury
   of time, cease to be so employed, and pass from the memory of men; the
   bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic See, may transfer
   simple benefices--even those that are under a right of patronage-from
   churches which have fallen into ruin by age, or otherwise, and which
   cannot, by reason of the poverty thereof, be restored, to the Mother
   Churches, or others of the same or neighbouring places, as they shall
   judge fit, after having summoned those who are interested therein; and
   they shall raise, in the said churches, altars, or chapels, under the
   same invocations; or transfer them, with all their emoluments and with
   all the obligations that were imposed on the former churches, to altars
   or chapels already erected. But, as regards parish churches which have
   thus fallen into decay, they shall, even though they be under a right
   of patronage, make it their care that they be repaired and restored,
   out of any fruits and proceeds whatever, in any way belonging to the
   said churches; and if those resources should not be sufficient, they
   shall compel, by all suitable means, the patrons and others who receive
   any fruits derived from those churches, or, in their default, the
   parishioners, to provide for the aforesaid repairs; setting aside every
   appeal, exemption, or reservation whatsoever. But if they should be all
   too poor, those churches shall [Page 150] be transferred to the Mother
   Churches, or to the neighbouring churches, with power to convert both
   the said parish churches and others that are in ruins, to profane,
   though not to sordid uses; a cross, however, being erected there.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   Commendatory monasteries, wherein regular observance is not in vigour,
   and all benefices so ever, shall be by bishops annually visited.
   It is right that whatsoever things in a diocese regard the worship of
   God, be diligently cared for by the Ordinary, and, where there is need,
   be by him set in order. Wherefore, monasteries held in commendam, even
   abbeys, priories, and those called provostries, wherein regular
   observance is not in vigour, as also benefices--with, or without the
   cure of souls, as well Regular as Secular-in whatever way held in
   commendam, even though exempt, shall be annually visited by the bishop,
   even as the delegates of the Apostolic See; and the said bishops shall
   provide, by suitable measures, even by the sequestration of the fruits,
   that what requires renewing or repairing, be done accordingly; and that
   the cure of souls, if those places, or those annexed to them, be
   charged therewith, as also that all other duties required of them, be
   rightly exercised; notwithstanding any appeals whatsoever, privileges,
   customs, even with a prescription from time immemorial, letters
   conservatory, commissions of judges, and their inhibitions to the
   contrary. And, if Regular observance be therein maintained, the bishops
   shall make it their care, by fatherly admonitions, that the superiors
   of the said Regulars observe, and cause to be observed, the manner of
   life required by the institutes of their order, and that they keep, and
   govern those subject to them, in their duty. And if, after having been
   admonished, they shall not, within six months, have visited or
   corrected them, then may the said bishops, even as delegates of the
   Apostolic See, visit and correct [Page 151] them, in the same way as
   the superiors themselves might do, in accordance with their institutes;
   notwithstanding, and completely setting aside, all appeals, privileges,
   and exemptions whatsoever.
   CHAPTER IX.
   The name and use of Questors of Alms is abolished.- The Ordinaries
   shall publish indulgences and spiritual graces.-- Two of the Chapters
   shall, without fee, receive the Alms.
   Whereas many remedies, heretofore applied by divers councils in their
   day, as well by that of Lateran, and of Lyons, as by that of Vienne,
   against the wicked abuses of questors of alms, have become in later
   times useless; yea, rather the depravity of such is, to the great
   scandal and complaint of all the faithful, found daily so to increase
   the more, as that there seems to be no longer any hope left of their
   amendment; (the Synod) ordains that, in all parts of Christendom
   soever, their name and use be henceforth utterly abolished; nor shall
   they be allowed in any wise to exercise any such office;
   notwithstanding any privileges granted to any churches, monasteries,
   hospitals, pious places, or to any persons of whatsoever degree,
   estate, and dignity, or any customs, even though immemorial. As regards
   the indulgences, or other spiritual graces, of which the faithful of
   Christ ought not on this account to be deprived, It decrees, that they
   are henceforth to be published to the people at the due times, by the
   Ordinaries of the places, aided by two members of the Chapter; to whom
   also power is given to gather faithfully the alms, and the succours of
   charity which are offered them, without their receiving any
   remuneration whatsoever; that so all men may at length truly
   understand, that these heavenly treasures of the Church are
   administered, not for gain, but for godliness.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION
   The sacred and holy, oecumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic See
   presiding therein, hath ordained and decreed, that the next ensuing
   Session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the octave of the
   feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which will be on the
   seventeenth of the month of September next; with the addition, however,
   that the said holy Synod freely may and can, according to Its will and
   pleasure, as It shall judge expedient for the affairs of the Council,
   limit or extend, even in a general congregation, the said term, as also
   that which may be assigned hereafter for each Session.
   SESSION THE TWENTY-SECOND,
   Being the sixth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on
   the seventeenth day of September, MDLXII.
   DOCTRINE ON THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.
   The sacred and holy, ecumenical and general Synod of Trent--lawfully
   assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the Apostolic Sec
   presiding therein--to the end that the ancient, complete, and in every
   part perfect faith and doctrine touching the great mystery of the
   Eucharist may be retained in the holy Catholic Church; and may, all
   errors and heresies being repelled, be preserved in its own purity;
   (the Synod) instructed by the illumination of the Holy Ghost, teaches,
   declares; and decrees what follows, to be preached to the faithful, on
   the subject of the Eucharist, considered as being a true and singular
   sacrifice.
   [Page 153]
   CHAPTER I.
   On the institution of the most holy Sacrifice of the Mass.
   Forasmuch as, under the former Testament, according to the testimony of
   the Apostle Paul, there was no perfection, because of the weakness of
   the Levitical priesthood; there was need, God, the Father of mercies,
   so ordaining, that another priest should rise, according to the order
   of Melchisedech, our Lord Jesus Christ, who might consummate, and lead
   to what is perfect, as many as were to be sanctified. He, therefore,
   our God and Lord, though He was about to offer Himself once on the
   altar of the cross unto God the Father, by means of his death, there to
   operate an eternal redemption; nevertheless, because that His
   priesthood was not to be extinguished by His death, in the last supper,
   on the night in which He was betrayed,--that He might leave, to His own
   beloved Spouse the Church, a visible sacrifice, such as the nature of
   man requires, whereby that bloody sacrifice, once to be accomplished on
   the cross, might be represented, and the memory thereof remain even
   unto the end of the world, and its salutary virtue be applied to the
   remission of those sins which we daily commit,--declaring Himself
   constituted a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech,
   He offered up to God the Father His own body and blood under the
   species of bread and wine; and, under the symbols of those same things,
   He delivered (His own body and blood) to be received by His apostles,
   whom He then constituted priests of the New Testament; and by those
   words, Do this in commemoration of me, He commanded them and their
   successors in the priesthood, to offer (them); even as the Catholic
   Church has always understood and taught. For, having celebrated the
   ancient Passover, which the multitude of the children of Israel
   immolated in memory of their going out of [Page 154] Egypt, He
   instituted the new Passover, (to wit) Himself to be immolated, under
   visible signs, by the Church through (the ministry of) priests, in
   memory of His own passage from this world unto the Father, when by the
   effusion of His own blood He redeemed us, and delivered us from the
   power of darkness, and translated us into his kingdom. And this is
   indeed that clean oblation, which cannot be defiled by any
   unworthiness, or malice of those that offer (it); which the Lord
   foretold by Malachias was to be offered in every place, clean to his
   name, which was to be great amongst the Gentiles; and which the apostle
   Paul, writing to the Corinthians, has not obscurely indicated, when he
   says, that they who are defiled by the participation of the table of
   devils, cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord; by the table,
   meaning in both places the altar. This, in fine, is that oblation which
   was prefigured by various types of sacrifices, during the period of
   nature, and of the law; in as much as it comprises all the good things
   signified by those sacrifices, as being the consummation and perfection
   of them all.
   CHAPTER II.
   That the Sacrifice of the Mass is propitiatory both for the living and
   the dead.
   And forasmuch as, in this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the
   mass, that same Christ is contained and immolated in an unbloody
   manner, who once offered Himself in a bloody manner on the altar of the
   cross; the holy Synod teaches, that this sacrifice is truly
   propritiatory and that by means thereof this is effected, that we
   obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid, if we draw nigh unto
   God, contrite and penitent, with a sincere heart and upright faith,
   with fear and reverence. For the Lord, appeased by the oblation
   thereof, and granting the [Page 155] grace and gift of penitence,
   forgives even heinous crimes and sins. For the victim is one and the
   same, the same now offering by the ministry of priests, who then
   offered Himself on the cross, the manner alone of offering being
   different. The fruits indeed of which oblation, of that bloody one to
   wit, are received most plentifully through this unbloody one; so far is
   this (latter) from derogating in any way from that (former oblation).
   Wherefore, not only for the sins, punishments, satisfactions, and other
   necessities of the faithful who are living, but also for those who are
   departed in Christ, and who are not as yet fully purified, is it
   rightly offered, agreebly to a tradition of the apostles.
   CHAPTER III.
   On Masses in honour of the Saints.
   And although the Church has been accustomed at times to celebrate,
   certain masses in honour and memory of the saints; not therefore,
   however, doth she teach that sacrifice is offered unto them, but unto
   God alone, who crowned them; whence neither is the priest wont to say,
   "I offer sacrifice to thee, Peter, or Paul;" but, giving thanks to God
   for their victories, he implores their patronage, that they may
   vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven, whose memory we celebrate upon
   earth.
   CHAPTER IV
   On the Canon of the Mass.
   And whereas it beseemeth, that holy things be administered in a holy
   manner, and of all holy things this sacrifice is the most holy; to the
   end that it might be worthily and reverently [Page 156] offered and
   received, the Catholic Church instituted, many years ago, the sacred
   Canon, so pure from every error, that nothing is contained therein
   which does not in the highest degree savour of a certain holiness and
   piety, and raise up unto God the minds of those that offer. For it is
   composed, out of the very words of the Lord, the traditions of the
   apostles, and the pious institutions also of holy pontiffs.
   CHAPTER V.
   On the solemn ceremonies of the Sacrifice of the Mass.
   And whereas such is the nature of man, that, without external helps, he
   cannot easily be raised to the meditation of divine things; therefore
   has holy Mother Church instituted certain rites, to wit that certain
   things be pronounced in the mass in a low, and others in a louder,
   tone. She has likewise employed ceremonies, such as mystic
   benedictions, lights, incense, vestments, and many other things of this
   kind, derived from an apostolical discipline and tradition, whereby
   both the majesty of so great a sacrifice might be recommended, and the
   minds of the faithful be excited, by those visible signs of religion
   and piety, to the contemplation of those most sublime things which are
   hidden in this sacrifice.
   CHAPTER VI.
   On Mass wherein the priest alone communicates.
   The sacred and holy Synod would fain indeed that, at each mass, the
   faithful who are present should communicate, not only in spiritual
   desire, but also by the sacramental participation of the Eucharist,
   that thereby a more abundant fruit might be derived to them from this
   most holy sacrifice: but not therefore, if this be not always done,
   does It condemn, as private and unlawful, but approves of and therefore
   commends, [Page 157] those masses in which the priest alone
   communicates sacramentally; since those masses also ought to be
   considered as truly common; partly because the people communicate
   spiritually thereat; partly also because they are celebrated by a
   public minister of the Church, not for himself only, but for all the
   faithful, who belong to the body of Christ.
   CHAPTER VII.
   On the water that is to be mixed with the wine to be offered in the
   chalice.
   The holy Synod notices, in the next place, that it has been enjoined by
   the Church on priests, to mix water with the wine that is to be offered
   in the chalice; as well because it is believed that Christ the Lord did
   this, as also because from His side there came out blood and water; the
   memory of which mystery is renewed by this commixture; and, whereas in
   the apocalypse of blessed John, the peoples are called waters, the
   union of that faithful people with Christ their head is hereby
   represented.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   On not celebrating the Mass every where in the vulgar tongue; the
   mysteries of the Mass to be explained to the people.
   Although the mass contains great instruction for the faithful people,
   nevertheless, it has not seemed expedient to the Fathers, that it
   should be every where celebrated in the vulgar tongue. Wherefore, the
   ancient usage of each church, and the rite approved of by the holy
   Roman Church, the mother and mistress of all churches, being in each
   place retained; [Page 158] and, that the sheep of Christ may not suffer
   hunger, nor the little ones ask for bread, and there be none to break
   it unto them, the holy Synod charges pastors, and all who have the cure
   of souls, that they frequently, during the celebration of mass, expound
   either by themselves, or others, some portion of those things which are
   read at mass, and that, amongst the rest, they explain some mystery of
   this most holy sacrifice, especially on the Lord's days and festivals.
   CHAPTER IX.
   Preliminary Remark on the following Canons.
   And because that many errors are at this time disseminated and many
   things are taught and maintained by divers persons, in opposition to
   this ancient faith, which is based on the sacred Gospel, the traditions
   of the Apostles, and the doctrine of the holy Fathers; the sacred and
   holy Synod, after many and grave deliberations maturely had touching
   these matters, has resolved, with the unanimous consent of all the
   Fathers, to condemn, and to eliminate from holy Church, by means of the
   canons subjoined, whatsoever is opposed to this most pure faith and
   sacred doctrine.
   ON THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.
   CANON I.--If any one saith, that in the mass a true and proper
   sacriflce is not offered to God; or, that to be offered is nothing else
   but that Christ is given us to eat; let him be anathema.
   CANON II.--If any one saith, that by those words, Do this for the
   commemoration of me (Luke xxii. 19), Christ did not institute the
   apostles priests; or, did not ordain that they, and other priests
   should offer His own body and blood; let him be anathema.
   CANON III.--If any one saith, that the sacrifice of the mass is only a
   sacrifice of praise and of thanksgiving; or, that it is a [Page 159]
   bare commemoration of the sacrifice consummated on the cross, but not a
   propitiatory sacrifice; or, that it profits him only who receives; and
   that it ought not to be offered for the living and the dead for sins,
   pains, satisfactions, and other necessities; let him be anathema.
   CANON IV.--If any one saith, that, by the sacrifice of the mass, a
   blasphemy is cast upon the most holy sacrifice of Christ consummated on
   the cross; or, that it is thereby derogated from; let him be anathema.
   CANON V.--If any one saith, that it is an imposture to celebrate masses
   in honour of the saints, and for obtaining their intercession with God,
   as the Church intends; let him be anathema.
   CANON VI.--If any one saith, that the canon of the mass contains
   errors, and is therefore to be abrogated; let him be anathema.
   CANON VII.--If any one saith, that the ceremonies, vestments, and
   outward signs, which the Catholic Church makes use of in the
   celebration of masses, are incentives to impiety, rather than offices
   of piety; let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.--If any one saith, that masses, wherein the priest alone
   communicates sacramentally, are unlawful, and are, therefore, to be
   abrogated; let him be anathema.
   CANON IX.--If any one saith, that the rite of the Roman Church,
   according to which a part of the canon and the words of consecration
   are pronounced in a low tone, is to be condemned; or, that the mass
   ought to be celebrated in the vulgar tongue only; or, that water ought
   not to be mixed with the wine that is to be offered in the chalice, for
   that it is contrary to the institution of Christ; let him be anathema.
   DECREE CONCERNING THE THINGS TO BE OBSERVED, AND TO BE AVOIDED, IN THE
   CELEBRATION OF MASS.
   What great care is to be taken, that the sacred and holy sacrifice of
   the mass be celebrated with all religious service and [Page 160]
   veneration, each one may easily imagine, who considers, that, in holy
   writ, he is called accursed, who doth the work of God negligently; and
   if we must needs confess, that no other work can be performed by the
   faithful so holy and divine as this tremendous mystery itself, wherein
   that life-giving victim, by which we were reconciled to the Father, is
   daily immolated on the altar by priests, it is also sufficiently clear,
   that all industry and diligence is to be applied to this end, that it
   be performed with the greatest possible inward cleanness and purity of
   heart, and outward show of devotion and piety. Whereas, therefore,
   either through the wickedness of the times, or through the carelessness
   and Corruption of men, many things seem already to have crept in, which
   are alien from the dignity of so great a sacrifice; to the end that the
   honour and cult due thereunto may, for the glory of God and the
   edification of the faithful people, be restored; the holy Synod
   decrees, that the ordinary bishops of places shall take diligent care,
   and be bound to prohibit and abolish all those things which either
   covetousness, which is a serving of idols, or irreverence, which can
   hardly be separated from impiety; or superstition, which is a false
   imitation of true piety, may have introduced. And that many things may
   be comprised in a few words: first, as relates to covetousness:--they
   shall wholly prohibit all manner of conditions and bargains for
   recompenses, and whatsoever is given for the celebration of new masses;
   as also those importunate and illiberal demands, rather than requests,
   for alms, and other things of the like sort, which are but little
   removed from a simonical taint, or at all events, from filthy lucre.
   In the next place, that irreverence may be avoided, each, in his own
   diocese, shall forbid that any wandering or unknown priest be allowed
   to celebrate mass. Furthermore, they shall not allow any one who is
   publicly and notoriously stained with crime, either to minister at the
   holy altar, or to assist at the sacred services; nor shall they suffer
   the holy sacrifice to be celebrated, either by any Seculars or Regulars
   whatsoever, in [Page 161] private houses; or, at all, out of the
   church, and those oratories which are dedicated solely to divine
   worship, and which are to be designated and visited by the said
   Ordinaries; and not then, unless those who are present shall have first
   shown, by their decently composed outward appearance, that they are
   there not in body only, but also in mind and devout affection of heart.
   They shall also banish from churches all those kinds of music, in
   which, whether by the organ, or in the singing, there is mixed up any
   thing lascivious or impure; as also all secular actions; vain and
   therefore profane conversations, all walking about, noise, and clamour,
   that so the house of God may be seen to be, and may be called, truly a
   house of prayer.
   Lastly, that no room may be left for superstition; they shall by
   ordinance, and under given penalties, provide, that priests do not
   celebrate at other than due hours; nor employ other rites, or other
   ceremonies and prayers, in the celebration of masses, besides those
   which have been approved of by the Church, and have been received by a
   frequent and praiseworthy usage. They shall wholly banish from the
   Church the observance of a fixed number of certain masses and of
   candles, as being the invention of superstitious worship, rather than
   of true religion; and they shall instruct the people, what is, and
   whence especially is derived, the fruit so precious and heavenly of
   this most holy sacrifice. They shall also admonish their people to
   repair frequently to their own parish churches, at least on the Lord's
   days and the greater festivals. All, therefore, that has been briefly
   enumerated, is in such wise propounded to all Ordinaries of places, as
   that, by the power given them by this sacred and holy Synod, and even
   as delegates of the Apostolic See, they may prohibit, ordain, reform,
   and establish, not only the things aforesaid, but also whatsoever else
   shall seem to them to have relation hereunto; and may compel the
   faithful people inviolably to observe them, by ecclesiastical censures
   and other penalties, which at their pleasure they may appoint; any
   privileges, exemptions, appeals, and customs whatsoever, to the
   contrary notwithstanding.
   [Page 162]
   DECREE ON REFORMATION.
   The same sacred and holy, ecumenical and general Synod of
   Trent,--lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same Legates of the
   Apostolic See presiding therein,--to the end that the business of
   reformation may be proceeded with, has thought good that the following
   things be ordained in the present Session.
   CHAPTER I.
   The Canons relative to the life, and propriety of conduct of Clerics
   are renewed.
   There is nothing that continually instructs others unto piety, and the
   service of God, more than the life and example of those who have
   dedicated themselves to the divine ministry. For as they are seen to be
   raised to a higher position, above the things of this world, others fix
   their eyes upon them as upon a mirror, and derive from them what they
   are to imitate. Wherefore clerics called to have the Lord for their
   portion, ought by all means so to regulate their whole life and
   conversation, as that in their dress, comportment, gait, discourse, and
   all things else, nothing appear but what is grave, regulated, and
   replete with religiousness; avoiding even slight faults, which in them
   would be most grievous; that so their actions may impress all with
   veneration. Whereas, therefore, the more useful and decorous these
   things are for the Church of God, the more carefully also are they to
   be attended to; the holy Synod ordains, that those things which have
   been heretofore copiously and wholesomely enacted by sovereign pontiffs
   and sacred councils,--relative to the life, propriety of conduct,
   dress, and learning of clerics, and also touching the luxuriousness,
   feastings, dances, gambling, sports, and all sorts of crime whatever,
   as also the secular employments, to be by them shunned,--the same shall
   be henceforth observed, under the same penalties, or greater, to be
   imposed at the discretion of the Ordinary; nor shall any appeal [Page
   163] suspend the execution hereof, as relating to the correction of
   manners. But if anything of the above shall be found to have fallen
   into desuetude, they shall make it their care that it be brought again
   into use as soon as possible, and be accurately observed by all; any
   customs to the contrary notwithstanding; lest they themselves may have,
   God being the avenger, to pay the penalty deserved by their neglect of
   the correction of those subject to them.
   CHAPTER II.
   Who are to be promoted to Cathedral Churches.
   Whosoever is, hereafter, to be promoted to a cathedral church shall not
   only be fully qualified by birth, age, morals, and life, and, in other
   respects, as required by the sacred canons, but shall also have been
   previously constituted in sacred Order, for the space of at least six
   months. And information on these points, if the individual be only
   recently, or not at all, known at the court (of Rome), shall be derived
   from the Legates of the Apostolic See, or from the Nuncios of the
   provinces, or from his Ordinary, and in his default, from the nearest
   Ordinaries. And, besides the things above-named, he shall possess such
   learning as to be able to discharge the obligations of the office that
   is about to be conferred upon him; and he shall, therefore, have been
   previously promoted by merit, in some university for studies, to be a
   master, or doctor, or licentiate, in sacred theology, or in canon law;
   or shall be declared, by the public testimony of some academy, fit to
   teach others. And, if he be a Regular, he shall have a similar
   attestation from the superiors of his own order. And all the
   above-named persons, from whom the information, or testimony, aforesaid
   is to be derived shall be bound to report on these matters faithfully
   and gratuitously; otherwise let them know, that their conciences will
   be grievously burthened, and that God, and their own superiors, will
   punish them.
   [Page 164]
   CHAPTER III.
   Daily distributions, out of the third part of all fruits soever, are to
   be established; on whom the portion of absentees devolves; certa in
   cases excepted.
   Bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic See, shall have power
   to divide the third part of any manner of fruits and proceeds of all
   dignities, personates, and offices existing in cathedral or collegiate
   churches, into distributions, to be assigned as they shall judge fit;
   in such wise to wit, that, if those who ought to receive them should
   fail, on any appointed day, personally to discharge the duty that
   devolves upon them, according to the form that shall be prescribed by
   the said bishops, they shall forfeit that day's distribution, and shall
   acquire no manner of property therein, but it shall be applied to the
   fabric of the church, as far as it may need it, or to some other pious
   place, at the discretion of the Ordinary. But if their contumacy
   increase, they shall proceed against them according to the constitution
   of the sacred canons. But if any of the aforesaid dignitaries has,
   neither by right, nor custom, any jurisdiction, administration, or
   office, devolving upon him in the cathedral or collegiate churches;
   but, out of the city, in the same diocese, there is a cure of souls to
   be attended to, which he who holds that dignity is willing to take upon
   himself; in this case, during the time that he shall reside and
   minister in the church with that cure, he shall be considered as though
   he were present and assisted at the divine offices in those cathedral
   or collegiate churches. These things are to be understood as appointed
   for those churches only, wherein there is no custom, or statute,
   whereby the said dignitaries, who do not serve, lose something, which
   amounts to the third part of the said fruits and proceeds: any customs,
   even though immemorial, exemptions, and constitutions, even though
   confirmed by oath or by any authority whatsoever, to the contrary
   notwithstanding.
   [Page 165]
   CHAPTER IV.
   Those not initiated into a sacred Order, shall not have a voice in the
   chapter of any Cathedral or Collegiate Church. The qualifications and
   duties of those who hold Benefices therein.
   Whosoever being employed in the divine offices in a cathedral, or
   collegiate, Secular or Regular, church, is not constituted in the order
   of subdeaconship at least, shall not have a voice in the chapter of
   those churches, even though this may have been voluntarily conceded to
   him by the others. As to those who possess, or shall hereafter possess,
   in the said churches, any dignities, personates, offices, prebends,
   portions, and any other manner of benefices whatever, to which various
   obligations are annexed, such as, that some shall say, or sing, mass,
   others the Gospel, others the Epistle, they shall be bound, all just
   impediment ceasing, to receive the requisite orders within a year,
   whatsoever may be their privilege, exemption, prerogative, or nobility
   of birth; otherwise they shall incur the penalties enacted by the
   constitution of the Council of Vienne, which begins, Ut ii qui, which
   by this present decree is renewed: and the bishops shall compel them to
   exercise in person the aforesaid orders on the appointed days, and to
   discharge all the other duties required of them in the divine service,
   under the said penalties, and others even more grievous, which may be
   imposed at their discretion. Nor, for the future, shall any such office
   be assigned to any but those who shall be well known fully to have
   already the age and the other qualifications; otherwise such provision
   shall be null.
   CHAPTER V.
   Dispensations expedited out of the (Roman) court shall be committed to
   the Bishop, and be by him examined.
   Dispensations, by whatsoever authority they are to be granted, if they
   are to be consigned out of the Roman court, shall be [Page 166]
   consigned to the Ordinaries of those who shall have obtained them. And
   as to those dispensations which shall be granted as graces, they shall
   not have effect, until the said Ordinaries, as delegates of the
   Apostolic See, shall have first ascertained summarily only and
   extra-judicially, that the terms of the petition do not labour under
   the vice of surreption or obreption.
   CHAPTER VI
   Last intentions to be altered with caution.
   In alterations of last wills,--which alterations ought not to be made
   except for a just and necessary cause,--the bishops, as delegates of
   the Apostolic See, shall, before the alterations aforesaid are carried
   into execution, ascertain, that nothing has been stated in the prayer
   of the petition, which suppresses what is true, or suggests what is
   false.
   CHAPTER VII.
   The chapter "Romana," in the sixth (of the Decretals), is renewed.
   Apostolic legates and nuncios, patriarchs, primates, and metropolitans,
   in appeals interposed before them, shall, in all causes whatsoever, as
   well in admitting the appeals, as in granting inhibitions after an
   appeal, be bound to observe the form and tenour of the sacred
   constitutions, and especially of the constitution of Innocent IV.,
   beginning Romana; any custom, even though immemorial, or usage, or
   privilege, to the contrary notwithstanding; otherwise the inhibitions
   and proceedings, and all the consequences thereof, shall be ipso jure
   null.
   [Page 167]
   CHAPTER VIII.
   Bishops shall execute the pious dispositions of all persons; shall
   visit all manner of pious places, if not under the immediate protection
   of Kings.
   The bishops, even as the delegates of the Apostolic See, shall, in the
   cases by law permitted, be the executors of all pious dispositions,
   whether made by last will, or between the living: they shall have a
   right to visit all manner of hospitals, colleges, and confraternities
   of laymen, even those which are called schools, or which go by any
   other name; but not, however, those places which are under the
   immediate protection of kings, except with their permission; also the
   eleemosynary institutions, called monts-de-piete, or of charity, and
   all pious places by whatsoever name designated, even though the
   aforesaid institutions be under the care of laymen, and though the said
   pious places be protected by a privilege of exemption; and, by virtue
   of their office, they shall take cognizance of, and see to the
   performance,--in accordance with the ordinances of the sacred
   canons,--of all things that have been instituted for God's worship, for
   the salvation of souls, or for the support of the poor; any custom,
   even though immemorial, or privilege, or statute whatsoever, to the
   contrary, notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER IX.
   Administrators of any pious places whatsoever shall give in their
   accounts to the Ordinary, unless it be otherwise provided by the
   foundation.
   The administrators, whether ecclesiastical, or lay, of the fabric of
   any church whatsoever, even though it be a cathedral, as also of any
   hospital, confraternity, charitable institution called [Page 168]
   mont-de-piete, and of any pious places whatsoever, shall be bound to
   give in, once a year, an account of their administration to the
   Ordinary: all customs and privileges to the contrary being set aside;
   unless it should happen that, in the institution and regulations of any
   church or fabric, it has been otherwise expressly provided. But if from
   custom, or privilege, or some regulation of the place, their account
   has to be rendered to others deputed thereunto, in that case the
   Ordinary shall also be employed jointly with them; and all acquittances
   given otherwise shall be of no avail to the said administrators.
   CHAPTER X.
   Notaries shall be subject to the examination and judgment of the
   Bishops.
   Whereas the unskilfulness of notaries causes very many injuries, and
   gives occasion to many lawsuits, the bishop, even as the delegate of
   the Apostolic See, may, by actual examination search into the
   competency of all notaries, even though created by apostolic, imperial,
   or royal authority; and, if such notaries be found incompetent, or on
   any occasion guilty of a delinquency in the discharge of their office,
   he may forbid them, altogether or for a time, to exercise that office,
   in ecclesiastical and spiritual affairs, lawsuits, and causes; nor
   shall any appeal on their parts suspend the prohibition of the
   Ordinary.
   CHAPTER XI.
   Usurpers of the property of any Church, or pious places, are punished.
   If any cleric, or layman, by whatsoever dignity pre-eminent, be he even
   emperor or king, should be so possessed by covetousness, that root of
   all evils, as to presume to convert to his own use, and to usurp,--by
   himself or by others, by force, or [Page 169] fear, or even by means of
   any supposititious persons, whether lay, or clerical, or by any
   artifice, or under any colourable pretext whatsoever,--the
   jurisdictions, property, rents, and rights, even those held in fee or
   under lease, the fruits, emoluments, or any sources of revenue
   whatsoever, belonging to any church, or to any benefice, whether
   Secular or Regular, monts-de-piete, or to any other pious places, which
   ought to be employed for the necessities of the ministers (thereof),
   and of the poor; or (shall presume) to hinder them (in any of the ways
   aforesaid) from being received by those unto whom they of right belong;
   he shall lie under an anathema until he shall have wholly restored to
   the Church, and to the administrator or beneficiary thereof, the
   jurisdictions, property, effects, rights, fruits, and revenues which he
   has seized upon, or in whatsoever way they have come to him, even by
   way of gift from a supposititious person and until he shall,
   furthermore, have obtained absolution from the Roman Pontiff. And if he
   be the patron of the said church, he shall, besides the penalties
   aforesaid, be thereupon deprived of the right of patronage. And the
   cleric who shall be the author of, or consenting to, any execrable
   fraud and usurpation of this kind, shall be subjected to the same
   penalties; as also he shall be deprived of all benefices whatsoever,
   and be rendered incapable of any others whatsoever; and ever after
   entire satisfaction and absolution, he shall be suspended from the
   exercise of his orders, at the discretion of his Ordinary.
   DECREE TOUCHING THE PETITION FOR THE CONCESSION OF THE CHALICE.
   Moreover, whereas the same sacred and holy Synod, in the preceding
   Session, reserved unto another time, for an opportunity that might
   present itself, two articles to be examined and defined, which
   (articles) had been proposed on another occasion, but had not then been
   as yet discussed, to wit, whether the reasons by which the holy
   Catholic Church was led to communicate, under the one species of bread,
   laymen and also priests [Page 170] when not celebrating, are in such
   wise to be adhered to, as that on no account is the use of the chalice
   to be allowed to any one soever; and, whether, in that case, for
   reasons beseeming and consonant with Christian charity, it appears that
   the use of the chalice is to be granted to any nation, or kingdom, it
   is to be conceded under certain conditions; and what are those
   conditions; It has now,--in Its desire that the salvation of those, on
   whose behalf the request is made, may be provided for in the best
   manner,--decreed, that the whole business be referred to our most holy
   lord, as by this present decree It doth refer it; who, of his singular
   prudence, will do that which he shall judge useful for the Christian
   commonweal, and salutary for those who ask for the use of the chalice.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION.
   Moreover, this sacred and holy Synod of Trent appoints, for the day of
   the next Session, the Thursday after the octave of All Saints, which
   will be the twelfth day of the month of November; and thereon It will
   decree concerning the sacrament of Order, and the sacrament of
   Matrimony, &c.
   The Session was prorogued until the fifteenth day of July, MDLXIII.
   SESSION THE TWENTY-THIRD,
   Being the seventh under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on
   the fifteenth day of July, MDLXIII.
   THE TRUE AND CATHOLIC DOCTRINE, TOUCHING THE SACRAMENT OF ORDER,
   DECREED AND PUBLISHED BY THE HOLY SYNOD OF TRENT, IN THE SEVENTH
   SESSION, IN CONDEMNATION OF THE ERRORS OF OUR TIME.
   CHAPTER I.
   On the institution of the Priesthood of the New Law.
   Sacrifice and priesthood are, by the ordinance of God, in such wise
   conjoined, as that both have existed in every law. [Page 171] Whereas,
   therefore, in the New Testament, the Catholic Church has received, from
   the institution of Christ, the holy visible sacrifice of the Eucharist;
   it must needs also be confessed, that there is, in that Church, a new,
   visible, and external priesthood, into which the old has been
   translated. And the sacred Scriptures show, and the tradition of the
   Catholic Church has always taught, that this priesthood was instituted
   by the same Lord our Saviour, and that to the apostles, and their
   successors in the priesthood, was the power delivered of consecrating,
   offering, and administering His Body and Blood, as also of forgiving
   and of retaining sins.
   CHAPTER II.
   On the Seven Orders.
   And whereas the ministry of so holy a priesthood is a divine thing; to
   the end that it might be exercised in a more worthy manner, and with
   greater veneration, it was suitable that, in the most well-ordered
   settlement of the church, there should be several and diverse orders of
   ministers, to minister to the priesthood, by virtue of their office;
   orders so distributed as that those already marked with the clerical
   tonsure should ascend through the lesser to the greater orders. For the
   sacred Scriptures make open mention not only of priests, but also of
   deacons; and teach, in words the most weighty, what things are
   especially to be attended to in the Ordination thereof; and, from the
   very beginning of the church, the names of the following orders, and
   the ministrations proper to each one of them, are known to have been in
   use; to wit those of subdeacon, acolyth, exorcist, lector, and
   door-keeper; though these were not of equal rank: for the subdeavonship
   is classed amongst the greater orders by the Fathers and sacred
   Councils, wherein also we very often read of the other inferior
   orders.
   [Page 172]
   CHAPTER III.
   That Order is truly and properly a Sacrament.
   Whereas, by the testimony of Scripture, by Apostolic tradition, and the
   unanimous consent of the Fathers, it is clear that grace is conferred
   by sacred ordination, which is performed by words and outward signs, no
   one ought to doubt that Order is truly and properly one of the seven
   sacraments of holy Church. For the apostle says; I admonish thee that
   thou stir up the grace of God, which is in thee by the imposition of my
   hands. For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of
   love of sobriety.
   CHAPTER IV
   On the Ecclesiastical hierarchy, and on Ordination.
   But, forasmuch as in the sacrament of Order, as also in Baptism and
   Confirmation, a character is imprinted, which can neither be effaced
   nor taken away; the holy Synod with reason condemns the opinion of
   those, who assert that the priests of the New Testament have only a
   temporary power; and that those who have once been rightly ordained,
   can again become laymen, if they do not exercise the ministry of the
   word of God. And if any one affirm, that all Christians indiscrimately
   are priests of the New Testament, or that they are all mutually endowed
   with an equal spiritual power, he clearly does nothing but confound the
   ecclesiastical hierarchy, which is as an army set in array; as if,
   contrary to the doctrine of blessed Paul, all were apostles, all
   prophets, all evangelists, all pastors, all doctors. Wherefore, the
   holy Synod declares that, besides [Page 173] the other ecclesiastical
   degrees, bishops, who have succeeded to the place of the apostles,
   principally belong to this hierarchial order; that they are placed, as
   the same apostle says, by the Holy Ghost, to rule the Church of God;
   that they are superior to priests; administer the sacrament of
   Confirmation; ordain the ministers of the Church; and that they can
   perform very many other things; over which functions others of an
   inferior order have no power. Furthermore, the sacred and holy Synod
   teaches, that, in the ordination of bishops, priests, and of the other
   orders, neither the consent, nor vocation, nor authority, whether of
   the people, or of any civil power or magistrate whatsoever, is required
   in such wise as that, without this, the ordination is invalid: yea
   rather doth It decree, that all those who, being only called and
   instituted by the people, or by the civil power and magistrate, ascend
   to the exercise of these ministrations, and those who of their own
   rashness assume them to themselves, are not ministers of the church,
   but are to be looked upon as thieves and robbers, who have not entered
   by the door. These are the things which it hath seemed good to the
   sacred Synod to teach the faithful in Christ, in general terms,
   touching the sacrament of Order. But It hath resolved to condemn
   whatsoever things are contrary thereunto, in express and specific
   canons, in the manner following; in order that all men, with the help
   of Christ, using the rule of faith, may, in the midst of the darkness
   of so many errors, more easily be able to recognise and to hold
   Catholic truth.
   ON THE SACRAMENT OF ORDER.
   CANON I.--If any one saith, that there is not in the New Testament a
   visible and external priesthood; or that there is not any power of
   consecrating and offering the true body and blood of the Lord, and of
   forgiving and retaining sins; but only an office and bare ministry of
   preaching the Gospel, or, that those who do not preach are not priests
   at all; let him be anathema.
   [Page 174] CANON II.--If any one saith, that, besides the priesthood,
   there are not in the Catholic Church other orders, both greater and
   minor, by which, as by certain steps, advance is made unto the
   priesthood; let him be anathema.
   CANON III.--If any one saith, that order, or sacred ordination, is not
   truly and properly a sacrament instituted by Christ the Lord; or, that
   it is a kind of human figment devised by men unskilled in
   ecclesiastical matters; or, that it is only a kind of rite for choosing
   ministers of the word of God and of the sacraments; let him be
   anathema.
   CANON IV.--If any one saith, that, by sacred ordination, the Holy Ghost
   is not given; and that vainly therefore do the bishops say, Receive ye
   the Holy Ghost; or, that a character is not imprinted by that
   ordination; or, that he who has once been a priest, can again become a
   layman; let him be anathema.
   CANON V.--If any one saith, that the sacred unction which the Church
   uses in holy ordination, is not only not required, but is to be
   despised and is pernicious, as likewise are the other ceremonies of
   Order; let him be anathema.
   CANON VI.--If any one saith, that, in the Catholic Church there is not
   a hierarchy by divine ordination instituted, consisting of bishops,
   priests, and ministers; let him be anathema.
   CANON VII.--If any one saith, that bishops are not superior to priests;
   or, that they have not the power of confirming and ordaining; or, that
   the power which they possess is common to them and to priests; or, that
   orders, conferred by them, without the consent, or vocation of the
   people, or of the secular power, are invalid; or, that those who have
   neither been rightly ordained, nor sent, by ecclesiastical and
   canonical power, but come from elsewhere, are lawful ministers of the
   word and of the sacraments; let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.--If any one saith, that the bishops, who are assumed by
   authority of the Roman Pontiff, are not legitimate and true bishops,
   but are a human figment; let him be anathema.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION
   The same sacred and holy Synod of Trent, prosecuting the matter of
   reformation, resolves and decrees that the things following be at
   present ordained.
   CHAPTER I.
   The negligence of Pastors of Churches in residing is variously
   punished: provision is made for the cure of souls.
   Whereas it is by divine precept enjoined on all, to whom the cure of
   souls is committed, to know their own sheep; to offer sacrifice for
   them; and, by the preaching of the divine word, by the administration
   of the sacraments, and by the example of all good works, to feed them;
   to have a fatherly care of the poor and of other distressed persons,
   and to apply themselves to all other pastoral duties; all which
   (offices) cannot be rendered and fulfilled by those who neither watch
   over nor are with their own flock, but abandon it after the manner of
   hirelings; the sacred and holy Synod admonishes and exhorts such, that
   mindful of the divine precepts, and made a pattern of the flock, they
   feed and rule in judgment and in truth. And for fear lest those things
   which have been already elsewhere holily and usefully ordained,
   concerning residence, under Paul III., of happy memory, may be wrested
   to a meaning alien from the mind of the sacred and holy Synod, as if by
   virtue of that decree it were lawful to be absent during five
   continuous months; the sacred and holy Synod, adhering to those
   decrees, declares, that all persons who are--under whatsoever name and
   title, even though they be cardinals of the holy Roman Church--set over
   any patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, and cathe-[Page 176]dral
   churches whatsoever, are obliged to personal residence in their own
   church, or diocese, where they shall be bound to discharge the office
   enjoined them; and may not be absent thence, save for the causes and in
   the manner subjoined. For whereas Christian charity, urgent necessity,
   due obedience, and the evident utility of the Church, or of the
   commonwealth, require and demand that some at times be absent, this
   same sacred and holy Synod ordains, that these causes of lawful absence
   are to be approved of in writing by the most blessed Roman Pontiff, or
   by the metropolitan, or, in his absence, by the oldest resident
   suffragan bishop, whose duty it shall also be to approve of the absence
   of the metropolitan; except when such absence happens in consequence of
   some employment and office in the state attached to the bishoprics; the
   causes of which absence being notorious, and at times sudden, it will
   not be necessary even to notify them to the metropolitan; to whom it
   shall however belong, conjointly with the provincial Council, to judge
   of the permissions granted by himself, or by his suffragan, and to see
   that no one abuse that right, and that transgressors are punished with
   the penalties adjudged by the canons. Meanwhile let those about to
   depart remember to provide in such sort for their sheep, as that, as
   far as possible, they may not suffer any injury through their absence.
   But, forasmuch as those who are only absent for a short period, are, in
   the sense of the ancient canons, not supposed to be absent, for that
   they are about to return immediately; the sacred and holy Synod wills,
   that that term of absence, whether continuous or interrupted, ought not
   by any means to exceed two, or at most three, months; except for the
   causes above named; and that regard be had that it be done from a just
   cause, and without any detriment to the flock: which, whether it be the
   case, the Synod leaves to the conscience of those who withdraw
   themselves which It hopes will be religious and timorous; seeing that
   their hearts are open before God, whose work they are bound, at their
   periol, not to do deceitfully. In the meantime It [Page 177] admonishes
   and exhorts them in the Lord, that unless their episcopal duties call
   them to some other part of their own diocese, they on no account be
   absent from their own cathedral church during the period of the Advent
   of the Lord, and of Lent, on the days of the Nativity, of the Lord's
   Resurrection, of Pentecost, and of Corpus Christi, on which days
   especially the sheep ought to be refreshed, and to rejoice in the Lord
   at the presence of the Shepherd.
   But if any one, which it is hoped will never happen, shall be absent,
   contrary to the regulation of this decree, the sacred and holy Synod
   ordains, that, in addition to the other penalties imposed upon and
   renewed against non-residents, under Paul III., and the guilt of mortal
   sin which such an one incurs, he acquires no property in any fruits, in
   proportion to the time of his absence, and that he cannot, even though
   no other declaration but this follow, retain them as his with a safe
   conscience; but is bound, or, in his default, his ecclesiastical
   superior for him, to apply them to the fabric of the churches, or to
   the poor of the place; every kind of agreement, or composition as it is
   called, in regard of ill-gotten fruits, being prohibited, whereby the
   aforesaid fruits even might be wholly, or in part, restored to him; any
   privileges whatsoever, granted to any college or fabric, to the
   contrary notwithstanding.
   The same also, both as regards the guilt, the loss of fruits, and the
   penalties, does the sacred and holy Synod wholly declare and decree, in
   regard of inferior pastors, and all others whomsoever who hold any
   ecclesiastical benefice having cure of souls; in such wise, however, as
   that, whensoever it shall happen that they are absent, for a cause that
   has been first made known to, and been approved of by, the bishop, they
   shall leave, with a due allowance of stipend, a suitable vicar, to be
   approved of by the Ordinary. And they shall not obtain permission to be
   absent,--which is to be granted in writing and gratuitously,--for a
   larger period than two months, except for some weighty cause; and if,
   after having been cited, even though not per-[Page 178]sonally, by an
   edict, they shall be contumacious, the Synod wills, that it be in the
   power of the Ordinaries to constrain them by ecclesiastical censures,
   and by the sequestration and substraction of fruits, and by other legal
   remedies, even as far as deprivation; and that the execution hereof
   shall not be able to be suspended by any manner of privilege soever,
   license, claim as a domestic, exemption,--though even upon the ground
   of any manner of benefice,--by any compact, or statute,--even though
   confirmed by oath or by what authority soever,--by any custom, even
   though immemorial, which herein is to be looked upon rather as a
   corruption, or by any appeal, or inhibition, even in the Roman Court,
   or by virtue of the constitution of Eugenius. Finally, the holy Synod
   commands, that both the decree under Paul III., and this present, shall
   be published in the provincial and episcopal councils; for It desires
   that things so nearly concerning the office of pastors, and the
   salvation of souls, be frequently impressed on the minds and ears of
   all men, that so, with God's help, they may never hereafter be
   abolished through the injury of time, the forgetfulness of men, or by
   desuetude.
   CHAPTER II.
   Those set over Churches shall receive the rite of consecration within
   three months; where the consecration is to take place.
   Those who,--under whatsoever name or title, even though they be
   cardinals of the holy Roman Church,--have been set over cathedral, or
   superior, churches, if they shall not, within three months, have
   received the rite of consecration, shall be bound to restore the fruits
   which they have received; if they shall have neglected to do this
   within three other months afterwards, they shall be ipso jure deprived
   of their churches. And their consecration, if performed out of the
   Court of Rome, shall be celebrated in the church to which they have
   been promoted, or in the province, if it can be conveniently done.
   [Page 179]
   CHAPTER III.
   Bishops, except in case of illness, shall confer Order in person.
   Bishops shall themselves confer orders; but, should they be prevented
   by illness, they shall not send their subjects to another bishop for
   ordination, unless they have been already approved of and examined.
   CHAPTER IV
   Who are to be initiated by the first tonsure.
   None shall be initiated by the first tonsure, who have not received the
   sacrament of Confirmation; and who have not been taught the rudiments
   of the faith; and who do not know how to read and write; and in whose
   regard there is not a probable conjecture, that they have chosen this
   manner of life, that they may render unto God a faithful service, and
   not that they may fraudulently withdraw themselves from Secular
   jurisdiction.
   CHAPTER V
   Wherewith those who are to be ordained are to be furnished.
   Those who are to be promoted to minor orders shall have a good
   testimonial from their parish priest; and from the master of the school
   in which they are educated. As to those who are to be raised to any one
   of the greater orders, they shall, a month before ordination, repair to
   the bishop, who shall commission the parish priest, or such other
   person as may be deemed more expedient, to state publicly in the church
   the names and the desire of those who wish to be promoted; and to
   diligently inform himself, from persons worthy of credit, of the birth,
   age, morals, and life [Page 180] of those who are to be ordained, and
   shall transmit to the bishop himself, as soon as possible, letters
   testimonial containing the actual inquiry that has been made.
   CHAPTER VI
   The age of fourteen years is required for an ecclesiastical benfice;
   who is to enjoy the privilege of the (ecclesiastical) court.
   No one, after being initiated by the first tonsure, or even after being
   constituted in minor orders, shall be able to hold a benefice before
   his fourteenth year. Further, he shall not enjoy the privilege of the
   (ecclesiastical) court, unless he have an ecclesiastical benefice; or,
   wearing the ecclesiastical dress and tonsure, he serves in some church
   by the bishop's order, or lives with the bishop's permission in an
   ecclesiastical seminary, or in some school, or university, on the way
   as it were to receive the greater orders. As regards married clerks,
   the constitution of Boniface VIII., which begins, clerici qui cum
   unicis, shall be observed; provided the said clerks, being deputed by
   the bishop to the service or ministry of some church, serve and
   minister therein, and wear the clerical dress and tonsure: no
   privilege, or custom, even immemorial, availing any one herein.
   CHAPTER VII.
   Those to be ordained are to be examined by persons versed in divine and
   human laws.
   The holy Synod, adhering to the traces of the ancient canons, ordains,
   that when a bishop has arranged to hold an ordination, all who may wish
   to be received into the sacred ministry shall be summoned to the city,
   for the Thursday before the said ordination, or for such other day as
   the bishop shall think fit. [Page 181] And the bishop, calling to his
   assistance priests and other prudent persons, well skilled in the
   divine law, and of experience in the constitutions of the church, shall
   diligently investigate and examine the parentage, person, age,
   education, morals, learning, and faith of those who are to be
   ordained.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   How, and by whom, each ought to be ordained.
   Ordinations of sacred orders shall be celebrated publicly, at the time
   appointed by law, and in the cathedral churches, in the presence of the
   canons of that church, who are to be invited for that purpose; but, if
   they are celebrated in some other place of the diocese, in the presence
   of the clergy of the place; the principal church being always, as far
   as possible, made use of. But each one shall be ordained by his own
   bishop. And if any one ask to be promoted by another bishop, this shall
   by no means be allowed him, even under the pretext of any general or
   special rescript or privilege whatsoever, even at the appointed times;
   unless his probity and morals be recommended by the testimony of his
   own Ordinary; otherwise, he who ordains him shall be suspended from
   conferring orders during a year, and he who has been ordained shall be
   suspended from exercising the orders which he has received, for as long
   a period as shall seem expedient to his own Ordinary.
   CHAPTER IX.
   A bishop ordaining one of his own household, shall at once and really
   confer upon him a benefice.
   A bishop may not ordain one of his household, who is not his subject,
   unless he has lived with him for the space of [Page 182] three years;
   and he shall really, and without fraud of any kind, at once confer on
   him a benefice; any custom, even though immemorial, to the contrary
   notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER X.
   Prelates inferior to bishops shall not give the tonsure, or minor
   orders, save to Regulars their own subjects; neither shall they, nor
   any Chapters whatsoever, grant dimissory letters; a more grievous
   penalty is enacted against those who offend against this decree.
   It shall not henceforth be lawful for abbots, or for any other persons
   whatsoever, howsoever exempted, being within the limits of any diocese,
   even though they be said to be of no diocese, or to be exempted, to
   confer the tonsure, or minor orders on any one who is not a Regular
   subject to them; nor shall the said abbots, and other exempted persons,
   or any colleges, or Chapters whatsoever, even those of cathedral
   churches, grant letters dimissory to any Secular clerics to be ordained
   by others. But the ordination of all these persons shall appertain to
   the bishops within the limits of whose diocese they are, all things
   considered in the decrees of this holy Synod being observed; any
   privilege, prescriptions, or customs, even though immemorial,
   notwithstanding. And the Synod ordains, that the penalty imposed on
   those, who, contrary to the decree of this holy Synod under Paul III.,
   obtain, during the vacancy of the episcopal See, letters dimissory from
   the Chapter, be also extended to those who shall obtain the said
   letters, not from the Chapter, but from any other persons whatsoever,
   who, during the vacancy of the See, succeed to the jurisdiction of the
   bishop, in lieu of the Chapter. And they who give dimissory letters,
   contrary to the form of this decree, shall be ipso jure suspended
   during a year from their office and benefice.
   [Page 183]
   CHAPTER XI.
   The interstices, and certain other regulations, to be observed in
   receiving minor orders.
   The minor orders shall not be given but to such as understand the Latin
   language at least, observing the appointed interstices of time, unless
   the bishop shall think it more expedient to act otherwise; that so they
   may be the more accurately taught how great is the obligation of this
   their state of life; and may exercise themselves in each office,
   agreeably to the appointment of the bishop; and this in the church to
   which they shall be assigned, unless they happen to be absent on
   account of their studies; and may thus ascend step by step: that so
   with their increasing age they may grow in worthiness of life and in
   learning; of which they will give proof especially by the example of
   their good conduct, by their assiduous service in the church, their
   greater reverence towards priests and the superior orders, and by a
   more frequent communion than heretofore of the Body of Christ. And
   whereas from these orders is the entrance unto higher orders and to the
   most sacred mysteries, no one shall be admitted thereunto, whom the
   promise of knowledge does not point out as worthy of the greater
   orders. And such shall not be promoted to sacred orders till a year
   after the reception of the last degree of minor orders; unless
   necessity, or the utility of the church, in the bishop's judgment,
   shall require otherwise.
   CHAPTER XII.
   Age required for the major orders; the deserving only to be admitted.
   No one shall for the future be promoted to the order of subdeaconship
   before the twenty-second year of age; to that [Page 184] of deaconship
   before his twenty-third year; to that of priesthood before his
   twenty-fifth year. Nevertheless, bishops are to know, that not all who
   have attained to that age must needs be admitted to the aforesaid
   orders, but those only who are worthy, and whose commendable life is an
   old age. Regulars likewise shall not be ordained under the above age,
   nor without a diligent examination by the bishop; all privileges
   whatsoever in this regard being completely set aside.
   CHAPTER XIII.
   On the conditions required in the Ordination of a Subdeacon and Deacon:
   on no one shall two sacred Orders be conferred on the same day.
   Such as have a good testimonial, and have been already tried in minor
   orders, and are instructed in letters, and in those things which belong
   to the exercise of their orders, shall be ordained subdeacons and
   deacons. They shall have a hope, with God's help, to be able to live
   continently; they shall serve in the churches to which they may be
   assigned; and are to know that it is very highly becoming that, after
   ministering at the altar, they should receive the sacred communion, at
   least on the Lord's days and solemnities. Those who have been promoted
   to the sacred order of the subdeaconship shall not, until they have
   remained therein during at least a year, be permitted to ascend to a
   higher degree, unless the bishop shall judge otherwise. Two sacred
   orders shall not be conferred on the same day, even upon Regulars; any
   privileges and indults whatsoever, to whomsoever granted, to the
   contrary notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER XIV.
   Who are to be raised to the Priesthood: their office.
   Those who have conducted themselves piously and faithfully in their
   precedent functions, and are promoted to the order of [Page 185]
   priesthood, shall have a good testimonial, and be persons who not only
   have served in their office of deacon during at least an entire
   year,--unless for the utility and the necessity of the Church, the
   bishop should judge otherwise,--but who have also been approved to be,
   by a careful previous examination, capable of teaching the people those
   things which it is necessary for all to know unto salvation, as also
   fit to administer the sacraments; and so conspicuous for piety and
   chasteness of morals, as that a shining example of good works and a
   lesson how to live may be expected from them. The bishop shall take
   care that they celebrate mass at least on the Lord's Days, and on
   solemn festivals; but, if they have the cure of souls, so often as to
   satisfy their obligation. The bishop may, for a lawful cause, grant a
   dispensation to those who have been promoted per saltum, provided they
   have not exercised the ministry (of that order).
   CHAPTER XV.
   No one shall hear confessions, unless he be approved of by the
   Ordinary.
   Although priests receive in their ordination the power of absolving
   from sins; nevertheless, the holy Synod ordains, that no one, even
   though he be a Regular, is able to hear the confessions of Seculars,
   not even of priests, and that he is not to be reputed fit thereunto,
   unless he either holds a parochial benefice, or is, by the bishops,
   after an examination if they shall think it necessary, or in some other
   manner, judged capable; and has obtained their approval, which shall be
   granted gratuitously; any privileges, and custom whatsoever, though
   immemorial, to the contrary notwithstanding.
   [Page 186]
   CHAPTER XVI.
   Those who are ordained shall be assigned to a particular church.
   Whereas no one ought to be ordained, who, in the judgment of his own
   bishop, is not useful or necessary for his churches, the holy Synod,
   adhering to the traces of the sixth canon of the council of Chalcedon,
   ordains, that no one shall for the future be ordained without being
   attached to that church, or pious place, for the need, or utility of
   which he is promoted; there to discharge his duties, and not wander
   about without any certain abode. And if he shall quit that place
   without consulting the bishop, he shall be interdicted from the
   exercise of his sacred (orders). Furthermore, no cleric, who is a
   stranger, shall, without letters commendatory from his own Ordinary, be
   admitted by any bishop to celebrate the divine mysteries, and to
   administer the sacraments.
   CHAPTER XVII.
   In what manner the exercise of the minor orders is to be restored.
   That the functions of holy orders, from the deacon to the
   janitor,-which functions have been laudably received in the Church from
   the times of the apostles, and which have been for some time
   interrupted in very many places,-may be again brought into use in
   accordance with the sacred canons; and that they may not be traduced by
   heretics as useless; the holy Synod, burning with the desire of
   restoring the pristine usage, ordains that, for the future, such
   functions shall not be exercised but by those who are actually in the
   said orders; and It exhorts in the Lord all and each of the prelates of
   the churches, and commands them, that it be their care to restore the
   said [Page 187] functions, as far as it can be conveniently done, in
   the cathedral, collegiate, and parochial churches of their dioceses,
   where the number of the people and the revenues of the church can
   support it; and, to those who exercise those functions, they shall
   assign salaries out of some part of the revenues of any simple
   benefices, or those of the fabric of the church,-if the funds allow of
   it,-or out of the revenues of both together, of which stipends they
   may, if negligent, be mulcted in a part, or be wholly deprived thereof,
   according to the judgment of the Ordinary. And if there should not be
   unmarried clerics at hand to exercise the functions of the four minor
   orders, their place may be supplied by married clerics of approved
   life; provided they have not been twice married, be competent to
   discharge the said duties, and wear the tonsure and the clerical dress
   in church.
   CHAPTER XVIII.
   Method of establishing Seminaries for Clerics, and of educating the
   same therein.
   Wereas the age of youth, unless it be rightly trained, is prone to
   follow after the pleasures of the world; and unless it be formed, from
   its tender years, unto piety and religion, before habits of vice have
   taken possession of the whole man, it never will perfectly, and without
   the greatest, and well-nigh special, help of Almighty God, persevere in
   ecclesiastical discipline; the holy Synod ordains, that all cathedral,
   metropolitan, and other churches greater than these, shall be bound,
   each according to its means and the extent of the diocese, to maintain,
   to educate religiously, and to train in ecclesiastical discipline, a
   certain number of youths of their city and diocese, or, if that number
   cannot be met with there, of that province, in a college to be chosen
   by the bishop for this purpose near the said churches, or in some other
   suitable place. Into this college shall be received such as are at
   least twelve years old, born in [Page 188] lawful wedlock, and who know
   how to read and write competently, and whose character and inclination
   afford a hope that they will always serve in the ecclesiastical
   ministry. And It wishes that the children of the poor be principally
   selected; though It does not however exclude those of the more wealthy,
   provided they be maintained at their own expense, and manifest a desire
   of serving God and the Church. The bishop, having divided these youths
   into as many classes as he shall think fit, according to their number,
   age, and progress in ecclesiastical discipline, shall, when it seems to
   him expedient, assign some of them to the ministry of the churches, the
   others he shall keep in the college to be instructed; and shall supply
   the place of those who have been withdrawn, by others; that so this
   college may be a perpetual seminary of ministers of God. And that the
   youths may be the more advantageously trained in the aforesaid
   ecclesiastical discipline, they shall always at once wear the tonsure
   and the clerical dress; they shall learn grammar, singing,
   ecclesiastical computation, and the other liberal arts; they shall be
   instructed in sacred Scripture; ecclesiastical works; the homilies of
   the saints; the manner of administering the sacraments, especially
   those things which shall seem adapted to enable them to hear
   confessions; and the forms of the rites and ceremonies. The bishop
   shall take care that they be present every day at the sacrifice of the
   mass, and that they confess their sins at least once a month; and
   receive the body of our Lord Jesus Christ as the judgment of their
   confessor shall direct; and on festivals serve in the cathedral and
   other churches of the place.
   All which, and other things advantageous and needful for this object,
   all bishops shall ordain-with the advice of two of the senior and most
   experienced canons chosen by himself-as the Holy Spirit shall suggest;
   and shall make it their care, by frequent visitations, that the same be
   always observed. The froward, and incorrigible, and the disseminators
   of evil morals, they shall punish sharply, even by expulsion if
   necessary; and, removing all hindrances, they shall carefully foster
   whatsoever appears to tend to preserve and advance so pious and holy an
   institution. And forasmuch as some certain revenues will be [Page 189]
   necessary, for raising the building of the college, for paying their
   salaries to the teachers and servants, for the maintenance of the
   youths, and for other expenses; besides those funds which are, in some
   churches and places, set apart for training or maintaining youths, and
   which are to be hereby looked upon as applied to this seminary under
   the said charge of the bishop; the bishops as aforesaid, with the
   advice of two of the Chapter,--of whom one shall be chosen by the
   bishop, and the other by the Chapter itself, and also of two of the
   clergy of the city, the election of one of whom shall in like manner be
   with the bishop, and of the other with the clergy,--shall take a
   certain part or portion, out of the entire fruits of the episcopal
   revenue, and of the chapter, and of all dignities whatsoever,
   personates, offices, prebends, portions, abbies, and priories, of
   whatsoever order, even though Regular, or of whatsoever quality, or
   condition they may be, and of hospitals which are conferred under title
   or administration, pursuant to the constitution of the Council of
   Vienne, which begins Quia contingit; and of all benefices whatsoever,
   even those belonging to Regulars, even those which are under any right
   of patronage, even those that are exempted, that are of no diocese, or
   are annexed to other churches, monasteries, hospitals, or to any other
   pious places, even such as are exempted; as also of the revenues
   devoted to the fabrics of churches, and of other places, and likewise
   of all other ecclesiastical revenues and proceeds whatsoever, even
   those of other colleges;-in which, however, there are not actually
   seminaries of scholars, or of teachers, for promoting the common good
   of the Church; for the Synod wills that those places be exempted,
   except in regard of such revenues as may remain over and above the
   suitable support of the said seminaries;--or of bodies, or
   confraternities, which in some places are called schools, likewise of
   all monasteries, with the exception of the Mendicants; also of the
   tithes in any way belonging to laymen, out of which ecclesiastical
   subsidies are wont to be paid; and those belonging to the soldiers of
   any [Page 190] military body, or order, the brethren of Saint John of
   Jerusalem alone excepted; and they shall apply to, and incorporate
   with, the said college this portion so deducted, as also a certain
   number of simple benefices, of whatsoever quality and dignity they may
   be, or even prestimonies, or prestimonial portions as they are called,
   even before they fall vacant, without prejudice however to the divine
   service, or to those who hold them. And this shall have effect, even
   though the benefices be reserved or appropriated to other uses; nor
   shall this union and application of the said benefices be suspended, or
   in any way hindered, by any resignation thereof, but shall still in any
   case have effect, notwithstanding any way whatever in which they may be
   vacated, even be it in the Roman court, and notwithstanding any
   constitution whatsoever to the contrary.
   The bishop of the place shall, by ecclesiastical censures, and other
   legal means, even by calling in for this purpose, if he think fit, the
   help of the Secular arm, compel the possessors of benefices, dignities,
   personates, and of all and singular the above-named (revenues), to pay
   this portion not merely on their own account, but also on account of
   whatsoever pensions they may happen to have to pay to others, out of
   the said revenues,-keeping back however a sum equivalent to that which
   they have to pay on account of those pensions: notwithstanding as
   regards all and singular the above-mentioned premises, any privileges,
   exemptions-even such as might require a special derogation-any custom,
   even immemorial, or any appeal, and allegation, which might hinder the
   execution hereof. But in case it should happen that, by means of the
   said unions being carried into effect, or from some other cause, the
   said seminary should be found to be wholly or in part endowed, then
   shall the portion, deducted as above from all benefices and
   incorporated by the bishop, be remitted, either wholly or in part, as
   the actual circumstances shall require. But if the prelates of
   cathedrals, and of the other greater churches, should be negligent in
   erecting the said seminary, and in preserving the same, and refuse to
   pay their share; it will be the duty of the archbishop sharply to
   reprove the bishop, and to compel him to comply with all the matters
   aforesaid, and of the provincial Synod to reprove and [Page 191] to
   compel in like manner the archbishop, and sedulously to provide that
   this holy and pious work be as soon as possible proceeded with,
   wherever it is possible. The bishop shall annually receive the accounts
   of the revenues of the said seminary, in the presence of two deputies
   from the Chapter, and of the same number deputed from the clergy of the
   city.
   Furthermore, in order that the teaching in schools of this nature may
   be provided for at less expense, the holy Synod ordains, that bishops,
   archbishops, primates, and other Ordinaries of places, shall constrain
   and compel, even by the substraction of their fruits, those who possess
   any dignities as professors of theology, and all others to whom is
   attached the office of lecturing, or of teaching, to teach those who
   are to be educated in the said schools, personally, if they be
   competent, otherwise by competent substitutes to be chosen by
   themselves, and to be approved of by the Ordinary. And if, in the
   judgment of the bishop, those chosen are not fit, they shall noniminate
   another who is fit, without any appeal being allowed; but should they
   neglect to do this, the bishop himself shall depute one. And the
   aforesaid masters shall teach those things which the bishop shall judge
   expedient. And, henceforth, those offices, or dignities, which are
   called professorships of theology, shall not be conferred on any but
   doctors, or masters, or licentiates in divinity, or canon law, or on
   other competent persons, and such as can personally discharge that
   office; and any provision made otherwise shall be null and void: all
   privileges and customs whatsoever, even though immemorial,
   notwithstanding.
   But if the churches in any province labour under so great poverty, as
   that a college cannot be established in certain (churches) thereof; the
   provincial Synod, or the metropolitan, aided by the two oldest
   suffragans, shall take care to establish one or more colleges, as shall
   be judged expedient, in the metro-[Page 192]politan, or in some other
   more convenient church of the province, out of the revenues of two or
   more churches, in which singly a college cannot conveniently be
   established, and there shall the youths of those churches be educated.
   But in churches which have extensive dioceses, the bishop may have one
   or more seminaries in the diocese, as to him shall seem expedient;
   which seminaries shall however be entirely dependent in all things on
   the one erected and established in the (episcopal) city.
   Finally, if, either upon occasion of the said unions, or the taxation,
   or assignment, and incorporation of the above-named portions, or from
   some other cause, there should happen to arise any difficulty, by
   reason of which the institution, or maintenance of the said seminary
   may be hindered or disturbed, the bishop with the deputies as above, or
   the provincial Synod according to the custom of the country, shall have
   power, regard being had to the character of the churches and benefices,
   to regulate and order all and singular the matters which shall seem
   necessary and expedient for the happy advancement of the said seminary,
   even so as to modify or enlarge, if need be, the contents hereof.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION.
   Moreover, the same sacred and holy Synod of Trent indicts the next
   ensuing Session for the sixteenth day of the month of September; in
   which it will treat of the sacrament of Matrimony, and of such other
   matters, if there be any, relative to the doctrine of faith as can be
   expedited, as also on provisions for bishoprics, dignities, and other
   ecclesiastical benefices, and divers articles of Reformation.
   The Session was prorogued to the eleventh day of November, MDLXIII.
   SESSION THE TWENTY-FOURTH,
   Being the eighth under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius IV., celebrated on
   the eleventh day of November, MDLXIII.
   DOCTRINE ON THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY
   The first parent of the human race, under the influence of the divine
   Spirit, pronounced the bond of matrimony perpetual and indissoluble,
   when he said; This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.
   Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his
   wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. But, that by this bond two
   only are united and joined together, our Lord taught more plainly, when
   rehearsing those last words as having been uttered by God, He said,
   therefore now they are not two, but one flesh; and straightway
   confirmed the firmness of that tie, proclaimed so long before by Adam,
   by these words; What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put
   asunder. But, the grace which might perfect that natural love, and
   confirm that indissoluble union, and sanctify the married, Christ
   Himself, the institutor and perfecter of the venerable sacraments,
   merited for us by His passion; as the Apostle Paul intimates, saying:
   Husbands love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church, and
   delivered himself up for it; adding shortly after, This is a great
   sacrament, but I speak in Christ and in the Church. Whereas therefore
   matrimony, in the evangelical law, excels in grace, through Christ, the
   ancient marriages; with reason have our holy Fathers, the Councils, and
   the tradition of the universal Church, always taught, that it is to be
   numbered amongst the sacraments of the new law; against which, impious
   men of this age raging, have not only had false notions touching this
   venerable sacrament, but, introducing according to their wont, [Page
   194] under the pretext of the Gospel, a carnal liberty, they have by
   word and writing asserted, not without great injury to the faithful of
   Christ, many things alien from the sentiment of the Catholic Church,
   and from the usage approved of since the times of the apostles; the
   holy and universal Synod wishing to meet the rashness of these men, has
   thought it proper, lest their pernicious contagion may draw more after
   it, that the more remarkable heresies and errors of the above-named
   schismatics be exterminated, by decreeing against the said heretics and
   their errors the following anathemas.
   ON THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY.
   CANON I.-If any one saith, that matrimony is not truly and properly one
   of the seven sacraments of the evangelic law, (a sacrament) instituted
   by Christ the Lord; but that it has been invented by men in the Church;
   and that it does not confer grace; let him be anathema.
   CANON II.-If any one saith, that it is lawful for Christians to have
   several wives at the same time, and that this is not prohibited by any
   divine law; let him be anathema.
   CANON III.-If any one saith, that those degrees only of consanguinity
   and affinity, which are set down in Leviticus, can hinder matrimony
   from being contracted, and dissolve it when contracted; and that the
   Church cannot dispense in some of those degrees, or establish that
   others may hinder and dissolve it ; let him be anathema.
   CANON IV.-If any one saith, that the Church could not establish
   impediments dissolving marriage; or that she has erred in establishing
   them; let him be anathema.
   CANON V.-If any one saith, that on account of heresy, or irksome
   cohabitation, or the affected absence of one of the parties, the bond
   of matrimony may be dissolved; let him be anathema.
   [Page 195] CANON VI.-If any one saith, that matrimony contracted, but
   not consummated, is not dissolved by the solemn profession of religion
   by one of the married parties; let him be anathema.
   CANON VlI.-If any one saith, that the Church has erred, in that she
   hath taught, and doth teach, in accordance with the evangelical and
   apostolical doctrine, that the bond of matrimony cannot be dissolved on
   account of the adultery of one of the married parties; and that both,
   or even the innocent one who gave not occasion to the adultery, cannot
   contract another marriage, during the life-time of the other; and, that
   he is guilty of adultery, who, having put away the adulteress, shall
   take another wife, as also she, who, having put away the adulterer,
   shall take another husband; let him be anathema.
   CANON VIII.-If any one saith, that the Church errs, in that she
   declares that, for many causes, a separation may take place between
   husband and wife, in regard of bed, or in regard of cohabitation, for a
   determinate or for an indeterminate period; let him be anathema.
   CANON IX.-If any one saith, that clerics constituted in sacred orders,
   or Regulars, who have solemnly professed chastity, are able to contract
   marriage, and that being contracted it is valid, notwithstanding the
   ecclesiastical law, or vow; and that the contrary is no thing else than
   to condemn marriage; and, that all who do not feel that they have the
   gift of chastity, even though they have made a vow thereof, may
   contract marriage; let him be anathema: seeing that God refuses not
   that gift to those who ask for it rightly, neither does He suffer us to
   be tempted above that which we are able.
   CANON X.-If any one saith, that the marriage state is to be placed
   above the state of virginity, or of celibacy, and that it is not better
   and more blessed to remain in virginity, or in celibacy, than to be
   united in matrimony; let him be anathema.
   CANON XI.-If any one saith, that the prohibition of the solemnization
   of marriages at certain times of the year, is a tyrannical
   superstition, derived from the superstition of the [Page 196] heathen;
   or, condemn the benedictions and other ceremonies which the Church
   makes use of therein; let him be anathema.
   CANON XII.-If any one saith, that matrimonial causes do not belong to
   ecclesiastical judges; let him be anathema.
   DECREE ON THE REFORMATION OF MARRIAGE
   CHAPTER I.
   The form prescribed in the Council of Lateran for solemnly contracting
   marriage is renewed.--Bishops may dispense with the bans.--Whosoever
   contracts marriage, otherwise than in the presence of the Parish Priest
   and of two or three witnesses, contracts it invalidly.
   Although it is not to be doubted, that clandestine marriages, made with
   the free consent of the contracting parties, are valid and true
   marriages, so long as the Church has not rendered them invalid; and
   consequently, that those persons are justly to be condemned, as the
   holy Synod doth condemn them with anathema, who deny that such
   marriages are true and valid; as also those who falsely affirm that
   marriages contracted by the children of a family, without the consent
   of their parents, are invalid, and that parents can make such marriages
   either valid or invalid; nevertheless, the holy Church of God has, for
   reasons most just, at all times detested and prohibited such marriages.
   But whereas the holy Synod perceives that those prohibitions, by reason
   of man's disobedience, are no longer of avail; and whereas it takes
   into account the grievous sins which arise from the said clandestine
   marriages, and especially the sins of those parties who live on in a
   state of damnation, when, having left their former wife, with whom they
   had contracted marriage secretly, they publicly marry another, and with
   her live in per-[Page 197]petual adultery; an evil which the Church,
   which judges not of what is hidden, cannot rectify, unless some more
   efficacious remedy be applied; wherefore, treading in the steps of the
   sacred Council of Lateran celebrated under Innocent III., it ordains
   that, for the future, before a marriage is contracted, the proper
   parish priest of the contracting parties shall three times announce
   publicly in the Church, during the solemnization of mass, on three
   continuous festival days, between whom marriage is to be celebrated;
   after which publication of banns, if there be no lawful impediment
   opposed, the marriage shall be proceeded with in the face of the
   church; where the parish priest, after having interrogated the man and
   the woman, and heard their mutual consent, shall either say, "I join
   you together in matrimony, in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost;" or, he shall use other words, according to the
   received rite of each province. But if upon occasion, there should be a
   probable suspicion that the marriage may be maliciously hindered, if so
   many publications of banns precede it; in this case either one
   publication only shall be made; or at least the marriage shall be
   celebrated in the presence of the parish priest, and of two or three
   witnesses: Then, before the consummation thereof, the banns shall be
   published in the church; that so, if there be any secret impediments,
   they may be the more easily discovered: unless the Ordinary shall
   himself judge it expedient, that the publications aforesaid be
   dispensed with, which the holy Synod leaves to his prudence and
   judgment. Those who shall attempt to contract marriage otherwise than
   in the presence of the parish priest, or of some other priest by
   permission of the said parish priest, or of the Ordinary, and in the
   presence of two or three witnesses; the holy Synod renders such wholly
   incapable of thus contracting and declares such contracts invalid and
   null, as by the present decree It invalidates and annuls them. Moreover
   It enjoins, that the parish priest, or any other priest, who shall have
   been [Page 198] present at any such contract with a less number of
   witnesses (than as aforesaid); as also the witnesses who have been
   present thereat without the parish priest, or some other priest; and
   also the contracting parties themselves; shall be severely punished, at
   the discretion of the Ordinary. Furthermore, the same holy Synod
   exhorts the bridegroom and bride not to live together in the same house
   until they have received the sacerdotal benediction, which is to be
   given in the church; and It ordains that the benediction shall be given
   by their own parish priest, and that permission to give the aforesaid
   benediction cannot be granted by any other than the parish priest
   himself, or the Ordinary; any custom, even though immemorial, which
   ought rather to be called a corruption, or any privilege to the
   contrary, notwithstanding. And if any parish priest, or any other
   priest, whether Regular or Secular, shall presume to unite in marriage
   the betrothed of another parish, or to bless them when married, without
   the permission of their parish priest, he shall-even though he may
   plead that he is allowed to do this by a privilege, or an immemorial
   custom,-remain ipso jure suspended, until absolved by the Ordinary of
   that parish priest who ought to have been present at the marriage, or
   from whom the benediction ought to have been received.
   The parish priest shall have a book, which he shall keep carefully by
   him, in which he shall register the names of the persons married, and
   of the witnesses, and the day on which, and the place where, the
   marriage was contracted.
   Finally, the holy Synod exhorts those who marry, that before they
   contract marriage, or, at all events, three days before the
   consummation thereof, they carefully confess their sins, and approach
   devoutly to the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist.
   If any provinces have herein in use any praise-worthy customs and
   ceremonies, besides the aforesaid, the holy Synod earnestly desires
   that they be by all means retained.
   And that these so wholesome injunctions may not be unknown [Page 199]
   to any, It enjoins on all Ordinaries, that they, as soon as possible,
   make it their care that this decree be published and explained to the
   people in every parish church of their respective dioceses; and that
   this be done as often as may be during the first year; and afterwards
   as often as they shall judge it expedient. It ordains, moreover, that
   this decree shall begin to be in force in each parish, at the
   expiration of thirty days, to be counted from the day of its first
   publication made in the said parish.
   CHAPTER II.
   Between whom Spiritual Relationship is contracted.
   Experience teaches, that, by reason of the multitude of prohibitions,
   marriages are ofttimes unwittingly contracted in prohibited cases, in
   which marriages either the parties continue to live on, not without
   great sin, or they are dissolved, not without great scandal. Wherefore,
   the holy Synod, wishing to provide against this inconvenience, and
   beginning with the impediment arising from spiritual relationship,
   ordains, that, in accordance with the appointments of the sacred
   canons, one person only, whether male or female, or at most one male
   and one female, shall receive in baptism the individual baptized;
   between whom and the baptized, and the father and mother thereof; as
   also between the person baptizing and the baptized, and the father and
   mother of the baptized; and these only; shall spiritual relationship be
   contracted.
   The parish priest, before he proceeds to confer baptism, shall
   carefully inquire of those whom it may concern, what person or persons
   they have chosen to receive from the sacred font the individual
   baptized, and he shall allow him or them only to receive the baptized;
   shall register their names in the book, and teach them what
   relationship they have contracted, that they may not have any excuse on
   the score of ignorance. [Page 200] And if any others, besides those
   designated, should touch the baptized, they shall not in any way
   contract a spiritual relationship; any constitutions that tend to the
   contrary notwithstanding. If through the fault or negligence of the
   parish priest any thing be done contrary hereto, he shall be punished,
   at the discretion of the Ordinary. That relationship, in like manner,
   which is contracted by confirmation shall not pass beyond him who
   confirms the person confirmed, his father and mother, and him who
   places his hand on him; all impediments arising from this kind of
   spiritual relationship between other persons being utterly set aside.
   CHAPTER III.
   The impediment of public honesty is confined within certain limits.
   The holy Synod entirely removes the impediment of justice arising from
   public honesty, whensoever espousals shall be, for whatsoever cause,
   not valid; but, when they are valid, the impediment shall not extend
   beyond the first degree; forasmuch as any such prohibition can no
   longer be observed, without injury, in more remote degrees.
   CHAPTER IV.
   Affinity arising from fornication is confined to the second degree.
   Moreover, the holy Synod, moved by the same and other most weighty
   reasons, limits, to those only who are connected in the first and
   second degree, the impediment contracted by affinity arising from
   fornication, and which dissolves the marriage that may have been
   afterwards contracted. It ordains [Page 201] that, as regards degrees
   more remote, this kind of affinity does not dissolve the marriage that
   may have been afterwards contracted.
   CHAPTER V.
   No one is to marry within the prohibited degrees: in what manner
   dispensation is to be granted therein.
   If any one shall presume knowingly to contract marriage within the
   prohibited degrees, he shall be separated, and be without hope of
   obtaining a dispensation; and this shall much the rather have effect in
   regard of him who shall have dared not only to contract such a
   marriage, but also to consummate it. But if he have done this in
   ignorance, but yet has neglected the solemnities required in
   contracting matrimony, he shall be subjected to the same penalties. For
   he who has rashly despised the wholesome precepts of the Church, is not
   worthy to experience without difficulty her bounty. But if, having
   observed those solemnities, some secret impediment be afterwards
   discovered, of which it was not unlikely that he should be ignorant, he
   may in this case more easily obtain a dispensation, and that
   gratuitously. As regards marriages to be contracted, either no
   dispensation at all shall be granted, or rarely, and then for a cause,
   and gratuitously. A dispensation shall never be granted in the second
   degree, except between great princes, and for a public cause.
   CHAPTER VI.
   Punishments inflicted on Abductors.
   The holy Synod ordains, that no marriage can subsist between the
   abducer and her who is abducted, so long as she shall remain in the
   power of the abducer. But if she that has been [Page 202] abducted,
   being separated from the abducer, and being in a safe and free place,
   shall consent to have him for her husband, the abducer may have her for
   his wife; but nevertheless the abduced himself and all who lent him
   advice, aid, and countenance, shall be ipso jure excommunicated, for
   ever infamous, and incapable of all dignities; and if they be clerics
   they shall forfeit their rank. The abducer shall furthermore be bound,
   whether he marry the person abducted, or marry her not, to settle on
   her a handsome dowry at the discretion of the judge.
   CHAPTER VII.
   Vagrants are to be married with caution.
   There are many persons who are vagrants, having no settled homes; and,
   being of a profligate character, they, after abandoning their first
   wife, marry another, and very often several in different places, during
   the life-time of the first. The holy Synod, being desirous to obviate
   this disorder, gives this fatherly admonition to all whom it may
   concern, not easily to admit this class of vagrants to marriage; and It
   also exhorts the civil magistrates to punish such persons severely. But
   It commands parish priests not to be present at the marriages of such
   persons, unless they have first made a careful inquiry, and, having
   reported the circumstance to the Ordinary, they shall have obtained
   permission from him for so doing.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   Concubinage is severely punished.
   It is a grievous sin for unmarried men to have concubines; but it is a
   most grievous sin, and one committed in special contempt of this great
   sacrament, for married men also to live in this state of damnation, and
   to have the audacity at times to [Page 203] maintain and keep them at
   their own homes even with their own wives. Wherefore, the holy Synod,
   that it may by suitable remedies provide against this exceeding evil,
   ordains that these concubinaries, whether unmarried or married, of
   whatsoever state, dignity, and condition they may be, if, after having
   been three times admonished on this subject by the Ordinary, even ex
   officio, they shall not have put away their concubines, and have
   separated themselves from all connexion with them, they shall be
   smitten with excommunication; from which they shall not be absolved
   until they have really obeyed the admonition given them. But if,
   regardless of this censure, they shall continue in concubinage during a
   year, they shall be proceeded against with severity by the Ordinary,
   according to the character of the crime. Women, whether married or
   single, who publicly live with adulterers or with concubinaries, if,
   after having been three times admonished, they shall not obey, shall be
   rigorously punished, according to the measure of their guilt, by the
   Ordinaries of the places, ex officio, even though not called upon to do
   so by any one; and they shall be cast forth from the city or diocese,
   if the Ordinaries shall think fit, calling in the aid of the Secular
   arm, if need be; the other penalties inflicted on adulterers and
   concubinaries remaining in their full force.
   CHAPTER IX.
   Temporal lords, or magistrates, shall not attempt anything contrary to
   the liberty of marriage.
   Earthly affections and desires do for the most part so blind the eyes
   of the understanding of temporal lords and magistrates, as that, by
   threats and ill-usage, they compel both men and women, who live under
   their jurisdiction,-especially such as are rich, or who have
   expectations of a great inheritance,-to contract marriage against their
   inclination with those whom the said lords or magistrates may prescribe
   unto them. Wherefore, seeing that it is a thing especially execrable to
   violate the liberty of matrimony, and that wrong comes from those from
   whom right is looked for, the holy Synod enjoins on all, of [Page 204]
   whatsoever grade, dignity, and condition they may be, under pain of
   anathema to be ipso facto incurred, that they put no constraint, in any
   way whatever, either directly or indirectly, on those subject to them,
   or any others whomsoever, so as to hinder them from freely contracting
   marriage.
   CHAPTER X.
   The solemnities of marriage are prohibited at certain times.
   The holy Synod enjoins, that the ancient prohibitions of solemn
   nuptials be carefully observed by all, from the Advent of our Lord
   Jesus Christ until the day of the Epiphany, and from Ash-Wednesday
   until the octave of Easter inclusively; but at other times It allows
   marriage to be solemnly celebrated; and the bishops shall take care
   that they be conducted with becoming modesty and propriety: for
   marriage is a holy thing, and is to be treated in a holy manner.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION
   The same sacred and holy Synod, prosecuting the subject of Reformation,
   ordains that the things following be established in the present
   Session.
   CHAPTER I.
   The manner of proceeding to the creation of Bishops and Cardinals.
   If, as regards all manner of degrees in the Church, a provident and
   enlightened care is to be taken, that in the house of the Lord there be
   nothing disorderly, nothing unseemly; much more ought we to strive that
   no error be committed in the election of him who is constituted above
   all those degrees. [Page 205] For the state and order of the whole
   household of the Lord will totter, if what is required in the body be
   not found in the head. For which cause, although the holy Synod has
   elsewhere usefully ordained certain things touching those who are to be
   promoted to cathedral and superior churches, yet doth it account this
   office to be of such a nature, as that were it to be pondered upon in
   proportion to its greatness, there would never seem to have been
   caution enough taken. Wherefore It ordains, that, as soon as a church
   shall become vacant, processions, and prayers shall be made in public
   and private; and such shall be enjoined, by the Chapter, throughout the
   city and diocese; that thereby both clergy and people may be enabled to
   obtain from God a good pastor.
   And as regards all and each of those who have, in any way, any right
   from the Apostolic See, or who otherwise have a part, in the promotion
   of those to be set over the churches; the holy Synod,-without making
   any change herein, from a consideration of the circumstances of the
   present time,-exhorts and admonishes them, that they above all things
   bear in mind that they cannot do anything more conducive to the glory
   of God, and the salvation of the people, than to study to promote good
   pastors, and such as are capable of governing a church; and that they
   sin mortally, becoming partakers in others' sins, unless they carefully
   endeavour that those be promoted whom they themselves judge the most
   worthy of, and useful to, the church, not guided by entreaties, or
   human affection, or the solicitations of pretenders, but by what the
   merits of the individuals require at their hands; and seeing that they
   be persons whom they know to have been born in lawful wedlock, and who,
   by their life, learning, and in all other qualifications, are such as
   are required by the sacred canons, and by the decrees of this Synod of
   Trent.
   And forasmuch as, by reason of the diversity of nations, peoples, and
   customs, a uniform system cannot be followed everywhere, in receiving
   the grave and competent testimony of [Page 206] good and learned men on
   the subject of the aforesaid qualifications, the holy Synod ordains,
   that, in a provincial Synod, to be held by the metropolitan, there
   shall be prescribed for each place and province a proper form of
   examination, scrutiny, or information, such as shall seem to be most
   useful and suitable for the said places, which form is to be submitted
   to the approval of the most holy Roman Pontiff; yet so, however, that,
   after that this examination, or scrutiny, as regards the persons to be
   promoted, shall have been completed, it shall, after being reduced into
   the form of a public document, be necessarily transmitted, as soon as
   possible, with all the attestations and with the profession of faith
   made by the individual to be promoted, to the most holy Roman Pontiff,
   in order that the said Sovereign Pontiff, having a full knowledge of
   the whole matter and of the persons, may, for the advantage of the
   Lord's flock, in a most useful manner provide those churches therewith,
   if they shall have been found, by the examination or scrutiny, suitable
   persons. And all the scrutinies, informations, attestations, and proofs
   of whatsoever kind, and by whomsoever made, even though in the Roman
   court, touching the qualifications of the person to be promoted, shall
   be carefully examined by a cardinal-who shall report thereon to the
   consistory-aided therein by three other cardinals; and the said report
   shall be authenticated by the signature of the cardinal who drew up the
   report, and of the three other cardinals; and therein each of the four
   cardinals shall make affirmation that, after giving exact attention
   thereto, he has found the persons to be promoted, endowed with the
   qualifications required by law, and by this holy Synod, and that, at
   the peril of his eternal salvation, he doth certainly think them fit to
   be placed over the churches: in such wise that, after the report has
   been made in one consistory, the sentence shall be deferred until
   another consistory, in order that the said inquiry may be more maturely
   looked into in the mean time,-unless the most blessed Pontiff shall
   judge it expedient to act otherwise.
   [Page 207] And the Synod ordains, that all and singular the particulars
   which have been elsewhere ordained, in the same Synod, touching the
   life, age, learning, and the other qualifications of those who are to
   be appointed bishops, the same are also to be required in the creation
   of cardinals-even though they be deacons -of the holy Roman Church;
   whom the most holy Roman Pontiff shall, as far as it can be
   conveniently done, select out of all the nations of Christendom, as he
   shall find persons suitable.
   Finally, the same holy Synod, moved by the so many most grievous
   afflictions of the Church, cannot avoid recording, that nothing is more
   necessary for the Church of God than that the most blessed Roman
   Pontiff apply especially here that solicitude, which, by the duty of
   his office, he owes to the Universal Church,-that he take unto himself,
   to wit as cardinals, persons the most select only, and that he appoint
   over each church, above all things, good and fit pastors; and this the
   more, for that our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the
   blood of those sheep of Christ which shall perish through the evil
   government of pastors who are negligent, and forgetful of their
   office.
   CHAPTER II.
   A Provincial Synod to be celebrated every third year, a Diocesan Synod
   every year: who are to convoke, and who to be present thereat.
   Provincial councils, wheresoever they have been omitted, shall be
   renewed, for the regulating of morals, the correcting of excesses, the
   composing of controversies, and for the other purposes allowed of by
   the sacred canons. Therefore, the metropolitans in person, or if they
   be lawfully hindered, the oldest suffragan bishop shall not fail to
   assemble a Synod, each in his own province, within a year at latest
   from the termination of the present council, and afterwards, at least
   every third year, [Page 208] either after the octave of the
   Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, or at some other more convenient
   time, according to the custom of the province; at which council all the
   bishops and others, who, by right or custom, ought to be present
   thereat, shall be absolutely bound to assemble, those excepted who
   would have to cross the sea at their imminent peril. The bishops of the
   province shall not, for the future, be compelled, under the pretext of
   any custom whatsoever, to repair against their will to the metropolitan
   church. Those bishops likewise who are not subject to any archbishop,
   shall once for all make choice of some neighbouring metropolitan, at
   whose provincial Synod they shall be bound to be present with the other
   bishops, and shall observe, and cause to be observed, whatsoever shall
   be therein ordained. In all other respects, their exemption and
   privileges shall remain whole and entire.
   Diocesan Synods also shall be celebrated every year; to which all those
   even who are exempted, but who would otherwise, that exemption ceasing,
   have to attend, and who are not subject to general Chapters, shall be
   bound to come; understanding however that, on account of parochial, or
   other Secular churches, even though annexed, those who have charge
   thereof must needs, whosoever they may be, be present at the said
   Synod. But if any, whether metropolitans, or bishops, or the others
   above-named, shall be negligent in these matters, they shall incur the
   penalties enacted by the sacred canons.
   CHAPTER III.
   In what manner Prelates are to make their visitation.
   Patriarchs, primates, metropolitans, and bishops shall not fail to
   visit their respective dioceses, either personally, or, if they be
   lawfully hindered, by their Vicar-general, or visitor; if they shall
   not be able on account of its extent, to make the visitation of the
   whole annually, they shall visit at least the greater part thereof, so
   that the whole shall be completed in two years, [Page 209] either by
   themselves, or by their visitors. Metropolitans, however, even after
   having made a complete visitation of their own proper diocese, shall
   not visit the cathedral churches, or the dioceses of the bishops of
   their province, except for a cause taken cognizance and approved of in
   the provincial Council.
   But archdeacons, deans, and other inferiors, who have been hitherto
   accustomed lawfully to exercise (the power of) visitation in certain
   churches, shall henceforth visit those same places, but by themselves
   only, with the consent of the bishop, and assisted by a notary. The
   visitors also who may be deputed by a Chapter, where the Chapter has
   the right of visitation, shall be first approved of by the bishop; but
   the bishop, or, if he be hindered, his visitor, shall not thereby be
   prevented from visiting those same churches apart from those deputies;
   and the said archdeacons, and other inferiors, shall be bound to give
   the bishop an account, within a month, of the visitation that has been
   made, and to show him the depositions of witnesses, and the proceedings
   in their entire form; any custom, even though immemorial, and any
   exemptions and privileges whatsoever notwithstanding.
   But the principle object of all these visitations shall be to lead to
   sound and orthodox doctrine, by banishing heresies; to maintain good
   morals, and to correct such as are evil; to animate the people, by
   exhortations and admonitions, to religion, peacefulness, and innocence;
   and to establish such other things as to the prudence of the visitors
   shall seem for the profit of the faithful, according as time, place and
   opportunity shall allow. And to the end that all this may have a more
   easy and prosperous issue, all and each of the aforesaid, to whom the
   right of visitation belongs, are admonished to treat all persons with
   fatherly love and Christian zeal; and with this view being content with
   a modest train of servants and horses, they shall endeavour to complete
   the said visitation as speedily as possible, though with due
   carefulness. And during it they shall be careful not to be troublesome
   or burthensome to any one by any useless expenses; and neither they,
   nor any of theirs, shall, by way of agency fee for the visitation, or,
   on account of wills made for pious uses--except that which is of right
   due to them out of [Page 210] pious bequests--or under any other name
   whatsoever, receive anything, be it money, or present, of whatsoever
   kind, or in whatsoever way offered; any custom, even though immemorial,
   to the contrary notwithstanding; with the exception, however, of food,
   which shall be furnished frugally and in moderation to them and theirs,
   only during the time necessary for the visitation, and no longer. It
   shall, however, be at the option of those who are visited, to pay, if
   they prefer it, in money, according to a fixed assessment, what they
   have been accustomed heretofore to disburse, or to furnish the food as
   aforesaid; saving also the right of ancient conventions entered into
   with monasteries, or other pious places, or churches not parochial,
   which right shall remain inviolate. But, in those places or provinces,
   where it is the custom that neither food, money, nor anything else be
   received by the visitors, but that all be done gratuitously, the same
   shall be retained there.
   But if any one, which God forbid, shall presume to receive anything
   more than is prescribed in any of the cases above-named; besides the
   restitution of double the amount which is to be made within a month, he
   shall also be subjected, without any hope of pardon, to the other
   penalties contained in the constitution of the general Councils of
   Lyons, which begins, Exigit; as also to the other penalties (which
   shall be enacted) in the provincial Synod, at the discretion of that
   Synod.
   As regards patrons, they shall not presume in any way to interfere in
   those things which regard the administration of the sacraments; neither
   shall they meddle with the visitation of the ornaments of the church,
   or its revenues arising from landed property, or from buildings,
   excepting so far as they are competent to do this by the institution,
   or foundation; but the bishops themselves shall attend to these things,
   and shall take care that the revenues of those buildings be expended
   upon purposes necessary and useful for the church, as to them shall
   seem most expedient.
   [Page 211]
   CHAPTER IV.
   By whom, and when, the office of preaching is to be discharged: the
   Parish Church to be frequented in order to hear the word of God. No one
   shall preach in opposition to the will of the Bishop.
   The holy Synod, desirous that the office of preaching, which peculiarly
   belongs to bishops, may be exercised as frequently as possible, for the
   welfare of the faithful, and accommodating more aptly to the use of the
   present times, the canons elsewhere set forth on this subject, under
   Paul III., of happy memory, ordains, that the bishops shall themselves
   in person, each in his own church, announce the sacred Scriptures and
   the devine law, or if lawfully hindered, it shall be done by those whom
   they shall appoint to the office of preaching; and in the other
   churches by the parish priests, or, if they be hindered, by others to
   be deputed by the bishop, whether it be in the city, or in any other
   part whatsoever of the diocese wherein they shall judge such preaching
   expedient, at the charge of those who are bound, or who are accustomed,
   to defray it, and this at least on all Lord's Days and solemn
   festivals; but, during the season of the fasts, of Lent and of the
   Advent of the Lord, daily, or at least on three days in the week, if
   the said bishop shall deem it needful; and, at other times, as often as
   they shall judge that it can be opportunely done. And the bishop shall
   diligently admonish the people, that each one is bound to be present at
   his own parish church, where it can be conveniently done, to hear the
   word of God. But no one, whether Secular or Regular, shall presume to
   preach, even in churches of his own order, in opposition to the will of
   the bishop.
   The said bishops shall also take care, that, at least on the Lord's
   Days and other festivals, the children in every parish be carefully
   taught the rudiments of the faith, and obedience towards [Page 212] God
   and their parents, by those whose duty it is, and who shall be
   constrained thereunto by their bishops, if need be, even by
   ecclesiastical censures; any privileges and customs notwithstanding. In
   other respects, those things decreed, under the said Paul III.,
   concerning the office of preaching, shall have their full force.
   CHAPTER V.
   In criminal causes against Bishops, the greater causes shall be taken
   cognizance of by the Sovereign Pontiff only, the less by the Provincial
   Council.
   The more grave criminal causes against bishops, even of heresy-which
   may God forfend-which merit deposition or deprivation, shall be taken
   cognizance of and decided by the Sovereign Roman Pontiff himself only.
   But if the cause shall be of such a nature that it must necessarily be
   committed out of the Roman Court, it shall not be committed to any
   others soever, but metropolitans, or bishops, to be chosen by the most
   blessed Pope. And this commission shall both be special, and shall be
   signed by the most holy Pontiff's own hand; nor shall he ever grant
   more to those commissioners than this,-that they take information only
   of the fact, and draw up the process, which they shall immediately
   transmit to the Roman Pontiff; the definitive sentence being reserved
   to the said most holy Pontiff.
   The other things hereupon elsewhere decreed, under Julius III., of
   happy memory, as also the constitution published in a general Council
   under Innocent III., which begins, Qualiter et quando, which
   constitution the holy Synod renews in this present decree, shall be
   observed by all.
   But the less criminal causes of bishops shall be taken cognizance of
   and decided in the provincial Council only, or by persons deputed
   thereunto by the provincial Council.
   [Page 213]
   CHAPTER VI.
   When and how the Bishop may absolve from crime, and dispense in cases
   of irregularity and suspension.
   It shall be lawful for the bishop to dispense in all manner of
   irregularities and suspensions, arising from a crime that is
   secret,-except that proceeding from wilful homicide, and those crimes
   which have been already carried before a legal tribunal; -and (it shall
   be lawful for them), in their own diocese, either by themselves, or by
   a vicar to be deputed especially for that purpose, to absolve
   gratuitously, as far as the tribunal of the conscience is concerned,
   after imposing a salutary penance, all delinquents whatsoever their
   subjects, in all cases whatsoever that are secret, even though reserved
   to the Apostolic See. The same also, as regards the crime of heresy,
   shall be permitted them in the said court of conscience, but to them
   only, and not to their vicars.
   CHAPTER VII.
   The virtue of the Sacraments shall, before being administered to the
   people, be explained by Bishops and Parish Priests; during the
   solemnization of mass, the sacred oracles shall be explained.
   In order that the faithful people may approach to the reception of the
   sacraments with greater reverence and devotion of mind, the holy Synod
   enjoins on all bishops, that, not only when they are themselves about
   to administer them to the people, they shall first explain, in a manner
   suited to the capacity of those who receive them, the efficacy and use
   of those sacraments, but shall endeavour that the same be done piously
   and prudently [Page 214] by every parish priest; and this even in the
   vernacular tongue, if need be, and it can be conveniently done; and in
   accordance with the form which will be prescribed for each of the
   sacraments, by the holy Synod, in a catechism which the bishops shall
   take care to have faithfully translated into the vulgar tongue, and to
   have expounded to the people by all parish priests; as also that,
   during the solemnization of mass, or the celebration of the divine
   offices, they explain, in the said vulgar tongue, on all festivals, or
   solemnities, the sacred oracles, and the maxims of salvation; and that,
   setting aside all unprofitable questions, they endeavour to impress
   them on the hearts of all, and to instruct them in the law of the
   Lord.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   On public sinners, a public penance shall be imposed, unless the Bishop
   shall determine otherwise: a Penitentiary to be instituted in Cathedral
   Churches.
   The apostle admonishes that those who sin publicly are to be reproved
   openly. When, therefore, any one has, publicly and in the sight of
   many, committed a crime, whereby there is no doubt that others have
   been offended and scandalized; there must needs be publicly imposed
   upon him a penance suitable to the measure of his guilt; that so those
   whom he has allured to evil manners by his example, he may bring back
   to an upright life by the testimony of his amendment. The bishop,
   however, may, when he judges it more expedient, commute this kind of
   public penance into one that is secret. Likewise, in all cathedral
   churches, where it can be conveniently done, the bishop shall appoint a
   penitentiary, annexing thereto the prebend that shall next become
   vacant, which penitentiary shall be a master, or doctor, or licentiate
   in theology, or in canon law, and forty years of age, or otherwise one
   who shall be found more suitable [Page 215] considering the character
   of the place; and, whilst hearing confessions in the church, he shall
   be meanwhile reputed as present in choir.
   CHAPTER IX.
   By whom Secular Churches, not of any diocese, are to be visited.
   Those things which have elsewhere been established by this same
   Council, under Paul III., of happy memory, and lately under our most
   blessed lord Pius IV., touching the diligence to be used by the
   Ordinaries in visiting benefices, even though exempted, the same shall
   also be observed in regard of those Secular churches which are said to
   be in no one's diocese; to wit they shall be visited by the bishop-as
   the delegate of the Apostolic See-whose cathedral church is the
   nearest, if he be able to do so; otherwise, by him whom the prelate of
   the said place has once for all selected in the provincial Council;-any
   privileges and customs whatsoever, even though immemorial, to the
   contrary notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER X.
   Where visitation and correction of morals are concerned, no suspension
   of decrees is allowed.
   Bishops, that they may be the better able to keep the people whom they
   rule in duty and obedience, shall, in all those things which regard
   visitation and correction of manners, have the right and power, even as
   delegates of the Apostolic See, of ordaining, regulating, correcting,
   and executing, in accordance with the enactments of the canons, those
   things which, in their prudence, shall seem to them necessary for the
   amendment of their subjects, and for the good of their respective
   dioceses. Nor herein, when visitation and correction of manners are
   concerned, shall any exemption, or any inhibition, or appeal, or
   complaint, even though interposed to the Apostolic See, in any way
   hinder, or suspend the execution of those things which shall have been
   by them enjoined, decreed, or adjudged.
   [Page 216]
   CHAPTER XI.
   Honorary titles, or particular privileges, shall not derogate in any
   way from the right of bishops.
   Forasmuch as the privileges and exemptions which, under various titles,
   are granted to very many persons, are clearly seen to raise, in these
   days, confusion in the jurisdiction of bishops, and to give occasion to
   those exempted to lead a more relaxed life; the holy Synod ordains,
   that if at any time it be thought proper, for just, weighty, and well
   nigh compulsory causes, that certain persons be distinguished by the
   honorary titles of Protonotary, Acolyte, Count Palatine, Royal
   Chaplain, or other such titles of distinction, whether in the Roman
   court or elsewhere; as also that others be admitted into monasteries as
   Oblates, or as attached thereunto in some other way, or under the name
   of servants to military orders, monasteries, hospitals, colleges, or
   under any other title whatsoever; nothing is to be understood as being,
   by these privileges, taken away from the Ordinaries, so as to prevent
   those persons, unto whom those privileges have already been granted, or
   to whom they may be hereafter conceded, from being fully subject in all
   things to the said Ordinaries, as delegates of the Apostolic See, and
   this as regards Royal Chaplains, in accordance with the constitution of
   Innocent III., which begins Cum capella: those persons, however, being
   excepted, who are engaged in actual service in the aforesaid places, or
   in military orders, and who reside within their enclosures and houses,
   and live under obedience to them; as also those who have made their
   profession lawfully and according to the rules of the said military
   orders, whereof the Ordinary must be certified: notwithstanding any
   privileges what soever, even those of the order of Saint John of
   Jerusalem, and of other military orders. But, as regards those
   privileges which by virtue of the constitution of Eugenius, those are
   accustomed to enjoy who reside in the Roman Court, or who are in the
   household of cardinals, such privileges shall in no wise be understood
   to apply to those who hold ecclesiastical benefices, in so [Page 217]
   far as those benefices are concerned; but such shall continue subject
   to the jurisdiction of the Ordinary; any inhibitions to the contrary
   notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER XII.
   What manner of persons those ought to be who are to be promoted to the
   dignities and canonries of Cathedral Churches: and what those so
   promoted are bound to perform.
   Whereas dignities, especially in cathedral churches, were established
   to preserve and increase ecclesiastical discipline, with the view that
   those who should obtain them, might be pre-eminent in piety, be an
   example to others, and aid the bishop by their exertions and services;
   it is but right, that those who are called unto those dignities, should
   be such as to be able to answer the purposes of their office.
   Wherefore, no one shall henceforth be promoted to any dignities
   whatsoever, to which the cure of souls is attached, who has not
   attained at least to the twenty-fifth year of his age, and, having been
   exercised for some time in the clerical order, is recommended by the
   learning necessary for the discharge of his office, and by integrity of
   morals, conformably to the constitution of Alexander III., promulgated
   in the Council of Lateran, which begins, Cum in cunctis.
   In like manner archdeacons, who are called the eyes of the bishop,
   shall, in all churches, where it is possible, be masters in theology,
   or doctors or licentiates in canon law. But, to the other dignities or
   personates, to which no cure of souls is attached, clerics shall be
   promoted, who are in other respects qualified, and who are not less
   than twenty-two years of age. Those also who are promoted to any
   benefices whatsoever having cure of souls, shall, within two months at
   the latest from the day of obtaining possession, be bound to make a
   public profession of their orthodox faith in the presence of the bishop
   [Page 218] himself, or, if he be hindered, before his Vicar-general, or
   official; and shall promise and swear, that they will continue in
   obedience to the Roman Church. But those who are promoted to canonries
   and dignities in cathedral churches, shall be bound to do this not only
   before the bishop, or his official, but also in the Chapter; otherwise
   all those promoted as aforesaid shall not render the fruits theirs; nor
   shall possession avail them anything. No one shall henceforth be
   received to a dignity, canonry, or portion, but one who has either
   already been admitted to that sacred order which that dignity, prebend,
   or portion requires, or is of such an age as to be capable of being
   admitted to that order, within the time prescribed by law and by this
   holy Synod. As regards all cathedral churches, all canonries and
   portions shall be attached to the order of the priesthood, deaconship,
   or subdeaconship; and the bishop, with the advice of the Chapter, shall
   designate and apportion, as he shall judge expedient, to which thereof
   each of those respective sacred orders is for the future to be annexed;
   in such wise, however, that one half at least shall be priests, and the
   rest deacons, or subdeacons: but where the more praiseworthy custom
   requires, that the greater part, or that all be priests, it shall be by
   all means retained. Moreover, the holy Synod exhorts that, in provinces
   where it can conveniently be done, all the dignities, and one half at
   least of the canonries, in cathedral and eminent collegiate churches,
   be conferred only on masters, or doctors, or even on licentiates in
   theology, or canon law. Furthermore, it shall not be lawful, by virtue
   of any manner of statute or custom whatsoever, for those who possess,
   in the said cathedral or collegiate churches, any dignities, canonries,
   prebends, or portions, to be absent from those churches, above three
   months in each year-saving, however, the constitutions of those
   churches which require a longer term of service-otherwise every
   offender shall, for the first year, be deprived of onehalf of the
   fruits which he has made his own by reason even of his prebend and
   residence. But, if he be again guilty of the same negligence, he shall
   be deprived of all the fruits which he may have acquired during that
   same year: and, the contumacy increasing, they shall be proceeded
   against according to the con-[Page 219] stitutions of the sacred
   canons. As regards the distributions; those who have been present at
   the stated hours shall receive them; all others shall, all collusion
   and remission set aside, forfeit them, pursuant to the decree of
   Boniface VIII., which begins, Consuetudinem, which the holy Synod
   brings again into use; any statutes, or customs, whatsoever, to the
   contrary notwithstanding. And all shall be obliged to perform the
   divine offices in person, and not by substitutes; as also to attend on
   and serve the bishop when celebrating (mass), or performing any other
   pontifical functions; and reverently, distinctly, and devoutly to
   praise the name of God, in hymns and canticles, in the choir appointed
   for psalmody.
   They shall, moreover, at all times wear a becoming dress, both in and
   out of church; shall abstain from unlawful hunting, hawking, dancing,
   taverns, and gaines; and be distinguished for such integrity of
   manners, as that they may with justice be called the senate of the
   Church. As to other matters, regarding the suitable manner of
   conducting the divine offices, the proper way of singing or chanting
   therein, the specific regulations for assembling in choir and for
   remaining there, as also such things as may be necessary in regard of
   all those who minister in the church, and any other things of the like
   kind; the provincial Synod shall prescribe a fixed form on each Head,
   having regard to the utility and habits of each province. But, in the
   mean time, the bishop, assisted by not less than two canons, one of
   whom shall be chosen by the bishop, and the other by the Chapter, shall
   have power to provide herein as may be judged expedient.
   CHAPTER XIII.
   In what manner provision is to be made for the more slightly endowed
   Cathedral and Parish Churches: Parishes are to be distinguished by
   certain boundaries.
   Forasmuch as very many cathedral churches have so slight a revenue, and
   are so small, that they by no means correspond with the episcopal
   dignity, nor suffice for the necessities of the churches; the
   provincial Council, having summoned those whose [Page 220] interests
   are concerned, shall examine and weigh with care, what churches it may
   be expedient, on account of their small extent, and their poverty, to
   unite to others in the neighbourhood, or to augment with fresh
   revenues; and shall send the documents prepared in regard thereof to
   the Sovereign Roman Pontiff; who, being thereby made acquainted with
   the matter, shall, of his own prudence, as he may judge expedient,
   either unite together the slightly provided churches, or improve them
   by some augmentation derived from the fruits. But in the meantime,
   until the things aforesaid are carried into effect, the Sovereign
   Pontiff may provide, out of certain benefices, for those bishops who,
   on account of the poverty of their dioceses, stand in need of being
   aided by certain fruits; provided however those benefices be not cures,
   nor dignities, canonries, prebends, nor monasteries wherein regular
   observance is in force, or which are subject to general Chapters, or to
   certain visitors.
   In parish churches also, the fruits of which are in like manner so
   slight that they are not sufficient to meet the necessary charges, the
   bishop,-if unable to provide for the exigency by a union of benefices,
   not however those belonging to Regulars,-shall make it his care, that,
   by the assignment of first fruits, or tithes, or by the contributions
   and collections of the parishioners, or in some other way that shall
   seem to him more suitable, as much be amassed as may decently suffice
   for the necessities of the rector and of the parish.
   But in whatsoever unions may have to be made, whether for the causes
   aforesaid, or for others, parish churches shall not be united to any
   monasteries whatever, or abbeys, or dignities, or prebends of a
   cathedral or collegiate church, or to any other simple benefices,
   hospitals, or military orders; and those so united shall be again taken
   cognizance of by the Ordinaries, pursuant to the decree already made in
   this same Synod, under Paul III., of happy memory, which shall also be
   equally observed in regard of those unions that have been made from
   that time forth to the present; notwithstanding whatsoever form of
   words may have been used therein, which shall be accounted as being
   sufficiently expressed here.
   Furthermore, all those cathedral churches, the revenue of which, [Page
   221] in real annual value, does not exceed the sum of one thousand
   ducats, and those parish churches where it does not exceed the sum of
   one hundred ducats, shall not for the future be burthened with any
   manner of pensions, or reservations of fruits. Also, in those cities
   and places where the parish churches have not any certain boundaries,
   neither have the rectors thereof their own proper people to govern, but
   administer the sacraments to all indiscriminately who desire them, the
   holy Synod enjoins on bishops, that for the greater security of the
   salvation of the souls committed to their charge, having divided the
   people into fixed and proper parishes, they shall assign to each parish
   its own perpetual and peculiar parish priest who may know his own
   parishioners, and from whom alone they may licitly receive the
   sacraments; or the bishops shall make such other provision as may be
   more beneficial, according as the character of the place may require.
   They shall also take care, that the same be done, as soon as possible,
   in those cities and places where there are no parish churches: any
   privileges aind customs, even though immemorial, to the contrary
   notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER XIV.
   In promotions to benefices, or in admissions into possession of the
   same, any deductions from the fruits, not applied to pious uses, are
   prohibited.
   In many churches, as well cathedral as collegiate and parochial, it is
   understood to be the practice, derived either from the constitutions
   thereof, or from an evil custom, that upon any election, presentation,
   institution, confirmation, collation, or other provision, or upon
   admission to the possession of any cathedral church, benefice,
   canonries, or prebends, or to a participation in the revenues, or the
   daily distributions, there are introduced certain conditions, or
   deductions from the fruits, certain payments, promises, unlawful
   compensations, as also the profits which are in some churches called
   Turnorum lucra; and [Page 222] whereas the holy Synod detests these
   practices, It enjoins on bishops, that they suffer not anything of the
   kind to be done, unless the proceeds be converted to pious uses, nor
   permit any of those modes of entering (on benefices) which carry with
   them a suspicion of a simoniacal taint, or of sordid avarice; and they
   shall themselves carefully take cognizance of their constitutions, or
   customs in the above regards; and, those only being retained which they
   shall approve of as laudable, the rest they shall reject and abolish as
   corrupt and scandalous. And It decrees that those, who act in any way
   contrary to the things comprised in this present decree, incur the
   penalties set forth against simoniacs by the sacred canons, and divers
   constitutions of the Sovereign Pontiffs, all of which this Synod
   renews; any statutes, constitutions, customs, even though immemorial,
   even though confirmed by apostolic authority, to the contrary
   notwithstanding; the bishop, as the delegate of the Apostolic See,
   having power to take cognizance of any surreption, obreption, or defect
   of intention, in regard thereof.
   CHAPTER XV.
   Method of increasing the slight prebends of Cathedral, and of eminent
   Collegiate Churches.
   In cathedral, and eminent collegiate, churches, where the prebends are
   numerous, and so small, that, even with the daily distributions, they
   are not sufficient for the decent maintenance of the rank of the
   canons, according to the character of the place, and of the persons, it
   shall be lawful for the bishop, with the consent of the Chapter, either
   to unite thereunto certain simple benefices, not however such as belong
   to Regulars, or, if a provision cannot be made in this way, they may
   reduce those prebends to a less number, by suppressing some of
   them,-with the consent of the patron, if the right of patronage belong
   to laymen,-the fruits and proceeds of which shall be applied towards
   the daily distributions of the remaining prebends; yet so, however,
   that such a number shall be left as may conveniently serve for the
   celebration of divine worship, [Page 223] and be suitable to the
   dignity of the church; any constitutions and privileges whatsoever, or
   any reservation whether general or special, or any application
   whatever, to the contrary notwithstanding: nor shall the aforesaid
   unions or suppressions be set aside or hindered by any manner of
   provision whatsoever, not even by virtue of any resignation, or by any
   other derogations, or suspensions whatever.
   CHAPTER XVI.
   What duty devolves on the Chapter during the vacancy of a See.
   When a See is vacant, the Chapter, in those places where the duty of
   receiving the fruits devolves upon it, shall appoint one or more
   faithful and diligent stewards to take care of the property and
   revenues of the church, of which they shall afterwards give an account
   to him whom it may regard. It shall also be absolutely bound, within
   eight days after the decease of the bishop, to appoint an official, or
   vicar, or to confirm the one who fills that office; who shall at least
   be a doctor, or a licentiate, of canon law, or otherwise as competent a
   person as can be procured: if anything be done contrary hereto, the
   appointment aforesaid shall devolve on the metropolitan. And if the
   church be itself the metropolitan, or exempted, and the Chapter shall
   be, as has been said above, negligent, then shall the oldest of the
   suffragan bishops in that metropolitan church, and the nearest bishop
   in regard of that church that is exempted, have power to appoint a
   competent steward and vicar. And the bishop, who is promoted to the
   said vacant church, shall demand, from the said steward, vicar, and all
   other officers and administrators, who, during the vacancy of the See,
   were, by the Chapter, or others, appointed in his room,-even though
   they should belong to the Chapter itself,-an account of those things
   which concern him, of their functions, jurisdiction, administration, or
   of any other their charge whatsoever; and shall have [Page 224] power
   to punish those who have been guilty of any delinquency in their office
   or administration, even though the officers aforesaid, having given in
   their accounts, may have obtained a quittance or discharge from the
   Chapter, or those deputed thereby. The Chapter shall also be bound to
   render an account to the said bishop of any papers belonging to the
   church, if any such have come into the possession thereof.
   CHAPTER XVII.
   In what case it is lawful to confer more than one benefice upon one
   individual; and for him to retain the same.
   Whereas ecclesiastical order is perverted when one cleric fills the
   offices of several, the sacred canons have holily provided that no one
   ought to be enrolled in two churches. But, seeing that many, through
   the passion of ungodly covetousness deceiving themselves, not God, are
   not ashamed to elude, by various artifices, what has been so
   excellently ordained, and to hold several benefices at the same time;
   the holy Synod, desiring to restore the discipline required for the
   government of the church, doth by this present decree,-which It orders
   to be observed in regard of all persons whatsoever, by whatsoever title
   distinguished, even though it be by the dignity of the
   Cardinalate,-ordain, that, for the future, one ecclesiastical benefice
   only shall be conferred on one and the same person. If indeed that
   benefice be not sufficient to afford a decent livelihood to the person
   on whom it is conferred, it shall then be lawful to bestow on him some
   other simple benefice that may be sufficient; provided that both do not
   require personal residence. And the above shall apply not only to
   cathedral churches, but also to all other benefices whatsoever, whether
   Secular or Regular, even to those held in commendam, of whatsoever
   title and quality they may be. But they who at present hold several
   parochial churches, or one cathedral and one parochial church, shall be
   absolutely obliged,-all dispensations and unions for life whatsoever to
   the contrary notwithstanding,-retaining one parochial church only, or
   the cathedral church alone, to resign the other parochial [Page 225]
   churches within the space of six months; otherwise as well the parish
   churches, as also all the benefices which they hold, shall be accounted
   ipso jure void, and as void shall be freely conferred on other
   competent persons; nor shall they who previously held them be able to
   retain the fruits thereof, with a safe conscience, after the said time.
   But the holy Synod desires that a provision be made in some suitable
   manner, as may seem fit to the Sovereign Pontiff, for the necessities
   of those who resign.
   CHAPTER XVIII.
   Upon a Parish Church becoming vacant, a Vicar is to be deputed
   thereunto by the Bishop, until it be provided with a Parish Priest: in
   what manner and by whom those nominated to Parochial Churches ought to
   be examined.
   It is most highly expedient for the salvation of souls, that they be
   governed by worthy and competent parish priests. To the end that this
   may with greater care and effect be accomplished, the holy Synod
   ordains, that when a vacancy occurs in a parish church, whether by
   death, or by resignation, even in the Roman Court, or in any other
   manner whatsoever, though it may be alleged that the charge thereof
   devolves on the church (itself), or on the bishop, and though it may be
   served by one or more priests,-and this not excepting even those
   churches called patrimonial, or receptive, wherein the bishop has been
   accustomed to assign the cure of souls to one or more (priests), all of
   whom, as this Synod ordains, must be subjected to the examination
   herein prescribed later,-even though, moreover, the said parish church
   may be reserved, or appropriated, whether generally or specially, by
   virtue even of an indult, or privilege granted in favour of cardinals
   of the holy Roman Church, or of certain abbots, or chapters; it shall
   be the duty of the bishop, at once, upon obtaining information of the
   vacancy of the church, [Page 226] to appoint, if need be, a competent
   vicar to the same--with a suitable assignment, at his own discretion,
   of a portion of the fruits thereof--to support the duties of the said
   church, until it shall be provided with a rector. Moreover, the bishop,
   and he who has the right of patronage, shall, within ten days, or such
   other term as the bishop shall prescribe, nominate, in the presence of
   those who shall be deputed as examiners, certain clerics as capable of
   governing the said church. It shall nevertheless be free for others
   also, who may know any that are fit for the office, to give in their
   names, that a diligent scrutiny may be afterwards made as to the age,
   morals, and sufficiency of each. And even,--if the bishop, or the
   provincial Synod shall, considering the custom of the country, judge
   this more expedient,--those who may wish to be examined may be summoned
   by a public notice. When the time appointed has transpired, all those
   whose names have been entered shall be examined by the bishop, or, if
   he be hindered, by his Vicar-general, and by the other examiners, who
   shall not be fewer than three; to whose votes, if they should be equal,
   or given to distinct individuals, the bishop, or his vicar, may add
   theirs, in favour of whomsoever they shall think most fit.
   And as regards the examiners, six at least shall be annually proposed
   by the bishop, or by his vicar, in the diocesan Synod; who shall be
   such as shall satisfy, and shall be approved of by, the said Synod. And
   upon any vacancy occurring in any church, the bishop shall select three
   out of that number to make the examination with him; and afterwards,
   upon another vacancy following, he shall select, out of the six
   aforesaid, the same, or three others, whom he may prefer. But the said
   examiners shall be masters, or doctors, or licentiates in theology, or
   in canon law, or such other clerics, whether Regulars,-even of the
   order of mendicants,-or Seculars, as shall seem best adapted thereunto;
   and they shall all swear on the holy Gospels of God, that they will,
   setting aside every human affection, faithfully perform their duty. And
   they shall beware of receiving anything whatever, either before or
   after, on account of this examination; otherwise, both the receivers
   and the givers will incur the guilt of simony, from which they shall
   not be capable of [Page 227] being absolved, until after they have
   resigned the benefices which they were possessed of in any manner
   whatsoever, even before this act; and they shall be rendered incapable
   of any others for the time to come. And in regard of all these matters,
   they shall be bound to render an account, not only to God, but also, if
   need be, to the provincial Synod, which shall have power to punish them
   severely, at Its discretion, if it be ascertained that they have done
   anything contrary to their duty.
   Then, after the examination is completed, a report shall be made of all
   those who shall have been judged, by the said examiners, fit by age,
   morals, learning, prudence, and other suitable qualifications, to
   govern the vacant church; and out of these the bishop shall select him
   whom he shall judge the most fit of all; and to him, and to none other,
   shall the church be collated by him unto whom it belongs to collate
   thereunto. But, if the church be under ecclesiastical patronage, and
   the institution thereunto belongs to the bishop, and to none else,
   whomsoever the patron shall judge the most worthy from amongst those
   who have been approved of by the examiners, him he shall be bound to
   present to the bishop, that he may receive institution from him: but
   when the institution is to proceed from any other than the bishop, then
   the bishop alone shall select the worthiest from amongst the worthy,
   and him the patron shall present to him unto whom the institution
   belongs.
   But if it be under lay patronage, the individual who shall be presented
   by the patron, must be examined, as above, by those deputed thereunto,
   and not be admitted, unless he be found fit. And, in all the
   above-mentioned cases, to none other but to one of those who have been
   examined as aforesaid, and have been approved of by the examiners,
   according to the rule prescribed above, shall the church be committed,
   nor shall any devolution, or appeal, interposed even before the
   Apostolic See, or the legates, vice-legates, or nuncios of that see, or
   before any bishops, or metropolitans, primates, or patriarchs, hinder
   or suspend the report of the aforesaid examiners from being carried
   into execution: for the rest, the vicar whom the bishop has, at his own
   discretion, already deputed for the time being to the vacant church, or
   whom he may afterwards happen to depute [Page 228] thereunto, shall not
   be removed from the charge and administration of the said church, until
   it be provided for, either by the appointment of the vicar himself, or
   of some other person, who has been approved of and elected as above:
   and all provisions and institutions made otherwise than according to
   the above-named form, shall be accounted surreptitious: any exemptions,
   indults, privileges, preventions, appropriations, new provisions,
   indults granted to any university whatsoever, even for a certain sum,
   and any other impediments whatsoever, in opposition to this decree,
   notwithstanding.
   If, however, the said parish churches should possess so slight a
   revenue, as not to allow of the trouble of all this examination; or
   should no one seek to undergo this examination; or if, by reason of the
   open factions, or dissensions, which are met with in some places, more
   grievous quarrels and tumults may easily be excited thereby; the
   Ordinary may, omitting this formality, have recourse to a private
   examination, if, in his conscience, with the advice of the (examiners)
   deputed, he shall judge this expedient; observing however the other
   things as prescribed above. It shall also be lawful for the provincial
   Synod, if It shall judge that there are any particulars which ought to
   be added to, or retrenched from, the above regulations concerning the
   form of examination, to provide accordingly.
   CHAPTER XIX.
   Mandates 'de providendo,' Expectatives, and other things of the like
   kind are abrogated.
   The holy Synod ordains, that mandates for contingent promotions, and
   those graces which are called expectant, shall not any more be granted
   to any one, not even to colleges, universities, senates, or to any
   individuals whatsoever, even [Page 220] though under the name of an
   indult, or up to a certain sum, or under any other colourable title;
   nor shall it be lawful for any one to make use of such as have been
   heretofore granted. So, neither shall any mental reservations, nor any
   other graces whatsoever in regard of future vacancies in benefices, nor
   indults which apply to churches belonging to others, or to monasteries,
   be granted to any, not even cardinals of the holy Roman Church; and
   those hitherto granted shall be looked upon as abrogated.
   CHAPTER XX.
   The manner of conducting causes, appertaining to the Ecclesiastical
   court, is prescribed.
   All causes belonging in any way whatever to the ecclesiastical court,
   even though they may relate to benefices, shall be taken cognizance of,
   in the first instance, before the Ordinaries of the places only; and
   shall be completely terminated within two years at the latest from the
   time that the suit was instituted: otherwise, at the expiration of that
   period, it shall be free for the parties, or for either of them, to
   have recourse to superior, but otherwise competent, judges, who shall
   take up the cause as it shall then stand, and shall take care that it
   be terminated with all possible despatch; nor, before that period,
   shall the causes be committed to any others (than the Ordinaries), nor
   be transferred therefrom; nor shall any appeals interposed by those
   parties be received by any superior judges whatsoever; nor shall any
   commission, or inhibition be issued by them, except upon a definitive
   sentence, or one that has the force thereof, and the grievance arising
   from which cannot be redressed by an appeal from that definitive
   sentence. From the above are to be excepted those causes, which,
   pursuant to the appointments of the canons, are to be tried before the
   Apostolic See, or those which the Sovereign Roman Pontiff shall, for an
   urgent and [Page 221] reasonable cause, judge fit to appoint, or to
   avocate, for his own hearing, by a special rescript under the signature
   of his Holiness signed with his own hand.
   Furthermore, matrimonial and criminal causes shall not be left to the
   judgment of deans, archdeacons, and other inferiors, even when on their
   course of visitation, but shall be reserved for the examination and
   jurisdiction of the bishop only; even though there should be, at this
   present moment, a suit pending, in whatsoever stage of the proceedings
   it may be, between any bishop, and the dean, or archdeacon, touching
   the cognizance of this class of causes: and if, in any said matrimonial
   cause, one of the parties shall truly prove his property in the
   presence of the bishop, he shall not be compelled to plead out of the
   province, either in the second or third stage of the suit, unless the
   other party will provide for his maintenance, and also bear the
   expenses of the suit.
   Legates also, even though de latere, nuncios, ecclesiastical governors,
   or others, shall not only not presume, by virtue of any powers
   whatsoever, to impede bishops in the causes aforesaid, or in any wise
   to take from them, or to disturb their jurisdiction, but they shall not
   even proceed against clerics, or other ecclesiastical persons, until
   the bishop has been first applied to, and has shown himself negligent;
   otherwise their proceedings and ordinances shall be of no force, and
   they shall be bound to make satisfaction to the parties for the damages
   which they have sustained.
   Furthermore, should any individual appeal in those cases allowed of by
   law, or lodge a complaint touching any grievance, or have recourse, as
   aforesaid, to a judge, on account of two years having elapsed, he shall
   be bound to transfer, at his own expense, to the judge of appeal, all
   the acts of the proceedings that have taken place before the bishop,
   having given, however, notice thereof previously to the said bishop;
   that so, if it seem fit to him to communicate any information on the
   suit, he may acquaint the judge of appeal therewith. But if the
   appellee [Page 231] shall appear, then shall he also be bound to bear
   his proportion of the costs of transferring those acts, provided that
   he wishes to make use thereof; unless it be the custom of the place to
   act otherwise, to wit, that the entire costs have to be borne by the
   appellant.
   Moreover, the notary shall be bound to furnish the appellant, upon
   payment of the suitable fee, with a copy of the proceedings as soon as
   may be, and within a month at the furthest. And should that notary be
   guilty of any fraud in delaying the giving such copy, he shall be
   suspended from the exercise of his office, at the discretion of the
   Ordinary, and be condemned to pay double the costs of the suit, which
   shall be divided between the appellant and the poor of the place. But
   if the judge also should himself be cognizant of, and an accomplice in,
   this delay, or if he shall in any other way raise obstacles against the
   entire proceedings being delivered over to the appellant within the
   term aforesaid, he shall be subjected to the same penalty of paying
   double the costs, as above; notwithstanding, as regards all the
   aforesaid matters, any privileges, indults, covenants, which only bind
   the authors thereof, and any other customs whatsoever to the contrary.
   CHAPTER XXI.
   It is declared, that, by certain words used previously, the usual
   manner of treating business in General Councils is not changed.
   The holy Synod,-being desirous that no occasion of doubting may, at any
   future period, arise out of the decrees which It has published,-in
   explanation of the words contained in a decree published in the first
   Session under our most blessed lord, Pius IV., to wit, "which, the
   legates and presidents proposing, shall to the said holy Synod appear
   suitable and proper for assuaging the calamities of these times,
   terminating the controversies concerning religion, restraining
   deceitful tongues, correcting the abuses of depraved manners, and
   procuring for the church a true and Christian peace," declares that it
   was not Its [Page 232] intention, that, by the foregoing words, the
   usual manner of treating matters in general Councils should be in any
   respect changed; or that anything new, besides that which has been
   heretofore established by the sacred canons, or by the form of general
   Councils, should be added to, or taken from, any one.
   INDICTION OF THE NEXT SESSION.
   Moreover, the same sacred and holy Synod ordains and decrees, that the
   next ensuing Session be held on the Thursday after the Conception of
   the Blessed Virgin Mary, which will be the ninth day of December next,
   with the power also of abridging that term. In which Session there will
   be treated of the sixth chapter which is now deferred till then, and
   the remaining chapters on Reformation which have been already set
   forth, and other matters which relate thereunto. And if it shall seem
   advisable, and the time will allow thereof, certain dogmas may also be
   treated of, as in their proper season they shall be proposed in the
   congregations.
   The term fixed for the Session was abridged.
   SESSION THE TWENTY-FIFTH,
   Begun on the third, and terminated on the fourth, day of December,
   MDLXIII., being the ninth and last under the Sovereign Pontiff, Pius
   IV.
   DECREE CONCERNING PURGATORY.
   Whereas the Catholic Church, instructed by the Holy Ghost, has, from
   the sacred writings and the ancient tradition of the Fathers, taught,
   in sacred councils, and very recently in this oecumenical Synod, that
   there is a Purgatory, and that the souls there detained are helped by
   the suffrages of the faithful, [Page 233] but principally by the
   acceptable sacrifice of the altar; the holy Synod enjoins on bishops
   that they diligently endeavour that the sound doctrine concerning
   Purgatory, transmitted by the holy Fathers and sacred councils, be
   believed, maintained, taught, and every where proclaimed by the
   faithful of Christ. But let the more difficult and subtle questions,
   and which tend not to edification, and from which for the most part
   there is no increase of piety, be excluded from popular discourses
   before the uneducated multitude. In like manner, such things as are
   uncertain, or which labour under an appearance of error, let them not
   allow to be made public and treated of. While those things which tend
   to a certain kind of curiosity or superstition, or which savour of
   filthy lucre, let them prohibit as scandals and stumbling-blocks of the
   faithful. But let the bishops take care, that the suffrages of the
   faithful who are living, to wit the sacrifices of masses, prayers,
   alms, and other works of piety, which have been wont to be performed by
   the faithful for the other faithful departed, be piously and devoutly
   performed, in accordance with the institutes of the church; and that
   whatsoever is due on their behalf, from the endowments of testators, or
   in other way, be discharged, not in a perfunctory manner, but
   diligently and accurately, by the priests and ministers of the church,
   and others who are bound to render this (service).
   ON THE INVOCATION, VENERATION, AND RELICS, OF SAlNTS, AND ON SACRED
   IMAGES.
   The holy Synod enjoins on all bishops, and others who sustain the
   office and charge of teaching, that, agreeably to the usage of the
   Catholic and Apostolic Church, received from the primitive times of the
   Christian religion, and agreeably to the consent of the holy Fathers,
   and to the decrees of sacred Councils, they especially instruct the
   faithful diligently concerning the intercession and invocation of
   saints; the honour (paid) to [Page 234] relics; and the legitimate use
   of images: teaching them, that the saints, who reign together with
   Christ, offer up their own prayers to God for men; that it is good and
   useful suppliantly to invoke them, and to have recourse to their
   prayers, aid, (and) help for obtaining benefits from God, through His
   Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who is our alone Redeemer and Saviour; but
   that they think impiously, who deny that the saints, who enjoy eternal
   happiness in heaven, are to be invocated; or who assert either that
   they do not pray for men; or, that the invocation of them to pray for
   each of us even in particular, is idolatry; or, that it is repugnant to
   the word of God; and is opposed to the honour of the one mediator of
   God and men, Christ Jesus; or, that it is foolish to supplicate,
   vocally, or mentally, those who reign in heaven. Also, that the holy
   bodies of holy martyrs, and of others now living with Christ,-which
   bodies were the living members of Christ, and the temple of the Holy
   Ghost, and which are by Him to be raised unto eternal life, and to be
   glorified,--are to be venerated by the faithful; through which (bodies)
   many benefits are bestowed by God on men; so that they who affirm that
   veneration and honour are not due to the relics of saints; or, that
   these, and other sacred monuments, are uselessly honoured by the
   faithful; and that the places dedicated to the memories of the saints
   are in vain visited with the view of obtaining their aid; are wholly to
   be condemned, as the Church has already long since condemned, and now
   also condemns them.
   Moreover, that the images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God, and
   of the other saints, are to be had and retained particularly in
   temples, and that due honour and veneration are to be given them; not
   that any divinity, or virtue, is believed to be in them, on account of
   which they are to be worshipped; or that anything is to be asked of
   them; or, that trust is to be reposed in images, as was of old done by
   the Gentiles who placed [Page 235] their hope in idols; but because the
   honour which is shown them is referred to the prototypes which those
   images represent; in such wise that by the images which we kiss, and
   before which we uncover the head, and prostrate ourselves, we adore
   Christ; and we venerate the saints, whose similitude they bear: as, by
   the decrees of Councils, and especially of the second Synod of Nicaea,
   has been defined against the opponents of images.
   And the bishops shall carefully teach this,-that, by means of the
   histories of the mysteries of our Redemption, portrayed by paintings or
   other representations, the people is instructed, and confirmed in (the
   habit of) remembering, and continually revolving in mind the articles
   of faith; as also that great profit is derived from all sacred images,
   not only because the people are thereby admonished of the benefits and
   gifts bestowed upon them by Christ, but also because the miracles which
   God has performed by means of the saints, and their salutary examples,
   are set before the eyes of the faithful; that so they may give God
   thanks for those things; may order their own lives and manners in
   imitation of the saints; and may be excited to adore and love God, and
   to cultivate piety. But if any one shall teach, or entertain
   sentiments, contrary to these decrees; let him be anathema.
   And if any abuses have crept in amongst these holy and salutary
   observances, the holy Synod ardently desires that they be utterly
   abolished; in such wise that no images, (suggestive) of false doctrine,
   and furnishing occasion of dangerous error to the uneducated, be set
   up. And if at times, when expedient for the unlettered people; it
   happen that the facts and narratives of sacred Scripture are portrayed
   and represented; the people shall be taught, that not thereby is the
   Divinity represented, as though it could be seen by the eyes of the
   body, or be portrayed by colours or figures.
   Moreover, in the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics, and
   the sacred use of images, every superstition shall be removed, all
   filthy lucre be abolished; finally, all lasciviousness be [Page 236]
   avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with
   a beauty exciting to lust; nor the celebration of the saints, and the
   visitation of relics be by any perverted into revellings and
   drunkenness; as if festivals are celebrated to the honour of the saints
   by luxury and wantonness.
   In fine, let so great care and diligence be used herein by bishops, as
   that there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly
   or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous,
   seeing that holiness becometh the house of God.
   And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy
   Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed,
   any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except
   that image have been approved of by the bishop: also, that no new
   miracles are to be acknowledged, or new relics recognised, unless the
   said bishop has taken cognizance and approved thereof; who, as soon as
   he has obtained some certain information in regard to these matters,
   shall, after having taken the advice of theologians, and of other pious
   men, act therein as he shall judge to be consonant with truth and
   piety. But if any doubtful, or difficult abuse has to be extirpated;
   or, in fine, if any more grave question shall arise touching these
   matters, the bishop, before deciding the controversy, shall await the
   sentence of the metropolitan and of the bishops of the province, in a
   provincial Council; yet so, that nothing new, or that previously has
   not been usual in the Church, shall be resolved on, without having
   first consulted the most holy Roman Pontiff.
   ON REGULARS AND NUNS
   The same sacred and holy Synod, prosecuting the subject of reformation,
   has thought fit that the things following be ordained.
   [Page 237]
   CHAPTER I.
   All ReguIars shall order their lives in accordance with what is
   prescribed by the rule which they have professed; Superiors shall
   sedulously provide that this be done.
   Forasmuch as the holy Synod is not ignorant how much splendour and
   utility accrue to the Church of God, from monasteries piously
   instituted and rightly administered; It has,--to the end that the
   ancient and regular discipline may be the more easily and promptly
   restored, where it has fallen away, and may be the more firmly
   maintained, where it has been preserved,--thought it necessary to
   enjoin, as by this decree It doth enjoin, that all Regulars, as well
   men, as women, shall order and regulate their lives in accordance with
   the requirements of the rule which they have professed; and above all
   that they shall faithfully observe whatsoever belongs to the perfection
   of their profession, such as the vows of obedience, poverty, and
   chastity, as also all other vows and precepts that may be peculiar to
   any rule or order, respectively appertaining to the essential character
   of each, and which regard the observance of a common mode of living,
   food, and dress. And all care and diligence shall be used by the
   Superiors, both in the general and in the provincial Chapters, and in
   their visitations, which they shall not omit to make in their proper
   seasons, that these things be not departed from; it being certain, that
   those things which belong to the substance of a regular life cannot be
   by them relaxed. For if those things which are the basis and the
   foundation of all regular discipline be not strictly preserved, the
   whole edifice must needs fall.
   CHAPTER II.
   Property is wholly prohibited to Regulars.
   For no Regular, therefore, whether man, or woman, shall it be lawful to
   possess, or hold as his own, or even in the name of [Page 238] the
   convent, any property moveable or immoveable, of what nature soever it
   may be, or in what way soever acquired; but the same shall be
   immediately delivered up to the Superior, and be incorporated with the
   convent. Nor shall it henceforth be lawful for Superiors to allow any
   real property to any Regular, not even by way of having the interest,
   or the use, the administration thereof, or in commendam. But the
   administration of the property of monasteries, or of convents, shall
   belong to the officers thereof only, removable at the will of their
   Superiors.
   The Superiors shall allow the use of moveables, in such manner as that
   the furniture of their body shall be suitable to the state of poverty
   which they have professed; and there shall be nothing therein
   superfluous, but at the same time nothing shall be refused which is
   necessary for them. But should any one be discovered, or be proved, to
   possess anything in any other manner, he shall be deprived during two
   years of his active and passive voice, and also be punished in
   accordance with the constitutions of his own rule and order.
   CHAPTER III.
   All Monasteries save those herein excepted, shall be able to possess
   real property: the number of persons therein to be determined by the
   amount of Income, or of Alms. No Monasteries, to be erected without the
   Bishop's leave.
   The holy Synod permits that henceforth real property may be possessed
   by all monasteries and houses, both of men and women, and of
   mendicants, even by those who were forbidden by their constitutions to
   possess it, or who had not received permission to that effect by
   apostolic privilege,-with the exception, however, of the houses of the
   brethren of St. Francis (called) Capuchins, and those called Minor
   Observants: and if any of the aforesaid places, to which it has been
   granted by apostolic [Page 239] authority to possess such property,
   have been stripped thereof, It ordains that the same shall be wholly
   restored unto them. But, in the aforesaid monasteries amid houses, as
   well of men as of women, whether they possess, or do not possess, real
   property, such a number of inmates only shall be fixed upon and be for
   the future retained, as can be conveniently supported, either out of
   the proper revenues of those monasteries, or out of the customary alms;
   nor shall any such places be henceforth erected, without the permission
   of the bishop, in whose diocese they are to be erected, being first
   obtained.
   CHAPTER IV.
   A Regular shall not, without the permission of his Superior, either
   place himself at the service of another, or retire from his Monastery:
   when sent to a University for study he shall reside in a Monastery.
   The holy Synod forbids, that any Regular, under the pretext of
   preaching, or lecturing, or of any other pious work, place himself at
   the service of any prelate, prince, university, community, or of any
   other person, or place, whatsoever, without permission from his own
   Superior; nor shall any privilege or faculty, obtained from others in
   regard hereof avail him anything. But should any one act contrary
   hereto, he shall be punished as disobedient, at the discretion of his
   Superior. Nor shall it be lawful for Regulars to withdraw from their
   own convents, even under the pretext of repairing to their own
   Superiors; unless they have been sent, or summoned, by them. And
   whoever shall be found to be without the order aforesaid in writing,
   shall be punished as a deserter from his Institute by the Ordinaries of
   the places. As to those who are sent to the universities for the sake
   of their studies, they shall dwell in convents only; otherwise they
   shall be proceeded against by the Ordinaries.
   [Page 240]
   CHAPTER V.
   Provision is made for the enclosure and safety of Nuns.
   The holy Synod, renewing the constitution of Boniface VIII., which
   begins Periculoso, enjoins on all bishops, by the judgment of God to
   which It appeals, and under pain of eternal malediction, that, by their
   ordinary authority, in all monasteries subject to them, and in others,
   by the authority of the Apostolic See, they make it their especial
   care, that the enclosure of nuns be carefully restored, wheresoever it
   has been violated, and that it be preserved, wheresoever it has not
   been violated; repressing, by ecclesiastical censures and other
   penalties, without regarding any appeal whatsoever, the disobedient and
   gainsayers, and calling in for this end, if need be, the aid of the
   Secular arm. The holy Synod exhorts Christian princes to furnish this
   aid, and enjoins, under pain of excommunication, to be ipso facto
   incurred, that it be rendered by all civil magistrates. But for no nun,
   after her profession, shall it be lawful to go out of her convent, even
   for a brief period, under any pretext whatever, except for some lawful
   cause, which is to be approved of by the bishop; any indults and
   privileges whatsoever notwithstanding.
   And it shall not be lawful for any one, of whatsoever birth, or
   condition, sex, or age, to enter within the enclosure of a nunnery,
   without the permission of the bishop, or of the Superior, obtained in
   writing, under the pain of excommunication to be ipso facto incurred.
   But the bishop, or the Superior ought to grant this permission in
   necessary cases only; nor shall any other person be able by any means
   to grant it, even by virtue of any faculty, or indult, already granted,
   or that may hereafter be granted. And forasmuch as those convents of
   nuns which are established outside the walls of a city or town, are
   exposed, often without any protection, to the robberies and other
   crimes of wicked men, the bishops and other Superiors shall, if they
   think it expedient, make it their care that the nuns be removed from
   those places to new or old convents within cities or popu-[Page
   241]lous towns, calling in even, if need be, the aid of the Secular
   arm. As to those who hinder them or disobey, they shall by
   ecclesiastical censures compel them to submit.
   CHAPTER VI.
   Manner of choosing Regular Superiors.
   In order that everything may be conducted uprightly and without fraud,
   in the election of all manner of superiors, temporary abbots, and other
   officers, and generals, and abbesses, and other superioresses, the holy
   Synod above all things strictly enjoins, that all the aforesaid ought
   to be chosen by secret voting, in such wise as that the names of the
   respective voters shall never be made known. Neither shall it, for the
   future, be lawful to appoint provincials, abbots, priors, or any other
   titularies whatsoever, for the purposes of an election that is to take
   place; nor to supply the place of the voices and suffrages of those who
   are absent. But should any one be elected contrary to the appointment
   of this decree, such election shall be invalid; and he who shall have
   allowed himself, for this object, to be created provincial, abbot, or
   prior, shall be from that time forth incapable of holding any offices
   whatsoever in that order; and any faculties that have been granted in
   this matter shall be looked upon as hereby abrogated; and should any
   others be granted for the time to come, they shall be regarded as
   surreptitious.
   CHAPTER VII.
   In what way, and what manner of, persons are to be chosen as Abbesses,
   or Superioresses by whatsoever other name; no one shall be appointed
   over two Nunneries.
   No one shall be elected as abbess, or prioress,--or by whatsoever other
   name she who is appointed and placed over the [Page 242] rest, may be
   called,--who is less than forty years of age, and who has not passed
   eight of those years in a praiseworthy manner, after having made her
   profession. But should no one be found in the same convent with these
   qualifications, one may be elected out of another convent of the same
   order. But if the superior who presides over the election shall deem
   even this an inconvenience; with the consent of the bishop, or other
   superior, there may be one chosen from amongst those, in the same
   convent, who are beyond their thirtieth year, and who have, since their
   profession, passed at least five of those years in an upright manner.
   But no individual shall be set over two convents; and if any one is, in
   any way, in possession of two or more, she shall, retaining one, be
   compelled to resign the rest, within six months: but after that period,
   if she have not resigned, they shall be all ipso jure vacant. And he
   who presides at the election, whether it be the bishop, or other
   superior, shall not enter the enclosure of the monastery, but shall
   listen to, or receive the votes of each, at the little window in the
   gates. In other particulars, the constitution of each order, or
   convent, shall be observed.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   In what manner the regulation of Monasteries, which have not ordinary
   Regular visitors, is to be proceeded with.
   All monasteries which are not subject to general Chapters, or to
   bishops, and which have not their own ordinary Regular visitors, but
   have been accustomed to be governed under the immediate protection and
   direction of the Apostolic See, shall be bound, within a year from the
   end of the present Council, and thenceforth every third year, to form
   themselves into congregations, according to the form of the
   constitution of Innocent III., beginning In singulis, published in a
   general Council; [Page 243] and shall there depute certain Regulars to
   deliberate and ordain as to the mode and order of establishing the
   congregations aforesaid, and touching the statutes to be therein
   observed. But should they be negligent in these matters, it shall be
   lawful for the metropolitan, in whose province the aforesaid
   monasteries are situated, to convoke them for the above named purposes,
   as the delegate of the Apostolic See. But if there be not a sufficient
   number of monasteries, within the limits of one province, for the
   establishing of such congregation, the monasteries of two or three
   provinces may form one congregation. And when the said congregations
   have been established, the general Chapters thereof, and the presidents
   and visitors elected thereby, shall have the same authority over the
   monasteries of their own congregation, and over the Regulars dwelling
   therein, as other presidents and visitors have in other orders; and
   they shall be bound to visit frequently the monasteries of their own
   congregation, and to apply themselves to the reformation thereof; and
   to observe whatsoever things have been decreed in the sacred canons,
   and in this sacred Council. Also, if, at the instance of the
   metropolitan, they shall not take measures to execute the above, they
   shall be subjected to the bishops, in whose dioceses the places
   aforesaid are situated, as the delegates of the Apostolic See.
   CHAPTER IX.
   Convents of Nuns immediately subject to the Apostolic See shall be
   governed by the Bishops; but others, by those deputed in the General
   Chapters, or by other Regulars.
   Those convents of nuns which are immediately subject to the Apostolic
   See, even those which are called by the name of Chapters of St. Peter,
   or of St. John, or by whatsoever other name they may be designated,
   shall be governed by the bishops, as the delegates of the Apostolic
   See; anything to the contrary notwithstanding. But those which are
   governed, by persons deputed in general Chapters, or by other Regulars,
   shall be left under their care and conduct.
   [Page 244]
   CHAPTER X.
   Nuns shall confess and communicate once a month; an extraordinary
   Confessor shall be assigned them by the Bishop. The Eucharist shall not
   be reserved within the enclosure of the Convent.
   Bishops and other Superiors of convents of nuns, shall take particular
   care that the nuns be admonished, in their constitutions, to confess
   their sins, and to receive the most holy Eucharist, at least once a
   month, that so they may fortify themselves, by that salutary safeguard,
   resolutely to overcome all the assaults of the devil. But besides the
   ordinary confessor, the bishop and other superiors shall, twice or
   thrice a year, offer them an extraordinary one, whose duty it shall be
   to hear the confessions of all the nuns. But that the most holy body of
   Christ be kept within the choir, or the enclosure of the convent, and
   not in the public church, the holy Synod forbids it; any privilege or
   indult whatsoever notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER XI.
   In Monasteries, which are charged with the cure of the souls of laymen,
   they who exercise that cure shall be subject to the Bishop, and be by
   him previously examined, with certain exceptions.
   In monasteries, or houses whether of men, or of women, which are
   charged with the cure of souls of other Secular persons besides those
   who belong to the household of those monasteries, or places; the
   individuals, whether Regulars or Seculars, who exercise that cure,
   shall be immediately subject, in what-[Page 245]soever pertains to the
   said cure and the administration of the sacraments, to the
   jurisdiction, visitation, and correction of the bishop in whose diocese
   those places are situated; nor shall any, not even such as are
   removable at pleasure, be deputed thereunto, save with the consent of
   the said bishop, and after having been previously examined by him, or
   by his vicar; the monastery of Cluny with its limits being excepted;
   and excepting also monasteries, or places, in which abbots, generals,
   or the heads of orders, have their usual principal residence; as also
   the other monasteries, or houses, in which the abbots, or other
   Superiors or Regulars, exercise episcopal and temporary jurisdiction
   over the parish priests and their parishioners; saving, however, the
   right of those bishops who exercise a greater jurisdiction over the
   places, or persons above-named.
   CHAPTER XII.
   Episcopal censures, and festivals appointed in the diocese, shall be
   observed even by Regulars.
   Censures and interdicts,-not only those emanating from the Apostolic
   See, but also those promulgated by the Ordinaries,-shall, upon the
   bishop's mandate, be published and observed by Regulars in their
   churches. The festival days also which the said bishop shall order to
   be observed in his own diocese, shall be kept by all exempted persons,
   even though Regulars.
   CHAPTER XIII.
   The Bishop shall settle disputes about precedency. Exempted persons,
   not living in the more strict enclosures, are obliged to attend at
   public Processions.
   All disputes about precedence, which very often, with very great
   scandal, arise between ecclesiastics, both Secular and Regular, as well
   at public processions, as at those which take [Page 246] place in
   burying the dead, or carrying the canopy, and on other such occasions,
   the bishop shall settle, without regarding any appeal; anything to the
   contrary notwithstanding. And all exempted persons whatsoever, as well
   Secular as Regular clerics, and even monks, on being summoned to public
   processions, shall be obliged to attend; those only being excepted who
   always live in more strict enclosure.
   CHAPTER XIV.
   By whom punishment is to be inflicted on a Regular who sins publicly.
   A Regular who, not being subject to the bishop, and residing within the
   enclosure of a monastery, has out of that enclosure, transgressed so
   notoriously as to be a scandal to the people, shall, at the instance of
   the bishop, be severely punished by his own Superior, within such time
   as the bishop shall appoint; and the Superior shall certify to the
   bishop that the punishment has been inflicted: otherwise he shall be
   himself deprived of his office by his own Superior, and the delinquent
   may be punished by the bishop.
   CHAPTER XV.
   Profession shall not be made except after a year 's probation, and at
   the age of sixteen years completed.
   In no religious order whatever, shall the profession, whether of men or
   women, be made before the age of sixteen years is completed; nor shall
   any one be admitted to profession, who has been less than a year under
   probation from the time of taking the habit. And any profession made
   sooner than this shall be null; and shall not superinduce any
   obligation to the observance of any rule, or of any religious body, or
   order; or entail any other effects whatsoever.
   [Page 247]
   CHAPTER XVI.
   Any renunciation made, or obligation entered into, previous to the two
   months' nearest Profession, shall be null. The probation ended, the
   Novices shall either be professed, or dismissed. In the Religious order
   of Clerks of the Society of Jesus nothing is innovated. No part of the
   property of a Novice shall be given to a Monastery before Profession.
   Further, no renunciation made, or obligation entered into, sooner than
   this, even though upon oath, or in favour of any pious object
   whatsoever, shall be valid, unless it be made with permission of the
   bishop, or of his vicar, within the two months immediately preceding
   profession; and it shall not otherwise be understood as obtaining
   effect, unless the profession have followed thereupon: but if made in
   any other manner, even though with the express renunciation, even upon
   oath, of this privilege, it shall be invalid and of no effect. When the
   period of the noviciate is ended, the Superiors shall admit those
   novices, whom they have found qualified, to profession; or they shall
   dismiss them from the monastery.
   By these things, however, the Synod does not intend to make any
   innovation, or prohibition, so as to hinder the Religious Order of
   Clerks of the Society of Jesus from being able to serve God and His
   church, in accordance with their pious institute, approved of by the
   holy Apostolic See.
   Also, before the profession of a novice, whether male, or female,
   nothing shall be given to the monastery out of the property of the
   same, either by parents, relatives, or guardians under any pretext
   whatever, except for food and clothing, for [Page 248] the time that
   they are under probation; lest the said novice may be unable to leave
   on this account,--that the monastery is in possession of the whole, or
   of the greater part of his substance; and he may not easily be able to
   recover it, if he should leave. Yea rather the holy Synod enjoins,
   under the pain of anathema on the givers and receivers, that this be
   nowise done; and that, to those who leave before their profession,
   every thing that was theirs be restored to them. And the bishop shall,
   if need be, enforce by ecclesiastical censures that this be performed
   in a proper manner.
   CHAPTER XVII.
   If a girl, who is more than twelve years of age, wish to take the
   Regular Habit, she shall be questioned by the Ordinary, and again
   before Profession.
   The holy Synod, having in view the freedom of the profession on the
   part of virgins who are to be dedicated to God, ordains and decrees,
   that if a girl, being more than twelve years of age, desire to take the
   religious habit, she shall not take that habit, neither shall she, nor
   any other, at a later period, make her profession, until the
   bishop,--or, if he be absent, or hindered, his vicar, or some one
   deputed thereunto by them, and at their expense,--has carefully
   examined into the inclination of the virgin, whether she has been
   compelled or enticed thereunto, or knows what she is doing; and if her
   will be found to be pious and free, and she have the qualifications
   required by the rule of that convent and order; and if also the convent
   be a suitable one; it shall be free for her to make her profession. And
   that the bishop may not be in ignorance as to the time of profession,
   the Superioress of the convent shall be bound to give him notice
   thereof a month beforehand ; but if she do not acquaint him therewith,
   she shall be suspended from her office, for as long a period as the
   bishop shall think fit.
   [Page 249]
   CHAPTER XVIII.
   No one shall, except in the cases by law expressed, compel a woman to
   enter a Monastery; or prevent her, if she desire to enter. The
   constitutions of the Penitents, or Convertites, shall all be
   preserved.
   The holy Synod places under anathema all and singular those persons, of
   what quality or condition soever they may be, whether clerics or
   laymen, Seculars or Regulars, or with whatsoever dignity invested, who
   shall, in any way whatever, force any virgin, or widow, or any other
   woman whatsoever,--except in the cases provided for by law,--to enter a
   convent against her will, or to take the habit of any religious order,
   or to make her profession; as also all those who lend their counsel,
   aid, or countenance thereunto ; and those also who, knowing that she
   does not enter into the convent voluntarily, or voluntarily take the
   habit, or make her profession, shall, in any way, interfere in that
   act, by their presence, or consent, or authority.
   It also subjects to a like anathema those who shall, in any way,
   without a just cause, hinder the holy wish of virgins, or other women,
   to take the veil, or make their vows. And all and singular those things
   which ought to be done before profession, or at the profession itself,
   shall be observed not only in convents subject to the bishop, but also
   in all others whatsoever. From the above, however, are excepted those
   women who are called penitents, or convertites; in whose regard their
   constitutions shall be observed.
   CHAPTER XIX.
   How to proceed in cases of pretended invalidity of profession.
   No Regular soever, who shall pretend that he entered into a religious
   order through compulsion and fear ; or shall even allege [Page 250]
   that he made his profession before the proper age; or the like; and
   would fain lay aside his habit, be the cause what it may; or would even
   withdraw with his habit without the permission of his superior; shall
   be listened to, unless it be within five years only from the day of his
   profession, and not then either, unless he has produced before his own
   superior, and the Ordinary, the reasons which he alleges. But if,
   before doing this, he has of his own accord laid aside his habit; he
   shall in no wise be admitted to allege any cause whatever; but shall be
   compelled to return to his monastery, and be punished as an apostate;
   and meanwhile he shall not have the benefit of any privilege of his
   order.
   Also, no Regular shall, by virtue of any manner of faculty, be
   transferred to an order less rigid; nor shall permission be granted to
   any Regular to wear in secret the habit of his order.
   CHAPTER XX.
   Superiors of orders not subject to bishops shall visit and correct
   inferior Monasteries, even though held in commendam.
   Abbots, who are heads of orders, and the other Superiors of the
   aforesaid orders, who are not subject to bishops, but have a lawful
   jurisdiction over other inferior monasteries, or priories, shall, each
   in his own place and order, visit officially the said monasteries and
   priories that are subject to them, even though held in commendam:
   which, for as much as they are subject to the heads of their own
   orders, the holy Synod declares that they are not to be included in
   what has been elsewhere decreed relative to the visitation of
   monasteries held in commendam ; and those who preside over monasteries
   of the orders aforesaid shall be bound to receive the above-named
   visitors, and to execute their orders.
   Also, those monasteries themselves which are the heads of orders, shall
   be visited conformably to the constitutions of the holy Apostolic See,
   and of each several order. And so long as the said commendatary
   monasteries shall continue, there shall be appointed, by the general
   Chapters, or by the visitors of the [Page 251] said orders, priors
   claustral, or sub-prior in those priories that are conventual, who
   shall exercise spiritual authority, and correction. In all other things
   the privileges and faculties of the above-named orders, as regards the
   persons, places, and rights thereof, shall remain firm and inviolate.
   CHAPTER XXI.
   Over Monasteries, Religious of that same order shall be appointed.
   Whereas very many monasteries, even abbeys, priories, and provostries,
   have suffered no slight injury, both in spirituals and temporals,
   through the mal-administration of those to whom they have been
   entrusted, the holy Synod would fain by every means restore them to a
   discipline suitable to a monastic life. But the present state of the
   times is so fraught with hindrances and difficulties that a remedy can
   neither be applied at once to all, nor common to all places, as It
   could desire; nevertheless, that It may not omit anything which may in
   time be used in wholesomely providing against the evils aforesaid, It
   trusts in the first place, that the most holy Roman Pontiff will, of
   his piety and prudence, make it his care,-as far as he sees that the
   times will permit,--that over those monasteries which are at present
   held in commendam, and which are conventual, there be appointed
   Regulars, expressly professed of the same order, and capable of guiding
   and of governing the flock. And as to such as shall become vacant
   hereafter, they shall be conferred solely on Regulars of distinguished
   virtue and holiness. But as regards those monasteries which are the
   heads and chiefs of orders, be the filiations thereof called abbeys or
   priories, those who hold them at present in commendam shall be
   bound,-unless provision be made for a Regular successor
   thereunto,--[Page 252] either to make, within six months, a solemn
   profession of the religious life which is peculiar to the said orders,
   or to resign; otherwise the places aforesaid held in commendam shall be
   accounted ipso jure vacant. But, lest any fraud may be used as regards
   all and singular the aforesaid matters, the holy Synod ordains, that in
   the appointments to the said monasteries, the quality of each
   individual be specifically expressed; and any appointment made
   otherwise shall be accounted surreptitious, and shall not be rendered
   valid by any subsequent possession, even though extending over three
   years.
   CHAPTER XXII.
   The Decrees touching the Reformation of Regulars shall be carried into
   execution at once by all.
   The holy Synod enjoins, that all and singular the matters contained in
   the foregoing decrees be observed in all convents and monasteries,
   colleges, and houses of all monks and religious whatsoever, as also of
   all religious virgins and widows soever, even though living under the
   conduct of the military orders, of the order even (of St. John) of
   Jerusalem, and by what name soever they may be designated, under
   whatsoever rule or constitutions they may be, or under the care or
   government of, or in subjection to, union with, or dependence on, any
   order whatsoever, whether of mendicants, or not mendicants, or of other
   Regular monks, or canons of whatsoever kind : any privileges whatsoever
   of all and each of the above-named, under whatsoever form of words
   expressed, even those called mare magnum, even those obtained at their
   foundation, as also any constitutions and rules whatsoever, even though
   sworn to, and any customs, or prescriptions whatsoever, even though
   immemorial, to the contrary notwithstanding. But, if there be any
   Regulars, whether men or women, who are living under stricter rule or
   statutes, the holy Synod does not intend to withdraw them from their
   institute and observance, except as to the power of possessing real
   property in common. And forasmuch as the holy [Page 253] Synod desires
   that all and singular the things aforesaid be put in execution as soon
   as possible, It enjoins on all bishops that, in the monasteries which
   are subject to them, as also in all the rest specially committed to
   them in the preceding decrees; and on all abbots, and generals, and
   other Superiors of the above-named orders ; that they forthwith put in
   execution the matters aforesaid, and if there be anything which is not
   carried into execution, the provincial Councils shall remedy, and
   punish the negligence of the bishops ; and that of Regulars, their
   provincial and general Chapters ; and, in default of general Chapters,
   the provincial Councils shall, by deputing certain persons belonging to
   the same order, provide herein.
   The holy Synod also exhorts all kings, princes, republics, and
   magistrates, and by virtue of holy obedience commands them, to
   vouchsafe to interpose, as often as requested, their help and authority
   in support of the aforesaid bishops, abbots, generals, and other
   superiors in the execution of the things comprised above, that so they
   may, without any hindrance, rightly execute the preceding matters to
   the praise of Almighty God.
   DECREE ON REFORMATION.
   CHAPTER I.
   Cardinals and all Prelates of the churches shall be content with modest
   furniture and a frugal table: they shall not enrich their relatives or
   domestics out of the property of the Church.
   It is to be wished, that those who undertake the office of a bishop
   should understand what their portion is; and comprehend that they are
   called, not to their own convenience, not to riches or luxury, but to
   labours and cares for the glory of God. For it is not to be doubted,
   that the rest of the faithful [Page 254] also will be more easily
   excited to religion and innocence, if they shall see those who are set
   over them, not fixing their thoughts on the things of this world, but
   on the salvation of souls, and on their heavenly country. Wherefore the
   holy Synod, being minded that these things are of the greatest
   importance towards restoring ecclesiastical discipline, admonishes all
   bishops, that, often meditating thereon, they show themselves
   conformable to their office, by their actual deeds, and the actions of
   their lives; which is a kind of perpetual sermon; but above all that
   they so order their whole conversation, as that others may thence be
   able to derive examples of frugality, modesty, continency, and of that
   holy humility which so much recom mends us to God.
   Wherefore, after the example of our fathers in the Council of Carthage,
   It not only orders that bishops be content with modest furniture, and a
   frugal table and diet, but that they also give heed that in the rest of
   their manner of living, and in their whole house, there be nothing seen
   that is alien from this holy institution, and which does not manifest
   simplicity, zeal towards God, and a contempt of vanities. Also, It
   wholly forbids them to strive to enrich their own kindred or domestics
   out of the revenues of the church: seeing that even the canons of the
   Apostles forbid them to give to their kindred the property of the
   church, which belongs to God; but if their kindred be poor, let them
   distribute to them thereof as poor, but not misapply, or waste, it for
   their sakes : yea, the holy Synod, with the utmost earnestness,
   admonishes them completely to lay aside all this human and carnal
   affection towards brothers, nephews and kindred, which is the seed-plot
   of many evils in the church. And what has been said of bishops, the
   same is not only to be observed by all who hold ecclesiastical
   benefices, whether Secular or Regular, each according to the nature of
   his rank, but the Synod decrees that it also regards the cardinals of
   the holy Roman Church ; for whereas, upon their advice to the most holy
   Roman Pontiff, the administration of the universal Church depends, it
   would seem to be a shame, if they did not at the same time shine so
   pre-eminent in virtue and in the discipline of their lives, as
   deservedly to draw upon themselves the eyes of all men.
   [Page 255]
   CHAPTER II.
   By whom individually the Decrees of the Council are to be solemnly
   received; and by whom a profession of faith is to be made.
   The calamitousness of the times, and the malignity of the increasing
   heresies demand, that nothing be left undone which may seem in any wise
   capable of tending to the edification of the people, and to the defence
   of the Catholic faith. Wherefore the holy Synod enjoins on patriarchs,
   primates, archbishops, bishops, and all others, who, of right or
   custom, ought to be present at the provincial Council, that, in the
   very first provincial Synod that shall be held after the close of this
   Council, they publicly receive all and singular the things that have
   been defined and ordained by this holy Synod; as also that they promise
   and profess true obedience to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff; and at the
   same time publicly express their detestation of and anathematize all
   the heresies that have been condemned by the sacred canons and general
   councils, and especially by this same Synod. And henceforth, all those
   who shall be promoted to be patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and
   bishops, shall strictly observe the same in the first provincial Synod
   at which they shall be present. And should any one of all the aforesaid
   refuse, which God forbid, the bishops of the same province shall be
   bound, under pain of the divine indignation, at once to give notice
   thereof to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, and shall meanwhile abstain
   from communion with that person. And all others, who now hold, or shall
   hereafter hold, ecclesiastical benefices, and whose duty it is to be
   present at the diocesan Synod, shall do and observe the same, as above
   set down, on the very first occasion that the synod shall be held,
   otherwise they shall be punished according to the form of the sacred
   canons. Moreover, all those to whom belong the charge, visitation, and
   reformation of universities and of (places of) general studies, shall
   diligently take care that the canons and decrees of this holy Synod be,
   by the said universities, wholly [Page 256] received; and that the
   masters, doctors, and others, in the said universities, interpret and
   teach those things which are of Catholic faith, in conformity
   therewith; and that at the beginning of each year they bind themselves
   by solemn oath to this procedure. And also if there be any other things
   that need correction and reformation in the universities aforesaid,
   they shall be reformed and regulated by those whom it regards, for the
   advancement of religion and of ecclesiastical discipline. But as
   regards those universities which are immediately under the protection
   of the Sovereign Pontiff, and are subject to his visitation, his
   Blessedness will take care that they be, by his delegates, wholesomely
   visited and reformed in the manner aforesaid, and as shall seem to him
   most advantageous.
   CHAPTER III.
   The sword of excommunication is not to be rashly used: when an
   execution can be made on property or person, censures are to be
   abstained from: the civil magistrates shall not interfere herein.
   Although the sword of excommunication is the very sinews of
   ecclesiastical discipline, and very salutary for keeping the people in
   their duty, yet it is to be used with sobriety and great
   circumspection; seeing that experience teaches, that if it be rashly or
   for slight causes wielded, it is more despised than feared, and
   produces ruin rather than safety. Wherefore, those excommunications,
   which, after certain admonitions, are wont to be issued with the view
   as it is termed, of causing a revelation, or on account of things that
   have been lost or stolen, shall be issued by no one whomsoever, but the
   bishop; and not then, otherwise than on account of some circumstance of
   no common kind which moves the mind of the bishop thereunto, after the
   cause has been by him diligently and very maturely weighed ; nor shall
   he be induced to grant the said excommunications by the authority of
   any Secular person whatever, even though a magistrate; but the whole
   shall be left to his own judgment and [Page 257] conscience, when,
   considering the circumstances, the place, the person, or the time, he
   shall himself judge that such are to be resolved on.
   As regards judicial causes, it is enjoined on all ecclesiastical
   judges, of whatsoever dignity they may be, that, both during the
   proceedings, and in giving judgment, they abstain from ecclesiastical
   censures, or interdict, as often as an execution on the person or
   property can, in each stage of the process, be effected by them of
   their own proper authority ; but in civil causes, which in any way
   belong to the ecclesiastical court, it shall be lawful for them, if
   they judge it expedient, to proceed against all persons whatsoever,
   even laymen, and to terminate suits, by means of pecuniary fines,
   which, by the very fact of being levied, shall be assigned to the pious
   places there existing; or by distress upon the goods, or arrest of the
   person, to be made either by their own, or other officers; or even by
   deprivation of benefices, and other remedies at law. But if the
   execution cannot be made in this way, either upon the person, or goods,
   of the guilty, and there be contumacy towards the judge, he may then,
   in addition to the other penalties, smite them also with the sword of
   anathema, if he think fit.
   In like manner in criminal causes, wherein an execution can as above be
   effected upon the person or goods, the judge shall abstain from
   censures ; but, if that execution cannot easily be made, it shall be
   lawful for the judge to employ the said spiritual sword against
   delinquents ; provided however the character of the offence so require,
   and after two monitions at least, and this by public notice. And it
   shall not be lawful for any civil magistrate, to prohibit an
   ecclesiastical judge from excommunicating any individual; or to command
   that he revoke an excomnunication that has been issued; under pretext
   that the things contained in the present decree have not been observed;
   whereas the cognizance hereof does not appertain to Seculars, but to
   ecclesiastics. And every excommunicated person, who, after the lawful
   monitions, does not repent, shall not only not be received to the
   sacraments, and to communion, and [Page 258] intercourse with the
   faithful, but, if, being bound with censures, he shall, with obdurate
   heart, remain for a year in the defilement thereof, he may even be
   proceeded against as suspected of heresy.
   CHAPTER IV.
   Where the number of Masses to be celebrated is excessive, Bishops,
   Abbots, and Generals, shall make such regulation as shall seem to them
   expedient.
   It frequently happens, in divers churches, either that so great a
   number of masses is required to be celebrated on account of various
   legacies from persons deceased, that it is not possible to comply
   therewith on the particular days prescribed by the testators; or, that
   the alms left for the celebration thereof is so slight that it is not
   easy to find any one willing to undertake the duty; whereby the pious
   intentions of the testators are frustrated, and occasion is given for
   burthening the consciences of those who are concerned in the aforesaid
   obligations. The holy Synod, being desirous that these legacies for
   pious uses be satisfied in the most complete and useful manner
   possible, empowers bishops in diocesan Synod, and likewise abbots and
   generals of orders in their general Chapters, to ordain, in regard
   hereof, whatsoever in their consciences they shall, upon a diligent
   examination of the circumstances, judge to be most expedient for God's
   honour and worship, and the good of the churches, in those churches
   aforesaid which they shall find stand in need of some regulation in
   this matter, in such wise however that a commemoration be always made
   of the departed who, for the welfare of their souls, have left the said
   legacies for pious uses.
   [Page 259]
   CHAPTER V.
   The conditions and obligations imposed on Benefices shall be observed.
   Reason requires, that, in regulations which have been well established,
   no alteration be made by any ordinances to the contrary. Whenever,
   therefore, by virtue of the erection or foundation of any benefices, or
   in consequence of other regulations, certain qualifications are
   required, or certain obligations are attached thereunto, they shall not
   be derogated from in the collation, or in any other arrangement
   whatsoever in regard of the said benefices. The same also shall be
   observed as to prebends assigned to teachers of theology, masters,
   doctors, priests, deacons, or subdeacons, whenever such prebends have
   been established in this manner, in such sort that, in no provision
   whatever shall anything be altered in regard of the said qualifications
   and orders ; and any provision made otherwise shall be accounted
   surreptitious.
   CHAPTER VI.
   In what manner the Bishop ought to act in regard of the visitation of
   exempted Chapters.
   The holy Synod ordains that the decree, made under Paul III., of happy
   memory, beginning Capitula Cathedralium, shall be observed in all
   cathedral and collegiate churches, not only when the bishop makes his
   visitation, but also as often as he proceeds ex officio, or at the
   petition of another, against any one of those who are comprised in the
   said decree; yet so, however, that whenever he institutes proceedings
   out of visitation, all the particulars subjoined shall have place: to
   wit, that the Chapter shall, at the beginning of each year, select two
   individuals belong-[Page 260]ing to the Chapter, with whose counsel and
   consent the bishop, or his vicar, shall be bound to proceed, both in
   instituting the process, and in all the other acts thereof until the
   end of the cause inclusively,-in the presence, nevertheless, of the
   notary of the said bishop, and in the bishop's house, or his ordinary
   court of justice. The two deputies shall, however, have but one vote ;
   but either of them may give his vote in unison with that of the bishop.
   But if, as regards any proceeding, or as regards any interlocutory or
   definitive sentence, they shall both differ from the bishop, they shall
   in this case choose, in conjunction with the bishop, a third person,
   within the term of six days: and should they also not agree in the
   election of that third person, the choice shall devolve on the nearest
   bishop ; and the point whereon they differed shall be decided, in
   accordance with the opinion which that third person sides with;
   otherwise, the proceedings, and what follows thereupon, shall be null,
   and of no effect in law. Nevertheless, in crimes arising from
   incontinency, whereof mention has been made in the decree concerning
   concubinaries, as also in the more heinous crimes which require
   deposition or degradation; where flight is apprehended, and where, that
   judgment may not be eluded, it is necessary to secure the person, the
   bishop may at first proceed singly to a summary information, and to the
   necessary detention of the person; observing, however, in the rest of
   the proceedings, the order named above. But in all cases regard is to
   be paid to this, that the delinquents be kept in custody in a suitable
   place, according to the quality of the crime and of the persons.
   Moreover, there shall everywhere be rendered to bishops that honour
   which comports with their dignity; and in choir, in the chapter, in
   processions, and other public functions, they shall have the first
   seat, and the place which they shall themselves make choice of, and
   theirs shall be the chief authority in everything that is to be done.
   If the bishops shall propose anything to the canons to be deliberated
   on, and the matter treated of be not one which [Page 261] regards any
   benefit to them or theirs, they shall themselves convoke the Chapter,
   take the votes, and decide according to them. But, in the absence of
   the bishop, this shall be wholly done by those of the Chapter, to whom
   of right or custom it appertains, nor shall the bishop's vicar be
   allowed to do it. But in all other things, the jurisdiction and power
   of the Chapter, if any there be belonging thereunto, as also the
   administration of their property, shall be left wholly unimpaired and
   untouched. As regards those who do not possess any dignities, and are
   not of the Chapter, they shall all be subject to the bishop in causes
   ecclesiastical; notwithstanding, as regards the things aforesaid, any
   privileges accruing even from any foundation; as also any customs, even
   though immemorial; any sentences, oaths, concordates, which bind the
   authors thereof only; saving, however, in all things those privileges
   which have been granted to universities for general studies, or to the
   persons who belong thereunto. But all and singular these things shall
   not have effect in those churches wherein the bishops, or their vicars,
   by virtue of constitutions, privileges, customs, concordates, or by any
   other right whatsoever, have a power, authority, and jurisdiction
   greater than that which is included in the present decree; from which
   (powers) the holy Synod does not intend to derogate.
   CHAPTER VII.
   The Access and Regress in regard of Benefices are done away with ; in
   what manner, to whom, and for what cause, a Coadjutor is to be
   granted.
   Whereas, as regards ecclesiastical benefices, whatsoever carries with
   it the appearance of hereditary succession is a thing odious to the
   sacred constitutions, and contrary to the decrees of the Fathers; no
   Access or Regress, in regard of any ecclesiastical benefice of
   whatsoever quality, shall, even though by con-[Page 262]sent, be
   henceforth granted to any individual; nor shall those already granted
   be suspended, extended, or transferred. And this decree shall have
   effect in regard of all ecclesiastical benefices whatsoever, and even
   in cathedral churches, and as regards all manner of persons soever,
   even though distinguished with the honour of the cardinalate.
   In like manner, as regards coadjutorships with future succession, the
   same shall henceforth be observed; (to wit) that they shall not be
   permitted to any one in regard of any ecclesiastical benefices
   whatsoever. But if at any time the urgent necessity, or the evident
   advantage of a cathedral church, or of a monastery, demands that a
   coajutor be granted to a prelate, such coadjutor with (the right of)
   future succession shall not otherwise be granted but after the said
   cause has been first diligently taken cognizance of by the most holy
   Roman Pontiff; and it is certain, that all those qualifications which,
   by law, and by the decrees of this holy Synod, are required in bishops
   and prelates, are reunited in his person; otherwise, the concessions
   made herein, shall be accounted surreptitious.
   CHAPTER VIII.
   What is to be observed in regard to Hospitals. By whom, and in what
   manner, the negligence of administrators is to be punished.
   The holy Synod admonishes all who hold any ecclesiastical benefices,
   whether Secular or Regular, to accustom themselves, as far as their
   revenues will allow, to exercise with alacrity and kindliness the
   office of hospitality, so frequently commended by the holy Fathers;
   being mindful that those who cherish hospitality receive Christ in (the
   person of) their guests. But as regards those who hold in commendam, or
   by way of administration, or under any other title whatsoever, or have
   even united to their own churches, the places commonly called
   hospitals, or other pious places instituted especially for the use of
   pilgrims, of the infirm, the aged or the poor; or, if the parish
   churches should happen to be united to hospitals, or have been turned
   [Page 263] into hospitals, and have been granted to the patrons thereof
   to be by them administered, the Synod strictly commands, that they
   execute the charge and duty imposed upon them, and that they actually
   exercise that hospitality, which is due at their hands, out of the
   fruits devoted to that purpose, pursuant to the constitution of the
   Council of Vienne, renewed elsewhere by this same holy Synod under Paul
   III., of happy memory, and which begins, Quia contingit. But if these
   hospitals were instituted to receive a certain class of pilgrims, or of
   infirm persons, or of others; and in the place where the said hospitals
   are situated, there are no such persons, or very few, to be found, It
   doth further command, that the fruits thereof be converted to some
   other pious use, the nearest that may be to their original destination,
   and the most useful for that time and place, as shall seem to be the
   most expedient to the Ordinary, aided by two of the Chapter,
   experienced in matters of business, to be chosen by him; unless it be
   that the contrary happen to be expressed, to meet even this case, in
   the foundation, or institution thereof; in which event, the bishop
   shall take care that what is ordained be observed, or, if that be not
   possible, he shall, as above, regulate the matter in a useful manner.
   Wherefore, if all and singular the persons aforesaid, of whatsoever
   order, and religious body, and dignity they may be, be they even
   laymen, who have the administration of hospitals,--provided, however,
   they be not subject to Regulars where regular observance is in
   force,--shall, after having been admonished be the Ordinary, have
   ceased really to discharge the duty of hospitality, complying with all
   the necessary conditions to which they are bound, they may be compelled
   thereunto not only by ecclesiastical censures, and other remedies at
   law, but may also even be deprived for ever of the administration and
   care of the hospital itself; and others shall be substituted in their
   place, by those to whom this may belong. And the persons aforesaid
   shall, this notwithstanding, be bound in conscience to make restitution
   of the fruits which they have received contrary to the institution of
   the said hospitals; which restitution shall not be pardoned them by any
   remission or composition: nor shall the administration or government of
   such places be henceforth en-[Page 264]trusted to one and the same
   person longer than for three years, unless it be otherwise provided in
   the foundation thereof; notwithstanding, as regards all the above-named
   particulars, any union, exemption, and custom, even from time
   immemorial, to the contrary, or any privileges, or indults of whatever
   kind.
   CHAPTER IX.
   In what manner a right of patronage is to be proved, and to whom
   granted: what is not lawful for patrons. Unions of free benefices, to
   churches under right of patronage, prohibited. Rights of patronage, not
   legitimately obtained, are to be revoked.
   Even as it is not just to take away the legitimate rights of patronage,
   and to violate the pious intentions of the faithful in the institution
   thereof, so also neither is it to be suffered, that, under this
   pretext, ecclesiastical benefices be reduced to a state of servitude,
   as by many is impudently done. In order, therefore, that what reason
   requires may be observed in all things, the holy Synod ordains, that
   the title to the right of patronage shall be (derived) from a
   foundation, or an endowment ; which (title) shall be shown from an
   authentic document, and the other (proofs) required by law; or, also,
   by repeated presentations during a period of time so remote that it
   exceeds the memory of man; or, otherwise, according as the law directs.
   But as regards those persons, or communities, or universities, which
   that right is for the most part presumed to have been obtained by
   usurpation rather than otherwise, a more full and exact proof shall be
   required to establish a true title; nor shall the proof derived from
   time immemorial be otherwise of avail in their regard, unless-besides
   other things necessary for that proof--presentations, even continuous,
   during the space of not less than fifty years, at the least, all of
   which presentations have been carried into effect, shall be proved from
   authentic writings. All other rights of patronage, in regard to
   benefices, as well Secular as Regular, or parochial, or in regard of
   dignities, or any other benefices whatsoever, in a cathedral or
   col-[Page 265]legiate church; as also all faculties and privileges,
   whether granted so as to have the force of patronage, or, by virtue of
   any other right whatsoever, to nominate, elect, present to the said
   benefices when they become vacant, excepting the rights of patronage
   belong to cathedral churches, and excepting such other (rights of
   patronage) as belong to the emperor, to kings. or to those who possess
   kingdoms, and to other high and supreme princes who have the rights of
   sovereignty within their own dominions, as also those (rights of
   patronage) which have been bestowed in favour of (places of) general
   studies, shall be understood to wholly abrogated and made void,
   together with the quasi-possession which has followed thereupon. And
   benefices of this kind shall be conferred, as being free, by those who
   collate thereunto; and such appointment shall have full effect.
   Furthermore, it shall be lawful for the bishop to reject the persons
   whom the patrons have presented, if they be not fit. But if the
   institution belong to inferior (ecclesiastics), they (the presentees)
   shall nevertheless be examined by the bishop, pursuant to what has been
   elsewhere ordained by this holy Synod; otherwise the institution made
   by those inferiors shall be null and void.
   But the patrons of benefices, of whatsoever order and dignity they may
   be, be they (the patrons) even communities, universities, or any
   colleges whatsoever whether of clerics or laymen, shall not in any way,
   nor for any manner of cause or occasion, meddle with the receiving of
   the fruits, rents, or revenues of any benefices whatsoever, even though
   those benefices be truly, by foundation or endowment, under their right
   of patronage; but shall leave them to the free disposal of the rector,
   or of the beneficiary, any custom whatever to the contrary
   notwithstanding. Nor shall they presume to transfer to others, contrary
   to the decrees of the canons, the said right of patronage, by sale, or
   under any other title whatsoever: if they act otherwise, they shall be
   subjected to the penalties of excommunication and interdict, and shall
   be ipso jure deprived of the aforesaid right itself of patronage.
   Moreover, those accessions made [Page 266] by way of union of free
   benefices with churches that are subject to the right of patronage,
   even of laymen, whether those churches be parochial, or benefices of
   any other kind whatsoever, even such as are simple, or are dignities,
   or hospitals, in such wise that the free benefices aforesaid are made
   to be of the same nature as those unto which they are united, and are
   placed under the (same) right of patronage; such (accessions), if they
   have not as yet been carried into full effect, as also such as shall
   henceforth be made, at the instance of any person whatsoever, by
   whatsoever authority, be it even apostolic, shall, together with the
   said unions themselves, be regarded as having been obtained
   surreptitiously; notwithstanding any form of words therein employed, or
   any derogation which may be held as equivalent to being expressed; nor
   shall such unions be any more carried into execution, but the benefices
   themselves so united shall, when vacant, be freely conferred as
   previously.
   As regards those augmentations, which, having been made within the last
   forty years, have obtained their effect and a complete incorporation;
   such shall nevertheless be reviewed and examined by the Ordinaries, as
   the delegates of the Apostolic See; and those which shall be found to
   have been obtained by surreption, or obreption, shall, together with
   the unions, be declared invalid, and the benefices themselves shall be
   separated, and be conferred upon other persons.
   In like manner also whatsoever rights of patronage,-over churches, and
   any other benefices of whatsoever kind, even dignities which were
   previously free,-which have been acquired within the last forty years,
   or that may henceforth be acquired, whether through an increase of the
   endowment, or in consequence of erecting the building afresh, or from
   some other like cause, even though with the authority of the Apostolic
   See, shall be carefully taken cognizance of by the said Ordinaries, as
   delegates as aforesaid; and they shall not be hindered by the
   faculties, or privileges of any individual in regard thereof; but they
   shall wholly revoke such rights of patronage as they [Page 267] shall
   find not to have been legitimately established on account of some most
   evident necessity of the church, or benefice, or dignity; and they
   shall restore benefices of this kind to their former state of liberty;
   without injury however to the incumbents thereof, and after having
   restored to the patrons whatsoever they may have given on this score;
   any privileges, constitutions, and customs, even though immemorial,
   notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER X.
   Judges, unto whom causes may be committed by the Apostolie See, are to
   be nominated by the Synod: all judges shall terminate causes speedily.
   Forasmuch as on account of the malicious suggestions of suitors, and at
   times also by reason of the distance of places, a knowledge of the
   persons to whom causes are committed cannot be perfectly obtained; and
   hence causes are sometimes referred to judges on the spot who are not
   altogether fit; the holy Synod ordains, that, in each provincial, or
   diocesan, Synod, there shall be designated certain persons who have the
   qualifications required by the constitution of Boniface VIII., which
   begins, Statutum, and who are otherwise suited thereunto; that, to them
   also, besides the Ordinaries of the places, may henceforth be committed
   those ecclesiastical and spiritual causes, belonging to the
   ecclesiastical court, which may have to be delegated to their
   districts. And if one of these so designated shall happen to die in the
   interim, the Ordinary of the place, with the advice of the Chapter,
   shall substitute another in his stead, until the next provincial or
   diocesan Synod; in such sort that each diocese shall have at least
   four, or even more, persons approved of and qualified as above, to whom
   causes of this nature may be committed by any legate, or nuncio, and
   even by the Apostolic See: otherwise, after the said designation has
   been made, which the bishops shall forthwith transmit to the Sovereign
   Roman Pontiff, any delegations whatsoever of other [Page 268] judges,
   made to any others but the above, shall be regarded as surreptitious.
   The holy Synod furthermore admonishes both the Ordinaries and all other
   judges whatsoever to endeavour to terminate causes in as brief a period
   as possible; and to meet in every way, either by prescribing a given
   term, or by some other available method, the artifices of lawyers,
   whether in delaying the trial of the suit, or any other part of the
   judicial process.
   CHAPTER XI.
   Certain leases of Ecclesiastical Property or rights are prohibited;
   certain other such leases are annulled.
   It ordinarily brings great ruin upon churches, when the property
   thereof is, to the prejudice of those who succeed, leased out to others
   upon the present payment of a sum of money. Wherefore, all leases of
   this kind, if made for payments in advance, shall be in no wise
   considered valid to the prejudice of those who succeed; any indult or
   privelege whatsoever notwithstanding; nor shall such leases be
   confirmed in the Roman court, or elsewhere. Neither shall it be lawful,
   to farm out ecclesiastical jurisdictions, or the faculties of
   nominating, or of deputing vicars in spirituals ; nor for the lessees
   to exercise the above in person or by others; and any grants to the
   contrary, even though made by the Apostolic See, shall be esteemed
   surreptitious. As to leases of ecclesiastiscal things, even though
   confirmed by apostolical authority, the holy Synod declares those to be
   invalid, which, having been made within the last thirty years, for a
   long term, or as they are designated in some districts, for
   twenty-nine, or for twice twenty-nine years, shall be judged by the
   provincial Synod, or by the deputies thereof, to have been contracted
   to the injury of the church, and contrary to the ordinances of the
   canons.
   [Page 269]
   CHAPTER XII.
   Tithes to be paid in full: those withholding, or hindering, the payment
   thereof are to be excommunicated: the Rectors of Poor Churches are to
   be piously relieved.
   Those are not to be borne who, by various artifices, endeavour to
   withhold the tithes accruing to the churches ; nor those who rashly
   take possession of, and apply to their own use, the tithes which have
   to be paid by others; whereas the payment of tithes is due to God; and
   they who refuse to pay them, or hinder those who give them, usurp the
   property of another. Wherefore, the holy Synod enjoins on all, of
   whatsoever rank and condition they be, to whom it belongs to pay
   tithes, that they henceforth pay in full the tithes, to which they are
   bound in law, to the cathedral church, or to whatsoever other churches,
   or persons, they are lawfully due. And they who either withhold them,
   or hinder them (from being paid), shall be excommunicated; nor be
   absolved from this crime, until after full restitution has been made.
   It further exhorts all and each, that, of their Christian charity, and
   the duty which they owe to their own pastors, they grudge not, out of
   the good things that are given them by God, to assist bountifully those
   bishops and parish priests who preside over the poorer churches; to the
   praise of God, and to maintain the dignity of their own pastors who
   watch for them.
   CHAPTER XIII.
   The fourth of Funeral (dues) shall be paid to the Cathedral or Parish
   Churches.
   The holy Synod ordains, that in whatsoever places, forty years ago, a
   fourth, as it is called, of funerals, was accustomed [Page 270] to be
   paid to the cathedral, or parish, church, but has subsequently, by
   virtue of whatsoever privilege, been granted to other monasteries,
   hospitals, or to any other kind of pious places; the same shall
   henceforth, with all its rights, and in the same proportion as was
   formerly usual, be paid to the cathedral or parish church; all grants,
   graces, privileges, even those called mare magnum, or any others
   whatsoever, to the contrary notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER XIV.
   The manner of proceeding against Clerics who keep concubines is
   prescribed.
   How shameful a thing, and how unworthy it is of the name of clerics who
   have devoted themselves to the service of God, to live in the filth of
   impurity, and unclean bondage, the thing itself doth testify, in the
   common scandal of all the faithful, and the extreme disgrace entailed
   on the clerical order. To the end, therefore, that the ministers of the
   Church may be recalled to that continency and integrity of life which
   becomes them; and that the people may hence learn to reverence them the
   more, that they know them to be more pure of life: the holy Synod
   forbids all clerics whatsoever to dare to keep concubines, or any other
   woman of whom any suspicion can exist, either in their own houses, or
   elsewhere, or to presume to have any intercourse with them : otherwise
   they shall be punished with the penalties imposed by the sacred canons,
   or by the statutes of the (several) churches, But if, after being
   admonished by their superiors, they shall not abstain from these women,
   they shall be ipso facto deprived of the third part of the fruits,
   rents, and proceeds of all their benefices whatsoever, and pensions;
   which third part shall be applied to the fabric of the church, or to
   some other pious place, at the discretion of the bishop. If, however,
   persisting in the same crime, with the same or some [Page 271] other
   woman, they shall not even yet have obeyed upon a second admonition,
   not only shall they thereupon forfeit all the fruits and proceeds of
   their benefices and pensions, which shall be applied to the places
   aforesaid, but they shall also be suspended from the administration of
   the benefices themselves, for as long a period as shall seem fit to the
   Ordinary, even as the delegate of the Apostolic See. And if, having
   been thus suspended, they nevertheless shall not put away those women,
   or, even if they shall have intercourse with them, then shall they be
   for ever deprived of their ecclesiastical benefices, portions, offices,
   and pensions of whatsoever kind, and be rendered thenceforth incapable
   and unworthy of any manner of honours, dignities, benefices and
   offices, until, after a manifest amendment of life, it shall seem good
   to their superiors, for a cause, to grant them a dispensation. But if,
   after having once put them away, they shall have dared to renew the
   interrupted connexion, or to take to themselves other scandalous women
   of this sort, they shall, in addition to the penalties aforesaid, be
   smitten with the sword of excommunication. Nor shall any appeal, or
   exemption, hinder or suspend the execution of the aforesaid; and the
   cognizance of all the matters above-named shall not belong to
   archdeacons, or deans, or other inferiors, but to the bishops
   themselves, who may proceed without the noise and the formalities of
   justice, and by the sole investigation of the truth of the fact.
   As regards clerics who have not ecclesiastical benefices or pensions,
   they shall, according to the quality of their crime and contumacy, and
   their persistance therein, be punished, by the bishop himself, with
   imprisonment, suspension from their order, inability to obtain
   benefices, or in other ways, conformably with the sacred canons.
   Bishops also, if, which God forbid, they abstain not from crime of this
   nature, and, upon being admonished by the provincial Synod, they do not
   amend, shall be ipso facto suspended; and, if they persist therein,
   they shall be reported by the said Synod to the most holy Roman
   Pontiff, who shall punish them according to the nature of their guilt,
   even with deprivation if need be.
   [Page 272]
   CHAPTER XV.
   The illegitimate Sons of Clerics are excluded from certain Benefices
   and Pensions.
   That the memory of paternal incontinency may be banished as far as
   possible from places consecrated to God, where purity and holiness are
   most especially beseeming; it shall not be lawful for the sons of
   clerics, not born in lawful wedlock, to hold, in those churches wherein
   their fathers have, or had, an ecclesiastical benefice, any benefice
   whatsoever, even though a different one; nor to minister in any way in
   the said churches; nor to have pensions out of the revenues of
   benefices which their fathers hold, or have aforetime held. And if a
   father and son shall be found, at this present time, to hold benefices
   in the same church; the son shall be compelled to resign his benefice,
   or to exchange it for another out of that church, within the space of
   three months, otherwise he shall be ipso jure deprived thereof; and any
   dispensation in regard of the aforesaid shall be accounted
   surreptitious. Moreover, any reciprocal resignations which shall from
   this time forth be made by fathers who are clerics in favour of their
   sons, that one may obtain the benefice of the other, shall be wholly
   regarded as made in fraudulent evasion of this decree, and of the
   ordinances of the canons; nor shall the collations that may have
   followed, by virtue of resignations of this kind, or of any other
   whatsoever made fraudulently, be of avail to the said sons of clerics.
   CHAPTER XVI.
   Benefices with cure shall not be converted into simple Benefices: a
   suitable portion of the fruits shall be assigned to the Vicar who
   exercises the cure of souls.
   The holy Synod ordains, that those Secular ecclesiastical benefices, by
   whatsoever name they may be called, which, by [Page 273] their original
   institution, or in any other way whatever, have the cure of souls,
   shall not henceforth be converted into a simple benefice, even though a
   suitable portion be assigned to a perpetual vicar; notwithstanding any
   graces whatsoever which have not obtained their full effect. But, as
   regards those benefices wherein, contrary to the institution or
   foundation thereof, the cure of souls has been transferred to a
   perpetual vicar, even though they be found to have been in this state
   from time immemorial, if a suitable portion of the fruits have not been
   assigned to the vicar of the church, by what name soever he may be
   designated, the same shall be assigned as soon as possible, and within
   a year at the furthest from the end of the present Council, at the
   discretion of the Ordinary; pursuant to the form of the decree made
   under Paul III., of happy memory. But if this cannot conveniently be
   done, or if it be not done, within the said term, as soon as the
   benefice shall be vacant, either by the resignation or death of the
   vicar, or rector, or in whatsoever way either of the above shall vacate
   it, it shall receive again the cure of souls; the name of vicarage
   cease; and it shall be restored to its ancient state.
   CHAPTER XVII.
   Bishops shall maintain their dignity; nor conduct themseIves with
   unworthy servility towards the Ministers of Kings, towards Lords, or
   Barons.
   The holy Synod cannot but sorely grieve at hearing that certain
   bishops, forgetful of their own estate, do in no slight manner disgrace
   the pontifical dignity; comporting themselves with an unseemly kind of
   servility, both in church and out of it, before the ministers of kings,
   nobles, and barons; and, as if they were inferior ministers of the
   altar, not only most unworthily give them place; but even serve them in
   person. Wherefore, the holy Synod, detesting this and the like
   behaviour, doth, by renewing all the sacred canons, the General
   Councils, and [Page 274] other apostolical ordinances, which relate to
   the decorum and authority of the episcopal dignity, enjoin, that
   henceforth bishops abstain from the like; charging them that, both in
   church and out of it, having before their eyes their own rank and
   order, they every where bear in mind that they are fathers and pastors;
   charging also others, as well princes, as all persons whatsoever, to
   pay them paternal honour and due reverence.
   CHAPTER XVIII.
   The Canons shall be exactly observed: if, at any time, a dispensation
   is to be granted in regard thereof, it shall be done with the most
   mature deliberation.
   As it is expedient for the public good, to relax at times the restraint
   of law, thereby more completely to meet, for the common advantage, the
   cases and necessities which arise; even so, to dispense too often with
   the law, and to yield to petitioners on account of precedent, rather
   than upon any certain discrimination in regard of persons and
   circumstances, is nothing else but to open a way for each one to
   transgress the laws. Wherefore, be it known to all men, that the most
   sacred canons are to be exactly observed by all, and, as far as this is
   possible, without distinction. But if any urgent and just reason, and
   at times a greater good, shall require that some be dispensed with;
   this shall be granted, after the cause has been taken cognizance of,
   and after the most mature deliberation, and gratuitously, by all those
   soever to whom that dispensation appertains; and any dispensation
   granted otherwise shall be esteemed surreptitious.
   CHAPTER XIX.
   Duelling is prohibited under the most severe penalties.
   The detestable custom of duelling, introduced by the contrivance of the
   devil, that by the bloody death of the body, he [Page 275] may
   accomplish the ruin of the soul, shall be utterly exterminated from the
   Christian world. Any emperor, kings, dukes, princes, marquises, counts,
   and temporal lords by whatsoever other name entitled, who shall grant a
   place within their territories for single combat between Christians,
   shall be thereupon excommunicated, and shall be understood to be
   deprived of jurisdiction and dominion over any city, castle, or place,
   in or at which they have permitted the duel to take place, which they
   hold of the church ; and if those places be held as a fief they shall
   forthwith escheat to their direct lords.
   As to the persons who have fought, and those who are called their
   seconds (sponsors), they shall incur the penalty of excommunication,
   and the confiscation of all their property, and of perpetual infamy,
   and are to be punished as homicides, according to the sacred canons;
   and if they have perished in the conflict itself, they shall be for
   ever deprived of ecclesiastical sepulture. Those also who have given
   counsel in the ease of a duel, whether for the question of right, or
   fact, or have in any other way whatever persuaded any one thereunto, as
   also the spectators thereof, shall be subjected to the bond of
   excommunication, and of a perpetual malediction ; any privilege soever,
   or evil custom, though immemorial, notwithstanding.
   CHAPTER XX.
   The Immunities, Liberty, and other Rights of the Church are recommended
   to Secular Princes.
   The holy Synod being desirous that ecclesiastical discipline may not
   only be restored amongst the Christian people, but that it also may be
   for ever preserved sound and safe from all manner of adverse attempts;
   besides those things which It has ordained touching ecclesiastical
   persons, has thought fit, that Secular princes also be admonished of
   their duty; trusting that they,--as Catholics, whom God hath willed to
   be the protectors [Page 276] of holy faith and church,--will not only
   grant that to the church her own right be restored, but will also
   recall all their own subjects to due reverence towards the clergy,
   parish priests, and the superior orders; nor permit that their
   officers, or inferior magistrates, through any spirit of covetousness,
   or any heedlessness, violate that immunity of the church and of
   ecclesiastical persons, which, by the ordinance of God, and by the
   appointments of the canons has been established; but (see) that they
   render, conjointly with the princes themselves, due observance to the
   sacred constitutions of Sovereign Pontiffs and of Councils.
   It ordains, therefore, and enjoins, that the sacred canons, and all the
   General Councils, as also all other apostolic ordinances, published in
   favour of ecclesiastical persons, of the liberty of the Church, and
   against the violators thereof,--all which It also renews by this
   present decree,--be exactly observed by all men. And for this cause It
   admonishes the emperor, kings, republics, princes, and all and each of
   whatsoever state and dignity they be, that, the more bountifully they
   are adorned with temporal goods, and with power over others, the more
   religiously should they respect whatsoever is of ecclesiastical right,
   as belonging especially to God, and as being under the cover of His
   protection; and that they suffer not such to be injured by any barons,
   nobles, governors, or other temporal lords, and above all by their own
   immediate officers; but punish those severely, who obstruct her
   liberty, immunity, and jurisdiction; being themselves an example to
   them in regard of piety, religion, and the protection of the churches,
   in imitation of those most excellent and religious princes their
   predecessors, who not only defended from all injury from others, but,
   by their authority and munificence, in a special manner advanced the
   interests of their own church. Wherefore let each one herein discharge
   his duty carefully ; that so the divine worship may be devoutly
   celebrated, and prelates and other clerics remain, quietly and without
   hindrances, in their own residences and in the discharge of their
   duties, to the profit and edification of the people.
   [Page 277]
   CHAPTER XXI.
   In all things the authority of the Aposto1ic See shall remain
   untouched.
   Lastly, the holy Synod declares, that all and singular the things
   which, under whatsoever clauses and words, have been ordained in this
   sacred Council, in the matter of reformation of morals, and
   ecclesiastical discipline, as well under the Sovereign Pontiffs, Paul
   III., and Julius III., of happy memory, as under the most blessed Pius
   IV., have been so decreed, as that the authority of the Apostolic See
   both is, and is understood to be, untouched thereby
   DECREE FOR CONTINUING THE SESSION ON THE FOLLOWING DAY.
   Whereas all those things which had to be treated of in the present
   Session cannot, because of the lateness of the hour, be conveniently
   despatched; therefore, according as was resolved on by the Fathers in
   general congregation, the things which remain are deferred till
   tomorrow, in continuation of this same Session.
   CONTINUATION OF THE SESSION.
   On the fourth day of December.
   DECREE CONCERNING INDULGENCES.
   Whereas the power of conferring Indulgences was granted by Christ to
   the Church; and she has, even in the most ancient times, used the said
   power, delivered unto her of God; the sacred holy Synod teaches, and
   enjoins, that the use of Indulgences, for the Christian people most
   salutary, and approved of [Page 278] by the authority of sacred
   Councils, is to be retained in the Church; and It condemns with
   anathema those who either assert, that they are useless; or who deny
   that there is in the Church the power of granting them. In granting
   them, however, It desires that, in accordance with the ancient and
   approved custom in the Church, moderation be observed; lest, by
   excessive facility, ecclesastical discipline be enervated. And being
   desirous that the abuses which have crept therein, and by occasion of
   which this honourable name of Indulgences is blasphemed by heretics, be
   amended and corrected, It ordains generally by this decree, that all
   evil gains for the obtaining thereof,--whence a most prolific cause of
   abuses amongst the Christian people has been derived,--be wholly
   abolished. But as regards the other abuses which have proceeded from
   superstition, ignorance, irreverence, or from what soever other source,
   since, by reason of the manifold corruptions in the places and
   provinces where the said abuses are committed, they cannot conveniently
   be specially prohibited; It commands all bishops, diligently to
   collect, each in his own church, all abuses of this nature, and to
   report them in the first provincial Synod; that, after having been
   reviewed by the opinions of the other bishops also, they may forthwith
   be referred to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, by whose authority and
   prudence that which may be expedient for the universal Church will be
   ordained; that this the gift of holy Indulgences may be dispensed to
   all the faithful, piously, holily, and incorruptly.
   ON CHOICE OF MEATS; ON FASTS, AND FESTIVAL DAYS.
   The holy Synod furthermore exhorts, and, by the most holy advent of our
   Lord and Saviour, conjures all pastors, that, like good soldiers, they
   sedulously recommend to all the faithful all those things which the
   holy Roman Church, the mother and [Page 279] mistress of all churches,
   has ordained, as also those things which, as well in this Council, as
   in the other oecumenical Councils, have been ordained, and to use all
   diligence that they be observant of all thereof, and especially of
   those which tend to mortify the flesh, such as the choice of meats, and
   fasts ; as also those which serve to promote piety, such as the devout
   and religious celebration of festival days; often admonishing the
   people to obey those set over them (Heb. xiii. 17), whom they who hear,
   shall hear God as a rewarder, whereas they who contemn them, shall feel
   God himself as an avenger.
   ON THE INDEX OF BOOKS; ON THE CATECHISM, BREVIARY, AND MISSAL.
   The sacred and holy Synod, in the second Session celebrated under our
   most holy lord, Pius IV., commissioned certain chosen Fathers to
   consider what ought to be done touching various censures, and books
   either suspected or pernicious, and to report thereon to the said holy
   Synod; hearing now that the finishing hand has been put to that labour
   by those Fathers, which, however, by reason of the variety and
   multitude of books cannot be distinctly and conveniently judged of by
   the holy Synod; It enjoins that whatsoever has been by them done shall
   be laid before the most holy Roman Pontiff, that it may be by his
   judgment and authority terminated and made public. And it commands that
   the same be done in regard of the Catechism, by the Fathers to whom
   that work was consigned, and as regards the missal and breviary.
   ON THE PLACE OF AMBASSADORS.
   The holy Synod declares, that, by the place assigned to ambassadors, as
   well Ecclesiastics as Seculars, whether in Session, procession, or in
   any other acts whatsoever, no prejudice has been created in regard of
   any amongst them; but that all their [Page 280] own rights and
   prerogatives, and those of their own emperor, kings, republics, and
   princes are uninjured and untouched, and continue in the same state as
   they were before the present Council.
   ON RECEIVING AND OBSERVING THE DECREES OF THE COUNCIL.
   So great has been the calamitousness of these times, and such the
   inveterate malice of the heretics, that there has been nothing ever so
   clear in our statement of faith, nothing so surely settled, which they,
   at the instigation of the enemy of the human race, have not defiled by
   some sort of error. For which cause the holy Synod hath made it Its
   especial care to condemn and anathematize the principal errors of the
   heretics of our time, and to deliver and teach the true and Catholic
   doctrine; even as It has condemned, and anathematized, and decreed.
   And whereas so many bishops, summoned from the various provinces of the
   Christian world, cannot be absent for so long a time without great loss
   to the flock entrusted to them, and without universal danger ; and
   whereas no hope remains that the heretics, after being so often
   invited, even with the public faith which they desired, and after being
   so long expected, will come hither later; and it is therefore necessary
   to put an end at length to the sacred Council: it now remains for It to
   admonish in the Lord all princes, as It hereby does, so to afford their
   assistance as not to permit the things which it has decreed to be
   corrupted or violated by heretics; but that they be by them and all
   others devoutly received, and faithfully observed. And should any
   difficulty arise in regard of receiving those decrees, or should
   anything be met with, which it does not believe, requiring explanation
   or definition, the holy Synod trusts that, besides the other remedies
   appointed in this Council, the most blessed Roman Pontiff will make it
   his care that, for the glory of God and the tranquillity of the Church,
   the necessities of the provinces be provided for, either by summoning
   particularly out of the provinces where the difficulties shall have
   arisen, those [Page 281] persons whom he shall deem it expedient (to
   employ) in treating of the said matters; or even by the celebration of
   a general Council, if he judge it necessary; or in such other way as
   shall seem to him most suitable.
   ON RECITING, IN SESSION, THE DECREES OF THE COUNCIL UNDER PAUL III. AND
   JULIUS III.
   Forasmuch as, at divers times, as well under Paul III., as under Julius
   III., of happy memory, many things have, in this sacred Council, been
   ordained and defined touching dogmas and reformation of manners; the
   holy Synod wills that they be now recited and read.
   They were recited.
   ON THE CLOSE OF THE COUNCIL, AND ON SUING FOR CONFIRMATION FROM OUR
   MOST HOLY LORD.
   Most illustrious lords and most reverend Fathers, doth it please you,
   that, to the praise of Almighty God, an end be put to this sacred
   oecumenical Synod? and that the confirmation of all and singular the
   things which have therein been decreed and defined, as well under the
   Roman Pontiffs, Paul III., and Julius III., of happy memory, as under
   our most holy lord Pius IV., be requested, in the name of this holy
   Synod, by the presidents, and the Legates of the Apostolic See, from
   the most blessed Roman Pontiff?
   They answered: It pleaseth us.
   Afterwards, the most illustrious and most reverend Cardinal Morone, the
   first Legate and President, blessing the holy Synod said: After having
   given thanks to God, most reverend Fathers, go in peace.
   They answered: Amen.
   ACCLAMATIONS OF THE FATHERS AT THE CLOSE OF THE COUNCIL.
   The Cardinal of Lorraine. To the most blessed Pius, Pope, and our lord,
   pontiff of the holy and universal Church, many years and eternal
   memory.
   Answer of the Fathers. O Lord God, do Thou very long preserve the most
   holy Father to thy church: for many years.
   The Cardinal. To the souls of the most blessed Soveriegn Pontiffs, Paul
   III., and Julius III., by whose authority this sacred general Council
   was begun, peace from the Lord, and eternal glory, and happiness in the
   light of the saints.
   Answer. Be their memory in benediction.
   The Cardinal. Of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and of the most serene
   kings, who have promoted and protected this universal Council, be the
   memory in benediction.
   Answer. Amen, Amen.
   The Cardinal. To the most serene Emperor Ferdinand, ever august,
   orthodox, and pacific, and to all our kings, republics, and princes,
   many years.
   Answer. Preserve, O Lord, the pious and Christian emperor: Oh, Heavenly
   Emperor, protect earthly kings, the preservers of the right faith.
   The Cardinal. To the Legates of the Apostolic Roman See, and presidents
   of this Synod, many thanks and many years.
   Answer. Many thanks: the Lord reward them.
   The Cardinal. To the most reverend cardinals, and most illustrious
   ambassadors.
   Answer. Many thanks; many years.
   The Cardinal. To the most holy bishops, life, and a happy return to
   their own churches.
   Answer. To the heralds of truth perpetual memory; to the orthodox
   senate many years.
   The Cardinal. The sacred and holy oecumenical Synod of Trent: let us
   confess the faith thereof; let us ever keep the decrees thereof.
   Answer. Ever let us confess, ever keep.
   [Page 283] The Cardinal. We all thus believe; we all think the very
   same ; we all, consenting and embracing (them), subscribe. This is the
   faith of blessed Peter, and of the apostles: this is the faith of the
   Fathers: This is the faith of the Orthodox.
   Answer. Thus we believe; thus we think; thus we subscribe.
   The Cardinal. To these decrees adhering may we be made worthy of the
   mercies and grace of the first and great supreme priest, Jesus Christ
   God; our inviolate Lady, the holy mother of God, also interceding, and
   all the saints.
   Answer. So be it: so be it. Amen, Amen.
   Cardinal. Anathema to all heretics.
   Answer Anathema, anathema.
   After this, it was enjoined on all the Fathers, by the Legates and
   presidents, under pain of excommunication, that, before departing from
   the city of Trent, they should subscribe with their own hand the
   decrees of the Council, or approve thereof by some public instrument;
   all of whom subsequently subscribed, and they were in number CCLV; to
   wit, four legates, two cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five
   archbishops, one hundred and sixty-eight bishops, seven abbots,
   thirty-nine proctors of absent (prelates) with lawful commission, seven
   generals.
   Praise be to God.
   It agrees with the original: in faith whereof we have subscribed:
   I, Angelus MASSARELLI, bishop of Telesia, secretary of the sacred

   CONFIRMATION OF THE COUNCIL.
   We, Alexander di Farnese, cardinal-deacon of Saint Lawrence in Damaso,
   vice-chancellor of the holy Roman Church, [Page 284] do certify and
   attest, that, on this day, being Wednesday, the twenty-sixth of
   January, MDLXIV, in the fifth year of the pontificate of our most holy
   lord Pius IV., by the providence of God, Pope, the most reverend my
   lords, the cardinals Morone and Simonetta, lately returned from the
   sacred Council of Trent, whereat they had presided as Legates of the
   Apostolic See, did, in a secret consistory, held at St. Peter's,
   petition our said most holy lord as follows:
   Most blessed Father; in a decree, concerning the closing of the
   oecumenical Council of Trent, published the day before the nones of
   December last, it was ordained, that, through the presidents and
   Legates of your Holiness, and of the holy Apostolic See, confirmation
   should be requested from your Holiness, in the name of the said
   Council, of all and singular the things which were therein decreed and
   defined, as well under Paul III., and Julius III., of happy memory, as
   under your Holiness. Wherefore, we, John, Cardinal Morone, and Louis,
   Cardinal Simonetta, who were then Legates and presidents, wishing to
   execute what was appointed in that decree, do humbly petition in the
   name of the said oecumenical Council of Trent, that your Holiness would
   vouchsafe to confirm all and singular the things which have therein
   been decreed and defined, as well under Paul III., and Julius III., of
   happy memory, as under your Holiness.
   Upon hearing which, his Holiness, having looked at and read the tenour
   of the said decree, and having takein the advice of the most reverend
   lords, the cardinals, replied in these words : Acceding to the petition
   made to us, by the Legates aforesaid, in the name of the oecumenical
   Council of Trent, touching the confirmation thereof, We, with apostolic
   authority, and with the advice and assent of our venerable brethren the
   cardinals, having previously had a mature deliberation with them, do
   confirm all and singular the things which have been decreed and defined
   in the said Council, as well under Paul III., and Julius III., of happy
   memory, as during the time of our pontificate; and we [Page 285]
   command that the same be received and inviolably observed by all the
   faithful of Christ; In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
   the Holy Ghost. Amen.
   So it is.
   A. Cardinal FARNESE,
   Vice-Chancellor
   BULL OF OUR MOST HOLY LORD PIUS IV., BY PROVIDENCE OF GOD, POPE,
   TOUCHING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE OECUMENICAL (AND) GENERAL COUNCIL OF
   TRENT.
   Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the perpetual memory
   hereof.
   Blessed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
   mercies, and the God of all comfort, who hath vouchsafed to look down
   upon His holy Church, agitated and tossed by so many storms and
   tempests, and, whilst it was day by day more sorely distressed, hath at
   length brought relief thereunto by a suitable and wished-for remedy. To
   extirpate very many and most pernicious heresies, to correct manners,
   and to restore ecclesiastical discipline, to procure time peace and
   concord of the Christiain people, an oecumenical and general Council
   had been, a long time previously, indicted by our predecessor, Paul
   III., of pious memory, and had been begun by holding several Sessions.
   Having been, by his successor, recalled to the same city, the Council,
   after several Sessions had been celebrated, could not, on account of
   various impediments and difficulties which supervened, be even then
   brought to a conclusion: it was, therefore, for a long time
   interrupted, not without the greatest grief on the part of all persons
   of piety, whilst the Church daily more and more implored that remedy.
   But we, upon having entered upon the government of the Apostolic See,
   undertook to accomplish so necessary and salutary a work, even as our
   pastoral solicitude admonished us; [Page 286] trusting in the Divine
   Mercy, and aided by the pious zeal of our most beloved son in Christ,
   Ferdinand, Emperor elect of the Romans, and by that of other Christian
   kings, republics, and princes, we have at length attained to that which
   we have not ceased to labour after by daily and nightly watchfulness,
   and which we have assiduously besought of the Father of lights. For
   whereas a most numerous assembly of bishops and of other distinguished
   prelates, and one worthy of an oecumenical Council, had, upon being
   convoked by our letters, and impelled also by their own piety, been
   gathered together from all sides out of the nations of Christendom, at
   the said city; together with whom were very many other persons of
   piety, pre-eminent for skill in sacred letters, and knowledge of divine
   and human law; the Legates of the Apostolic See presiding in the said
   Synod; ourselves so favourable to the liberty of the Council, as even
   to have, by letters written to our Legates, voluntarily left the said
   Council free to determine concerning matters properly reserved to the
   Apostolic See; such things as remained to be treated of, defined, and
   ordained, touching the sacraments and other matters, which seemed to be
   necessary for confuting heresies, removing abuses, and amending morals,
   were by the sacred and holy Synod with the most perfect liberty and
   diligence, treated of, and accurately and most deliberately defined,
   explained, and ordained, which being completed, the Council was brought
   to a close with so great unanimity on the part of all who assisted
   thereat, that it was plain that such agreement was the Lord's doing,
   and it was very wonderful in our eyes, and those of all. For which so
   singular a bounty, We at once appointed solemn processions in this good
   city, which were assisted at with great piety by the clergy and people;
   and We made it our care that the thanksgivings so justly due should be
   paid to the divine majesty; forasmuch as the issue of that Council has
   brought with it a great and well nigh assured hope that greater fruits
   will day by day be derived unto the Church from the decrees and
   constitutions thereof.
   [Page 287] And whereas the said holy Synod, in its reverence towards
   the Apostolic See, and following also in the traces of the ancient
   Councils, has, in a decree made thereon in public Session, requested of
   us the confirmation of all Its decrees, passed in our time and that of
   our predecessors; We, being made acquainted with the request of the
   said Synod, first by the letters of our Legates, then, upon their
   return, by what they diligently reported in the name of the Synod;
   after mature deliberation had thereon with our venerable brethren the
   cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and, above all, having invoked the
   assistance of the Holy Spirit; after that we had ascertained that all
   those decrees were Catholic, and useful and salutary to the Christian
   people, We, to the praise of Almighty God, with the advice and assent
   of our brethren aforesaid, have this day, in our secret consistory,
   confirmed by Apostolic authority all and singular those decrees, and
   have ordained that the same be received and observed by all the
   faithful of Christ; as also, for the clearer information of all men, We
   do, by the tenour of this letter, confirm them, and ordain that they be
   received and observed.
   And, in virtue of holy obedience, and under the penalties by the sacred
   canons appointed, and others more grievous, even those of deprivaiton,
   to be inflicted at our discretion, We do also command all and each of
   our venerable brethren, the patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and all
   other prelates whatsoever of the churches, of what estate, grade, order
   and dignity soever, they may be, even though distinguished with the
   honour of the cardinalate, diligently to observe the said decrees and
   statutes in their own churches, cities, and dioceses, both in their
   courts of justice and elsewhere, and to cause the same to be inviolably
   observed, each by his own subjects, in so far as they are in any way
   concerned therein; silencing gainsayers, and the refractory, by means
   of judicial sentences, and by the censures also and ecclesiastical
   penalties contained in the said decrees; calling in also, if need be,
   the help of the secular arm. And, by the bowels of the mercy of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, We admonish and conjure our said most beloved son
   the emperor elect, and the Christian kings, republics, and princes,
   with that piety with which they assisted, by their ambassadors, at the
   Council, with [Page 288] the same piety and equal zeal, for the sake of
   God's honour, and the salvation of their people, in reverence also
   towards the Apostolic See, and the sacred Synod, to support, when
   needful, with their assistance and countenance, the prelates in
   executing and observing the decrees of the said Council ; and not to
   permit opinions adverse to the sound and salutary doctrine of the
   Council to be received by the people who are under their sway, but
   utterly to interdict such.
   Furthermore, in order to avoid the perversion and confusion which might
   arise, if each one were allowed, as he might think fit, to publish his
   own commentaries and interpretations on the decrees of the Council ;
   We, by apostolic authority, forbid all men, as well ecclesiastics, of
   whatsoever order, condition, and rank they may be, as also laymen, with
   whatsoever honor and power invested ; prelates, to wit, under pain of
   being interdicted from entering the church, and all others whomsoever
   they be, under pain of excommunication incurred by the fact, to
   presume, without our authority to publish, in any form, any
   commentaries, glosses, annotations, scholia, or any kind of
   interpretation whatsoever of the decrees of the said Council ; or to
   settle anything in regard thereof, under any plea whatsoever, even
   under pretext of greater corroboration of the decrees, or the more
   perfect execution thereof, or under any other colour whatsoever. But if
   anything therein shall seem to any one to have been expressed and
   ordained in an obscure manner, and it shall appear to stand in need on
   that account of an interpretation or decision, let him Go up to the
   place which the Lord hath chosen; to wit, to the Apostolic See, the
   mistress of all the faithful, whose authority the holy Synod also has
   so reverently acknowledged. For, if any difficulties and controversies
   shall arise in regard of the said decrees, We reserve them to be by Us
   cleared up and decided, even as the holy Synod has Itself in like
   manner decreed ; being prepared, as that Synod has justly expressed Its
   confidence in regard to Us, to provide for the necessities of all the
   provinces, in such manner as shall [Page 289] seem to Us most suitable;
   declaring that whatsoever may be attempted to the contrary in this
   matter, whether wittingly or unwittingly, by any one, by what authority
   soever, is, notwithstanding, null and void. And that these things may
   come to the knowledge of all men, and that no one may use the excuse of
   ignorance; We will and ordain, that, in the Vatican Basilica of the
   prince of the apostles, and in the Lateran church, at the time when the
   people is wont to assemble there to be present at the solemnization of
   masses, this letter be publicly read in a loud voice by certain
   officers of our court; and that, after having been read, it be affixed
   to the doors of those churches, and also to the gates of the Apostolic
   Chancery, and to the usual place in the Campo di Fiore; and be there
   left for some time, to be read by and to come to the knowledge of all
   men. And when removed thence, copies being, according to custom, left
   in those same places, it shall be committed to the press in our good
   city, that so it may be more conveniently made known throughout the
   provinces and kingdoms of the Christian name. And we ordain and decree,
   that, without any doubt, faith be given to copies thereof written or
   subscribed by the hand of a public notary, and guaranteed by the seal
   and signature of some person constituted in ecclesiastical dignity. Let
   no one, therefore, infringe this our letter of confirmation, monition,
   inhibition, reservation, will, mandate, and decree, or with rash daring
   go contrary thereunto. But if any one shall presume to attempt this,
   let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of
   His blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's,
   in the year of the Lord's Incarnation One thousand five hundred and
   sixty-four, on the seventh of the calends of February, in the fifth
   year of our pontificate.
