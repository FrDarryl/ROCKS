The First General Council of Lyons, 1245

INTRODUCTION

   The dispute, distinctive of the Middle Ages, between the papacy and the
   empire became very serious under Pope Innocent IV and Emperor Frederick
   II. Already in 1240 Pope Gregory IX had tried to define the questions
   between the two powers by calling a general council, but Frederick II
   by arms had prevented the council from meeting. When Innocent IV
   succeeded as pope in 1243 he gave his earnest attention to renewing
   this policy. He was able to make his way in 1244 to Lyons, which was
   outside the direct authority of the emperor, and there proclaimed a
   council. Some letters of summons exist, dated 3 January 1245 and the
   days following, in which the purpose of the council is stated thus:
   "That the church, through the salutary counsel of the faithful and
   their fruitful help, may have the dignity of its proper position; that
   assistance may speedily be brought to the unhappy crisis in the holy
   Land and the sufferings of the eastern empire; that a remedy may be
   found against the Tartars and other enemies of the faith and
   persecutors of the christian people; further, for the issue between the
   church and the emperor; for these reasons we think that the kings of
   the earth, the prelates of the church and other princes of the world
   should be summoned". The chief purposes for which the council was
   called -- and from the beginning it was called "general" -- seem to
   have been political ones.
   When the council opened on 26 June 1245, in a meeting which was
   probably only preparatory, there were present three patriarchs and
   about 150 bishops besides other religious and secular persons, among
   whom was the Latin emperor of Constantinople. Emperor Frederick II sent
   a legation headed by Thaddaeus of Suessa. Many bishops and prelates
   were unable to attend the council because they had been prevented by
   the invasions of the Tartars in the east or the attacks of the Saracens
   in the holy Land, or because Frederick II had intimidated them
   (especially the Sicilians and Germans). Thus it was that the four chief
   parties of the council were the French and probably the Spanish,
   English and Italian. In the three sessions which were held during the
   council (26 June, 5 and 17 July) the fathers, not without hesitation
   and dispute, had to treat especially of Frederick II. There seems to
   have been a bitter conflict between Innocent IV on the one side and
   Thaddaeus of Suessa on the other. The sources, especially the Brevis
   nota and Matthew Paris, tell us clearly about the nature of the
   discussion and the determined attitude of the pope, who induced the
   council to depose the emperor at the session on 17 July 1245, a matter
   that appeared unprecedented to the fathers themselves. The council on
   this question shows us clearly the critical position reached by the
   medieval theory and practice of ruling a christian state, which rested
   on a double order of authority.
   In the same session of 17 July the council also approved some strictly
   legal constitutions and others on usury, the Tartars and the Latin
   east. But the council, unlike the previous councils of the Middle Ages,
   did not approve canons concerning the reform of the church and the
   condemnation of heresy. Enthusiasm for the Gregorian reform movement
   seems to have died down completely. The council, however, concerned
   itself with promoting and confirming the general canonical legislation
   for religious life.
   The transmission of the text of the constitutions is involved and still
   partly obscure. Only in recent times has it been realised that the
   authentic and definitive drawing up of the constitutions, and their
   promulgation, took place after the council. This collection consists of
   22 constitutions, all of which are of a legal nature, and was sent to
   the universities by Innocent IV on 25 August 1245 (Coll. I). A second
   collection of 12 decrees was published by Innocent IV on 21 April 1246
   (Coll. II). A final collection (Coll. I + II and 8 other decrees) was
   issued on 9 September 1253 (Coll. III), and was included (except for
   const. 2) in Liber Sextus in 1298. Coll. I, however, is not identical
   with the constitutions of the council. For in it can be found neither
   the condemnation of Frederick II, which seems to have been the chief
   matter of the council, nor the five constitutions pertaining to the
   important questions introduced by Innocent IV at the opening of the
   council, namely those concerned with the Tartars, the Latin east and
   the crusades.
   Stephen Kuttner has shown that the constitutions have been transmitted
   to us through three versions: the conciliar version (= M), known
   principally from the chronicle of Matthew of Paris (const. 1-19, and
   the const. on the crusade corresponding to R 17); the intermediate
   version ( = R), known from the register of Innocent IV (const. 1-17, of
   which const. 1-12 correspond to M 1-10); and the definitive version ( =
   Coll. I), containing two constitutions (18 and 22) which are absent
   from the other versions, but lacking the constitutions not directly
   concerned with the law (R 13-17).
   Indeed, the origins of the constitutions must be placed before the
   council, as is shown by an earlier version of constitutions M 13, 15
   and 19, antedating the council. Evidently the council fathers were
   discussing matters which had already been partly worked out, and it was
   somewhat later that the constitutions acquired their more accurate and
   definite legal form.
   The constitutions taken from Matthew Paris were edited in Bn[1] III/2
   (1606) 1482-1489. Those from the register of Innocent IV were edited in
   Rm IV (1612) 73-78. All later editions followed Rm. However, I. H.
   Boehmer and Msi[1] 2 (1748) 1073-1098 (afterwards in Msi 23 (1779)
   651-674) printed Coll. III. in addition. Coll. I, as such, has never
   been edited; but there exists both an indirect transmission (Coll. I +
   II, Coll. III, Liber Sextus) and a direct, single-family transmission
   through eight manuscript codices: Arras, Bibl. Municipale 541;
   Bratislava, formerly Cathedral Library, 13; Innsbruck,
   Universitaetsbibl., 70, fos. 335v-338v (= I); Kassel, Landesbibl., Iur.
   fol. 32; Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibl., Lat. 8201e, fos. 219v-220r,
   and Lat. 9654; Trier, Stadtbibl., 864; Vienna, Nationalbibl., 2073,
   fos. 238v-242v (= W).
   Our edition of the constitutions tries to give all the documents truly
   belonging to the council. Coll. I has been taken as the base, and
   variants from M and R are set out in the critical apparatus. The text
   of Coll. I has been established from codices I and W, which we have
   seen in microfilm. With regard to M, the edition of H.R. Luard has been
   used. With regard to R, we have examined directly the register of
   Innocent IV. We think, moreover, that the last five constitutions in R
   (13-17, 17 is also in M and Annales de Burton) should also be included
   among the constitutions of the council, even though they were not
   included in Coil. I. We have printed the text of these five
   constitutions from the register of Innocent IV;as regards const. 17 we
   have also compared M and Annales de Burton ( = Bu).
   We think that the bull of deposition of the emperor Frederick II must
   be considered a statute of the council, and we place this in front of
   the constitutions. The transmission of the text of the bull is
   involved, and the editions are very faulty. There are three copies of
   the bull: Vatican Archives, AA. Arm. I-XVIII, 171 (= V); Paris,
   Archives Nationales, L 245 no. 84 (= P); Lyons, Archives du Rhone,
   Fonds du chap. primat., Arm. Cham. vol. XXVII no. 2 (= L). Of these
   only V has been published. Other transcriptions of the bull are given
   in the register of Innocent IV, in some chronicles (Matthew of Paris,
   Annals of Plasencia, Annals of Melrose), in collections of decretals,
   and in some more recent publications (Bzovius). Our edition takes as
   its base V, P and L.
   {The headings are added by the hypertext editor. Endnotes are given in
   parenthesis {}. They should be noted for variant readings and
   numberings.}

Bull Deposing The Emperor Frederick II

   Innocent {1}, bishop, servant of the servants of God, in the presence
   of the holy council, for an everlasting record.
   Raised, though unworthy, to the highest point of the apostolic dignity,
   by the will of the divine majesty, we ought to exercise a watchful,
   diligent and wise care of all Christians, to examine with close
   attention the merits of individuals and to weigh them in the balance of
   prudent deliberation, so that we may raise by suitable favours those
   whom a rigorous and just examination shows to be worthy, and depress
   the guilty with due penalties, weighing always the merit and the reward
   in a fair scale, repaying to each the amount of penalty or favour
   according to the nature of his work. Indeed since the terrible conflict
   of war has afflicted some countries of the christian world for a long
   time, as we desired with our whole heart the peace and tranquillity of
   the holy church of God and of all the christian people in general, we
   thought that we should send special ambassadors, men of great
   authority, to {2} the secular prince who was the special cause of this
   discord and suffering. He was the man whom our predecessor of happy
   memory, Pope Gregory {3}, had bound by anathema because of his
   excesses. The ambassadors we sent, men eager for his salvation, were
   our venerable brethren Peter of Albano {4}, at that time bishop of
   Rouen, William of Sabina {5}, at that time bishop of Modena, and our
   beloved son William {6}, cardinal-priest of the basilica of the Twelve
   Apostles and at that time abbot of Saint Facundus. Through them we
   proposed to him, because we and our brethren desired to have peace with
   him and with all people, as far as lay in our power, that we were ready
   to grant peace and tranquillity to him and also to the rest of the
   whole world.
   Because the restitution of the prelates, clerics and all others whom he
   kept in captivity, and of all both clerics and laymen whom he had taken
   in the galleys7, could especially lead the way to peace, we asked and
   begged him through our said ambassadors to set these prisoners free.
   This both he and his envoys had promised before we had been called to
   the apostolic office. Further we informed him that our ambassadors were
   ready on our behalf to hear and treat of peace, and even of
   satisfaction, should the emperor be ready to make it with regard to all
   those things for which he had incurred excommunication; and besides to
   offer him that if the church had injured him in anything contrary to
   justice-though it did not believe it had done so -- it was ready to put
   it to rights and restore the proper position. If he said that he had
   harmed the church in nothing unjustly, or that we had harmed him
   contrary to justice, we were ready to call the kings, prelates and
   princes, both ecclesiastical and lay, to some safe place where either
   by themselves or by official representatives they might come together,
   and that the church was ready on the advice of the council to satisfy
   him if in anything it had harmed him, and to recall the sentence of
   excommunication if it had been brought unjustly against him, and with
   all clemency and mercy, in so far as it could be done without offence
   to God and its own honour, to receive satisfaction from him for the
   injuries and wrongs done to the church itself and its members through
   him.
   The church also wished to secure peace for his friends and supporters
   and the enjoyment of full security, so that for this reason they should
   never incur any danger. But though in our relations with him, for the
   sake of peace, we have always taken care to rely on paternal
   admonitions and gentle entreaty, yet he, following the hardness of
   Pharaoh and blocking his ears like an asp, with proud obstinacy and
   obstinate pride has despised such prayers and admonitions. Furthermore
   on the Maundy Thursday previous to that which has just passed, in our
   presence and that of our brother cardinals, and in the presence of our
   dear son in Christ, the illustrious emperor of Constantinople {8}, and
   of a considerable gathering of prelates, before the senate and people
   of Rome and a very large number of others, who on that day because of
   its solemnity had come to the apostolic see from different parts of the
   world, he guaranteed on oath, through the noble count Raymond of
   Toulouse, and Masters Peter de Vinea and Thaddaeus of Suessa, judges of
   his court, his envoys and proctors who had in this matter a general
   commission, that he would keep our commands and those of the church.
   However afterwards he did not fulfil what he had sworn. Indeed it is
   likely enough that he took the oath, as can be clearly gathered from
   his following actions, with the express intention of mocking rather
   than obeying us and the church, since after more than a year he could
   not be reconciled to the bosom of the church, nor did he trouble to
   make satisfaction for the losses and injuries he had caused it, even
   though he was asked to do this. For this reason, as we are unable
   without giving offence to Christ to bear any longer his wickedness, we
   are compelled, urged on by our conscience, justly to punish him.
   To say nothing about his other crimes, he has committed four of the
   greatest gravity, which cannot be hidden by evasion. For, he has often
   failed to keep his oath; he deliberately broke the peace previously
   established between the church and the empire; he committed a sacrilege
   by causing the arrest of cardinals of the holy Roman church and of
   prelates and clerics of other churches, both religious and secular, who
   were coming to the council which our predecessor had decided to summon;
   he is also suspect of heresy, by proofs which are not light or doubtful
   but clear and inescapable.
   It is clear that he has often been guilty of perjury. For, once when he
   was staying in Sicily, before he had been elected to the dignity of
   emperor, in the presence of Gregory of happy memory, cardinal deacon of
   Saint Theodore {9} and legate of the apostolic see, he took an oath of
   loyalty to our predecessor Pope Innocent10 of happy memory and his
   successors and the Roman church, in return for the grant of the kingdom
   of Sicily made to him by this same church. Likewise, as is said, after
   he had been elected to that same dignity and had come to Rome, in the
   presence of Innocent and his brother cardinals and before many others,
   he renewed that oath, making his pledge of hommage in the pope's hands.
   Then, when he was in Germany he swore to the same Innocent, and on his
   death to our predecessor Pope Honorius {11} of happy memory and his
   successors and the Roman church itself, in the presence of the princes
   and nobles of the empire, to preserve as far as was in his power, the
   honours, rights and possessions of the Roman church, and loyally to
   protect them, and without difficulty to see to the restoration of
   whatever came into his hands, expressly naming the said possessions in
   the oath: afterwards he confirmed this when he had gained the imperial
   crown. But he has deliberately broken these three oaths, not without
   the brand of treachery and the charge of treason. For against our
   predecessor Gregory and his brother cardinals, he has dared to send
   threatening letters to these cardinals, and in many ways to slander
   Gregory before his brother cardinals, as is clear from the letters
   which he then sent to them, and almost throughout the whole world, as
   it is said, he has presumed to defame him.
   He also personally caused the arrest of our venerable brother Otto
   {12}, bishop of Porto, at that time cardinal deacon of Saint Nicholas
   in Carcere Tulliano, and James of happy memory, bishop of Palestrina
   {13}, legates of the apostolic see, noble and important members of the
   Roman church. He had them stripped of all their goods, and after more
   than once being led shamefully through different places, committed to
   prison. Furthermore this privilege which our lord Jesus Christ handed
   to Peter and in him to his successors, namely, whatever you bind on
   earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall
   be loosed in heaven, in which assuredly consists the authority and
   power of the Roman church, he did his best to diminish or take away
   from the church itself, writing that he did not fear Pope Gregory's
   condemnations. For, not only by despising the keys of the church he did
   not observe the sentence of excommunication pronounced against him, but
   also by himself and his officials he prevented others from observing
   that and other sentences of excommunication and interdict, which he
   altogether set at nought. Also without fear he seized territories of
   the said Roman church, namely the Marches, the Duchy, Benevento, the
   walls and towers of which he has caused to be demolished, and others
   with few exceptions in parts of Tuscany and Lombardy and certain other
   places which he holds, and he still keeps hold of them. And as if it
   were not enough that he was clearly going against the aforesaid oaths
   by such presumption, either by himself or through his officials he has
   forced the inhabitants of these territories to break their oath,
   absolving them in fact, since he cannot do it in law, from the oaths of
   loyalty by which they were bound to the Roman church, and making them
   nonetheless forswear the said loyalty and take an oath of loyalty to
   himself.
   It is absolutely clear that he is the violator of the peace. For,
   previously at a time when peace had been restored between himself and
   the church, he took an oath before the venerable John of Abbeville
   {14}, bishop of Sabina, and Master Thomas {15}, cardinal priest of the
   title of Saint Sabina, in the presence of many prelates, princes and
   barons, that he would observe and obey exactly and without reserve all
   the commands of the church with regard to those things for which he had
   incurred excommunication, after the reasons of that excommunication had
   been set out in order before him. Then, when remitting every sanction
   and penalty to the Teutonic knights, the inhabitants of the kingdom of
   Sicily and any others who had supported the church against him, he
   guaranteed on his soul through Thomas, count of Acerra, that he would
   never wrong them or cause them to be wronged on the ground that they
   had supported the church. But he did not keep the peace and violated
   these oaths without any sense of shame that he was guilty of perjury.
   For afterwards he caused some of these very men, both nobles and
   others, to be captured; and after stripping them of all their goods, he
   had their wives and children imprisoned; and contrary to the promise he
   had made to bishop John of Sabina and cardinal Thomas, he invaded the
   lands of the church without hesitation, even though they promulgated in
   his presence that henceforth he would incur sentence of excommunication
   if he broke his promise. And when these two ecclesiastics, by their
   apostolic authority, ordered that neither by himself nor through others
   should he hinder postulations, elections or confirmations of churches
   and monasteries in the kingdom of Sicily from being held freely in
   future according to the statutes of the general council; that
   henceforth nobody in the same kingdom should impose taxes or
   collections on ecclesiastical persons or their property; that in the
   same kingdom no cleric or ecclesiastical person should in future be
   brought before a lay judge in a civil or criminal case, except for a
   suit in civil law over feudal rights; and that he should make adequate
   compensation to the Templars, Hospitallers and other ecclesiastical
   persons for the loss and injury inflicted upon them; he nevertheless
   refused to obey these commands.
   It is clear that in the kingdom of Sicily eleven or more archiepiscopal
   and many episcopal sees, abbacies and other churches are at present
   vacant, and through his agency, as is patent, these have long been
   deprived of prelates, to their own grave loss and the ruin of souls.
   And though perhaps in some churches of the kingdom elections have been
   held by chapters, since however they have elected clerics who are
   Frederick's dependants, it can be concluded in all probability that
   they did not have a free power of choice. Not only has he caused the
   possessions and goods of churches in the kingdom to be seized at his
   pleasure, but also the crosses, thuribles, chalices and other sacred
   treasures of theirs, and silk cloth, to be carried off, like one who
   sets at nought divine worship, and although it is said that they have
   been restored in part to the churches, yet a price was first exacted
   for them. Indeed clerics are made to suffer in many ways by collections
   and taxes, and not only are they dragged before a lay court but also,
   as it is asserted, they are compelled to submit to duels and are
   imprisoned, killed and tortured to the disturbance and insult of the
   clerical order. Satisfaction has not been made to the said Templars,
   Hospitallers and ecclesiastical persons for the loss and injury done to
   them.
   It is also certain that he is guilty of sacrilege. For when the
   aforesaid bishops of Porto and Palestrina, and many prelates of
   churches and clerics, both religious and secular, summoned to the
   apostolic see to hold the council which Frederick himself had
   previously asked for, were coming by sea, since the roads had been
   entirely blocked at his command, he stationed his son Enzo with a large
   number of galleys and, by means of many others duly placed long
   beforehand, he laid an ambush against them in the parts of Tuscany on
   the coast; and so that he might vomit forth in more deadly fashion the
   poison which had long gathered within him, by an act of sacrilegious
   daring he caused them to be captured; during their seizure some of the
   prelates and others were drowned, a number were killed, some were put
   to flight and pursued, and the rest were stripped of all their
   possessions, ignominiously led from place to place to the kingdom of
   Sicily, and there harshly imprisoned. Some of them, overcome by the
   filth and beset by hunger, perished miserably.
   Furthermore, he has deservedly become suspect of heresy. For, after he
   had incurred the sentence of excommunication pronounced against him by
   the aforesaid John, bishop of Sabina, and cardinal Thomas, after the
   said pope Gregory had laid him under anathema, and after the capture of
   cardinals of the Roman church, prelates, clerics and others coming at
   different times to the apostolic see; he has despised and continues to
   despise the keys of the church, causing the sacred rites to be
   celebrated or rather, as far as in him lies, to be profaned, and he has
   consistently asserted, as said above, that he does not fear the
   condemnations of the aforesaid pope Gregory. Besides, he is joined in
   odious friendship with the Saracens; several times he has sent envoys
   and gifts to them, and receives the like from them in return with
   expressions of honour and welcome; he embraces their rites; he openly
   keeps them with him in his daily services; and, following their
   customs, he does not blush to appoint as guards, for his wives
   descended from royal stock, eunuchs whom it is seriously said he has
   had castrated. And what is more loathsome, when he was in the territory
   overseas, after he had made an agreement, or rather had come to a
   wicked understanding with the sultan, he allowed the name of Mahomet to
   be publicly proclaimed day and night in the Lord's temple. Recently,
   after the sultan of Babylon and his followers had brought serious loss
   and untold injury to the holy Land and its christian inhabitants, he
   caused the envoys of the sultan to be honourably received and lavishly
   entertained throughout the kingdom of Sicily with, it is said, every
   mark of honour being paid to the sultan. Using the deadly and hateful
   service of other unbelievers against the faithful, and securing a bond
   by friendship and marriage with those who, wickedly making light of the
   apostolic see, have separated from the unity of the church, he brought
   about by assassins the death of the famous duke Ludwig of Bavaria {16},
   who was specially devoted to the Roman church, with disregard of the
   christian religion, and he gave his daughter in marriage to Vatatzes
   {17}, that enemy of God and the church who, together with his
   counsellors and supporters, was solemnly separated by excommunication
   from the communion of the faithful.
   Rejecting the customs and actions of christian princes and heedless of
   salvation and reputation, he gives no attention to works of piety.
   Indeed to say nothing of his wicked acts of destruction, though he has
   learnt to oppress, he does not care mercifully to relieve the
   oppressed, and instead of holding out his hand in charity, as befits a
   prince, he sets about the destruction of churches and crushes religious
   and other ecclesiastical persons by constant affliction. Nor is he seen
   to have built churches, monasteries, hospitals or other pious places.
   Surely these are not light but convincing proofs for suspecting him of
   heresy? The civil law declares that those are to be regarded as
   heretics, and ought to be subject to the sentences issued against them,
   who even on slight evidence are found to have strayed from the judgment
   and path of the catholic religion. Besides this the kingdom of Sicily,
   which is the special patrimony of blessed Peter and which Frederick
   held as a fief from the apostolic see, he has reduced to such a state
   of utter desolation and servitude, with regard to both clergy and
   laity, that these have practically nothing at all; and as nearly all
   upright people have been driven out, he has forced those who remain to
   live in an almost servile condition and to wrong in many ways and
   attack the Roman church, of which in the first place they are subjects
   and vassals. He could also be rightly blamed because for more than nine
   years he has failed to pay the annual pension of a thousand gold
   pieces, which he is bound to pay to the Roman church for this kingdom.
   We therefore, after careful discussion with our brother cardinals and
   the sacred council on his wicked transgressions already mentioned and
   many more besides, since though unworthy we hold on earth the place of
   Jesus Christ, and to us in the person of the blessed apostle Peter has
   been said, whatever you bind on earth etc., denounce the said prince,
   who has made himself so unworthy of the empire and kingdoms and every
   honour and dignity and who also, because of his crimes, has been cast
   out by God from kingdom and empire; we mark him out as bound by his
   sins, an outcast and deprived by our Lord of every honour and dignity;
   and we deprive him of them by our sentence. We absolve from their oath
   for ever all those who are bound to him by an oath of loyalty, firmly
   forbidding by our apostolic authority anyone in the future to obey or
   heed him as emperor or king, and decreeing that anyone who henceforth
   offers advice, help or favour to him as to an emperor or king,
   automatically incurs excommunication. Let those whose task it is to
   choose an emperor in the same empire, freely choose a successor to him.
   With regard to the aforesaid kingdom of Sicily, we shall take care to
   provide, with the counsel of our brother cardinals, as we see to be
   expedient.
   Given at Lyons on 17 July in the third year of our pontificate.

CONSTITUTIONS

   I

   1.On rescripts

   Since in many articles of law failure to define their scope is
   blameworthy, after prudent consideration we decree that by the general
   clause "certain others" which frequently occurs in papal letters, no
   more than three or four persons are to be brought to court. The
   petitioner should state the names in his first citation, lest by chance
   a place is left for fraud if the names can be freely altered {18}.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   2. {19} Those to whom cases should be entrusted

   By {20} the present decree we ordain that the apostolic see or its
   legates should not entrust cases to any persons except those who
   possess a dignity or belong to cathedrals or other collegiate churches
   of high standing; and such cases are to be conducted only in cities or
   large and well-known places where are to be found many men learned in
   the law. Judges who, contrary to this statute, cite either one or both
   parties to other places may be disobeyed without penalty, unless the
   citation takes place with the consent of both parties.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   3. {21} Curtailing legal expenses

   As we wish, to the best of our power, to curtail the expenses of
   lawsuits by shortening the legal process, extending the decree of
   Innocent III of happy memory on this matter, we decree that if anyone
   wishes to bring several personal claims against another, he must be
   careful to gain letters on all these claims to the same judges and not
   to different ones. If anyone acts contrary to this, his letters and the
   processes initiated by them are to lack all validity; besides if he has
   caused inconvenience to the defendant by them, he is to be condemned to
   pay the legal expenses. Also if the defendant during the course of the
   same trial declares that he has a charge against the plaintiff, he
   ought, through benefit either of reconvention or of convention, if he
   prefers to obtain letters against him, to have his case tried before
   the same judges, unless he can reject them as being suspect. If he acts
   contrary to this, he should suffer the same penalty.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   4. {22} On challenging elections etc.

   We decree that if anyone attacks an election, postulation or provision
   already made, bringing some objection to the form or the person, and
   should happen to appeal to us in this matter, both the objector and the
   defendant, and in general all those who are concerned and whom the case
   affects, either by themselves or by their procurators instructed for
   the case, should make their way to the apostolic see within a month of
   the lodging of the objection. But if one party {23} does not come after
   twenty days, and the other party has arrived and is waiting, the case
   about the election may proceed according to law, notwithstanding the
   absence of anyone. We wish and command that this is to be observed in
   dignities parsonages and canonries. We {24} also add that anyone who
   does not fully prove the objection he has brought regarding the form,
   shall be condemned to pay the expenses which the other party claims to
   have incurred on this account. But anyone who fails to prove his
   objection against the person, should know that he is suspended from
   ecclesiastical benefices for three years, and if within that time he
   continues to act with similar reckless conduct, that by the law itself
   he is deprived of these benefices for ever, and he is to have no hope
   or confidence of mercy in this matter, unless it is established by the
   clearest proof that a probable and sufficient cause excuses him from a
   malicious accusation.

   5. {25} Only unconditional votes valid

   In {26} elections, postulations and ballots, from which the right of
   election arises, we completely disapprove of conditional, alternative
   and indefinite votes, and we decree that the said votes are to be held
   invalid, and that the election is to be determined by unconditional
   votes; for the power of decision of those who do not express a clear
   opinion is transferred to the others {27}.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   6. {28} Jurisdiction of conservators

   We decree that conservators, whom we frequently appoint, may defend
   from manifest injury and violence those whom we entrust to their
   protection, but that their power does not extend to other matters which
   require a judicial investigation.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   7. {29} Legates and benefices

   We are required by our office to watch for remedies for our subjects,
   because while we relieve their burdens and remove their stumbling
   blocks, so we rest in their ease and enjoy their peace. Therefore we
   enact by the present decree that legates of the Roman church, however
   much they hold the full power of legates whether they have been sent by
   us or claim the dignity of that office on behalf of their own churches,
   have no power from the office of legate of conferring benefices, unless
   we have judged that this is specially to be granted to a particular
   one. We do not, however, wish this restriction to hold with our brother
   cardinals while acting as legates, because just as they rejoice in a
   prerogative of honour, so we wish them to exercise a wider authority.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   8. {30} Judge delegates

   The law seems to be clear that a judge delegate, unless he has received
   a special concession for the purpose from the apostolic see, cannot
   order either of the parties to appear in person before him, unless it
   be a criminal case or, in order to obtain a statement of the truth or
   an oath regarding calumny, the necessity of the law demands that the
   parties appear before him.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   9. {31} On peremptory exceptions

   The objection of a peremptory exception or of any major defence
   concerning the trial of a case, raised before the contestation of the
   suit, shall not prevent or hold up the contestation, unless the
   objector makes an exception concerning a matter already judged or
   concluded or brought to a solution, even though the objector says that
   the rescript would not have been granted if the grantor had been aware
   of the things which are adverse to the plaintiff.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   10. {32} The objection of robbery

   We are well aware of the frequent and persistent complaint that the
   exception of robbery, sometimes maliciously introduced in trials,
   hinders and confuses ecclesiastical cases. For while the exception is
   admitted, sometimes appeals are introduced. Thus the hearing of the
   chief case is interrupted and often comes to nothing. Thus we who are
   ever ready to take labours upon ourselves so that we may win peace for
   others, wishing to limit lawsuits and to remove material for malicious
   accusations, decree that in civil suits a judge is not to hold up the
   proceedings of the major issue on account of an objection of robbery
   brought by anyone except the plaintiff. But if the defendant declares
   in civil suits that he has been robbed by the plaintiff, or in criminal
   cases by anyone at all, then he must prove his assertion within fifteen
   days after the day on which the claim is put forward; otherwise he is
   to be condemned to pay the expenses which the plaintiff has incurred on
   this account, after a judicial estimate has been made, or let him be
   punished otherwise if the judge thinks right. By the word "robbed" we
   wish to be understood in this case a criminal accusation whereby
   someone declares that he has been stripped by violence of all his
   substance or a greater part of it. This we think is the only honest
   interpretation of the canons, for we ought not to meet our opponents
   either naked or without arms. For the one stripped has the advantage
   that he cannot be stripped again. Among the schoolmen the matter is
   debated, whether one who has been robbed by a third party can bring an
   exception against his accuser, or whether a time should be granted him
   by the judge within which he should ask for restitution, lest perchance
   he should wish to continue in this state in order to evade every
   accuser, and this we think is fully according to justice. If he does
   not seek restitution within the time granted, or does not bring his
   case to a conclusion even though he could do so, then he can be accused
   regardless of the exception of robbery. In addition to this we decree
   that robbery of private goods cannot in any way be brought up against
   one for ecclesiastics or vice versa.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   11. {33} No-show plaintiffs

   A plaintiff who does not take the trouble to come on the date for which
   he has caused his appeal to be cited, should be condemned on his
   arrival to pay the expenses incurred by the defendant on account of
   this, and he is not to be admitted to another citation unless he gives
   a sufficient surety that he will appear on the date.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   12. {34} On early possession for the sake of preservation

   We decree that a person who, in order to obtain a dignity, parsonage or
   ecclesiastical benefice, brings a suit against the possessor, may not
   be admitted to possession of it for the sake of its preservation, on
   the grounds of the other's contumacy; this is to prevent his entering
   upon it from appearing irregular. But in this case the divine presence
   may make up for the absence of the contumacious one, so that though the
   suit is not opposed, the matter may be brought to the proper conclusion
   after a careful examination.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   13. {35} On the acceptability of negative assertions

   We decree that negative assertions, which can only be proved by the
   admission of the opponent, may be accepted by the judges if they see
   this to be expedient in the interests of equity.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   14. {36} The exception of major excommunication

   After due consideration our holy mother the church decrees that the
   exception of a major excommunication should hold up the suit and delay
   the agents, in whatever part of the proceedings it is produced. Thus
   ecclesiastical censure will be the more feared, the danger of communion
   avoided, the vice of contumacy checked, and those excommunicated, while
   they are excluded from the acts of the community, may the more easily
   be brought, through a sense of shame, to the grace of humility and
   reconciliation. But with the growth of human evil what was provided as
   a remedy has turned to harm. For while in ecclesiastical cases this
   exception is frequently brought up through malice, it happens that
   business is delayed and the parties worn out by toil and expense.
   Therefore, since this has crept in like a general plague, we think it
   right to apply a general remedy. Thus if anyone brings up the objection
   of excommunication, he should set out the kind of excommunication and
   the name of the person who imposed the penalty. He must know that he is
   bringing the matter into public notice, and he must prove it with the
   clearest evidence within eight days, not counting the day on which he
   brings it forward. If he does not prove it, the judge should not fail
   to proceed in the case, condemning the accused to repay the sum which
   the plaintiff shows he has incurred, after an estimate has been made.
   If however later, while the hearing continues and the proof is
   progressing, an exception is made either with regard to the same
   excommunication or another and is proved, the plaintiff is to be
   excluded from the proceedings until he has deserved to gain the grace
   of absolution, and all that has gone before shall nevertheless be
   regarded as valid; provided that this exception is not put forward more
   than twice, unless a new excommunication has arisen or a clear and
   ready proof has come to light concerning the old. If such an exception
   is brought forward after the case has been decided though it will
   prevent the execution it will not weaken the verdict, with the
   qualification that, if the plaintiff has been publicly excommunicated,
   and the judge knows this at any time, then even if the accused shall
   not make an exception on this score, the judge should not delay in
   removing the plaintiff from his office.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   15. {37} On Judges Who Give Dishonest Judgment

   Since before the judgment seat of the eternal king a person will not be
   held guilty when a judge unjustly condemns him, according to the words
   of the prophet, the Lord will not condemn him when he is judged,
   ecclesiastical judges must take care and be on the watch that in the
   process of justice dislike has no power, favour does not take an undue
   place, fear is banished, and reward or hope of reward does not overturn
   justice. Let them bear the scales in their hands and weigh with an
   equal balance, so that in all that is done in the court, especially in
   forming and giving the verdict, they may have God only before their
   eyes following the example of him who when entering the tabernacle
   referred the complaints of the people to the Lord to judge according to
   his command. If any ecclesiastical judge, whether ordinary or
   delegated, careless of his reputation and seeking his own honour, acts
   against his conscience and justice in any way to the injury of one
   party in his judgment, whether from favour or from base motives, let
   him know that he is suspended from the exercise of his office for a
   year and he is to be condemned to pay to the injured party the damages
   incurred; further, let him know that if during the period of his
   suspension he sacrilegiously takes part in the sacred rites of the
   church, he is caught in the noose of irregularity according to the
   canonical sanctions, from which he can be freed only by the apostolic
   see, saving the other constitutions which assign and inflict punishment
   on judges who give dishonest judgment. For it is right that he who
   dares to offend in so many ways should suffer a multiple penalty.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   16. {38} On appeals

   It is our earnest wish to lessen lawsuits and to relieve subjects of
   their troubles. Therefore we decree that if anyone thinks that he
   should appeal to us in a court of law or outside it because of an
   interlocutory decree or a grievance, let him at once put in writing the
   reason for his appeal, seeking a writ which we order to be granted him.
   In this writ the judge is to declare the reason for the appeal, and why
   the appeal has not been granted or whether it was granted out of
   respect for a superior. After this let time be granted to the
   appellant, according to distance and the nature of the persons and the
   business, to follow up his appeal. If the appellee wishes it and the
   principals petition for it, let them approach the apostolic see, either
   by themselves or through agents who have been instructed and given a
   commission to act, bringing with them the reasons and documents
   relating to the case. Let them come so prepared that if it seems good
   to us, when the matter of the appeal has been dealt with or committed
   to the parties for agreement, the principal case may proceed, insofar
   as it can and should by law; without however any change in what
   tradition has ordained about appeals from definitive sentences. If the
   appellant does not observe the above provisions, he is not to be
   reckoned an appellant and he must return to the examination of the
   former judge, and is to be condemned to pay the legitimate expenses. If
   the appellee disregards this statute, he shall be proceeded against as
   contumacious, as regards both the costs and the case, in so far as this
   is allowed by the law. Indeed it is right that the laws should raise
   their hands against someone who mocks the law, judge and litigant.


   17. {39} On the same

   When reasonable grounds for suspicion have been noted against a judge,
   and arbitrators have been chosen by the parties according to the form
   of law to investigate it, it often happens that when the two
   arbitrators fail to agree and do not summon a third one, with whom both
   or one of them can proceed to settle the matter as they are obliged,
   the judge brings a sentence of excommunication against them, which they
   through dislike or favour for long disregard. Thus the case itself,
   interrupted more than it should be, does not proceed to a settlement of
   the principal business. As it is our wish therefore to apply a
   necessary remedy for a disease of this nature, we decree that a fitting
   time-limit should be fixed by the judge for the two arbitrators, so
   that within it they may either agree or by consent summon a third one,
   with whom both or one of them may put an end to the suspicion.
   Otherwise the judge thenceforth shall proceed in the principal
   business.

   18. {40} On employing assassins

   The son of God, Jesus Christ, for the redemption of the human race
   descended from the height of heaven to the lowest part of the world and
   underwent a temporal death. But when after his resurrection he was
   about to ascend to his Father, that he might not leave the flock
   redeemed by his glorious blood without a shepherd, he entrusted its
   care to the blessed apostle Peter, so that by the firmness of his own
   faith he might strengthen others in the Christian religion and kindle
   their minds with the ardour of devotion to the works of their
   salvation. Hence we who by the will of our Lord, though without merit
   of our own, have been made successors of this apostle and hold on
   earth, though unworthy, the place of our Redeemer, should always be
   careful and vigilant in the guarding of that flock and be forced to
   direct our thoughts continuously to the salvation of souls by removing
   what is harmful and doing what is profitable. Thus casting off the
   sleep of negligence and with the eyes of our heart ever vigilant, we
   may be able to win souls to God with the cooperation of his grace.
   Since therefore there are people who with a terrible inhumanity and
   loathsome cruelty thirst for the death of others and cause them to be
   killed by assassins, and thus bring about not only the death of the
   body but also of the soul, unless the abundant divine grace prevents
   it, we wish to meet such danger to souls, so that the victims may be
   defended beforehand by spiritual arms and all power may be bestowed by
   God for justice and the exercise of right judgment, and to strike those
   wicked and reckless people with the sword of ecclesiastical punishment,
   so that the fear of punishment may set a limit to their audacity. We do
   so especially since some persons of high standing, fearing to be killed
   in such a way, are forced to beg for their own safety from the master
   of these assassins, and thus so to speak to redeem their life in a way
   that is an insult to Christian dignity. Therefore, with the approval of
   the sacred council, we decree that if any prince, prelate or any
   ecclesiastical or secular person shall cause the death of any Christian
   by such assassins, or even command it even though death does not follow
   from this-or receives, defends or hides such persons, he automatically
   incurs the sentence of excommunication and of deposition from dignity,
   honour, order, office and benefice, and these are to be conferred on
   others by those who have the right to do so. Let such a one with all
   his worldly goods be cast out for ever by all Christian people as an
   enemy of religion, and after it has been established by reasonable
   evidence that so loathsome a crime has been committed, no other
   sentence of excommunication, deposition or rejection shall in any way
   be needed.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   19. {41} On excommunication 1

   Since the aim of excommunication is healing and not death, correction
   and not destruction, as long as the one against whom it is pronounced
   does not treat it with contempt, let an ecclesiastical judge proceed
   with caution, so that in pronouncing It he may be seen as one who acts
   with a correcting and healing hand. Whoever pronounces an
   excommunication, therefore, should do this in writing and should write
   down expressly the reason why the excommunication was pronounced. He is
   bound to hand over a copy of this written document to the one
   excommunicated within a month after the date of sentence, if requested
   to do so. As to this request, we wish a public document to be drawn up
   or testimonial letters to be furnished, sealed with an official seal.
   If any judge rashly violates this constitution, let him know that he is
   suspended for one month from entering a church or attending divine
   services. The superior to whom the one excommunicated has recourse,
   should readily remove the excommunication and condemn the judge who
   pronounced it to repay the expenses and all losses, or punish him in
   other ways with a fitting penalty, so that judges may learn by the
   lesson of punishment how serious it is to hurl the bolt of
   excommunication without due consideration. We wish the same to be
   observed in sentences of suspension and interdict. Let prelates of
   churches and all judges take care that they do not incur the foresaid
   penalty of suspension. But if it happens that they take part m divine
   offices as before, they will not escape irregularity according to the
   canonical sanctions, in a matter where dispensation cannot be granted
   except by the sovereign pontiff.


   20. {42} On excommunication 2

   The question is sometimes asked whether, when a person who asks to be
   absolved by a superior by way of precaution, asserting that the
   sentence of excommunication pronounced against him is void, the act of
   absolution should be performed for him without objection; and whether
   one who declares before such absolution that he will prove in a court
   of law that he was excommunicated after a legitimate appeal, or that an
   intolerable mistake was clearly expressed in the sentence, should be
   avoided in all things except in what concerns the proof. To the first
   question we decree that the following is to be observed: absolution is
   not to be refused to the petitioner, even though the pronouncer of the
   sentence or the adversary opposes it, unless he says that the
   petitioner was excommunicated for a manifest offence, in which case a
   limit of eight days is to be granted to the one saying this. If he
   proves his objection, the sentence is not to be set aside unless there
   is sufficient guarantee of amendment or an adequate assurance that the
   petitioner will appear in court if the offence with which he is charged
   is still doubtful. To the second question, we decree that he who is
   allowed to submit a proof, as long as the matter of proof is in
   dispute, is to be avoided in all matters in the court in which he is
   engaged as an agent, but outside the court he may take part in offices,
   postulations, elections and other lawful acts.


   21. {43} On excommunication 3

   We decree {44} that no judge should presume to pronounce, before a
   canonical warning, a sentence of major excommunication upon persons who
   associate, in speech or other ways by which an associate incurs a minor
   excommunication, with persons already excommunicated by the judge;
   saving those decrees which have legitimately been promulgated against
   those who presume to associate with one condemned for grievous crime.
   But it the excommunicated person becomes hardened in speech or other
   ways by which an associate incurs a minor excommunication, the judge
   can, after canonical warning, condemn such associates with a similar
   censure. Otherwise excommunication pronounced against these associates
   is not to have any binding power, and those who pronounce it may fear
   the penalty of the law.


   22. {45} On excommunication 4

   Since there is danger that bishops and their superiors in the execution
   of their pontifical office, which is often their duty, may incur in
   some case an automatic sentence of interdict or suspension, we have
   thought it right, after careful consideration, to decree that bishops
   and other higher prelates in no way incur, because of any decree,
   sentence or order, the aforesaid sentence by reason of the law itself,
   unless there is express mention in them of bishops and superiors. In
   the constitution Solet a nonnullis, previously promulgated by us, it is
   laid down that when someone offers in court to prove that a sentence of
   excommunication was passed against him after a legitimate appeal, he is
   not to be avoided during the period of proof in matters which lie
   outside the court, such as elections, postulations and offices. To this
   we add that this constitution should not be extended to the sentences
   of bishops and archbishops, but what was previously observed in such
   actions should be observed in the future for these too.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   II

   1. {46} Management of church debts

   Our pastoral care incites and urges us to look to the interest of those
   churches which have fallen into debt, and to provide by a salutary
   constitution that this should not happen for the future. The abyss of
   usury has almost destroyed many churches, and some prelates are found
   to be very careless and remiss in the payment of debts, especially
   those contracted by their predecessors, too ready to contract heavier
   debts and mortgage the property of the church, slothful in guarding
   what has been acquired, and preferring to win praise for themselves by
   making some small innovation than to guard their possessions, recover
   what has been thrown away, restore what is lost and repair damage. For
   this reason, so that they may not be able for the future to excuse
   themselves for an inefficient administration and to throw the blame on
   their predecessors and others, we lay down the following rules, with
   the approval of the present council. Bishops, abbots, deans and others
   who exercise a lawful and common administration, within one month after
   they have assumed office, having first informed their immediate
   superior, so that he may be present either in person or through some
   suitable and faithful ecclesiastical person, in the presence of the
   chapter or convent especially summoned for this purpose, must see that
   an inventory is made of the goods that belong to the administration
   they have taken up. In this the movable and immovable goods, books,
   charters, legal instruments, privileges, ornaments or fittings of the
   church, and all things which belong to the equipment of the estate,
   whether urban or rural, as well as debts and credits, are to be
   carefully written down. Thus, what was the condition of the church or
   the administration when they took it up, how they governed it during
   their incumbency, and what was its state when they laid it down by
   death or withdrawal, may be clearly known to the superior, if
   necessary, and those who are appointed for the service of the church.
   Archbishops who have no superior except the Roman pontiff, are to see
   to it that for this purpose they summon one of their suffragans, either
   in person or through another, as is expressed above, and abbots and
   other lesser exempt prelates, a neighbouring bishop, who is to claim no
   right for himself in the exempt church. The said inventory is to be
   furnished with the seals of the new incumbent and his chapter, and of
   the archbishop's suffragan or the neighbouring bishop called for the
   purpose. It is to be preserved in the archives of the church with due
   safeguards. Moreover a transcript of this inventory is to be given to
   both the new incumbent and the prelate summoned for the above purpose,
   and is to be similarly sealed. Existing goods are to be carefully
   guarded, their administration carried out in a worthy manner, and the
   debts which have been found are to be speedily paid, if possible, from
   the movable possessions of the church. If these movable goods are not
   sufficient for a speedy payment, all revenues are to be directed to the
   payment of debts that are usurious or burdensome; only necessary
   expenses are to be deducted from these revenues, after a reasonable
   estimate has been made by the prelate and his chapter. But if the debts
   are not burdensome or usurious, a third part of these revenues is to be
   set aside for this obligation, or a greater part with the agreement of
   those whom we have said must be summoned to take the inventory.

   Further we strictly forbid, with the authority of the same council,
   those mentioned above to mortgage to others their persons or the
   churches entrusted to them, or to contract debts on behalf of
   themselves or the churches which may be a source of trouble. If evident
   necessity and the reasonable advantage of their churches should
   persuade them, then prelates with the advice and consent of their
   superiors, and archbishops and exempt abbots with the advice and
   consent of those already mentioned and of their chapter, may contract
   debts which, if possible, are not usurious and which are never in fairs
   or public markets. The names of the debtors and creditors and the
   reason why the debt was contracted are to be included in the written
   contract, even if it is turned to the advantage of the church, and for
   this purpose we wish that in no way ecclesiastical persons or churches
   should be given as security. Indeed the privileges of churches, which
   we command should be faithfully guarded in a safe place, are never to
   be given as securities, nor are other things, except for necessary and
   useful debts contracted with the full legal forms mentioned above.

   That this salutary constitution should be kept unbroken, and the
   advantage which we hope from it may be clearly seen, we consider that
   we must lay down by an inviolable decree that all abbots and priors as
   well as deans and those in charge of cathedrals or other churches, at
   least once a year in their chapters, should render a strict account of
   their administration, and a written and sealed account should be
   faithfully read out in the presence of the visiting superior. Likewise
   archbishops and bishops are to take care each year to make known to
   their chapters with due fidelity the state of administration of the
   goods belonging to their households, and bishops to their
   metropolitans, and metropolitans to the legates of the apostolic see,
   or to others to whom the visitation of their churches has been assigned
   by the same see. Written accounts are always to be kept in the treasury
   of the church for a record, so that in the accounts a careful
   comparison can be made between future years and the present and past;
   and the superior may learn from this the care or negligence of the
   administration. Let the superior requite any negligence, keeping God
   only before his eyes and putting aside love, hate and fear of humans,
   with such a degree and kind of correction that he may not on this
   account receive from God or his superior or the apostolic see condign
   punishment. We order that this constitution is to be observed not only
   by future prelates but also by those already promoted.

   2. {47} On help for the empire of Constantinople

   Though we are engaged in difficult matters and distracted by manifold
   anxieties, yet among those things which demand our constant attention
   is the liberation of the empire of Constantinople. This we desire with
   our whole heart, this is ever the object of our thoughts. Yet though
   the apostolic see has eagerly sought a remedy on its behalf by earnest
   endeavour and many forms of assistance, though for long Catholics have
   striven by grievous toils, by burdensome expense, by care, sweat, tears
   and bloodshed, yet the hand that extended such aid could not wholly,
   hindered by sin, snatch the empire from the yoke of the enemy. Thus not
   without cause we are troubled with grief. But because the body of the
   church would be shamefully deformed by the lack of a loved member,
   namely the aforesaid empire, and be sadly weakened and suffer loss; and
   because it could rightly be assigned to our sloth and that of the
   church, if it were deprived of the support of the faithful, and left to
   be freely oppressed by its enemies; we firmly propose to come to the
   help of the empire with swift and effective aid. Thus at the same time
   as the church eagerly rises to its assistance and stretches out the
   hand of defence, the empire can be saved from the dominion of its foes,
   and be brought back by the Lord's guidance to the unity of that same
   body, and may feel after the crushing hammer of its enemies the
   consoling hand of the church its mother, and after the blindness of
   error regain its sight by the possession of the catholic faith. It is
   the more fitting that prelates of churches and other ecclesiastics
   should be watchful and diligent for its liberation, and bestow their
   help and assistance, the more they are bound to work for the increase
   of the faith and of ecclesiastical liberty, which could chiefly come
   about from the liberation of the empire; and especially because while
   the empire is helped, assistance is consequently rendered to the holy
   Land.

   Indeed, so that the help to the empire may be speedy and useful, we
   decree, with the general approval of the council, that half of all
   incomes of dignities parsonages and ecclesiastical prebends, and of
   other benefices of ecclesiastics who do not personally reside in them
   for at least six months, whether they hold one or more, shall be
   assigned in full for three years to the help of the said empire, having
   been collected by those designated by the apostolic see. Those are
   exempt who are employed in our service or in that of our brother
   cardinals and of their prelates, those who are on pilgrimages or in
   schools, or engaged in the business of their own churches at their
   direction, and those who have or will take up the badge of the cross
   for the aid of the holy Land or who will set out in person to the help
   of the said empire; but if any of these, apart from the crusaders and
   those setting out, receive from ecclesiastical revenues more than a
   hundred silver marks, they should pay a third part of the remainder in
   each of the three years. This is to be observed notwithstanding any
   customs or statutes of churches to the contrary, or any indulgences
   granted by the apostolic see to these churches or persons, confirmed by
   oath or any other means. And if by chance in this matter any shall
   knowingly be guilty of any deceit, they shall incur the sentence of
   excommunication.

   We ourselves, from the revenues of the church of Rome, after first
   deducting a tenth from them to be assigned to the aid of the holy Land,
   will assign a tenth part in full for the support of the said empire.
   Further, when help is given to the empire, assistance is given in a
   very particular way and directed to the recovery of the holy Land,
   while we are striving for the liberation of the empire itself. Thus
   trusting in the mercy of almighty God and the authority of his blessed
   apostles Peter and Paul, from the power of binding and loosing which he
   conferred upon us though unworthy, we grant pardon of their sins to all
   those who come to the help of the said empire, and we desire they may
   enjoy that privilege and immunity which is granted to those who come to
   the help of the holy Land.

   3. {48} Admonition to be made by prelates to the people in their charge

   In the belief that it is for ever our native country, from times long
   past all the children of the church have not only poured out countless
   sums of money but have also freely shed their blood to recover the holy
   Land, which the Son of God has consecrated with the shedding of his own
   blood. This we learn, sad at heart, from what has happened across the
   sea where the unbelievers fight against the faithful. Since it is the
   special prayer of the apostolic see that the desire of all for the
   redemption of the holy Land may, if God so wills, be speedily
   accomplished, we have made due provision, in order to win God's favour,
   to arouse you to this task by our letter. Therefore we earnestly beg
   all of you, commanding you in our lord Jesus Christ, that by your pious
   admonitions you should persuade the faithful committed to your care, in
   your sermons or when you Impose a penance upon them, granting a special
   indulgence, as you see it to be expedient, that in their wills, in
   return for the remission of their sins, they should leave something for
   the help of the holy Land or the eastern empire. You are carefully to
   provide that what they give for this support by way of money, through
   reverence of our crucified Lord, is faithfully preserved in definite
   places under your seal, and that what is bequeathed for this purpose in
   other forms is accurately recorded in writing. May your own devotion
   carry out this work of piety, in which the only aim is God's cause and
   the salvation of the faithful, so readily that with full assurance you
   may look at least for the reward of glory from the hand of the divine
   judge.

   4. {49} On the Tartars

   Since we desire above all things that the Christian religion should be
   spread still further and more widely throughout the world, we are
   pierced with the deepest sorrow when any people by aim and action go
   against our wishes, and strive with all their might to blot out utterly
   this religion from the face of the world. Indeed the wicked race of the
   Tartars, seeking to subdue, or rather utterly destroy the Christian
   people, having gathered for a long time past the strength of all their
   tribes, have entered Poland, Russia, Hungary and other Christian
   countries. So savage has been their devastation that their sword spared
   neither sex nor age, but raged with fearful brutality upon all alike.
   It caused unparalleled havoc and destruction in these countries in its
   unbroken advance; for their sword, not knowing how to rest in the
   sheath, made other kingdoms subject to it by a ceaseless persecution.
   As time went on, it could attack stronger Christian armies and exercise
   its savagery more fully upon them. Thus when, God forbid, the world is
   bereaved of the faithful, faith may turn aside from the world to lament
   its followers destroyed by the barbarity of this people. Therefore, so
   that the horrible purpose of this people may not prevail but be
   thwarted, and by the power of God be brought to the opposite result,
   all the faithful must carefully consider and ensure by their earnest
   endeavour that the Tartar advance may be hindered and prevented from
   penetrating any further by the power of their mailed arm. Therefore, on
   the advice of the holy council, we advise, beg, urge and earnestly
   command all of you, as far as you can, carefully to observe the route
   and approaches by which this people can enter our land, and by ditches,
   walls or other defences and fortifications, as you think fitting, to
   keep them at bay, so that their approach to you may not easily be open.
   Word of their arrival should previously be brought to the apostolic
   see. Thus we may direct the assistance of the faithful to you, and thus
   you may be safe against the attempts and raids of this people. For to
   the necessary and useful expenses which you should make for that
   purpose, we shall contribute handsomely, and we shall see that
   contributions are made in proportion by all Christian countries, for in
   this way we may meet common dangers. Nevertheless, in addition to this,
   we shall send similar letters to all Christians through whose
   territories this people could make its approach.

   5 [On the crusade{50}]{51}

   Deeply sorrowful at the grievous dangers of the holy Land, but
   especially at those which have recently happened to the faithful
   settled there, we seek with all our heart to free it from the hands of
   the wicked. Thus with the approval of the sacred council, in order that
   the crusaders may prepare themselves, we lay it down that at an
   opportune time, to be made known to all the faithful by preachers and
   our special envoys, all who are ready to cross the sea should gather at
   suitable places for this purpose, so that they may proceed from there
   with the blessing of God and the apostolic see to the assistance of the
   holy Land. Priests and other clerics who will be in the Christian army,
   both those under authority and prelates, shall diligently devote
   themselves to prayer and exhortation, teaching the crusaders by word
   and example to have the fear and love of God always before their eyes,
   so that they say or do nothing that might offend the majesty of the
   eternal king. If they ever fall into sin, let them quickly rise up
   again through true penitence. Let them he humble in heart and in body,
   keeping to moderation both in food and in dress, avoiding altogether
   dissensions and rivalries, and putting aside entirely any bitterness or
   envy, so that thus armed with spiritual and material weapons they may
   the more fearlessly fight against the enemies of the faith, relying not
   on their own power but rather trusting in the strength of God. Let
   nobles and the powerful in the army, and all who abound in riches, be
   led by the holy words of prelates so that, with their eyes fixed on the
   crucified one for whom they have taken up the badge of the cross, they
   may refrain from useless and unnecessary expenditure, especially in
   feasting and banquets, and let they give a share of their wealth to the
   support of those persons through whom the work of God may prosper; and
   on this account, according to the dispensation of the prelates
   themselves, they may be granted remission of their sins. We grant to
   the aforesaid clerics that they may receive the fruits of their
   benefices in full for three years, as if they were resident in the
   churches, and if necessary they may leave them in pledge for the same
   time.

   To prevent this holy proposal being impeded or delayed, we strictly
   order all prelates of churches, each in his own locality, diligently to
   warn and induce those who have abandoned the cross to resume it, and
   them and others who have taken up the cross, and those who may still do
   so, to carry out their vows to the Lord. And if necessary they shall
   compel them to do this without any backsliding, by sentences of
   excommunication against their persons and of interdict on their lands,
   excepting only those persons who find themselves faced with an
   impediment of such a kind that their vow deservedly ought to be
   commuted or deferred in accordance with the directives of the apostolic
   see. In order that nothing connected with this business of Jesus Christ
   be omitted, we will and order patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, abbots
   and others who have the care of souls to preach the cross zealously to
   those entrusted to them. Let them beseech kings, dukes, princes,
   margraves, counts, barons and other magnates, as well as the communes
   of cities, vills and towns - in the name of the Father, Son and holy
   Spirit, the one, only, true and eternal God - that those who do not go
   in person to the aid of the holy Land should contribute, according to
   their means an appropriate number of fighting men together with their
   necessary expenses for three years, for the remission of their sins, in
   accordance with what has already been explained in general letters and
   will be explained below for still greater assurance. We wish to share
   in this remission not only those who contribute ships of their own but
   also those who are zealous enough to build them for this purpose. To
   those who refuse, if there happen to be any who are so ungrateful to
   our lord God, we firmly declare in the name of the apostle that they
   should know that they will have to answer to us for this on the last
   day of final judgment before the fearful judge. Let them consider
   beforehand, however, with what knowledge and with what security it was
   that they were able to confess before the only-begotten Son of God,
   Jesus Christ, to whom the Father gave all things into his hands, if in
   this business, which is as it were peculiarly his, they refuse to serve
   him who was crucified for sinners, by whose beneficence they are
   sustained and indeed by whose blood they have been redeemed.

   We therefore decree, with the general approval of the council, that all
   clerics, both those under authority and prelates, shall give a
   twentieth of the revenues of their churches for a full three years to
   the aid of the holy Land, by means of the persons appointed by the
   apostolic see for this purpose; the only exceptions being certain
   religious who are rightly to be exempted from this taxation and
   likewise those persons who have taken or will take the cross and so
   will go in person. We and our brothers, cardinals of the holy Roman
   church, shall pay a full tenth. Let all know, moreover, that they are
   obliged to observe this faithfully under pain of excommunication, so
   that those who knowingly deceive in this matter shall incur the
   sentence of excommunication. Because it is right that those who
   persevere in the service of the heavenly ruler should in all justice
   enjoy special privilege, the crusaders shall therefore be exempt from
   taxes or levies and other burdens. We take their persons and goods
   under the protection of St Peter and ourself once they have taken up
   the cross. We ordain that they are to be protected by archbishops,
   bishops and all prelates of the church of God, and that protectors of
   their own are to be specially appointed for this purpose, so that their
   goods are to remain intact and undisturbed until they are known for
   certain to be dead or to have returned. If anyone dares to act contrary
   to this, let him be curbed by ecclesiastical censure.

   If any of those setting out are bound by oath to pay interest, we
   ordain that their creditors shall be compelled by the same punishment
   to release them from their oath and to desist from exacting the
   interest; if any of the creditors does force them to pay the interest,
   we command that he be forced by similar punishment to restore it. We
   order that Jews be compelled by the secular power to remit interest,
   and that until they do so all intercourse shall be denied them by all
   Christ's faithful under pain of excommunication. Secular princes shall
   provide a suitable deferral for those who cannot now pay their debts to
   Jews, so that after they have undertaken the journey, and until there
   is certain knowledge of their death or of their return, they shall not
   incur the inconvenience of paying interest. The Jews shall be compelled
   to add to the capital, after they have deducted their necessary
   expenses, the revenues which they are meanwhile receiving from property
   held by them on security. For, such a benefit seems to entail not much
   loss, inasmuch as it postpones the repayment but does not cancel the
   debt. Prelates of churches who are negligent in showing justice to
   crusaders and their families should know that they will be severely
   punished. Furthermore, since corsairs and pirates greatly impede help
   for the holy Land, by capturing and plundering those who are travelling
   to and from it, we bind with the bond of excommunication them and their
   principal helpers and supporters. We forbid anyone, under threat of
   anathema, knowingly to communicate with them by contracting to buy or
   to sell; and we order rulers of cities and their territories to
   restrain and curb such persons from this iniquity. Otherwise, since to
   be unwilling to disquiet evildoers is none other than to encourage
   them, and since he who fails to oppose a manifest crime is not without
   a touch of secret complicity, it is our wish and command that prelates
   of churches exercise ecclesiastical severity against their persons and
   lands. We excommunicate and anathematise, moreover, those false and
   impious Christians who, in opposition to Christ and the Christian
   people, convey {52} arms and iron and timber for galleys; and we decree
   that those who sell them galleys or ships, and those who act as pilots
   in pirate Saracen ships, or give them any help or advice by way of
   machines or anything else, to the detriment of the holy Land, are to be
   punished with deprivation of their possessions and are to become the
   slaves of those who capture them. We order this sentence to be renewed
   publicly on Sundays and feast-days in all maritime towns; and the bosom
   of the church is not to be opened to such persons unless they send in
   aid of the holy Land all that they received from this damnable commerce
   and the same amount of their own, so that they are punished in
   proportion to their sins. If perchance they do not pay, they are to be
   punished in other ways in order that through their punishment others
   may be deterred from venturing upon similar rash actions. In addition,
   we prohibit and on pain of anathema forbid all Christians, for four
   years, to send or take their ships across to the lands of the Saracens
   who dwell in the east, so that by this a greater supply of shipping may
   be made ready for those wanting to cross over to help the holy Land,
   and so that the aforesaid Saracens may be deprived of the not
   inconsiderable help which they have been accustomed to receiving from
   this.

   Although tournaments have been forbidden in a general way on pain of a
   fixed penalty at various councils, we strictly forbid them to be held
   for three years, under pain of excommunication, because the business of
   the crusade is much hindered by them at this present time. Because it
   is of the utmost necessity for the carrying out of this business that
   rulers and Christian peoples keep peace with each other, we therefore
   ordain, on the advice of this holy and general synod, that peace be
   generally kept in the whole Christian world for four years, so that
   those in conflict shall be brought by the prelates of churches to
   conclude a definitive peace or to observe inviolably a firm truce.
   Those who refuse to comply shall be most strictly compelled to do so by
   an excommunication against their persons and an interdict on their
   lands, unless the malice of the wrongdoers is so great that they ought
   not to enjoy peace. If it happens that they make light of the church's
   censure, they may deservedly fear that the secular power will be
   invoked by ecclesiastical authority against them, as disturbers of the
   business of him who was crucified.

   We therefore, trusting in the mercy of almighty God and in the
   authority of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, do grant, by the
   power of binding and loosing that God has conferred upon us, albeit
   unworthy, unto all those who undertake this work in person and at their
   own expense, full pardon for their sins about which they are heartily
   contrite and have spoken in confession, and we promise them an increase
   of eternal life at the recompensing of the just. To those who do not go
   there in person but send suitable men at their own expense, according
   to their means and status, and likewise to those who go in person but
   at others' expense, we grant full pardon for their sins. We grant to
   share in this remission, according to the amount of their help and the
   intensity of their devotion, all who shall contribute suitably from
   their goods to the aid of the said Land or who give useful advice and
   help regarding the above. Finally, this holy and general synod imparts
   the benefit of its prayers and blessings to all who piously set out on
   this enterprise in order that it may contribute worthily to their
   salvation.
