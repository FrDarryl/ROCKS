Inter Mirifica - Decree on the Media of Social Communications - 12/4/1963

   DECREE ON THE MEDIA OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATIONS
   INTER MIRIFICA
   SOLEMNLY PROMULGATED BY HIS HOLINESS POPE PAUL VI
   ON DECEMBER 4, 1963

   INTRODUCTION

   1. Among the wonderful technological discoveries which men of talent,
   especially in the present era, have made with God's help, the Church
   welcomes and promotes with special interest those which have a most
   direct relation to men's minds and which have uncovered new avenues of
   communicating most readily news, views and teachings of every sort. The
   most important of these inventions are those media which, such as the
   press, movies, radio, television and the like, can, of their very
   nature, reach and influence, not only individuals, but the very masses
   and the whole of human society, and thus can rightly be called the
   media of social communication.

   2. The Church recognizes that these media, if properly utilized, can be
   of great service to mankind, since they greatly contribute to men's
   entertainment and instruction as well as to the spread and support of
   the Kingdom of God. The Church recognizes, too, that men can employ
   these media contrary to the plan of the Creator and to their own loss.
   Indeed, the Church experiences maternal grief at the harm all too often
   done to society by their evil use. Hence, this sacred Synod, attentive
   to the watchful concern manifested by the Supreme Pontiffs and Bishops
   in a matter of such great importance, judges it to be its duty to treat
   of the principal questions linked with the media of social
   communication. It trusts, moreover, that the teaching and regulations
   it thus sets forth will serve to promote, not only the eternal welfare
   of Christians, but also the progress of all mankind.

   CHAPTER I

   ON THE TEACHING OF THE CHURCH

   3. The Catholic Church, since it was founded by Christ our Lord to bear
   salvation to all men and thus is obliged to preach the Gospel,
   considers it one of its duties to announce the Good News of salvation
   also with the help of the media of social communication and to instruct
   men in their proper use.

   It is, therefore, an inherent right of the Church to have at its
   disposal and to employ any of these media insofar as they are necessary
   or useful for the instruction of Christians and all its efforts for the
   welfare of souls. It is the duty of Pastors to instruct and guide the
   faithful so that they, with the help of these same media, may further
   the salvation and perfection of themselves and of the entire human
   family. In addition, the laity especially must strive to instill a
   human and Christian spirit into these media, so that they may fully
   measure up to the great expectations of mankind and to God's design.

   4. For the proper use of these media it is most necessary that all who
   employ them be acquainted with the norms of morality and
   conscientiously put them into practice in this area. They must look,
   then, to the nature of what is communicated, given the special
   character of each of these media. At the same time they must take into
   consideration the entire situation or circumstances, namely, the
   persons, place, time and other conditions under which communication
   takes place and which can affect or totally change its propriety. Among
   these circumstances to be considered is the precise manner in which a
   given medium achieves its effect. For its influence can be so great
   that men, especially if they are unprepared, can scarcely become aware
   of it, govern its impact, or, if necessary, reject it.

   5. It is, however, especially necessary that all parties concerned
   should adopt for themselves a proper moral outlook on the use of these
   media, especially with respect to certain questions that have been
   vigorously aired in our day.

   The first question has to do with "information," as it is called, or
   the search for and reporting of the news. Now clearly this has become
   most useful and very often necessary for the progress of contemporary
   society and for achieving closer links among men. The prompt
   publication of affairs and events provides every individual with a
   fuller, continuing acquaintance with them, and thus all can contribute
   more effectively to the common good and more readily promote and
   advance the welfare of the entire civil society. Therefore, in society
   men have a right to information, in accord with the circumstances in
   each case, about matters concerning individuals or the community. The
   proper exercise of this right demands, however, that the news itself
   that is communicated should always be true and complete, within the
   bounds of justice and charity. In addition, the manner in which the
   news is communicated should be proper and decent. This means that in
   both the search for news and in reporting it, there must be full
   respect for the laws of morality and for the legitimate rights and
   dignity of the individual. For not all knowledge is helpful, but "it is
   charity that edifies."(1)

   6. The second question deals with the relationship between the rights,
   as they are called, of art and the norms of morality. Since the
   mounting controversies in this area frequently take their rise from
   false teachings about ethics and esthetics, the Council proclaims that
   all must hold to the absolute primacy of the objective moral order,
   that is, this order by itself surpasses and fittingly coordinates all
   other spheres of human affairs-the arts not excepted-even though they
   be endowed with notable dignity. For man who is endowed by God with the
   gift of reason and summoned to pursue a lofty destiny, is alone
   affected by the moral order in his entire being. And likewise, if man
   resolutely and faithfully upholds this order, he will be brought to the
   attainment of complete perfection and happiness.

   7. Finally, the narration, description or portrayal of moral evil, even
   through the media of social communication, can indeed serve to bring
   about a deeper knowledge and study of humanity and, with the aid of
   appropriately heightened dramatic effects, can reveal and glorify the
   grand dimensions of truth and goodness. Nevertheless, such
   presentations ought always to be subject to moral restraint, lest they
   work to the harm rather than the benefit of souls, particularly when
   there is question of treating matters which deserve reverent handling
   or which, given the baneful effect of original sin in men, could quite
   readily arouse base desires in them.

   8. Since public opinion exercises the greatest power and authority
   today in every sphere of life, both private and public, every member of
   society must fulfill the demands of justice and charity in this area.
   As a result, all must strive, through these media as well, to form and
   spread sound public opinion.

   9. All who, of their own free choice, make use of these media of
   communications as readers, viewers or listeners have special
   obligations. For a proper choice demands that they fully favor those
   presentations that are outstanding for their moral goodness, their
   knowledge and their artistic or technical merit. They ought, however,
   to void those that may be a cause or occasion of spiritual harm to
   themselves, or that can lead others into danger through base example,
   or that hinder desirable presentations and promote those that are evil.
   To patronize such presentations, in most instances, would merely reward
   those who use these media only for profit.

   In order that those who make use of these media may fulfill the moral
   code, they ought not to neglect to inform themselves in time about
   judgments passed by authorities competent in these matters. They ought
   also to follow such judgments according to the norms of an upright
   conscience. So that they may more easily resist improper inducements
   and rather encourage those that are desirable, let them take care to
   guide and instruct their consciences with suitable aids.

   10. Those who make use of the media of communications, especially the
   young, should take steps to accustom themselves to moderation and
   self-control in their regard. They should, moreover, endeavor to deepen
   their understanding of what they see, hear or read. They should discuss
   these matters with their teachers and experts, and learn to pass sound
   judgements on them. Parents should remember that they have a most
   serious duty to guard carefully lest shows, publications and other
   things of this sort, which may be morally harmful, enter their homes or
   affect their children under other circumstances.

   11. The principle moral responsibility for the proper use of the media
   of social communication falls on newsmen, writers, actors, designers,
   producers, displayers, distributors, operators and sellers, as well as
   critic and all others who play any part in the production and
   transmission of mass presentations. It is quite evident what gravely
   important responsibilities they have in the present day when they are
   in a position to lead the human race to good or to evil by informing or
   arousing mankind.

   Thus, they must adjust their economic, political or artistic and
   technical aspects so as never to oppose the common good. For the
   purpose of better achieving this goal, they are to be commended when
   they join professional associations, which-even under a code, if
   necessary, of sound moral practice-oblige their members to show respect
   for morality in the duties and tasks of their craft.

   They ought always to be mindful, however, that a great many of their
   readers and audiences are young people, who need a press and
   entertainment that offer them decent amusement and cultural uplift. In
   addition, they should see to it that communications or presentations
   concerning religious matters are entrusted to worthy and experienced
   hands and are carried out with fitting reverence.

   12. The public authority, in these matters, is bound by special
   responsibilities in view of the common good, to which these media are
   ordered. The same authority has, in virtue of its office, the duty of
   protecting and safeguarding true and just freedom of information, a
   freedom that is totally necessary for the welfare of contemporary
   society, especially when it is a question of freedom of the press. It
   ought also to encourage spiritual values, culture and the fine arts and
   guarantee the rights of those who wish to use the media. Moreover,
   public authority has the duty of helping those projects which, though
   they are certainly most beneficial for young people, cannot otherwise
   be undertaken.

   Lastly, the same public authority, which legitimately concerns itself
   with the health of the citizenry, is obliged, through the promulgation
   and careful enforcement of laws, to exercise a fitting and careful
   watch lest grave damage befall public morals and the welfare of society
   through the base use of these media. Such vigilance in no wise
   restricts the freedom of individuals or groups, especially where there
   is a lack of adequate precaution on the part of those who are
   professionally engaged in using these media.

   Special care should be taken to safeguard young people from printed
   matter and performances which may be harmful at their age.

   CHAPTER II

   ON THE PASTORAL ACTIVITY OF THE CHURCH

   13. All the children of the Church should join, without delay and with
   the greatest effort in a common work to make effective use of the media
   of social communication in various apostolic endeavors, as
   circumstances and conditions demand. They should anticipate harmful
   developments, especially in regions where more urgent efforts to
   advance morality and religion are needed.

   Pastors should hasten, therefore, to fulfill their duty in this
   respect, one which is intimately linked with their ordinary preaching
   responsibility. The laity, too, who have something to do with the use
   of these media, should endeavor to bear witness to Christ, first of all
   by carrying out their individual duties or office expertly and with an
   apostolic spirit, and, further, by being of direct help in the pastoral
   activity of the Church-to the best of their ability-through their
   technical, economic, cultural and artistic talents.

   14. First, a good press should be fostered. To instill a fully
   Christian spirit into readers, a truly Catholic press should be set up
   and encouraged. Such a press-whether immediately fostered and directed
   by ecclesiastical authorities or by Catholic laymen-should be edited
   with the clear purpose of forming, supporting and advancing public
   opinion in accord with natural law and Catholic teaching and precepts.
   It should disseminate and properly explain news concerning the life of
   the Church. Moreover, the faithful ought to be advised of the necessity
   both to spread and read the Catholic press to formulate Christian
   judgments for themselves on all events.

   The production and showing of films that have value as decent
   entertainment, humane culture or art, especially when they are designed
   for young people, ought to be encouraged and assured by every effective
   means. This can be done particularly by supporting and joining in
   projects and enterprises for the production and distribution of decent
   films, by encouraging worthwhile films through critical approval and
   awards, by patronizing or jointly sponsoring theaters operated by
   Catholic and responsible managers.

   Similarly, effective support should be given to good radio and
   television programs, above all those that are suitable for families.
   Catholic programs should be promoted, in which listeners and viewers
   can be brought to share in the life of the Church and learn religious
   truths. An effort should also be made, where it may be necessary, to
   set up Catholic stations. In such instances, however, care must be
   taken that their programs are outstanding for their standards of
   excellence and achievement.

   In addition, there should be an effort to see that the noble and
   ancient art of the drama, which now is diffused everywhere by the media
   of social communication, serves the cultural and moral betterment of
   audiences.

   15. To provide for the needs just set forth, priests, religious and
   laymen who are equipped with the proper skills for adapting these media
   to the objectives of the apostolate should be appointed promptly.

   Importantly, laymen ought to be afforded technical, doctrinal and moral
   training. For this purpose, the number of school faculties and
   institutes should be increased, where newsmen, writers for screen,
   radio and television and all other interested parties can obtain a
   sound training that is imbued with the Christian spirit, especially
   with respect to the social teaching of the Church.

   Finally, care must be taken to prepare literary, film, radio,
   television and other critics, who will be equipped with the best skills
   in their own crafts and trained and encouraged to render judgments
   which always put moral issues in their proper light.

   16. Since the proper use of the media of social communications which
   are available to audiences of different cultural backgrounds and ages,
   calls for instruction proper to their needs, programs which are
   suitable for the purpose-especially where they are designed for young
   people-should be encouraged, increased in numbers and organized
   according to Christian moral principles. This should be done in
   Catholic schools at every level, in seminaries and in lay apostolate
   groups. To speed this along catechetical manuals should present and
   explain Catholic teaching and regulations on this matter.

   17. It is quite unbecoming for the Church's children idly to permit the
   message of salvation to be thwarted or impeded by the technical delays
   or expenses, however vast, which are encountered by the very nature of
   these media. Therefore, this sacred Synod advises them of the
   obligation they have to maintain and assist Catholic newspapers,
   periodicals and film projects, radio and television programs and
   stations, whose principal objective is to spread and defend the truth
   and foster Christian influence in human society. At the same time, the
   Synod earnestly invites those organizations and individuals who possess
   financial and technical ability to support these media freely and
   generously with their resources and their skills, inasmuch as they
   contribute to genuine culture and the apostolate.

   18. Moreover, that the varied apostolates of the Church with respect to
   the media of social communication may be strengthened effectively, each
   year in every diocese of the world, by the determination of the
   Bishops, there should be celebrated a day on which the faithful are
   instructed in their responsibilities in this regard. They should be
   invited to pray and contribute funds for this cause. Such funds are to
   be expended exclusively on the promotion, maintenance and development
   of institutes and undertakings of the Church in this area, according to
   the needs of the whole Catholic world.

   19. In fulfilling his supreme pastoral charge with respect to the media
   of social communication, the Sovereign Pontiff has at hand a special
   office of the Holy See. Moreover, the Fathers of the Council, freely
   acceding to the wish of the "Secretariat for the Supervision of
   Publications and Entertainment," reverently request that the Sovereign
   Pontiff extend the duties and competence of this office to include all
   media of social communication, including the press, and that experts
   from various countries be named to it, including laymen.

   20. It will be the task of the Bishops, however, to watch over such
   works and undertakings in their own dioceses, to promote them and, as
   far as the public apostolate is concerned, to guide them, not excluding
   those that are under the direction of exempt religious.

   21. Since an effective apostolate on a national scale calls for unity
   of planning and resources, this sacred Synod decrees and orders that
   national offices for affairs of the press, films, radio and television
   be established everywhere and given every aid. It will be the special
   task of these offices to see to it that the consciences of the faithful
   are properly instructed with respect to these media. Likewise they
   should foster and guide whatever is done by Catholics in these areas.

   In each country the direction of such offices should be entrusted to a
   special committee of Bishops, or to a single Bishop. Moreover, laymen
   who are experts in Catholic teaching and in these arts or techniques
   should have a role in these offices.

   22. Since the effectiveness of these media reaches beyond national
   boundaries and has an impact on individual members of the whole human
   family, national offices should co-operate among themselves on an
   international plane. The offices spoken of in Number 21 should
   assiduously work together with their own international Catholic
   associations. These Catholic international associations are
   legitimately approved by the Holy See alone and depend on it.

   APPENDICES

   23. So that the general principles and norms of this sacred Synod with
   respect to the media of social communications may be put into effect,
   by the express will of the Council, the office of the Holy See
   mentioned in Number 19 should undertake, with the assistance of experts
   from various countries, to issue a pastoral instruction.

   24. As for the rest, this sacred Synod is confident that its issuance
   of these instructions and norms will be gladly accepted and religiously
   kept by all the Church's children. By using these helps they will
   experience no harm and, like salt and light, they will give savor to
   the earth and brighten the world. Moreover, the Synod invites all men
   of good will, especially those who have charge of these media, to
   strive to turn them solely to the good of society, whose fate depends
   more and more on their proper use. Thus, as was the case with ancient
   works of art, the name of the Lord may be glorified by these new
   discoveries in accordance with those words of the Apostle: "Jesus
   Christ, yesterday and today, and the same forever."(2)
