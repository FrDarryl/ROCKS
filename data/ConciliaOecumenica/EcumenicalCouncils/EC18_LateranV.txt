The Fifth General Council of the Lateran, 1512-17

INTRODUCTION

   This council was summoned by pope Julius II by the bull Sacrosanctae
   Romanae Ecclesiae, issued at Rome on 18 July 1511, after several
   schismatic cardinals, officially supported by Louis XII, king of
   France, had assembled a quasi-council at Pisa. Twice postponed, the
   council held its first session in full solemnity at Rome in the Lateran
   residence on 10 May 1512, at which session an elaborate address on the
   evils of the church was made by Giles of Viterbo, general of the order
   of Augustinian hermits.
   There were twelve sessions. The first five of them, held during Julius
   II's pontificate, dealt primarily with the condemnation and rejection
   of the quasi-council of Pisa, and with the revoking and annulment of
   the French "Pragmatic Sanction". After the election of pope Leo X in
   March 1513, the council had three objectives: first, achieving a
   general peace between christian rulers; second, church reform; and
   third, the defence of the faith and the rooting out of heresy. The
   seven sessions after Leo's election gave approval to a number of
   constitutions, among which are to be noted the condemnation of the
   teaching of the philosopher Pomponazzi (session 8), and the approval of
   the agreement completed outside the council between pope Leo X and king
   Francis I of France (session 11).
   All the decrees of this council, at which the pope presided in person,
   are in the form of bulls. At the beginning of them are added the words
   "with the approval of the sacred council", and at the end "in public
   session solemnly held in the Lateran basilica". The fathers confirmed
   all the decrees by their votes. If anyone wished to reject a proposal,
   he made his dissenting opinion known verbally, or briefly in writing.
   The result was that the matters proposed, after various debates, were
   sometimes altered.
   The decisions on the reform of the curia produced almost no effect
   because of the timidity and inadequacy of the recommendations,
   especially since the papacy showed slight inclination to carry the
   matter through. On the other hand, the council totally suppressed the
   Pisan schism. It is clear that bishops were never present in great
   numbers at the council, and that prelates who lived outside Italy were
   notably absent to such an extent that there has been frequent dispute
   about whether the council was ecumenical.
   The decrees and other acts of the council were first published in Rome
   shortly after the council ended, namely on 31 July 1521 by cardinal
   Antonio del Monte, acting on the orders of pope Leo X. The title of
   this edition is: SA. Lateranense concilium novissimum sub Iulio II et
   Leone X celebratum (= Lc). It was subsequently used in various
   conciliar collections from Cr2 3 (1551) 3-192 to Msi 32 (1802)
   649-1002. We have followed this edition of 1521 and have taken the
   headings of the constitutions from the summary which precedes it.

SESSION 1

10 May 1512

   [The bull convoking the council, Sacrosancta Romanae Ecclesiae, and the
   bulls postponing it, Inscrutabilis and Romanus pontifex, are read
   out1{Msi 32, 681-690}. Masses are ordered to be celebrated, and prayers
   to be offered, to beg God's assistance; various arrangements are to be
   observed in the council and decrees are set out; advocates,
   procurators, notaries, guards and vote-scrutineers are chosen;
   assigners of places, and the location of places in their due order, are
   established.]

SESSION 2

17 May 1512

   [The quasi-council of Pisa is condemned, and everything done at it is
   declared null and void. The Lateran council and whatever has been
   rightly done at it are confirmed]
   Julius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of
   the sacred council, for an everlasting record. We intend, with the help
   of the most High, to proceed with the holding of this sacred Lateran
   council which has now begun for the praise of God, the peace of the
   whole church, the union of the faithful the overthrow of heresies and
   schisms, the reform of morals, and the campaign against the dangerous
   enemies of the faith, so that the mouths of all schismatics and enemies
   of peace, those howling dogs, may be silenced and Christians may be
   able to keep themselves unstained from such pernicious and poisonous
   contagion.
   Accordingly, in this second session lawfully assembled in the holy
   Spirit, after mature deliberation held by us with our venerable
   brothers, the cardinals of the holy Roman church, by the advice and
   unanimous consent of the same brothers from sure knowledge and by the
   fullness of apostolic power, we confirm approve and renew, with the
   approval of the sacred council, the rejections condemnations,
   revocations, quashings, invalidations and annulments of the summoning,
   convoking and public utterances of that schismatical assembly, the
   vaunted quasi-council of Pisa, with its aim of rending and hampering
   the union of the aforesaid church, and of the citations, warnings,
   decrees, pardons, sentences, acts, legacies, creations, obediences,
   withdrawals, enjoined censures and applications issuing from it, and of
   the transfer of the said quasi-council to the cities of Milan or
   Vercellae or any other place, and of each and all of the acts and
   decisions of the said quasi-council, that have been expressed in our
   various letters completed and issued in due order, especially those
   issued under the dates of 18 July in the eighth year of our
   pontificate, and of 3 December and 13 April in the ninth year of our
   pontificate. Likewise we confirm, approve and renew with the approval
   of the sacred council, the letters themselves along with their decrees,
   declarations, prohibitions, commands, exhortations, warnings,
   applications of ecclesiastical interdicts, and other sentences,
   censures and penalties, whether by canonical sanctions or by our own
   act, especially those in the letter summoning this sacred universal
   council, and each and all of the other clauses contained in the said
   letters, the meanings of which we wish to be considered as expressed as
   if they were inserted herein word for word, even though, as being
   definite and valid, they require no other confirmation or approval for
   a more extensive guarantee and demonstration of the truth. We wish,
   decree and ordain that they be observed without alteration, and we make
   good each and all of the defects in them, should there be any.
   We condemn and reject the aforesaid quasi-council and its transfer, and
   each and every thing done by it, and also those taking part in it or
   giving support, approval or consent, directly or indirectly, to
   whatever extent and in whatever manner, from the day of the summoning
   of the quasi-council until the present day, whether the things have
   already been done or are to be done in the future, even if they are or
   have been such that special, specific, definite and separate mention
   should be made about them, since we consider their meaning and
   characteristics as clearly expressed. We condemn and reject it like
   other counterfeit councils which diverge from the truth and whose acts
   have been condemned and rejected by the law and sacred canons. We
   proclaim these things to be null, void and empty, as indeed they are,
   to be or to have been of no force or Importance; and, so far as is
   necessary, we declare them void, invalid and null, and we wish them to
   be considered as void, invalid and null.
   We decree and declare, with the approval of this same sacred council,
   that this sacred ecumenical council, justly, reasonably, and for true
   and lawful purposes duly and rightly summoned, has begun to be
   celebrated, and that each and every thing which has been and shall be
   done and executed in it, will be just, reasonable, settled and valid,
   and that it possesses and holds the same strength, power, authority and
   stability which other general councils approved by the sacred canons,
   especially the Lateran council, possess and hold.
   Moreover, in the arrangement of the seasons, as the summer heats
   approach, in order to take account of the convenience and health of the
   prelates, and so that those may be awaited who live beyond the
   mountains and across the sea and who have hitherto been unable to come
   to this sacred council, and for other just and reasonable causes known
   to and approved by the said sacred council, we are summoning the third
   session of this same council to take place on 3 November next, with the
   said council likewise giving approval. And to each and every prelate
   and to others present at the same council, we grant and concede the
   freedom and permission to withdraw from the Roman curia and to stay
   wherever they wish, so long as they are present at the aforesaid
   Lateran council on the said 3 November, any clearly legitimate
   hindrance having been removed, subject to the infliction of the
   penalties indicated in the letter summoning the council and in
   canonical punishments against those failing to attend to councils, the
   said sacred council also approving. Let nobody therefore . . . If
   anyone however . . .2{2 At this session, on account of the arrival of
   the bishop of Gurk, representative of the most serene emperor, a
   postponement of the third session was made until 3 November.}

SESSION 3

3 December 1512

   [Each and all of the measures sponsored by the schismatic cardinals are
   rejected]
   Julius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of
   the sacred council, for an everlasting record. To the praise and glory
   of him whose works are perfect, we are continuing the sacred council of
   the Lateran, lawfully assembled by favour of the holy Spirit, in this
   third session. We had summoned this session on another occasion, during
   the second session, for the third day of the following November. Later,
   by the advice and unanimous agreement of our venerable brothers,
   cardinals of the holy Roman church, for reasons then stated and for
   other lawful causes, we postponed it and summoned it to be held today,
   with the same sacred council giving approval to both the postponement
   and the summons for the said reasons which were known to it. This was
   after the happy and favourable adherence to, and union with, this most
   holy Lateran council on the part of our most dear son in Christ,
   Maximilian, ever revered emperor-elect of the Romans
   We condemn, reject and detest, with the approval of this same sacred
   council, each and every thing done by those sons of damnation, Bernard
   Carvajal, Guillaume Briconnet, Rene de Prie, and Frederick of San
   Severino, formerly cardinals, and their supporters, adherents,
   accomplices and disciples -- who are schismatics and heretics and have
   worked madly to their own and others' ruin, aiming to split asunder the
   unity of holy mother church at the quasi-council held at Pisa, Milan,
   Lyons and elsewhere -- whatever the things were in number and kind that
   have been enacted, carried out, done, written, published or ordained up
   to the present day, including the imposition of taxes carried out by
   them throughout the kingdom of France, or shall be done in the future.
   Even though they are indeed null, useless and void and have already
   been condemned and rejected by us with the approval of the aforesaid
   sacred council, we nevertheless retain this present condemnation and
   rejection for the sake of greater precaution. We wish the meaning and
   characteristics of the things done, or to be done, to be considered as
   expressed herein word for word and not just by general clauses. We
   decree and declare them to be and to have been null, without purpose
   and void, of no force, efficacy, effect or importance.
   We renew our letter dated 13 August 1512, at St Peter's, Rome, in the
   ninth year of our pontificate, by which, on the advice of the
   Dominicans, on account of the support, favours, sustenance and help
   notoriously provided to schismatics and heretics in the promotion of
   the said condemned and rejected quasicouncil of Pisa, by the king of
   France and not a few other prelates, officials, nobles and barons of
   the kingdom of France, we placed under ecclesiastical interdict the
   kingdom of France and particularly Lyons, excepting the duchy of
   Brittany, and we forbade the customary fairs of Lyons to be held in
   that city and we transferred them to the city of Geneva. We also renew
   the decrees, declarations, prohibitions and every clause contained in
   the letter, the said sacred council likewise having full information
   about them and giving its approval. As stated, we subject the aforesaid
   kingdom and its cities, lands, towns and any other territories to this
   interdict, and we transfer the fairs from Lyons to the said city of
   Geneva.
   In order that this sacred Lateran council may be brought to a fruitful
   and beneficial conclusion, and that the many other serious matters due
   for treatment and discussion in the council may proceed to the praise
   of almighty God and the exaltation of the universal church, we declare,
   with the full approval of the said sacred council, that the fourth
   session of the continuing celebration of the council shall be held on
   the tenth day of the present month of December. Let nobody therefore
   ... If anyone however...

SESSION 4

10 December 1512

   [The Pragmatic is revoked and the acts of the quasi-council of Pisa
   regarding the same are annulled1{Before this constitution, in the same
   session, there was also read out: A warning against the Pragmatic and
   its supporters} ]
   Julius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of
   the sacred council, for an everlasting record. Giving close attention
   by paternal and earnest consideration to the safety of the flock
   entrusted to us from above, to the reform of morals and the defence of
   the church's liberty, and to the peace and development of the catholic
   faith, we approve and renew, with the approval of this holy council,
   for the praise and glory of almighty God and the undivided Trinity, the
   letter recently issued by us, of which the same council is aware, by
   which we made a general reform of the Roman curia's officials and of
   their imposts. We ordered the letter to be made public by certain
   persons, who were afterwards designated, for the benefit of the
   faithful, and in accordance with our wishes. We now order it to be made
   public in detail by the said designated persons together with other
   prelates from various nations who are present in the aforesaid council
   and are to be appointed. Everything that can pervert human judgment is
   to cease, as is right and fitting. We order, moreover, that the
   declarations are to be referred to us in other sessions of this sacred
   council and are to be approved by the same council, in order that they
   may be duly carried out.
   Moreover, for considerable periods of time there has been great
   disparagement of the apostolic see and of the head, the liberty and the
   authority of the holy Roman universal church, as well as a limitation
   of the sacred canons, by a number of prelates of the French nation and
   by noble laymen and others supporting them, especially under pretext of
   a certain sanction which they call the Pragmatic{2 This Pragmatic
   Sanction had been promulgated by king Charles VII of France at Bourges
   on 7 July 1438, with the aim of removing abuses in the church, see DThC
   12/2 (1935) 2780-2786, DDrC 7 (1958) 109-113, and NCE 11 (1967)
   662-663}. We do not wish to endure further a thing so pernicious and
   offensive to God, a clear cheapening of and damage to the said church.
   For it is only in those regions that the sanction, carried out by those
   lacking all lawful power for that end and without the authority of
   popes or legitimate general councils, has been introduced and observed
   by way of an abuse. It must be rightly, along with its contents, be
   declared null and void and be repealed. Louis XI, king of France, of
   distinguished memory, repealed this sanction, as is clearly contained
   in his letters patent already made. Therefore, with the approval of the
   same council, we commit to the meetings of our venerable brothers,
   cardinals of the aforesaid church, and of other prelates, which are to
   be held in the upper room of the Lateran, insofar as this is necessary,
   the business of the declaration and abrogation which we are to make, as
   well as the report that is to be made to us and the same sacred council
   concerning the matters discussed in the first and other sessions,
   insofar as this can conveniently be done. We determine and decree that
   the prelates of France, chapters of churches and monasteries, and
   laymen favouring them, of whatever rank they may be, even royal, who
   approve or falsely use the said sanction, together with each and every
   other person thinking, either individually or in a group, that this
   sanction is to his advantage, be warned and cited, within a definite
   adequate term to be established, by a public edict -- which is to be
   fixed on the doors of the churches of Milan, Asti and Pavia, since a
   safe approach to France is not available -- that they are to appear
   before us and the aforesaid council and declare the reasons why the
   said sanction and its corrupting effect and misuse in matters
   concerning the authority, dignity and unity of the Roman church and the
   apostolic see, and the violation of sacred canons and of ecclesiastical
   freedom, ought not to be declared and judged null and void and be
   abrogated, and why those so warned and cited should not be restrained
   and held as if they had been warned and cited in person. Moreover, with
   regard to each and all provisions and collations of ecclesiastical
   benefices, confirmations of elections and petitions, grants of
   concessions, mandates and indults, of whatever kind, concerning both
   favours and matters of justice or both together, of whatever sense they
   may be -- which things we wish to be regarded as clearly stated in the
   present letter -- which were made by the synagogue or quasi-council of
   Pisa and its schismatic adherents, lacking all authority and merit,
   though they are indeed null and void, yet, for greater caution, we
   decree, with the approval of the said sacred council, that they are
   null and of no effect, force or importance; and that each individual,
   of whatever rank, status, grade, nobility, order or condition, to whom
   they were granted, or to whose convenience, advantage or honour they
   pertain, are to give up their fruits, incomes and profits, or to
   arrange for this to be done, and they are bound to restore both these
   things and their benefices and to give up the other aforesaid
   concessions, and that unless they have really and completely given up
   the benefices themselves and the other things granted to them, within
   two months from the date of this present letter, they are automatically
   deprived of the other ecclesiastical benefices which they hold by
   lawful title. Moreover, we apply whatever has been or shall be obtained
   in the way of fruits, rents and profits of this kind, and money-taxes
   imposed by the said quasi-council, to the campaign which is to be
   conducted against the infidels.
   In order that the declaration of reform, and of the nullity of the said
   sanction, as well as other business may be carried out in due season,
   and so that the prelates who are still to come to this sacred council
   (we have received news that some have already set out on their journey
   to attend) may be able to arrive without inconvenience, we declare,
   with the approval of the council, that the fifth session shall be held
   on 16 February, which will be Wednesday after the first Sunday of the
   coming Lent. Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however ...

SESSION 5

16 February 1513

   [Bull renewing and confirming the Constitution against not committing
   the evil of simony when electing the Roman pontiff]
   Julius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of
   the sacred council, for an everlasting record. The supreme maker of
   things, the creator of heaven and earth, has willed by his ineffable
   providence that the Roman pontiff preside over the christian people in
   the chair of pastoral supremacy, so that he may govern the holy, Roman,
   universal church in sincerity of heart and deeds and may strive after
   the progress of all the faithful. We therefore regard it as suitable
   and salutary that, in the election of the said pontiff, in order that
   the faithful may look upon him as a mirror of purity and honesty, all
   stain and every trace of simony shall be absent, that men shall be
   raised up for this burdensome office who, having embarked in the
   appropriate manner and order in a due, right and canonical way, may
   undertake the steering of the barque of Peter and may be, once
   established in so lofty a dignity, a support for right and good people
   and a terror for evil people; that by their example, the rest of the
   faithful may receive instruction on good behaviour and be directed in
   the way of salvation, that the things which have been determined and
   established by us for this, in accordance with the magnitude and
   seriousness of the case, may be approved and renewed by the sacred
   general council; and that the things so approved and renewed may be
   communicated, so that the more frequently they are upheld by the said
   authority, the more strongly they shall endure and the more resolutely
   they shall be observed and defended against the manifold attacks of the
   devil. Formerly, indeed, for great and urgent reasons, as a result of
   important and mature discussion and deliberation with men of great
   learning and authority, including cardinals of the Roman church,
   excellent and very experienced persons, a document on the following
   lines was issued by us.

Inserted constitution

   Julius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record. From a consideration that the detestable crime of simony is
   forbidden by both divine and human law, particularly in spiritual
   matters, and that it is especially heinous and destructive for the
   whole church in the election of the Roman pontiff, the vicar of our
   lord Jesus Christ, we therefore, placed by God in charge of the
   government of the same universal church, despite being of little merit,
   desire, so far as we are able with God's help, to take effective
   measures for the future with regard to the aforesaid things, as we are
   bound to, in accordance with the necessity of such an important matter
   and the greatness of the danger. With the advice and unanimous consent
   of our brothers, cardinals of the holy Roman church, by means of this
   our constitution which will have permanent validity, we establish,
   ordain, decree and define, by apostolic authority and the fulness of
   our power, that if it happens (which may God avert in his mercy and
   goodness towards all), after God has released us or our successors from
   the government of the universal church, that by the efforts of the
   enemy of the human race and following the urge of ambition or greed,
   the election of the Roman pontiff is made or effected by the person who
   is elected, or by one or several members of the college of cardinals,
   giving their votes in a manner that in any way involves simony being
   committed -- by the gift, promise or receipt of money, goods of any
   sort, castles, offices, benefices, promises or obligations -- by the
   person elected or by one or several other persons, in any manner or
   form whatsoever, even if the election resulted in a majority of
   two-thirds or in the unanimous choice of all the cardinals, or even in
   a spontaneous agreement on the part of all, without a scrutiny being
   made, then not only is this election or choice itself null, and does
   not bestow on the person elected or chosen in this fashion any right of
   either spiritual or temporal administration, but also there can be
   alleged and presented, against the person elected or chosen in this
   manner, by any one of the cardinals who has taken part in the election,
   the charge of simony, as a true and unquestionable heresy, so that the
   one elected is not regarded by anyone as the Roman pontiff.
   A further consequence is that the person elected in this manner is
   automatically deprived, without the need of any other declaration, of
   his cardinal's rank and of all other honours whatsoever as well as of
   cathedral churches, even metropolitan and patriarchical ones,
   monasteries, dignities and all other benefices and pensions of whatever
   kind which he was then holding by title or in commendam or otherwise;
   and that the elected person is to be regarded as, and is in fact, not a
   follower of the apostles but an apostate and, like Simon, a magicianl
   and a heresiarch, and perpetually debarred from each and all of the
   above-mentioned things. A simoniacal election of this kind is never at
   any time to be made valid by a subsequent enthronement or the passage
   of time, or even by the act of adoration or obedience of all the
   cardinals. It shall be lawful for each and all of the cardinals, even
   those who consented to the simoniacal election or promotion, even after
   the enthronement and adoration or obedience, as well as for all the
   clergy and the Roman people, together with those serving as prefects,
   castellans, captains and other officials at the Castel Sant' Angelo in
   Rome and any other strongholds of the Roman church, notwithstanding any
   submission or oath or pledge given, to withdraw without penalty and at
   any time from obedience and loyalty to the person so elected even if he
   has been enthroned (while they themselves, notwithstanding this, remain
   fully committed to the faith of the Roman church and to obedience
   towards a future Roman pontiff entering office in accordance with the
   canons) and to avoid him as a magician, a heathen, a publican and a
   heresiarch. To discomfort him still further, if he uses the pretext of
   the election to interfere in the government of the universal church,
   the cardinals who wish to oppose the aforesaid election can ask for the
   help of the secular arm against him.
   Those who break off obedience to him are not to be subject to any
   penalties and censures for the said separation, as though they were
   tearing the Lord's garment . However, the cardinals who elected him by
   simoniacal means are to be dealt with without further declaration as
   deprived of their orders as well as of their titles and honour as
   cardinals and of any patriarchal, archiepiscopal, episcopal or other
   prelacies, dignities and benefices which at that time they held by
   title or in commendam, or in which or to which they now have some
   claim, unless they totally and effectively abandon him and unite
   themselves without pretence or trickery to the other cardinals who did
   not consent to this simony, within eight days after they receive the
   request from the other cardinals, in person if this shall be possible
   or otherwise by a public announcement. Then, if they have joined
   themselves in full union with the said other cardinals, they shall
   immediately stand reintegrated, restored, rehabilitated and
   re-established in their former state, honours and dignities, even of
   the cardinalate, and in the churches and benefices which they had
   charge of or held, and shall stand absolved from the stain of simony
   and from any ecclesiastical censures and penalties.
   Intermediaries, brokers and bankers, whether clerical or lay, of
   whatever rank, quality or order they may have been, even patriarchal or
   archiepiscopal or episcopal, or enjoying other secular, worldly or
   ecclesiastical status, including spokesmen or envoys of any kings and
   princes, who had part in this simoniacal election, are by that very
   fact deprived of all their churches, benefices, prelacies and fiefs,
   and any other honours and possessions. They are debarred from anything
   of that kind and from making or benefiting from a will, and their
   property, like that of those condemned for treason, is immediately
   confiscated and allotted to the treasury of the apostolic see. if the
   aforesaid criminals are ecclesiastics or otherwise subjects of the
   Roman church. If they are not subjects of the Roman church, their goods
   and fiefs in regions under secular control are immediately allotted to
   the treasury of the secular ruler in whose territory the property is
   located; in such a way, however, that if within three months from the
   day on which it was known that they had committed simony, or had part
   in it, the rulers have not in fact allotted the said goods to their own
   treasury, then the goods are from that date considered as allotted to
   the treasury of the Roman church, and are immediately so considered
   without the need for any further pronouncement to the same effect.
   Also not binding and invalid, and ineffectual for taking action, are
   promises and pledges or solemn engagements made at any time for that
   purpose, even if prior to the election in question and even if made in
   any way through persons other than the cardinals, with some strange
   solemnity and form, including those made under oath or conditionally or
   dependent upon the outcome, or in the form of agreed bonds under
   whatever inducement, whether it be a deposit, loan, exchange,
   acknowledged receipt, gift, pledge, sale, exchange or any other kind of
   contract, even in the fuller form of the apostolic camera. Nobody can
   be bound or under pressure by the strength of these in a court of
   justice or elsewhere, and all may lawfully withdraw from them without
   penalty or any fear or stigma of perjury.
   Moreover, cardinals who have been involved in such a simoniacal
   election, and have abandoned the person thus elected, may join with the
   other cardinals, even those who consented to the simoniacal election
   but later joined with the cardinals who did not commit the said simony,
   if the latter are willing to join with them. If these cardinals are not
   willing, they may freely and canonically proceed without them in
   another place to the election of another pope without waiting for
   another formal declaration to the effect that the election was
   simoniacal, though there always remains in force our same current
   constitution. They may announce and call together a general council in
   a suitable place as they shall judge expedient, notwithstanding
   constitutions and apostolic orders, especially that of pope Alexander
   III, of happy memory, which begins Licet de evitanda discordia, and
   those of other Roman pontiffs, our predecessors, including those issued
   in general councils, and any other things to the contrary that Impose
   restraint.
   Finally, each and every one of the cardinals of the holy Roman church
   in office at the time, and their sacred college, are under pain of
   immediate excommunication, which they automatically incur and from
   which they cannot be absolved except by the canonically elected Roman
   pontiff, except when in immediate danger of death, not to dare, during
   a vacancy in the apostolic see, to contravene the aforesaid, or to
   legislate, dispose or ordain or to act or attempt anything in any way,
   under whatever alleged pretext or excuse, contrary to the aforesaid
   things or to any one of them. From this moment we decree it to be
   invalid and worthless if there should happen to be, by anyone knowingly
   or unknowingly, even by us, an attack on these or any one of the
   foregoing regulations. So that the meaning of this our present
   constitution, decree, statute, regulation and limitation may be brought
   to the notice of everyone, it is our will that our present letter be
   affixed to the doors of the basilica of the prince of the apostles and
   of the chancellery and in a corner of the Campo dei Fiori, and that no
   other formality for the publication of this letter be required or
   expected, but the aforesaid public display suffices for its solemn
   publication and perpetual force. Let nobody therefore . . . If anyone
   however . . Given at Rome at St Peter's on 14 January 1505/6, in the
   third year of our pontificate.
   [. . .] As we ponder how heavy is the burden and how damaging the loss
   to the vicars of Christ on earth that counterfeit elections would be,
   and how great the hurt they could bring to the christian religion,
   especially in these very difficult times when the whole christian
   religion is being disturbed in a variety of ways, we wish to set
   obstacles to the tricks and traps of Satan and to human presumption and
   ambition, so far as it is permitted to us, so that the aforesaid letter
   shall be better observed the more clearly it is established that it has
   been approved and renewed by the mature and healthy discussion of the
   said sacred council, by which it has been decreed and ordained, though
   it does not need any other approval for its permanence and validity.
   For a more ample safeguard, and to remove all excuse for guile and
   malice on the part of evil thinkers and those striving to overthrow so
   sound a constitution, with a view to the letter being observed with
   greater determination and being more difficult to remove, to the extent
   that it is defended by the approval of so many of the fathers, we
   therefore, with the approval of this Lateran council and with the
   authority and fullness of power stated above, confirm and renew the
   said letter together with every statute, regulation, decree,
   definition, penalty, restraint, and all the other and individual
   clauses contained in it; we order it to be maintained and observed
   without change or breach and to preserve the authority of an unchanging
   firmness; and we decree and declare that cardinals, mediators,
   spokesmen, envoys and others listed in the said letter are and shall be
   bound to the observance of the said letter and of each and every point
   expressed in it, under pain of the censures and penalties and other
   things contained in it, in accordance with its meaning and form;
   notwithstanding apostolic constitutions and ordinances, as well as all
   those things which we wished not to prevent in the said letter, and
   other things of any kind to the contrary. Let nobody therefore ... If

   Pragmatic Sanction were also recorded, especially Julius II's
   constitution Inter alia (Msi 32, 772-773).}

SESSION 6

27 April 1513

   [Safeconduct for those who wish and ought to come to the council, for
   their coming, residence, exchange of views and return journey]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. By the supreme ordinance of
   the omnipotent who governs the things of heaven and of earth by his
   providence, we preside over his holy and universal church, though we
   are unworthy. Instructed by the saving and most holy teaching of the
   doctor of the gentiles, we direct our chief attention, among the many
   anxieties from which we unceasingly suffer distress, towards those
   things in particular by means of which unending unity and unsullied
   charity may abide in the church; the flock committed to us may go
   forward along the right courses towards the way of salvation, and the
   name of Christians and the sign of the most sacred cross, in which the
   faithful have been saved, may be more widely spread, after the infidels
   have been expelled with the help of God's right hand.
   Indeed, after the holding of five sessions of the sacred general
   Lateran council, pope Julius II of happy memory, our predecessor, by
   the advice and agreement of our venerable brothers the cardinals of the
   holy Roman church, of whose number we then were, in a praiseworthy and
   lawful manner and for sound reasons, guided by the holy Spirit,
   summoned the sixth session of the council to take place on the eleventh
   day of this month. But after he had been taken from our midst, we
   postponed the sixth session until today, with the advice and consent of
   our said brothers, for reasons which were then expressed and for other
   reasons influencing the attitude of us and of our said brothers. But
   since there had always been an inner determination within us, while we
   were of lesser rank, to see the general council being celebrated (as a
   principal means of cultivating the Lord's field), now that we have been
   raised to the highest point of the apostolate, considering that a duty
   which results from the office of pastoral care enjoined on us has
   coincided with our honourable and beneficial wish, we have undertaken
   this matter with a more earnest desire and complete readiness of mind.
   Consequently, with the approval of the same sacred Lateran council we
   approve the postponement which we made and the council itself, until
   the aims for which it was summoned have been completed, in particular
   that a general and settled peace may be arranged between christian
   princes and rulers after the violence of wars has been stilled and
   armed conflict set aside. We intend to apply and direct all our efforts
   to this peace, with untiring care and leaving nothing untried for so
   salutary a good. We declare that it is and shall be our unchangeable
   attitude and intention that, after those things which affect the praise
   of God and the exaltation of the aforesaid church and the harmony of
   Christ's faithful have been achieved, the holy and necessary campaign
   against the enemies of the catholic faith may be carried out and may
   achieve (with the favour of the most High) a triumphant outcome.
   In order, however, that those who ought to attend so very useful a
   council may not be held back in any way from coming, we hereby grant
   and concede, with the approval of the said sacred council, to each and
   every one of those summoned to the council by the said Julius, our
   predecessor, or who ought to take part, by right or custom, in the
   meetings of general councils, especially those of the French nation,
   and to those schismatics and others who are coming to the said Lateran
   council by common or special right, on account of a declaration or
   apostolic letter of our predecessors or of the apostolic see (except,
   of course, those under prohibition), and to the attendants and
   associates of those who come, of whatever status, rank, condition or
   nobility they may be, ecclesiastical or secular, for themselves and all
   their belongings, a free, guaranteed and fully comprehensive
   safeconduct, for coming by land or sea through the states, territories
   and places that are subject to the said Roman church, to this Lateran
   council in Rome, and of residing in the city and freely exchanging
   views, and of leaving it as often as they wish, with complete,
   unrestricted and total security and with a true and unchallengeable
   papal guarantee, notwithstanding any impositions of ecclesiastical or
   secular censures and penalties which may have been promulgated in
   general against them, for whatever reasons, by law or by the aforesaid
   see, under any forms of words or clauses, and which they may in general
   have incurred. By our letters we shall encourage, warn, and request
   each and every christian king, prince and ruler that, out of reverence
   for almighty God and the apostolic see, they are not to molest or cause
   to be molested directly or indirectly, in any way in their persons or
   goods, those on their way to this sacred Lateran council, but they are
   to allow them to come in freedom, security and peace.
   In addition, for the carrying out of the celebration of this council,
   we declare that the seventh session shall be held on 23 May next. Let
   nobody therefore . . . If anyone however...

   the eighth session to 16 November, is read out and approved.]

SESSION 8

19 December 1513

   [Condemnation of every proposition contrary to the truth of the
   enlightened christian faith]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. The burden of apostolic
   government ever drives us on so that, for the weaknesses of souls
   requiring to be healed, of which the almighty Creator from on high has
   willed us to have the care, and for those ills in particular which are
   now seen to be pressing most urgently on the faithful, we may exercise,
   like the Samaritan in the gospel, the task of healing with oil and
   wine, lest that rebuke of Jeremiah may be cast at us: Is there no balm
   in Gilead, is there no physician there? Consequently, since in our days
   (which we endure with sorrow) the sower of cockle, the ancient enemy of
   the human race, has dared to scatter and multiply in the Lord's field
   some extremely pernicious errors, which have always been rejected by
   the faithful, especially on the nature of the rational soul, with the
   claim that it is mortal, or only one among all human beings, and since
   some, playing the philosopher without due care, assert that this
   proposition is true at least according to philosophy, it is our desire
   to apply suitable remedies against this infection and, with the
   approval of the sacred council, we condemn and reject all those who
   insist that the intellectual soul is mortal, or that it is only one
   among all human beings, and those who suggest doubts on this topic. For
   the soul not only truly exists of itself and essentially as the form of
   the human body, as is said in the canon of our predecessor of happy
   memory, pope Clement V, promulgated in the general council of Vienne,
   but it is also immortal; and further, for the enormous number of bodies
   into which it is infused individually, it can and ought to be and is
   multiplied. This is clearly established from the gospel when the Lord
   says, They cannot kill the soul; and in another place, Whoever hates
   his life in this world, will keep it for eternal life and when he
   promises eternal rewards and eternal punishments to those who will be
   judged according to the merits of their life; otherwise, the
   incarnation and other mysteries of Christ would be of no benefit to us,
   nor would resurrection be something to look forward to, and the saints
   and the just would be (as the Apostle says) the most miserable of all
   people.
   And since truth cannot contradict truth, we define that every statement
   contrary to the enlightened truth of the faith is totally false and we
   strictly forbid teaching otherwise to be permitted. We decree that all
   those who cling to erroneous statements of this kind, thus sowing
   heresies which are wholly condemned, should be avoided in every way and
   punished as detestable and odious heretics and infidels who are
   undermining the catholic faith. Moreover we strictly enjoin on each and
   every philosopher who teaches publicly in the universities or
   elsewhere, that when they explain or address to their audience the
   principles or conclusions of philosophers, where these are known to
   deviate from the true faith -- as in the assertion of the soul's
   mortality or of there being only one soul or of the eternity of the
   world and other topics of this kind -- they are obliged to devote their
   every effort to clarify for their listeners the truth of the christian
   religion, to teach it by convincing arguments, so far as this is
   possible, and to apply themselves to the full extent of their energies
   to refuting and disposing of the philosophers' opposing arguments,
   since all the solutions are available.
   But it does not suffice occasionally to clip the roots of the brambles,
   if the ground is not dug deeply so as to check them beginning again to
   multiply, and if there are not removed their seeds and root causes from
   which they grow so easily. That is why, since the prolonged study of
   human philosophy -- which God has made empty and foolish, as the
   Apostle says, when that study lacks the flavouring of divine wisdom and
   the light of revealed truth -- sometimes leads to error rather than to
   the discovery of the truth, we ordain and rule by this salutary
   constitution, in order to suppress all occasions of falling into error
   with respect to the matters referred to above, that from this time
   onwards none of those in sacred orders, whether religious or seculars
   or others so committed, when they follow courses in universities or
   other public institutions, may devote themselves to the study of
   philosophy or poetry for longer than five years after the study of
   grammar and dialectic, without their giving some time to the study of
   theology or pontifical law. Once these five years are past, if someone
   wishes to sweat over such studies, he may do so only if at the same
   time, or in some other way, he actively devotes himself to theology or
   the sacred canons; so that the Lord's priests may find the means, in
   these holy and useful occupations, for cleansing and healing the
   infected sources of philosophy and poetry.
   We command, in virtue of holy obedience, that these canons are to be
   published each year, at the beginning of the course, by the local
   ordinaries and rectors of universities where institutes of general
   studies flourish. Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however...
   [On arranging peace between christian princes and on bringing back the
   Bohemians who reject the faith]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. We are continuing the sacred
   Lateran council for the praise of the almighty and undivided Trinity
   and for the glory of him whose place we represent on earth, who
   develops peace and harmony in his high heavens, and who, on his
   departure from this world, left peace as a lawful inheritance to his
   disciples. For, in the previous seventh session, the council was
   confronting, among other matters, the threatening and very obvious
   danger from the infidels and the spilling of christian blood, which
   even then was being poured out because of our blatant faults. The
   quarrels between christian kings and princes and peoples must also be
   removed. and we were being compelled to seek with all our strength for
   peace between them. This was the reason for having to arrange one of
   the more important meetings of the said council: so that peace should
   follow and be maintained as unbroken and leading to its due fulfilment,
   especially in these times when the power of the infidels is recognised
   to have grown to a remarkable extent. Therefore, with the approval of
   the same council, we have arranged and decided to send to the aforesaid
   kings, princes and rulers alert legates and envoys of peace, who are
   outstanding in learning, experience and goodness, with a view to
   negotiating and arranging peace. And, in order that these men may lay
   aside their arms, we have called upon their spokesmen who are present
   at the council, insofar as we were able to do with God's help, to
   devote all their energy and strength, out of reverence for the
   apostolic see and the union of the faithful, to giving notice of these
   matters to their kings, princes and rulers. These are invited, in our
   name, to negotiate and listen with good will and honour to the
   apostolic legates themselves, and to act in favour of our just and holy
   desires which are to be set before them by these messengers.
   We were persuading ourself that they will do this, in order that our
   legates may be able to take up the task of the embassy as quickly as
   possible and manfully complete the undertaking, and so that, by the
   favour of the Father of lights (from whom comes every best gift) peace
   can be negotiated and arranged and, once this has been settled, the
   holy and necessary expedition against the frenzy of the infidels,
   panting to have their fill of christian blood, can take place and be
   brought to a favourable conclusion for the safety and peace of the
   whole of Christianity. After this we were hoping from the depths of our
   heart, because of our pastoral office, for peace and union within the
   whole christian people and in particular among the same kings, rulers
   and princes from whose discord it was feared that prolonged and serious
   damage could daily affect the christian state. A hope began to rise
   that the christian state would be cared for in a useful and salutary
   way by this peace and unity, because of the authority of these men. We
   dispatched our messengers and letters to the aforesaid kings, princes
   and rulers -- at that time in disunion with each other -- for them to
   be exhorted, requested and warned. We omitted nothing (so far as lay in
   our power) to arrange and produce by our every effort that, once
   discord and disagreement of any kind had been removed, they would wish
   eventually to return, in complete agreement, grace and love, to
   universal peace, harmony and union. In this way, further losses would
   not be inflicted on Christians from the hands of the savage ruler of
   the Turks or from other infidels, but there would be a rallying of
   forces to crush the terrible fury and the boastful endeavours of those
   peoples.
   In that situation, as we strive with all thought, care, effort and zeal
   for everything to be brought to the desired end, and with confidence in
   the gift of God, we have decreed that legates with a special mission
   from us -- who will be cardinals of the holy Roman church and who are
   soon to be named by us, on the advice of our brothers, in our secret
   consistory -- shall be appointed and sent with authority and with the
   necessary and appropriate faculties, as messengers of peace, for the
   arranging, negotiating and settling of this universal peace among
   Christians, for the embarking upon an expedition against the infidels,
   with the approval of this sacred council, and for inducing the said
   kings, out of generosity of soul befitting their rank and out of
   devotion towards the catholic faith, to move with ready and eager minds
   towards the holy tasks of both peace and the expedition, for the total
   and perfect protection, defence and safety of the entire christian
   state.
   In addition, since very great offence is given to God from the
   prolonged and manifold heresy of the Bohemians, and scandal is caused
   to the christian people, the charge of bringing back these people to
   the light and harmony of the true faith has been wholly entrusted by us
   for the immediate future to our dear son, Thomas of Esztergom,
   cardinal-priest of the title of St Martin in the Hills, as legate of
   ourself and the apostolic see to Hungary and Bohemia. We exhort these
   people in the Lord not to neglect to dispatch some of their spokesmen,
   with an adequate mandate, either to us and this sacred Lateran council
   or to the same Thomas, cardinal-legate, who will be nearer to them. The
   purpose will be to exchange views with regard to an appropriate remedy
   by which they may recognise the errors to which they have long been in
   thrall and may be led back, with God's guidance, to the true practice
   of religion and into the bosom of holy mother church. With the approval
   of the sacred council, by the tenor of the present letter, we grant and
   bestow on them, by the faith of a pontiff, a public guarantee and a
   free safe-conduct as to their coming, going, remaining for as long as
   the negotiation of the aforesaid matters shall last, and afterwards for
   departing and returning to their own territories; and we shall consent
   to their wishes so far as we can under God.
   So that this sacred Lateran council may be brought to the completion of
   the fruitful benefit desired, since many other serious subjects remain
   to be discussed and debated for the praise of God and the triumph of
   his church, we declare with the approval of the sacred council, that
   the ninth session of the continuing celebration of this sacred Lateran
   council shall be held on 5 April 1514, in the first year of our
   pontificate, which will be Wednesday after Passion Sunday. Let nobody
   therefore ... If anyone however...
   [Bull on reform]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Placed by the gift of divine
   grace at the supreme point of the apostolic hierarchy, we thought
   nothing was more in keeping with our official duty than to survey, with
   zeal and care, everything which could pertain to the protection,
   soundness and extension of the catholic flock entrusted to us. To this
   purpose we have applied all the force of our activity and the strength
   of our mind and talent. Our predecessor of happy memory, pope Julius
   II, since he was concerned about the well-being of the faithful and
   anxious to protect it, had summoned the ecumenical Lateran council for
   many other reasons indeed, but also because a constant complaint was
   being pressed concerning the officials of the Roman curia. For these
   reasons there were appointed a number of committees composed of his
   venerable brothers, the cardinals of the holy Roman church, of whose
   number we were then, and also of prelates, to investigate carefully
   into these complaints. In order that those attached to the curia and
   others approaching it for favours would not in the meantime be
   tormented by the excessive burden of expenses and that, at the same
   time, the ill-repute by which the said officials were deeply disturbed
   might be appeased by a speedy remedy, he issued a bull of reform by
   which they were bound anew, under a heavy penalty, to keep the legal
   terms of their offices. Because death intervened, he was unable to
   legislate in particular about the excesses or to complete the council.
   We, as the successor of the concern no less than of the office, right
   at the beginning of our pontificate, did not delay to resume the synod,
   to promote peace between christian princes and no less, since it is our
   intention to complete a universal reform, to strengthen by new aids
   what was first provided by our predecessor concerning the curial
   offices, and to follow this through with the expanded committees. For
   no more pressing anxiety weighs on us than that the thorns and brambles
   be pulled up from the Lord's field, and if there is anything hindering
   its cultivation, it is to be removed root and branch. Therefore, after
   a careful report had been received from the committees, with notice of
   what was being side-tracked by which persons, we restored to the norm
   whatever had deviated either from a sound and praiseworthy custom or
   from a long-standing institution. We gathered these together into one
   bull of reform published on this matter with the approval of the sacred
   council;{This bull Pastoralis officii was published on 13 Dec. 1513,
   but it was never submitted to a vote of the fathers} and we appointed
   to execute it those who would insist on the decisions being kept. With
   the approval of this sacred council, we order this to be observed
   without alteration and without deceit by the officials themselves as
   well as by others, according as it affects each, under penalty of
   immediate excommunication from which they can only be absolved by the
   Roman pontiff (except in immediate danger of death), in such a way
   that, in addition to this and other penalties stated in detail in the
   bull, those acting against it are automatically suspended for six
   months from the office in which they committed the fault. And if they
   have failed for a second time in the same office, they are deprived for
   ever because they have contaminated the office itself. After they have
   been brought back to good conduct by means of our constitution, and the
   general damage has been checked and removed, we shall proceed to the
   remaining stages of the reform.
   If the Almighty in his mercy allows us to settle peace among the
   christian leaders, we shall press on not only to destroy completely the
   bad seeds, but also to expand the territories of Christ, and, supported
   by these achievements, we shall go forward, with God favouring his own
   purposes, to the most holy expedition against the infidels, the desire
   for which is deeply fixed in our heart .
   Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however...

SESSION 9

5 May 1514

   [The pope urges christian rulers to make peace among themselves so that
   an expedition against the enemies of the christian faith may be
   possible]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. After we had been called by
   divine dispensation to the care and rule of the universal church, even
   though we are unworthy of so great a responsibility, we began from the
   highest point of the apostolate, as from the top of Mount Sion, to turn
   our immediate gaze and direct our mind to the things that seem to be of
   primary importance for the salvation, peace and extension of the church
   itself. When we focused all our care, thought and zeal in this
   direction, like an experienced and watchful shepherd, we found nothing
   more serious or dangerous to the christian state and more opposed to
   our holy desire than the fierce madness of armed conflicts. For, as a
   result of them, Italy has been almost wiped out by internecine
   slaughter, cities and territories have been disfigured, partly
   overturned and partly levelled, provinces and kingdoms have been
   stricken, and people cease not to act with madness and to welter in
   christian blood. Hence we have judged that nothing should be given more
   importance, consideration and attention than the quelling of these wars
   and the re-ordering of ecclesiastical discipline in accordance with
   resources and circumstances, so that with God appeased by a change of
   life, after quarrels have been set aside, we may be able to bring
   together and gather into one the Lord's flock entrusted to our care,
   and to encourage and arouse this flock more readily, in a union of
   peace and harmony, as by a very strong binding force, against the
   common enemies of the christian faith who are now threatening it .
   This our intense desire for this campaign against the evil and
   implacable enemies of the cross of Christ is indeed so implanted in our
   heart that we determined to continue and follow up the sacred Lateran
   council -- which was summoned and begun by our predecessor of happy
   memory, Julius II, and interrupted by his death -- for that special
   reason, as is clear from all the different sessions held by us in the
   same council. Thus, with the christian princes or their spokesmen
   assembled at the same council, and prelates from different parts of the
   world coming to it, once peace between these christian princes had been
   settled and (as is right) the noxious brambles of heresies had been
   first uprooted from the Lord's field, then the things necessary for the
   campaign against the same enemies, and what concerns the glory and
   triumph of the orthodox faith, and various other matters, could be
   happily decided upon by the timely advice and agreement of all.
   Although many distinguished men, outstanding in every branch of
   learning, came from different parts of Europe to this council, which
   had been solemnly summoned and duly proclaimed, many also, legitimately
   hindered, sent their instructions in official form. However, because of
   the difficulties from wars and circumstances as a result of which many
   territories have been blocked by hostile arms for a long time, the
   resources and large numbers which we desired could not be assembled.
   Moreover, that we have not as yet sent the specially appointed legates
   to kings and princes to promote union and peace between the same rulers
   -- something that perhaps seems necessary to many and that we too think
   is especially opportune -- cannot be attributed to us. The reason, of
   course, why we refrained from doing so is this: nearly all the princes
   made it known by letters and messages to us, that the sending of
   legates was not at all necessary or expedient. Nevertheless, we sent
   men of discretion and proved loyalty, endowed with the rank of bishop,
   as our envoys to those very princes who were undertaking serious armed
   activity among themselves and, as far as could be guessed, rather
   bitter wars. It has come about, especially by the action of these
   envoys, that truces have been agreed between some of the princes and
   the rest are thought to be on the point of giving their consent.
   Therefore we shall not put off sending the special legates, as we
   decided in the last session, whenever this is necessary and profitable
   for the setting up of a stable and lasting peace among them, and as we
   previously proposed. In the meantime, we shall not cease to act and
   reflect on what is relevant to the situation, with the spokesmen of the
   same princes who are negotiating with us, and to press on and exhort
   them and their princes to this action by means of our envoys and
   letters.
   Oh that the almighty and merciful God would assist from on high our
   plans for peace and our constant thoughts, would regard the faithful
   people with more benevolent and favourable eyes and, for the sake of
   common safety and peace and for the suppression of the haughty madness
   of the wicked enemies of the christian name, would give a propitious
   hearing to their devout prayers ! By our apostolic authority, we enjoin
   on each and every primate, patriarch and archbishop, on chapters of
   cathedral and collegiate churches, both secular and those belonging to
   any of the religious orders, on colleges and convents, on leaders of
   peoples, deans, rectors of churches and others who have charge of
   souls, and on preachers, alms-collectors and those who expound the word
   of God to the people, and we order in virtue of holy obedience, that
   within the celebration of masses, during the time that the word of God
   is being set before the people or outside that time, and in prayers
   which they will say in chapter or as convents, or at some other time in
   any kind of gathering, they are to keep the following special collects
   for the peace of Christians and for the confounding of the infidels
   respectively: O God, from whom holy desires, and, O God, in whose hands
   are all power and authority over kingdoms, look to the help of
   Christians. And they are no less to enjoin on members of their dioceses
   and on any other persons of either sex, whether ecclesiastical or
   secular, over whom they have authority by reason of a prelature or any
   other ecclesiastical position of authority, and to encourage in the
   Lord those to whom God's word is proposed on their own or another's
   responsibility, that they should pour forth in private devout prayers
   to God himself and to his most glorious mother, in the Lord's prayer
   and the Hail Mary, for the peace of Christians (as mentioned above) and
   for the complete destruction of the infidels.
   Further, whoever of those mentioned above think that, by influence or
   favour with secular princes of any rank, distinction or dignity, or
   with their advisers, associates, attendants or officials, or with the
   magistrates, rectors and lieutenants of cities, towns, universities or
   any secular institutions, or with other persons of either sex,
   ecclesiastical or secular, they can take steps towards a universal or
   particular peace between princes, rulers and christian peoples, and
   towards the campaign against the infidels, let them use strong
   encouragement and lead them on to this peace and the campaign. By the
   tender mercy of our God and the merit of the passion of his
   only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, we exhort all of them with all
   possible emotion of our heart, and we counsel them by the authority of
   the pastoral office which we exercise, to lay aside private and public
   enmities and to turn to embracing the endeavour for peace and deciding
   on the aforesaid campaign.
   We strictly forbid each and every prelate, prince or individual,
   whether ecclesiastical or secular, of whatever state, rank, dignity,
   pre-eminence or condition they may be, under threat of the divine
   judgment, to presume to introduce in any way, directly or indirectly,
   openly or secretly, any obstacle to the said peace which is to be
   negotiated by us or by our agents, whether legates or envoys of the
   apostolic see endowed (as said before) with the episcopal rank, for the
   defence of the christian state of the faithful. Those who, in working
   towards this peace, think that there is involved something of a private
   or a public nature that is of importance to their princes, cities or
   states, the care for whom or which pertains to them because of some
   office or public function should, as far as it will be possible in the
   Lord, with due moderation and calm take control of the matter inasmuch
   as it involves support and goodwill towards the coming peace. Indeed,
   those who wish to rouse the faithful by Christ's spiritual gifts, when
   these are duly contrite and absolved, and to pour out devout prayers
   for obtaining peace and for deciding on the expedition, so that the
   said peace and the campaign against the said enemies of the christian
   faith may be brought about and be secured from God himself, will devote
   worthwhile and well-considered efforts as often as they do this. These
   prayers, offered with devotion, should take place in masses, sermons
   and other divine services, in collegial, conventual and other public or
   communal prayers, and among princes, advisers, officials, governors and
   other persons named above who seem to have some influence in making or
   arranging the peace and in deciding (as said before) on the campaign
   against the enemies of the unconquered cross.
   Trusting in the mercy of God and the authority of his blessed apostles
   Peter and Paul, we grant remission of one hundred days of imposed
   penances to those who, individually and in private, offer prayers to
   obtain the foregoing from God; seven times each day if they do it so
   often or, if fewer, as often as they shall do it; until the universal
   peace -- which is receiving our constant attention -between princes and
   peoples at present in armed dispute has been established, and the
   campaign against the infidels has been decreed with our approval. We
   lay an obligation on our venerable brothers, primates, patriarchs,
   archbishops and bishops, to whom the present letter or copies of it,
   accurately printed either in Rome or elsewhere, shall come under
   official seals, to have it published with all possible speed in their
   provinces and dioceses, and to give firm instructions for its due
   execution.
   In the meantime, with the approval of the sacred council, we have
   decreed, as we proposed and desired with all our heart, the
   ecclesiastical reform of our curia and of our venerable brothers, the
   cardinals of the holy Roman church, and of others dwelling in Rome, and
   many other necessary things, which will be contained in our other
   letters due for publication in this same session. It was Julius, our
   predecessor, who summoned to this council all those who were accustomed
   to attend councils. He gave them a comprehensive safe-conduct so that
   they could make the journey and arrive safely and unharmed. However,
   many prelates who ought to have come have so far not arrived, perhaps
   because of the obstacles already stated. In our desire to go ahead with
   the more serious business due in the next session, we appeal to in the
   Lord, and we ask and counsel by the tender mercy of the same, prelates,
   kings, dukes, marquises, counts and others who usually come or send
   someone to a general council, but who have not yet provided spokesmen
   or legitimate instructions, to decide with all possible speed either to
   come in person or to send chosen and competent envoys, with valid
   instructions, to this sacred Lateran council which is so beneficial to
   the christian state.
   With regard to those venerable brethren, patriarchs, archbishops,
   bishops, abbots and prelates - especially those bound under oath to
   visit the place of the apostles Peter and Paul at certain fixed times,
   and to attend in person general councils which have been summoned,
   including those under that obligation at the time of their promotion --
   whose obstinacy as being non-attenders at various sessions became a
   matter of frequent accusation by the sponsor of the same council, there
   is to be found in solemn form both a petition for proceedings against
   them and a statement of the censures and penalties incurred. This is
   notwithstanding any privileges, concessions and indults that were
   granted confirmed or renewed by us or our said predecessors in favour
   of them and their churches, monasteries and benefices. These we annul
   and invalidate through our certain knowledge and fullness of power,
   considering them to be fully stated here. We impose in virtue of holy
   obedience, and we strictly command under the penalties of
   excommunication and perjury and others derived from law or custom, and
   in particular from the letter which summoned and proclaimed the said
   Lateran council and was promulgated by our predecessor, Julius himself
   that they must attend in person the said Lateran council and remain in
   Rome until it has reached its conclusion and been terminated by our
   authority, unless they are prevented by some legitimate excuse. And if
   (as we said) they have somehow been prevented, they are to send their
   suitably qualified representatives with a full mandate on the matters
   that will have to be treated, dealt with and advised upon.
   In order to remove completely all excuse and leave no pretext of any
   impediment to anyone who is obliged to attend, in addition to the
   public guarantee which was clearly granted at the summoning of this
   council to all coming to it we give, concede and grant, acting on the
   advice and power mentioned above with the same council's approval, to
   each and all who have been accustomed to be present at the meetings of
   general councils and are coming to the present Lateran council, as well
   as to members of their personal staff, of whatever status rank, order
   and condition or nobility they may be, ecclesiastical and secular, a
   free, safe and secure safe-conduct and, by apostolic authority in the
   meaning of the present letter, full protection in all its aspects, for
   themselves and for all their possessions of any kind as they pass
   through cities, territories and places, by sea and land, which are
   subject to the said Roman church, for the journey to the Lateran
   council in Rome, for remaining in the city of freedom, for exchanging
   views according to their opinions, for departing therefrom as often as
   they may wish and also after four months from the conclusion and
   dispersal of the said council; and we promise to give readily other
   safe-conducts and guarantees to those desiring to have them. Each and
   all of these visitors we shall deal with and welcome with kindness and
   charity.
   Under the threat of the divine majesty and of our displeasure, and of
   the penalties against those impeding the holding of councils,
   particularly the said Lateran council, which are contained and set down
   in law or in the letter of the aforesaid summons of our predecessor, we
   are instructing each and all secular princes, of whatever exalted rank
   they may be, including imperial, royal, queenly, ducal or any other,
   the governors of cities, and citizens governing or ruling their states,
   to grant to the prelates and others coming to the said Lateran council
   a free permission and licence, a safe-conduct for coming and returning,
   and a free and unharmed transit through the dominions, lands and
   property of theirs through which the said persons must pass together
   with their equipment, possessions and horses; all exceptions and
   excuses being completely set aside and without force.
   In addition we order and command, under pain of our displeasure and of
   other penalties which can be inflicted at our will, each and all of our
   people who bear arms, both infantry and cavalry, their commanders and
   captains, the castellans of our fortresses, the legates, governors,
   rulers, lieutenants, authorities, officials and vassals of the cities
   and territories that are subject to the said Roman church, and any
   others of whatever rank, status, condition or distinction they may be,
   to give permission, and to be responsible for the giving of permission,
   to those coming to the Lateran council, to pass through in freedom,
   safety and security, to stay, and to return, so that such a holy,
   praiseworthy and very necessary council may not be frustrated for any
   reason or pretext, and that those coming to it may be able to live in
   peace and calm and without restraint and to say and develop under the
   same conditions the things which concern the honour of almighty God and
   the standing of the whole church. This we enjoin notwithstanding any
   constitutions, apostolic ordinances, imperial laws or municipal
   statutes and customs (even those reinforced by oath and apostolic
   confirmation or by any other authority) which could modify in any
   respect or impede in any way the said safe-conduct and guarantee, even
   if the constitutions etc. were of such a kind that an individual,
   precise, clear and distinct form of speech, or some other clearly
   stated expression, should be employed regarding them, and not just
   general clauses which only imply the matter, for we consider the
   significance of all the above things to be clearly stated by the
   present letter, as if they had been included word for word. Let nobody
   therefore . . . If anyone however . . .
   [Bull on reform of the curia]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. It is eminently fitting for
   the Roman pontiff to carry out the duty of a provident shepherd, in
   order to care for and keep safe the Lord's flock entrusted to him by
   God, since, by the will of the supreme ordinance by which the things of
   heaven and of earth are arranged by ineffable providence, he acts on
   the lofty throne of St Peter as vicar on earth of Christ, the
   only-begotten Son of God. When we notice, out of solicitude for our
   said pastoral office, that church discipline and the pattern of a sound
   and upright life are worsening, disappearing and going further astray
   from the right path throughout almost all the ranks of Christ's
   faithful, with a disregard for law and with exemption from punishment,
   as a result of the troubles of the times and the malice of human
   beings, it must be feared that, unless checked by a well-guided
   improvement, there will be a daily falling into a variety of faults
   under the security of sin and soon, with the appearance of public
   scandals, a complete breakdown. We desire, then, as far as it is
   permitted to us from on high, to check the evils from becoming too
   strong, to restore a great many things to their earlier observance of
   the sacred canons, to create with God's help an improvement in keeping
   with the established practice of the holy fathers, and to give -- with
   the approval of the sacred Lateran council initiated for that reason,
   among others, by our predecessor of happy memory, pope Julius II, and
   continued by us -healthy guidance to all these matters.
   In order to make a start, we take up the points which for the present
   seem more appropriate and which, having often been neglected during
   particular generations, have brought great loss to the christian
   religion and produced very great scandals in the church of God. We have
   therefore decided to begin with preferment to ecclesiastical dignities.
   Our predecessor of devout memory, pope Alexander III, also in a Lateran
   council, decreed that age, a serious character and knowledge of letters
   are to be carefully examined in the preferment of individuals to
   bishoprics and abbacies. Moreover, nothing impedes the church of God
   more than when unworthy prelates are accepted for the government of
   churches. Therefore, in the preferment of prelates, the Roman pontiffs
   must give much attention to the matter, especially because they will
   have to give an account to God at the last judgment about those given
   preferment by them to churches and monasteries. Consequently, we rule
   and establish that henceforward, in accordance with the constitution of
   the aforesaid Alexander III, for vacant churches and monasteries of
   patriarchal, metropolitan and cathedral status, the person provided is
   to be of mature age, learning and serious character, as said above, and
   the provision is not to be made at someone's urging, by means of
   recommendation, direction or enforcement, or in any other way, unless
   it has seemed right to act differently on the grounds of advantage to
   the churches, prudence, nobility, uprightness, experience, lengthy
   contact with the curia (together with adequate learning), or service to
   the apostolic see. We wish the same to be observed regarding the
   persons elected and chosen in elections and choices that have
   customarily been admitted by the apostolic see. But if the question
   arises of providing for churches and monasteries of this kind with
   persons of less than thirty years of age, there can be no dispensation
   for them to be in charge of churches before their twenty-seventh year
   of age or of monasteries before their twenty-second year.
   Indeed, so that suitable persons may be advanced with greater exactness
   and care, we rule that the cardinal to whom the reporting on an
   election, appointment or provision to a church or monastery has been
   entrusted, ought, before he gives an account in the sacred consistory
   (as the custom is) of his carrying out of such an examination or report
   assigned to him, to make his report known to one of the older cardinals
   of each grade, personally in the actual consistory, or, if there was no
   consistory on the day appointed for him to give his account, then by
   means of his secretary or some other member of his personal staff, and
   the three older cardinals in question are bound to communicate the
   report as soon as possible to the other cardinals of their grade. The
   said cardinal making the report shall personally examine the business
   of the election, administration, appointment or promotion in summary
   and extra-judicial fashion. If any have spoken against it, he is
   obliged to call, after the objectors have been summoned, competent,
   responsible and trustworthy witnesses and, if it should be necessary or
   appropriate, others by virtue of office. He is bound to bring with him
   to the consistory, on the day the report has to be made, the stages and
   decisions of the report together with the statements of the witnesses,
   and he shall not give his report in any form until the person to be
   promoted, if he is at the curia, shall have first visited the majority
   of the cardinals in order that they may be able to learn at first hand,
   insofar as it is relevant to his character, what they shall soon learn
   from the report of their colleague. Moreover, the person promoted is
   obliged, by longstanding practice and laudable custom, to visit as soon
   as possible the same cardinals who are then in the curia. This practice
   and praiseworthy custom, indeed, we renew and command to be kept
   without change.
   Since it is right to maintain episcopal dignity unharmed, and for it to
   be protected from indiscriminate exposure to the attacks of wicked
   persons and to the false charges of accusers, we decree that no bishop
   or abbot may be deprived of his rank when anyone urges a charge or
   presses demands (unless the opportunity for a legitimate defence is
   afforded to him), even if the charges have been widely known and, after
   the parties have been attentively heard, the case has been fully
   proved; nor may any prelate be transferred against his will, except for
   other just and efficacious reasons and causes, in accordance with the
   terms and decree of the council of Constance.
   Also, as a result of commendams for monasteries, the monasteries
   themselves (as experience, a practical mistress, has quite often
   taught) are seriously damaged in spiritual and temporal matters because
   their buildings fall into decay, partly through the negligence of the
   commendatories and partly through greed or lack of interest, divine
   worship is gradually reduced, and matter for contempt is generally
   offered especially to secular persons, not without a lessening of the
   standing of the apostolic see, from which commendams of this kind
   originate. In order that sounder measures may be taken to secure these
   monasteries from damage, we will and decree that when vacancies occur
   through the death of the abbot in charge, they cannot be given in
   commendam to anyone by any agreement unless it seems right to us to
   decide otherwise, in accordance with the actual circumstances and with
   the advice of our brothers, so as to protect the authority of the
   apostolic see and to oppose the evil designs of those attacking it .
   But let such monasteries be provided with competent persons, in keeping
   with the above-mentioned constitution, so that suitable abbots will
   have charge of them (as is fitting). Such monasteries may be given in
   commendam, when the original commendam no longer exists on account of
   the resignation or death of the commendatory, only to cardinals and to
   qualified and well-deserving persons; and in such a way that the
   commendatories of the monasteries, whatever their dignity, honour and
   high rank may be, even if they enjoy the status and dignity of a
   cardinal, are obliged, if they have meals in private, apart from the
   common table, to assign a quarter of their board for the renewal of the
   fabric, or for the purchase or repair of furnishings, clothings and
   adornment, or for the maintenance or sustenance of the poor, as the
   greater need demands or suggests . If, however, they share board
   completely, a third part of all the resources of the said monastery
   committed to the commendatory must be assigned, after all other imposts
   have been deducted, to the above-mentioned burdens and to the
   sustenance of the monks. Moreover, letters which are drawn up regarding
   such commendams to monasteries ought to contain a clause specifically
   stating this. If they are drawn up in some other form, they are of no
   worth or value .
   Since it is fitting for such churches to be provided for without any
   loss of revenues, in such a way that both the honour of those in charge
   and the need of the churches and buildings are considered, we decree
   and rule that pensions may never be reserved from the incomes of these
   churches except on account of a resignation or for some other reason
   which has been considered credible and honourable in our secret
   consistory. We also rule that henceforth parochial churches, major and
   principal dignities and other ecclesiastical benefices whose rents,
   revenues and produce by ordinary reckoning do not amount to an annual
   value of two hundred golden ducats of the treasury, and also hospitals,
   leperhouses and hostels of any importance which have been set up for
   the use and provisioning of the poor, shall not be given in commendam
   to cardinals of the holy Roman church, or conferred on them by any
   other title, unless they have become vacant by the death of a member of
   their household. In the latter case they can be given in commendam to
   cardinals, but these are bound to dispose of them within six months for
   the benefit of such persons as are suitable and in good relations with
   them. We do not wish, however, to prejudge the cardinals further with
   respect to benefices to which they may have a reserve claim
   We also ordain that members of churches, monasteries or military orders
   may not be detached or separated from their head -- which is absurd --
   without legitimate and reasonable cause. Perpetual unions, apart from
   cases permitted by law or on some reasonable grounds, are not permitted
   at all. Dispensations for more than two incompatible benefices are not
   to be granted, except for great and pressing reasons or to qualified
   persons according to the form of common law . We set a limit of two
   years on persons of whatever rank who obtain more than four parish
   churches and their perpetual vicarages, or major and principal
   dignities, even if by way of union or commendam for life. They are
   bound to release the rest, only four being retained in the meantime.
   Such benefices, due for release, can be resigned into the hands of the
   ordinaries so that they may be provided with persons nominated by them;
   notwithstanding any reservations, even those of a general nature or
   resulting from the quality of the persons resigning. Once the period of
   two years is past, all the benefices that have not been disposed of may
   be reckoned as vacant and may freely be applied for as vacant. Those
   who hold on to them incur the penalties of the constitution Execrabilis
   of our memorable predecessor, pope John XXII. We also rule that special
   reservations of any benefice are in no way to be granted at the urging
   of anyone .
   On cardinals
   Since the cardinals of the holy Roman church take precedence in honour
   and dignity over all the other members of the church after the
   sovereign pontiff, it is proper and right that they be distinguished
   beyond all others by the purity of their life and the excellence of
   their virtues. On that account, we not only exhort and advise them but
   also decree and order that henceforth each of the cardinals following
   the teaching of the Apostle, so live a sober, chaste and godly life
   that he shines out before people as one who abstains not merely from
   evil but from every appearance of evil . In the first place, let him
   honour God by his works . Let all of them be vigilant, constant at the
   divine office and the celebration of masses, and maintain their chapels
   in a worthy place, as they were wont to do .
   Their house and establishment, table and furniture, should not attract
   blame by display or splendour or superfluous equipment or in any other
   way, so as to avoid any fostering of sin or excess, but, as is right,
   let them deserve to be called mirrors of moderation and frugality.
   Therefore, let them find satisfaction in what contributes to priestly
   modesty; let them act with kindness and respect both in public and in
   private, towards prelates and other distinguished persons who come to
   the Roman curia; and let them undertake with grace and generosity the
   business committed to them by ourself and our successors .
   Moreover, let them not employ bishops or prelates in demeaning tasks in
   their houses, so that those who have been appointed to give direction
   to others and who have been clad in a sacred character, will not lower
   themselves to menial chores and generally bring about a lack of respect
   for the pastoral office . Consequently, let them treat with honour as
   brothers, and as befits their state of life, those whom they have or
   will have in their houses. Since the cardinals assist the Roman
   pontiff, the common father of all Christians, it is very improper for
   them to be patrons of or special pleaders for individuals. We have
   therefore decided, lest they adopt partiality of any kind, that they
   are not to set up as promoters or defenders of princes or communities
   or of any other persons against anyone, except to the extent that
   justice and equity demands and the dignity and rank of such people
   requires. Rather, separated from all private interest, let them be
   available and engage with all diligence in calming and settling any
   disputes. Let them promote with due piety the maintenance of the just
   business of princes and all other persons, especially the poor and
   religious, and let them offer help in accordance with their resources
   and their official responsibility to those who are oppressed and
   unjustly burdened .
   They are to visit at least once a year -- in person if they have been
   present in the curia, and by a suitable deputy if they have been absent
   -- the places of their titular basilica. They are, with due care, to
   keep themselves informed about the clergy and people of the churches
   subject to their basilica; they are to keep under review the divine
   worship and the properties of the said churches; above all, let them
   examine with care the lives of the clergy and their parishioners, and
   with a father's affection encourage one and all to live an upright and
   honourable life . For the development of divine worship and the
   salvation of his own soul, each cardinal should give to his basilica
   during his lifetime, or bequeath at the time of his death, a sufficient
   amount for the suitable sustenance there of one priest; or, if the
   basilica needs repairs or some other form of aid, let him leave or
   donate as much as he may in conscience decide. It is entirely unfitting
   to pass over persons related to them by blood or by marriage,
   especially if they are deserving and need help. To come to their
   assistance is just and praiseworthy. But we do not consider that it is
   appropriate to heap on them a great number of benefices or church
   revenues, with the result that an uncontrolled generosity in these
   matters may bring wrong to others and may cause scandal. Consequently
   we have determined that they are not to squander thoughtlessly the
   goods of the churches, but are to apply them in works of devotion and
   piety, for which great and rich returns have been assigned and ordained
   by the holy fathers .
   It is also our wish that they take care, without making any excuse, of
   the churches entrusted to them in commendam, whether these be
   cathedrals, abbeys, priories, or any other eeclesiastical benefices
   that they take measures, with all personal effect, to see that the
   cathedrals are duly served by the appointment of worthy and competent
   vicars or suffragans, according to what has been customary, with an
   appropriate and adequate salary; and that they provide for the other
   churches and monasteries held by them in commendam with the right
   number of clerics or chaplains, whether religious or monks, for the
   adequate and praiseworthy service of God. Let them also maintain in
   proper condition the buildings, properties and rights of any kind, and
   repair what has crumbled, in accordance with the duty of good prelates
   and commendatories . We also judge that the said cardinals are to use
   great discretion and careful foresight with regard to the number of
   their personal attendants and horses lest by having a greater number
   than their resources, situation and dignity permit, they can be accused
   of the vice of over-display and extravagance. Let them not be accounted
   greedy and squalid on the grounds that they enjoy great and plentiful
   revenues and yet offer sustenance to very few; for the house of a
   cardinal ought to be an open lodging, a harbour and refuge for upright
   and learned persons, especially men, for nobles who are now poor and
   for honourable persons. Hence let them be prudent about the manner and
   quantity of what has to be kept, and carefully check the character of
   their personal attendants, lest they themselves incur from the vices of
   others the shameful stain of dishonour and provide real opportunities
   for contradictions and false accusations .
   Since very special provision must be made that our deeds be approved
   not only before God, whom we ought to please in the first place, but
   also before peoplel so that we can offer to others an example to be
   imitated, we ordain that every cardinal show himself an excellent ruler
   and overseer of his house and personal staff, with regard to both what
   is open for all to see and what lies hidden within . Therefore let each
   of them have the priests and deacons clad in respectable garments, and
   make careful provision that no one in his household who holds a
   benefice of any type, or is in holy orders, wears multi-coloured
   clothes or a garment that has little connection with ecclesiastical
   status. Those in the priesthood, therefore, ought to wear clothes of
   colours which are not forbidden to clerics by law and are of at least
   ankle length. Those who hold high office in cathedrals, canons of the
   said cathedrals those holding the chief posts in colleges, and
   chaplains of cardinals when celebrating masses, are obliged to wear a
   head-covering in public. Shield-bearers are permitted garments somewhat
   shorter than ankle-length. Grooms, because they are generally moving
   about and perform a somewhat burdensome service, can use shorter and
   more suitable garments, even if they happen to be clerics, so long as
   they are not ordained priests; but in such a way that they do not cast
   aside decency and they so conduct themselves that their behaviour is in
   keeping with their position in the church . Other clerics are to do
   everything with due proportion and restraint. Both clerics holding
   benefices and those in holy orders are not to pay special attention to
   their hair and beards, nor to possess mules or horses with trappings
   and ornaments of velvet or silk, but for articles of this kind let them
   use ordinary cloth or leather .
   If anyone of the aforesaid staff acts otherwise, or wears such
   forbidden garments after three months from the announcement of the
   present regulations, despite being given a legitimate warning, he
   incurs excommunication. If he has not corrected himself within a
   further three months, he is understood to be suspended from receiving
   the fruits of the benefices which he holds. And if he remains fixed in
   this obstinacy for another six months, after a similar legal warning,
   he is to be deprived of all the benefices which he holds, and he is to
   be considered as so deprived. The benefices thus made vacant may be
   freely sought from the apostolic see. We wish each and every one of
   these arrangements to apply to the households of ourself and any future
   Roman pontiffs, and likewise to all other beneficed clerics or persons
   in holy orders, even those in the curia . There is one single
   exception: the said attendants of ourself and future Roman pontiffs may
   wear red garments, in keeping with what is proper and usual for the
   papal dignity .
   Since the care of the most important business is the special concern of
   cardinals, it is for them to use their ability to know which regions
   have been infected by heresies, errors and superstitions opposed to the
   true orthodox faith; where the ecclesiastical discipline of the Lord's
   commandments is lacking; and which kings and princes or peoples are
   being troubled, or fear to be troubled, by wars. Cardinals shall apply
   themselves to obtain information on these and similar matters and make
   a report to us or the current Roman pontiff so that, by earnest effort,
   opportune and saving remedies for such evils and afflictions can be
   thought out. Since by frequent, almost daily, experience it is known
   that many evils quite often occur to provinces and cities on account of
   the absence of their own officially appointed legates, and various
   scandals are springing up which are not without disadvantages to the
   apostolic see, we decree and ordain that cardinals who are in charge of
   provinces or cities, under the title of legates, may not administer
   them through lieutenants or officials, but they are obliged to be
   present in person for the greater part of the time, and to rule and
   govern them with all vigilance. Those who now hold the title of legate,
   or will hold it for a time, are obliged to go to their provinces --
   within three months from the date of the present proclamation if the
   provinces are in Italy, and within five months if they are outside
   Italy -- and to reside there for the greater part of the time, unless,
   by a command from us or our successors, they are held back in the Roman
   curia for some business of greater moment or are sent to other places
   as needs demand. In the latter cases, let them have in the said
   provinces and cities vice-legates, auditors, lieutenants and the other
   usual officials with due arrangements and salaries. Anyone who does not
   observe each and all of the above regulations is to be deprived of all
   the emoluments of his post as legate. These regulations were formulated
   and established long ago with this object: that the ready presence of
   the legates would be beneficial to the peoples; not that, being free
   from toils and cares, under cover of being the legate, they would fix
   their attention only on profit .
   Since the duty of a cardinal is primarily concerned with regular
   assistance to the Roman pontiff and the business matters of the
   apostolic see, we have decided that all cardinals shall reside at the
   Roman curia, and those who are absent are to return within six months
   if they are in Italy, or within a year from the day of promulgation of
   this present constitution if they are outside Italy. If they do not
   they are to lose the fruits of their benefices and the emoluments of
   all their offices; and they lose completely, as long as they arc
   absent, all privileges granted in general and in particular to
   cardinals. Those cardinals are excepted, however, who happen to be
   absent by reason of a duty imposed by the apostolic see, or of a
   command or permission from the Roman pontiff, or from reasonable fear
   or any other motive which justifiably excuses, or for health reasons .
   Moreover, the privileges, indults and immunities granted to the said
   cardinals and contained or declared in our bull under the date of our
   coronation1{Bull Licat Romani pontificis,9 April 1513; see Regesta
   Leonis X no. 14} remain in full force. We have also decided that the
   funeral expenses of cardinals, when all costs are included, ought not
   to exceed the total of 1,500 florins, unless the previous arrangement
   of the executors -- after just grounds and reasons have been set out --
   has reckoned that more should be spent. The funeral rites and formal
   mourning are to be on the first and ninth days; within the octave,
   however, masses may be celebrated as usual .
   Out of reverence towards the apostolic see, for the advantage and
   honour of the pontiff and the cardinals, in order that the possibility
   of scandals which could come to light may be removed and a greater
   freedom of votes in the holy senate may exist, and that, as is right,
   it may be lawful for each cardinal to say freely and without penalty
   whatever he feels before God and his own conscience, we lay down that
   no cardinal may reveal in writing or by word or in any other way, under
   pain of being a perjurer and disobedient, the votes that were given in
   the consistory, or whatever was done or said there which could result
   in hatred or scandal or prejudice with regard to anyone, or whenever
   silence on any point beyond the foregoing has been specially and
   clearly enjoined by ourself or the Roman pontiff of the time. If anyone
   acts to the contrary he incurs, as well as the punishments stated,
   immediate excommunication from which, except in immediate danger of
   death, he can only be absolved by ourself or the Roman pontiff of the
   time, and with a declaration of the reason .
   Reforms of the curia and of other things
   Since every generation inclines to evil from its youth, and for it to
   grow accustomed from tender years towards good is the result of work
   and purpose we rule and order that those in charge of schools, and
   those who teach young children and youths, ought not only to instruct
   them in grammar, rhetoric and similar subjects but also to teach those
   matters which concern religion, such as God's commandments, the
   articles of the faith, sacred hymns and psalms, and the lives of the
   saints. On feast days they should limit themselves to teaching what has
   reference to religion and good habits, and they are obliged to
   instruct, encourage and compel their pupils in these matters insofar as
   they can. Thus, let them attend churches not only for masses, but also
   to listen to vespers and the divine offices, and let them encourage the
   hearing of instructions and sermons . Let them not teach anything to
   their pupils that is contrary to good morals or may lead to a lack of
   reverence .
   To wipe out the curse of blasphemy, which has increased beyond measure
   towards a supreme contempt for the divine name and for the saints, we
   rule and ordain that whoever curses God openly and publicly and, by
   insulting and offensive language, has expressly blasphemed our lord
   Jesus Christ or the glorious virgin Mary, his mother, if he has held a
   public office or jurisdiction, he is to lose three months' emoluments
   of his said office for the first and second offence, and if he has
   committed the fault a third time, he is automatically deprived of his
   post. If he is a cleric or a priest, he is to be punished further as
   follows for being found guilty of such a fault: for the first time he
   blasphemed, he is to lose the fruits of whatever benefices he held for
   one year; for the second time he offended and was convicted, he is to
   be deprived of his benefice if he held only one, and if he held several
   then he is to be compelled to lose the one that his ordinary decides
   upon; if he is charged and convicted for a third time, he is
   automatically deprived of all the benefices and dignities that he
   holds, he is rendered incapable of holding them any longer, and they
   can be freely asked for and allotted to others. A lay person who
   blasphemes, if he is a noble, is to be fined a penalty of twenty-five
   ducats; for the second offence the fine is fifty ducats, which are to
   be applied to the fabric of the basilica of the prince of the apostles
   in Rome; for other offences he is to be punished as set out below; for
   a third fault, however, he is to lose his noble status. If he is of no
   rank and a plebian, he is to be cast into prison. If he has been caught
   committing blasphemy in public more than twice, he is to be compelled
   to stand for a whole day in front of the entrance of the principal
   church, wearing a hood signifying his infamy; but if he has fallen
   several times into the same fault, he is to be condemned to permanent
   imprisonment or to the galleys, at the decision of the appointed judge.
   In the forum of conscience, however, nobody guilty of blasphemy can be
   absolved without a heavy penance imposed by the decision of a strict
   confessor . We wish those who blaspheme against the other saints to be
   punished somewhat more lightly, at the decision of a judge who will
   take account of individuals .
   We also decree that secular judges who have not taken action against
   such convicted blasphemers and have not imposed rightful penalties on
   them, insofar as they are able to, are to be subjected to the same
   penalties as if they had been involved in the said crime. But those who
   have exercised care and severity in their examinations and punishments,
   will gain for each occasion an indulgence of ten years and may keep a
   third of the fine imposed. Any persons who have heard the blasphemer
   are obliged to rebuke him sharply in words, if it should happen that
   this can be done without danger to themselves, and they are obliged to
   report the same or bring it to the knowledge of an ecclesiastical or
   secular judge within three days. But if several persons have at the
   same time heard the said blasphemer committing the fault, each one is
   obliged to make an accusation against him, unless perhaps they all
   agree that one will perform the task for all . We urge and counsel in
   the Lord all the said persons, in virtue of holy obedience, that they
   command and ensure, for the reverence and honour of the divine name,
   that all the foregoing are kept and very exactly carried out in their
   lordships and lands. Thus they will have from God himself an abundant
   reward for such a good and pious deed, and they too will obtain from
   the apostolic see an indulgence of ten years, and a third of the fine
   by which the blasphemer is punished, as often as they have taken the
   trouble to have such a crime punished . It is likewise our will that
   this indulgence and the remaining third of the fine imposed be granted
   and assigned to the person reporting the name of the blasphemer.
   Moreover, other penalties set down in the sacred canons against such
   blasphemers remain in force .
   In order that clerics, especially, may live in continence and chastity
   according to canonical legislation, we rule that offenders be severely
   punished as the canons lay down. If anyone, lay or cleric, has been
   found guilty of a charge on account of which the wrath of God comes
   upon the sons of disobedience, let him be punished by the penalties
   respectively imposed by the sacred canons or by civil law. Those
   involved in concubinage, whether they be lay or cleric, are to be
   punished by the penalties of the same canons. Concubinage is not to be
   allowed by the tolerance of superiors, or as an evil custom of a great
   number of sinners, which should rather be called a corruption, or under
   any other excuse; but let those involved be punished severely in
   accordance with the judgment of the law .
   Moreover, for the good and peaceful government of cities and all places
   subject to the Roman church, we renew the constitutions published some
   time ago by Giles, the well-remembered bishop of Sabina, and we enjoin
   and command that they be kept without alteration .
   So that the stain and disease of abominable simony may be driven out
   for ever not only from the Roman curia but also from all christian
   rule, we renew the constitutions issued by our predecessors, also in
   sacred councils, against simoniacs of this kind, and we prescribe that
   they be observed unaltered. We wish the penalties they contain to be
   regarded as clearly stated and included herein, and the offenders to be
   punished by our authority .
   We rule and order that anyone who holds a benefice with or without the
   care of souls, if he has not recited the divine office after six months
   from the date of his obtaining the benefice, and any legitimate
   impediment has come to an end may not receive the revenues of his
   benefices, on account of his omission and the length of time, but he is
   bound to spend them, as being unjustly received, on the fabric of the
   benefices or on alms to the poor. If he obstinately remains in such
   negligence beyond the said period, after a legitimate warning has been
   given, let him be deprived of the benefice, since it is for the sake of
   the office that the benefice is granted. He is to be understood as
   neglecting the office, so that he can be deprived of his benefice, if
   he fails to recite it at least twice during fifteen days . However, in
   addition to what has just been said, he will be obliged to offer to God
   an explanation for the said omission. The penalty on those holding
   several benefices may be repeated as often as they are proved to act
   contrary to these obligations .
   The full disposal and administration of the revenues of cathedral and
   metropolitan churches, monasteries and any other ecclesiastical
   benefices belong exclusively to us and the Roman pontiff of the time,
   and to those who legally and canonically hold churches, monasteries and
   benefices of this kind. Secular princes ought in no way to interpose
   themselves in the said churches, monasteries and benefices, since all
   divine law also forbids it. For these reasons we rule and command that
   the fruits and revenues of churches, monasteries and benefices ought
   not to be sequestrated, held or detained in any way by any secular
   rulers, even if they be the emperor, kings, queens, republics or other
   powers, or by their officials, or by judges, even ecclesiastical ones,
   or by any other persons public or private, acting at the command of the
   said emperor, kings, queens princes, republics or powers. Those who
   hold such churches, monasteries and benefices ought not to be impeded
   -- under the pretext of the restoration of the fabric (unless
   permission is expressly given by the Roman pontiff of the time) or of
   alms-giving or under any other guise or pretence -- so that they cannot
   freely and without restriction, as before, dispose of the fruits and
   revenues. If there have been sequestrations, seizures or retentions,
   then restoration of the fruits and revenues must be made totally,
   freely, and without exception or delay, to the prelates to whom they
   pertain by right and by law. If they have been scattered and can
   nowhere be found, it is our will, supported by the penalty of
   excommunication or ecclesiastical interdict to be automatically
   incurred by the lands and domain of the ruler, that, after a just
   estimate has been made about them, the said prelates receive
   satisfaction through those who carried out the said sequestrations,
   applications or dispersals or who gave orders for them to be carried
   out; and further, that their goods and the goods of those subject to
   them, wherever these may be found, may be seized and held if, after
   being warned, they refuse to obey. Those who act in a contrary manner
   do so under pain of both the penalties mentioned above and those of
   deprivation of the fiefs and privileges which they have obtained for a
   time from us and from the Roman or other churches, and of those issued
   against violators and oppressors of ecclesiastical liberties, including
   those in extraordinary and other constitutions, even if they are
   unknown and perhaps not now in actual use. We renew all these penalties
   as stated and included herein, we decree and declare that they have
   perpetual force- and we will and order that sentence, judgment and
   interpretation are to be given according to them by all judges, even
   cardinals of the holy Roman church, with all power of judging and
   declaring otherwise being removed and taken away from them .
   Since no power over ecclesiastical persons is granted to lay people by
   either divine or human law, we renew the constitution of pope Boniface
   VIII, our predecessor of happy memory, which begins Felicis, and that
   of pope Clement V which begins Si quis suadente, and also any other
   apostolic ordinance, however issued, in favour of ecclesiastical
   freedom and against its violators . Moreover, the penalties against
   those who dare to do such things, contained in the bull In coena
   Domini3, are to remain in force. It has similarly been forbidden in the
   Lateran and general councils, under penalty of excommunication, for
   kings, princes, dukes, counts, barons, republics and any other
   authorities exercising control over kingdoms, provinces, cities and
   territories, to impose and exact money contributions, tithes and other
   similar imposts on or from clerics, prelates and any other persons of
   the church, or even to receive them from those who freely offer them
   and give their consent. Those who openly or covertly provide help,
   favour or advice in the aforesaid matters automatically incur the
   penalty of immediate excommunication; and states, communities and
   universities which are at fault in any way on this point are by this
   very fact to be subject to ecclesiastical interdict. Prelates also, who
   have given consent to the foregoing without the clear permission of the
   Roman pontiff, automatically incur the penalty of excommunication and
   removal from office. For these reasons we decree and ordain that
   henceforth those who attempt such things, even if (as mentioned) they
   are qualified, in addition to the aforesaid penalties which we renew
   and wish them to incur by the very fact of their contravention, are to
   be regarded as incapable of all legal acts and as intestable .
   Sorcery, by means of enchantments, divinations, superstitions and the
   invoking of demons, is prohibited by both civil laws and the sanctions
   of the sacred canons. We rule, decree and ordain that clerics who are
   found guilty of these things are to be branded with disgrace at the
   judgment of superiors. If they do not desist, they are to be demoted,
   forced into a monastery for a period of time that is to be fixed by the
   will of the superior, and deprived of their benefices and
   ecclesiastical offices. Lay men and women, however, are to be subject
   to excommunication and the other penalties of both civil and canon law.
   All false Christians and those with evil sentiments towards the faith,
   of whatever race or nation they may be, as well as heretics and those
   stained with some taint of heresy, or Judaizers, are to be totally
   excluded from the company of Christ's faithful and expelled from any
   position, especially from the Roman curia, and punished with an
   appropriate penalty. For these reasons we rule that proceedings are to
   be taken against them, with careful enquiry everywhere and particularly
   in the said curia, by means of judges appointed by us, and that those
   accused and rightly convicted of these offences are to be punished with
   fitting penalties; and we wish that those who have relapsed are to be
   dealt with without any hope of pardon or forgiveness .
   Since these constitutions and ordinances which we are now establishing
   concern life, morals and ecclesiastical discipline, it is fitting that
   our own and other officials, both those in the Roman curia and those
   everywhere else, should be models of and bound to them, and it is our
   will and decision that they be held to their observance by an
   inviolable bond. Lest these constitutions seem at any point to detract
   from other censures and penalties imposed by ancient laws and
   constitutions against those acting otherwise, even though they have
   been thought out and issued as a development, we further declare that
   nothing whatever has been taken away from common law or from other
   decrees of Roman pontiffs by these regulations and ordinances. Indeed,
   if any parts of them have lost their force through the evil corruption
   of times, places and people, or through abuse, or for any other
   unapprovable reason, we here and now renew and confirm them and order
   them to be observed without alteration . We decree and declare that
   these our well-pondered constitutions are to be of binding force from
   two months after publication, and we strictly forbid anyone to presume
   to make glosses or commentaries or interpretations on them without
   special permission from us or the apostolic see. Anyone who rashly
   dares to oppose this, incurs the penalty of immediate excommunication
   by this very act . Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however.. .

SESSION 10

4 May 1515

   [On the reform of credit organisations (Montes pietatis)]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. We ought to give first place
   in our pastoral office, among our many anxious cares, to ensuring that
   what is healthy, praiseworthy, in keeping with the christian faith, and
   in harmony with good customs may be not only clarified in our time but
   also made known to future generations, and that what could offer matter
   for scandal be totally cut down, wholly uprooted and nowhere permitted
   to spread, while at the same time permitting those seeds to be planted
   in the Lord's field and in the vineyard of the Lord of hosts which can
   spiritually feed the minds of the faithful, once the cockle has been
   uprooted and the wild olive cut down. Indeed, we have learnt that among
   some of our dear sons who were masters in theology and doctors of civil
   and canon law, there has recently broken out again a particular
   controversy, not without scandal and disquiet for ordinary people, with
   regard to the relief of the poor by means of loans made to them by
   public authorities. They are popularly called credit organisations and
   have been set up in many cities of Italy by the magistrates of the
   cities and by other Christians, to assist by this kind of loan the lack
   of resources among the poor lest they be swallowed up by the greed of
   usurers They have been praised and encouraged by holy men, preachers of
   God's word, and approved and confirmed also by a number of our
   predecessors as popes, to the effect that the said credit organisations
   are not out of harmony with christian dogma, even though there is
   controversy and different opinions regarding the question .
   Some of these masters and doctors say that the credit organisations are
   unlawful. After a fixed period of time has passed, they say, those
   attached to these organisations demand from the poor to whom they make
   a loan so much per pound in addition to the capital sum. For this
   reason they cannot avoid the crime of usury or injustice, that is to
   say a clearly defined evil, since our Lord, according to Luke the
   evangelist, has bound us by a clear command that we ought not to expect
   any addition to the capital sum when we grant a loan. For, that is the
   real meaning of usury: when, from its use, a thing which produces
   nothing is applied to the acquiring of gain and profit without any
   work, any expense or any risk. The same masters and doctors add that in
   these credit organisations neither commutative nor distributive justice
   is observed, even though contracts of this kind, if they are to be duly
   approved, ought not to go beyond the bounds of justice. They endeavour
   to prove this on the grounds that the expenses of the maintenance of
   these organisations, which ought to be paid by many persons (as they
   say), are extracted only from the poor to whom a loan is made; and at
   the same time certain other persons are given more than their necessary
   and moderate expenses (as they seem to imply), not without an
   appearance of evil and an encouragement to wrongdoing .
   But many other masters and doctors say the opposite and, both in
   writing and in speech, unite in speaking in many of the schools in
   Italy in defence of so great a benefit and one so necessary to the
   state, on the grounds that nothing is being sought nor hoped for from
   the loan as such. Nevertheless, they argue, for the compensation of the
   organisations -- that is, to defray the expenses of those employed and
   of all the things necessarily pertaining to the upkeep of the said
   organisations -- they may lawfully ask and receive, in addition to the
   capital, a moderate and necessary sum from those deriving benefit from
   the loan, provided that no profit is made therefrom. This is in virtue
   of the rule of law that the person who experiences benefit ought also
   to meet the charge, especially when there is added the support of the
   apostolic authority. They point out that this opinion was approved by
   our predecessors of happy memory, the Roman pontiffs Paul II, Sixtus
   IV, Innocent VIII, Alexander VI and Julius II, as well as by saints and
   persons devoted to God and held in high esteem for their holiness, and
   has been preached in sermons about the gospel truth .
   We wish to make suitable arrangements on this question (in accord with
   what we have received from on high). We commend the zeal for justice
   displayed by the former group, which desires to prevent the opening up
   of the chasm of usury, as well as the love of piety and truth shown by
   the latter group, which wishes to aid the poor, and indeed the
   earnestness of both sides. Since, therefore, this whole question
   appears to concern the peace and tranquility of the whole christian
   state, we declare and define, with the approval of the sacred council,
   that the above-mentioned credit organisations, established by states
   and hitherto approved and confirmed by the authority of the apostolic
   see, do not introduce any kind of evil or provide any incentive to sin
   if they receive, in addition to the capital, a moderate sum for their
   expenses and by way of compensation, provided it is intended
   exclusively to defray the expenses of those employed and of other
   things pertaining (as mentioned) to the upkeep of the organisations,
   and provided that no profit is made therefrom. They ought not, indeed,
   to be condemned in any way. Rather, such a type of lending is
   meritorious and should be praised and approved. It certainly should not
   be considered as usurious; it is lawful to preach the piety and mercy
   of such organisations to the people, including the indulgences granted
   for this purpose by the holy apostolic see; and in the future, with the
   approval of the apostolic see, other similar credit organisations can
   be established. It would, however, be much more perfect and more holy
   if such credit organisations were completely gratuitous: that is, if
   those establishing them provided definite sums with which would be
   paid, if not the total expenses, then at least half the wages of those
   employed by the organisations, with the result that the debt of the
   poor would be lightened thereby. We therefore decree that Christ's
   faithful ought to be prompted, by a grant of substantial indulgences,
   to give aid to the poor by providing the sums of which we have spoken,
   m order to meet the costs of the organisations .
   It is our will that all religious as well as ecclesiastical and secular
   persons who henceforth dare to preach or argue otherwise by word or in
   writing, contrary to the sense of the present declaration and sanction,
   incur the punishment of immediate excommunication, notwithstanding any
   kind of privilege, things said above, constitutions and orders of the
   apostolic see, and anything else to the contrary .
   [Bull against exempt persons, in which are included some points
   regarding ecclesiastical liberty and episcopal dignity]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Presiding over the
   government of the universal church (the Lord so disposing), we readily
   aim to secure the advantages of subjects, in conformity with the
   obligation of our pastoral office. In order to preserve the church's
   freedom, to remove scandals, to establish harmony, and to foster peace
   between prelates of churches and those subject to them, we apply the
   effort of apostolic care in proportion as experience shows that
   disagreement between such groups will be harmful. Thus we are glad to
   regulate the indults and privileges granted to the same subjects by
   both our predecessors and the apostolic see, at the expense of the
   prelates concerned, in such a way scandals do not arise from them, or
   material be provided to anyone for fostering ill-will, or
   ecclesiastical persons be somehow drawn away from the benefit of
   obedience as well as from perseverance in the divine service .
   Recently, indeed, a trustworthy report has reached our ears that canons
   of patriarchal, metropolitan, cathedral and collegiate churches and
   other secular clerics are making too many claims, on account of which
   they give rise to considerable ill-report concerning themselves, have
   an injurious effect on others from their claims of exemption and
   freedom obtained from the apostolic see, evade the corrections and
   regulations of the ordinaries, and shun their courts and judgments.
   Some of them, in the hope of gaining freedom from punishment for their
   deviations by the privilege of exemption, do not fear to commit
   offences which they would certainly have never committed if they did
   not believe that they were protected by their exemption. The result is
   that, on account of the brashness of those trusting that they will
   obtain freedom from punishment for their offences, because of the
   privilege of exemption, they commit outrages on many occasions as a
   result of which the church is very much maligned and serious scandals
   arise, especially when those responsible for correcting and punishing
   them fail to do so. In our wish to provide the necessary remedy lest,
   on the above pretext, their faults remain unpunished, we rule, with the
   approval of the sacred council, that henceforth those to whom the
   correction and punishment of exempt persons has been committed by the
   apostolic see, are to attend carefully to these duties and diligently
   to carry out the obligations of the office entrusted to them. As soon
   as it is legally clear to them that exempt persons have been at fault,
   they are to punish them in such a way that they are restrained from
   their acts of arrogance by fear of a penalty and so that others,
   frightened by their example, will rightly shrink from committing
   similar faults .
   If they are neglectful in this matter, the diocesan and other local
   ordinaries are to warn such persons, who have the responsibility for
   correcting those who are exempt, that they should punish such exempt
   persons who have committed faults and are guilty and should censure
   them within a suitable time, which is to be determined by the judgment
   of those giving the warning. The warning is to be given in person (if
   the resources and standing of the person giving it make this possible),
   or otherwise, if there should be no clearly recognised judge in the
   region of the exempt persons, they are to warn those whom they consider
   to be responsible for the above by means of a public edict, which is to
   be fixed to the doors of the cathedrals or other churches where such
   judges of exempt persons may happen to reside, or if there are no
   judges of the exempt persons there, then where the exempt persons have
   committed the faults. If those who have received the warning are
   negligent in this matter, and do not trouble or have refused to carry
   it out, then, so that they may be penalised for their fault, they are
   to be deprived of hearing the inquiry for that time and are henceforth
   not to be involved in any way in such inquiries. Then the diocesan and
   other local ordinaries can proceed, on our authority, either to an
   inquiry or by means of an accusation, excluding the use of torture,
   against such offending and criminous persons and may personally examine
   the witnesses. They shall see that the process itself -- regarding
   which, by reason of the solemnity of the law, we forbid anything to be
   alleged or said except on account of an omitted citation (provided the
   offence has been correctly proved elsewhere) -- is held, closed and
   sealed by them and quickly despatched to the apostolic see, either by
   themselves or by another messenger, so as to be carefully examined by
   the apostolic see, either by the Roman pontiff or by someone else to
   whom he shall commit the matter; at the expense of the offending exempt
   persons, including the expenses incurred in the process itself, which
   expenses the ordinaries can compel the persons who have been
   investigated and charged to pay. And those found worthy of blame,
   either to the extent of being condemned or on account of there being
   sufficient evidence to justify recourse to torture so that the truth
   might be extracted, are to be returned to the diocesans or ordinaries
   so that these may lawfully proceed further, on our authority, in the
   inquiry or the accusation and may terminate the case according to what
   is just .
   Notaries of the apostolic see, whose office is known to have been
   instituted by pope Clement I of happy memory at the beginnings of the
   primitive church, for the purpose of investigating and recording the
   acts of saints, and who have been elevated to the office of protonotary
   and wear an official garment and a rochet, together with other
   officials who are attached to us and to the said see, when they are
   actually engaged in their duties, are exempt from all jurisdiction of
   ordinaries in both civil and criminal matters. Other notaries, however,
   not wearing the dress of the protonotariate, unless they have adopted
   it within three months after the publication of this present document,
   both themselves and others due to be elevated to the office in the
   future who do not regularly wear the official dress and a rochet, as
   well as other officials, our own and those of the said see, when not
   actually engaged in their duties, are to be subject to the jurisdiction
   of the said diocesans and ordinaries in both criminal and civil cases
   which involve sums not exceeding twenty-five golden ducats of the
   treasury. But in civil cases involving sums exceeding such an amount,
   they are to enjoy full exemption and to be totally excluded from the
   jurisdiction of the said diocesans and ordinaries. We also judge it
   worthy and appropriate that among the personal staff of cardinals of
   the holy Roman church, only those shall enjoy the privilege of
   exemption who belong to the household staff and are regular sharers of
   its board, or have been sent by the same cardinals to carry out their
   personal business, or perhaps are absent for a time from the Roman
   curia to refresh themselves. But for others, even when they are
   registered as belonging to the personal staff, the privilege of staff
   membership in no way entitles them to be outside the control of their
   diocesans and ordinaries .
   By the constitution published at the council of Vienne which begins
   Attendentes, there was given to the aforesaid diocesans full faculties
   to visit once a year the convents of nuns, in their dioceses, that are
   immediately subject to the apostolic see. We renew this constitution
   and we prescribe and command that it be strictly kept, notwithstanding
   any exemptions and privileges. By the foregoing, moreover, the same
   diocesans and ordinaries are not to be prejudiced by cases in which
   jurisdiction over exempt persons has been granted by law. Rather, we
   define that henceforth exemptions granted for a time without reasonable
   cause, and without any citation of those involved, are of no force or
   value .
   Since order in the church is confused if the jurisdiction of each
   person is not preserved, we rule and ordain, in an effort to support
   the jurisdiction of ordinaries (so far as we can with God's favour), to
   impose more quickly an end to lawsuits, and to restrict the immoderate
   expenses of litigants, that individual cases, spiritual, civil and
   mixed, involving in any way an ecclesiastical forum and concerned with
   benefices -- provided that the actual benefices have not been under a
   general reservation and the incomes, rents and produce of the
   individual benefices do not surpass in value, by common reckoning,
   twenty-four golden ducats of the treasury -- shall in the first
   instance be examined and settled outside the Roman curia and before the
   local ordinaries. Thus, nobody may appeal prior to a definitive
   sentence, nor may an appeal (if made) be in any way admitted, except
   from an interlocutory judgment which may have the force of a definitive
   sentence, or by way of a complaint which in no way concerns the main
   business. For, redress cannot be obtained from a definitive sentence by
   means of an appeal, unless one of the litigants does not dare to go to
   law before the ordinary because of a genuine fear of his adversary's
   power, or for some other acceptable and honourable reason which must be
   at least partially proved otherwise than by his personal oath. In these
   exceptional cases, the appeal can be begun, investigated and concluded
   in the Roman curia, even in the first instance . In other cases, the
   appeals and the commissions of these and other such suits, and whatever
   follows from them, shall henceforth be of no force or value. The judges
   and conservators appointed by the apostolic see, if they are not
   graduates in either civil or canon law, are obliged, on being asked by
   the parties concerned or by one of them, to take an assessor who is not
   under suspicion with the parties and to judge the case according to his
   report .
   We have learnt, by many and frequent reports, that very many churches
   and the bishops presiding over them, on both sides of the Alps, are
   being troubled and disturbed in their jurisdictions, rights and
   lordships by esquires, princes and nobles. These, under colour of a
   right of patronage which they pretend to hold in ecclesiastical
   benefices, without the support of any apostolic privileges, or of
   collations or letters from the ordinaries, or even of any pretence of a
   title, presume to confer benefices not only on clerics but also on
   layfolk; to punish at their own whim priests and clerics who are at
   fault; to remove, purloin and usurp in an arbitrary way, either
   directly or by ordering others, the tithes of everything on which they
   are obliged by law to pay, as well as tithes belonging to cathedrals,
   and other things which pertain to diocesan law and jurisdiction and are
   the exclusive concern of bishops; to forbid such tithes and any fruits
   to be taken out of their cities, lands and territories; to seize and
   unjustly hold fiefs, possessions and lands; to induce and compel, by
   threats, terror and other indirect means, the granting to them of fiefs
   and goods of churches and the conferring of ecclesiastical benefices on
   persons nominated by them; and not only to permit but even expressly to
   command very many other losses, damages and injuries to be inflicted on
   the aforesaid clerics and churches and their prelates .
   We take thought, then, that no power has been granted to lay people
   over clerics and ecclesiastics, or over property belonging to the
   church, and that it is right and just that laws should be made against
   those who refuse to observe this . We also consider how much such
   actions detract, with disastrous results which must be condemned, not
   only from the honour of ourself and the apostolic see but also from the
   peaceful and prosperous condition of churchmen. We desire too, to
   restrain from thoughtless acts of rashness, not so much by new
   penalties as by a renewed fear of existing ones that should be applied,
   those whom the rewards of virtues do not induce to observe laws. We
   therefore renew each and all of the constitutions hitherto issued
   regarding the payment of tithes; against violators and seizers of
   churches; against fire-raisers and pillagers of fields; against those
   seizing and holding cardinals of the holy Roman church, our venerable
   brother bishops and other persons of the church, both secular and
   regular, and unlawfully taking over in any way their jurisdiction and
   rights, or disturbing or molesting them in the exercise of their
   jurisdiction, or presumptuously forcing them to confer ecclesiastical
   benefices on persons named by them, or to dispose of them in some other
   way at their arbitrary choice, or to grant or otherwise sell fiefs and
   goods of the church in perpetual tenure, against making regulations in
   conflict with ecclesiastical liberty; against providing help, advice
   and support for the above practices. Since these acts are not merely
   opposed to law but are also in the highest degree insulting and
   contrary to ecclesiastical liberty, we therefore, in order that we may
   be able to give an honest account to God of the office entrusted to us,
   earnestly urge in the Lord, by fatherly sentiments and counsels, the
   emperor, kings, princes, dukes, marquises, counts, barons, and others
   of whatever other nobility, pre-eminence, sovereignty, power,
   excellence or dignity they may be, and we command them by virtue of
   holy obedience, to observe the foregoing constitutions and to make them
   inviolably observed by their subjects, notwithstanding any customs
   whatever to the contrary, if they wish to avoid the divine displeasure
   and the fitting reaction of the apostolic see. We decree that
   appointments made in the above-mentioned way to the said benefices are
   null and void, and those making use of them are rendered incapable of
   obtaining other ecclesiastical benefices until they have been dispensed
   in the matter by the apostolic see .
   We have also been carefully reflecting that, after Christ's ascension
   into heaven, the apostles assigned bishops to each city and diocese,
   and the holy Roman church became established throughout the world by
   inviting these same bishops to a role of responsibility, and by
   gradually sharing the burdens by means of patriarchs, primates,
   archbishops and bishops; and that it has also been laid down by the
   sacred canons that provincial councils and episcopal synods ought to be
   established by such persons for the correction of morals, the
   settlement and limiting of controversies, and the observance of God's
   commandments, in order that corruptions may be corrected and those
   neglecting to do these things may be subjected to canonical penalties.
   In our desire that these canons be faithfully observed, since it is
   right for us to be interested in what concerns the christian state, we
   place a strict obligation on the said patriarchs, primates, archbishops
   and bishops, in order that they may be able to render to God a worthy
   account of the office entrusted to them, that they order the canons,
   councils and synods to be observed inviolably, notwithstanding any
   privilege whatsoever. Besides, we order that henceforth a provincial
   council is to be held every three years, and we decree that even exempt
   persons are to attend them, notwithstanding any privelege or custom to
   the contrary. Those who are negligent in these matters are to know that
   they will incur penalties contained in the same canons .
   In order that respect for the papal dignity might be preserved, it was
   determined by the constitution issued at the council of Vienne, which
   begins In plerisque that no persons, especially no religious, may be
   provided to cathedral churches which are deprived of temporal goods,
   without which spiritual things cannot exist for long, and which lack
   both clergy and christian people. We renew this constitution, and we
   will and command that it must be observed inviolably unless we shall
   judge otherwise for some just reason to be approved in our secret
   consistory .
   We decree that anything attempted against the foregoing, or any part
   thereof, is null and void, notwithstanding any constitution or
   privilege to the contrary . Let nobody therefore ... If anyone
   however.. .
   [On printing books]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Among the anxieties resting
   on our shoulders we come back with constant thought to how we can bring
   back to the path of truth those going astray, and gain them for God (by
   his grace working in us) . This is what we truly seek after with
   eagerness; to this we unremittingly direct our mind's desires; and over
   this we watch with anxious earnestness .
   It is certainly possible to obtain without difficulty some learning by
   reading books. The skill of book-printing has been invented, or rather
   improved and perfected, with God's assistance, particularly in our
   time. Without doubt it has brought many benefits to men and women
   since, at small expense, it is possible to possess a great number of
   books. These permit minds to devote themselves very readily to
   scholarly studies. Thus there can easily result, particularly among
   Catholics, men competent in all kinds of languages; and we desire to
   see in the Roman church, in good supply, men of this type who are
   capable of instructing even unbelievers in the holy commandments, and
   of gathering them for their salvation into the body of the faithful by
   the teaching of the christian faith .
   Complaints from many persons, however, have reached our ears and those
   of the apostolic see. In fact, some printers have the boldness to print
   and sell to the public, in different parts of the world, books -- some
   translated into Latin from Greek, Hebrew, Arabic and Chaldean as well
   as some issued directly in Latin or a vernacular language -- containing
   errors opposed to the faith as well as pernicious views contrary to the
   christian religion and to the reputation of prominent persons of rank.
   The readers are not edified. Indeed, they lapse into very great errors
   not only in the realm of faith but also in that of life and morals .
   This has often given rise to various scandals, as experience has
   taught, and there is daily the fear that even greater scandals are
   developing.
   That is why, to prevent what has been a healthy discovery for the glory
   of God, the advance of the faith, and the propagation of good skills,
   from being misused for the opposite purposes and becoming an obstacle
   to the salvation of Christians, we have judged that our care must be
   exercised over the printing of books, precisely so that thorns do not
   grow up with the good seed or poisons become mixed with medicines. It
   is our desire to provide a suitable remedy for this danger, with the
   approval of this sacred council, so that the business of book-printing
   may go ahead with greater satisfaction the more that there is employed
   in the future, with greater zeal and prudence, a more attentive
   supervision. We therefore establish and ordain that henceforth, for all
   future time, no one may dare to print or have printed any book or other
   writing of whatever kind in Rome or in any other cities and dioceses,
   without the book or writings having first been closely examined, at
   Rome by our vicar and the master of the sacred palace, in other cities
   and dioceses by the bishop or some other person who knows about the
   printing of books and writings of this kind and who has been delegated
   to this office by the bishop in question, and also by the inquisitor of
   heresy for the city or diocese where the said printing is to take
   place, and unless the books or writings have been approved by a warrant
   signed in their own hand, which must be given, under pain of
   excommunication, freely and without delay .
   In addition to the printed books being seized and publicly burnt,
   payment of a hundred ducats to the fabric of the basilica of the prince
   of the apostles in Rome, without hope of relief, and suspension for a
   whole year from the possibility of engaging in printing, there is to be
   imposed upon anyone presuming to act otherwise the sentence of
   excommunication. Finally, if the offender's contumacy increases, he is
   to be punished with all the sanctions of the law, by his bishop or by
   our vicar, in such a way that others will have no incentive to try to
   follow his example. Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however.. .
   [On setting a date for those acknowledging the Pragmatic Sanction]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Among other matters to be
   carried through in this sacred council, we especially desire to make
   known and proclaim what must be decided and announced concerning the
   sanction called the Pragmatic, which was issued by a number of leaders
   of the French nation, both clerics and laymen as well as nobles and
   others supporting them. This is in accordance with the wishes of our
   predecessor pope Julius II, of happy memory, who summoned this council.
   The prelates and other clergy and the aforesaid laity have been
   summoned on several occasions to appear before both our said
   predecessor, Julius, and ourself; and their obstinacy has quite often
   been alleged or been the subject of accusations in the said council. It
   was subsequently alleged on behalf of the prelates, clerics and laymen,
   including nobles, and their said supporters, who were legitimately
   summoned (as just stated) for this purpose, that there was no route
   which would allow them to travel in safety to the said council. In
   order that they may not be able to make this excuse, we have taken
   measures for a comprehensive safe-conduct to be granted and conveyed to
   them by the Genoans, through whose territory they can travel in safety
   to the Roman curia, so that they may be able to bring forward the views
   which they may wish to present in defence of this Pragmatic Sanction .
   To prevent them being able to bring up some further point against what
   has been set out and to claim a legitimate ignorance, and in order that
   their obstinacy may be overcome, we once again, with the approval of
   the sacred council, give notice and warning, regarding a final and
   definitive dead-line, to the clergy and laity, including nobles,
   prelates and their supporters, and to colleges of clerics and of
   seculars, that they must lawfully assemble (putting aside every excuse
   and delaying action) before I October next. We are extending the
   dead-line, for the aforesaid reasons and in order to remove all
   excuses, to the said I October, by way of a final postponement; and we
   grant and assign this anew. Once the dead-line has passed, however,
   proceedings will go forward at the next session to other matters and to
   the conclusion of the said business, even by means of a definitive
   sentence, notwithstanding their obstinacy and refusal to appear. This
   next eleventh session we summon for these and many other useful
   matters. with the approval of the sacred council, for 14 December after
   the next feast day of St Lucy. Let nobody therefore ... If anyone
   however .. .

SESSION 11

19 December 1516

   [On how to preach]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Under the protection of the
   supreme majesty by whose ineffable providence things in heaven and on
   earth are guided, as we carry out the office of watchman over the
   Lord's flock committed to us, insofar as this is granted to our
   weakness, we reflect within ourselves in great depth that, among many
   other important matters, the office of preaching is also our concern.
   Preaching is of the first importance, very necessary and of great
   effect and utility in the church, so long as it is being exercised
   rightly, from genuine charity towards God and our neighbour, and
   according to the precepts and examples of the holy fathers, who
   contributed a great deal to the church by publicly professing such
   things at the time of the establishment and propagation of the faith .
   For, our redeemer first did and taught, and by his command and example,
   the college of twelve apostles -- the heavens alike proclaiming the
   glory of the true God through all the earth -- led back from darkness
   the whole human race, which was held by the old bondage under the yoke
   of sin, and guided it to the light of eternal salvation. The apostles
   and then their successors propagated far and wide and rooted deeply the
   word itself through all the earth and unto the ends of the world.
   Therefore those who are now carrying this burden ought to remember and
   frequently reflect that they in turn, with respect to this office of
   preaching, are entering into and maintaining that succession of the
   author and founder of this office, Jesus Christ our most holy redeemer,
   of Peter and Paul, and of the other apostles and disciples of the Lord
   .
   We have learnt from trustworthy sources that some preachers in our
   times (we record this with sorrow) do not attend to the fact that they
   are carrying out the office of those we have named, of the holy doctors
   of the church and of others professing sacred theology, who, ever
   standing by Christians and confronting false prophets striving to
   overturn the faith, have shown that the church militant remains
   unimpaired by her very nature; and that they ought to adopt only what
   the people who flock to their sermons will find useful, by means of
   reflection and practical application, for rooting out vices, praising
   virtues and saving the souls of the faithful. Reliable report has it,
   rather, that they are preaching many and various things contrary to the
   teachings and examples which we have mentioned, sometimes with scandal
   to the people. This fact influences our attitude very deeply when we
   reflect within ourself that these preachers, unmindful of their duty,
   are striving in their sermons not for the benefit of the hearers but
   rather for their own self-display. They flatter the idle ears of some
   people who seem to have already reached a state that would make true
   the words of the Apostle writing to Timothy: For, a time is coming when
   people will not endure sound teaching but, having itching ears, they
   will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own likings, and
   will turn away from listening to the truth and wander into myths .
   These preachers make no attempt whatever to lead back the deceived and
   empty minds of such people to the path of right and truth. Indeed, they
   involve them in even greater errors. Without any reverence for the
   testimony of canon law, indeed contrary to canonical censures, twisting
   the sense of scripture in many places, often giving it rash and false
   interpretations, they preach what is false; they threaten, describe and
   assert to be present, totally unsupported by legitimate proofs and
   merely following their own private interpretation, various terrors,
   menaces and many other evils, which they say are about to arrive and
   are already growing; they very often introduce to their congregations
   certain futile and worthless ideas and other matters of this nature;
   and, what is more appalling, they dare to claim that they possess this
   information from the light of eternity and by the guidance and grace of
   the holy Spirit .
   When these preachers spread this medley of fraud and error, backed by
   the false testimony of alleged miracles, the congregations whom they
   ought to be carefully instructing in the gospel message, and retaining
   and preserving in the true faith, are withdrawn by their sermons from
   the teaching and commands of the universal church. When they turn aside
   from the official sacred teachings, which they ought particularly to
   follow, they separate and move far from salvation those who listen to
   them. For, as a result of these and similar activities, the less
   educated people, as being more exposed to deceit, are very easily led
   into manifold errors, as they wander from the path of salvation and
   from obedience to the Roman church. Gregory, therefore, who was
   outstanding in this task, moved by the warmth of his charity, gave a
   strong exhortation and warning to preachers that, when about to speak,
   they approach the people with prudence and caution lest, caught up in
   the enthusiasm of their oratory, they entangle the hearts of their
   hearers with verbal errors as if with nooses, and while perhaps they
   wish to appear wise, in their delusion they foolishly tear asunder the
   sinews of the hoped-for virtue. For, the meaning of words is often lost
   when the hearts of the audience are bruised by too urgent and careless
   forms of speech .
   Indeed, in no other way do these preachers cause greater harm and
   scandal to the less educated than when they preach on what should be
   left unspoken or when they introduce error by teaching what is false
   and useless. Since such things are known to be totally opposed to this
   holy and divinely instituted religion, as being novelties and foreign
   to it, it is surely just for them to be examined seriously and
   carefully, lest they cause scandal for the christian people and ruin
   for the souls of their authors and of others. We therefore desire, in
   accord with the word of the prophet, Who makes harmony dwell in the
   house, to restore that uniformity which has lost esteem, and to
   preserve such as remains, insofar as we can with God's help, in the
   holy church of God, which by divine providence we preside over and
   which is indeed one, preaches and worships one God and firmly and
   sincerely professes one faith. We wish that those who preach the word
   of God to the people be such that God's church suffers no scandal from
   their preaching. If they are amenable to correction, let them abstain
   in future from these matters into which they have recently ventured.
   For it is clear that, in addition to the points which we have
   mentioned, a number of them are no longer preaching the way of the Lord
   in virtue and are not expounding the gospel, as is their duty, but
   rather invented miracles, new and false prophecies and other
   frivolities hardly distinguishable from old wives' tales. Such things
   give rise to great scandal since no account is taken of devotion and
   authority and of its condemnations and rejections. There are those who
   make attempts to impress and win support by bawling everywhere, not
   sparing even those who are honoured with pontifical rank and other
   prelates of the church, to whom they should rather be showing honour
   and reverence. They attack their persons and their state of life,
   boldly and without discrimination, and commit other acts of this kind.
   Our aim is that so dangerous and contagious an evil and so mortal a
   disease may be thoroughly wiped out and that its consequences may be so
   completely swept away that not even its memory remains .
   We decree and ordain, with the approval of the sacred council, that
   nobody -whether a secular cleric or a member of any of the mendicant
   orders or someone with the right to preach by law or custom or
   privilege or otherwise -- may be admitted to carry out this office
   unless he has first been examined with due care by his superior, which
   is a responsibility that we lay on the superior's conscience, and
   unless he is found to be fit and suitable for the task by his upright
   behaviour, age, doctrine, honesty, prudence and exemplary life.
   Wherever he goes to preach, he must provide a guarantee to the bishop
   and other local ordinaries concerning his examination and competence,
   by means of the original or other letters from the person who examined
   and approved him. We command all who undertake this task of preaching,
   or will later undertake it, to preach and expound the gospel truth and
   holy scripture in accordance with the exposition, interpretation and
   commentaries that the church or long use has approved and has accepted
   for teaching until now, and will accept in the future, without any
   addition contrary to its true meaning or in conflict with it. They are
   always to insist on the meanings which are in harmony with the words of
   sacred scripture and with the interpretations, properly and wisely
   understood, of the doctors mentioned above. They are in no way to
   presume to preach or declare a fixed time for future evils, the coming
   of antichrist or the precise day of judgment; for Truth says, it is not
   for us to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own
   authority. Let it be known that those who have hitherto dared to
   declare such things are liars, and that because of them not a little
   authority has been taken away from those who preach the truth .
   We are placing a restriction on each and all of the said clerics,
   secular and regular and others, of whatever status, rank or order, who
   undertake this task. In their public sermons they are not to keep on
   predicting some future events as based on the sacred writings, nor
   presume to declare that they know them from the holy Spirit or from
   divine revelation, nor that strange and empty predictions are matters
   which must be firmly asserted or held in some other way. Rather, at the
   command of the divine word, let them expound and proclaim the gospel to
   every creature, rejecting vices and commending virtues. Fostering
   everywhere the peace and mutual love so much commended by our Redeemer,
   let them not rend the seamless garment of Christ and let them refrain
   from any scandalous detraction of bishops, prelates and other superiors
   and of their state of life. Yet these they rebuke and hurt before
   people generally, including the laity, not only heedlessly and
   extravagantly but also by open and plain reproof, with the names of the
   evildoers sometimes being stated by them .
   Finally, we decree that the constitution of pope Clement of happy
   memory beginning Religiosi, which we renew and approve by this present
   decree, must be observed by preachers without alteration, so that,
   preaching in these terms for the people's advantage and winning them
   for the Lord, they may deserve to gain interest on the talent received
   from him and to win his grace and glory. But if the Lord reveals to
   certain of them, by some inspiration, some future events in the church
   of God, as he promises by the prophet Amos and as the apostle Paul, the
   chief of preachers, says, Do not quench the Spirit, do not despise
   prophesying, we have no wish for them to be counted with the other
   group of story-tellers and liars or to be otherwise hindered. For, as
   Ambrose bears witness, the grace of the Spirit himself is being
   extinguished if fervour in those beginning to speak is quietened by
   contradiction. In that case, a wrong is certainly done to the holy
   Spirit. The matter is important inasmuch as credence must not be easily
   given to every spirit and, as the Apostle states, the spirits have to
   be tested to see whether they come from God. It is therefore our will
   that as from now, by common law, alleged inspirations of this kind,
   before they are published, or preached to the people, are to be
   understood as reserved for examination by the apostolic see. If it is
   impossible to do this without danger of delay, or some pressing need
   suggests other action, then, keeping the same arrangement, notice is to
   be given to the local ordinary so that, after he has summoned three or
   four knowledgeable and serious men and carefully examined the matter
   with them, they may grant permission if this seems to them to be
   appropriate. We lay the responsibility for this decision on their
   consciences .
   If any persons dare to carry through anything contrary to any of the
   above, it is our will that, in addition to the punishments set down
   against such persons by law, they incur the penalty of excommunication
   from which, except at the imminent approach of death, they can be
   absolved only by the Roman pontiff . In order that others may not be
   urged on by their example to try similar acts, we decree that the
   office of preaching is forbidden to such persons for ever;
   notwithstanding constitutions, ordinances, privileges, indults and
   apostolic letters for religious orders and the aforesaid persons,
   including those mentioned in Mare magnum, even if perchance they have
   been approved, renewed or even granted anew by us, none of which in
   this matter do we wish to support at any point in their favour. Let
   nobody therefore ... If anyone however.. .
   [Bull containing agreements between the pope and the most christian
   king of France, on the Pragmatic]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. In accord with the
   dispensation of the divine mercy by which kings reign and princes rule,
   established as we are despite our lack of merit in the lofty
   watch-tower of the apostolate and set over nations and kingdoms, we
   ponder how permanent force and effect may be given to the things which
   have been granted, carried out, established, ordained, decreed and done
   by our praiseworthy and prudent arrangement, in union with our
   venerable brothers, the cardinals of the holy Roman church, for the
   wholesome and peaceful government of kingdoms and for the peace and
   justice of peoples, especially with regard to rulers who are
   well-deserving of the catholic faith, the christian state and the
   apostolic see. Nevertheless, we sometimes add the force of our renewed
   approval to such things, with the approval of the sacred council, so
   that these things may persist with greater steadiness in an undamaged
   state the more often they are strengthened by our authority as well as
   by the protection of a general council. We readily supply effective
   care for the preservation of such things in order that the kings and
   peoples of the kingdoms in question, full of gladness in the Lord
   because of such concessions, privileges, statutes and regulations, may
   rest together in the sweetness of peace, quiet and delight and may
   persevere more fervently in their accustomed devotion to the same see
   .
   Recently, in order that the church, our spouse, might be kept in a holy
   union and use might be made by Christ's faithful of the sacred canons
   issued by Roman pontiffs and general councils, we ordained and decreed,
   with the unanimous advice and consent of our said brothers, the
   cardinals of the holy Roman church certain constitutions that had been
   treated with our dearly beloved son in Christ, Francis, the most
   christian king of France, while we were at Bologna with our curia, and
   which were to take the place of the Pragmatic Sanction and the things
   contained in it for the sake of peace and harmony in the kingdom of
   France and for the general and public advantage of the kingdom. These
   constitutions were carefully examined by our said brothers, agreed upon
   with the said king on their advice, and accepted by a legitimate
   procurator of the king. Their contents are contained rather fully in
   our letter which follows, Primitiva illa ecclesia . . . {Msi 32,
   948-963, Raccolta di concordati su materie ecclesiastiche tra la Santa
   Sede e le autorita civili, edited by A. Mercati. I Rome. 1954. 233-25}
   The letter has been published chiefly in order that continuing charity
   and unbroken peace may abide in the mystical body, the church, and that
   any dissenting members may be re-grafted into the body in a convenient
   way. The letter will be better observed according as it is more clearly
   established that it has been approved and renewed by us, after mature
   and healthy consideration, with the approval of the said Lateran
   council. Although there is no need of another approval for the validity
   and reality of the same letter, however, to provide an ampler surety so
   that observance may be firmer and abolition more difficult, greater
   strength will be given to it by the approval of so many fathers.
   Therefore, with the approval of the sacred Lateran council, by
   apostolic authority and fullness of power, we approve and renew, and
   order to be observed and maintained in their totality and without
   change, the said letter together with each and every statute,
   ordinance, decree, explanation, agreement, compact, promise, wish,
   penalty, restraint and clause contained in it; especially the clause by
   which it was our will that if the said king of France does not approve
   and ratify the aforesaid letter, and each and every thing contained in
   it, within six months from the date of this present letter, and does
   not arrange for the contents to be read, published, sworn to and
   registered, like all other royal constitutions in his kingdom and in
   all other places and lordships of the said kingdom, for all future time
   without limit, by all the prelates and other ecclesiastical persons and
   courts of parlements, and if he does not convey to us, within the said
   six months, letters patent or authentic written documents concerning
   each and all of the aforesaid matters about the acceptance, reading,
   publication, oath and registration referred to, or does not deliver
   them to our nuncio attached to the king, in order to be passed on by
   him to us, and does not subsequently arrange for the letter to be read
   each year and effectively observed without alteration exactly as other
   binding constitutions and ordinances of the king of France have to be
   observed, then the letter itself and whatever follows from it are null
   and void and of no force or value .
   We decree and declare that the enduring effect only continues in the
   event of the said ratification and approval, and not otherwise or in
   any other way, and that all who are included in the said letter,
   regarding the observance of the actual letter and of each and every
   thing set down in it, are bound and obliged by the censures and
   penalties and other things contained in it, in accordance with the
   meaning and form of the same letter. This is notwithstanding apostolic
   constitutions and ordinances, all those things which we did not wish to
   oppose in the and any other things of any kind to the contrary. Let
   nobody If anyone however.. .
   [On the abrogation of the Pragmatic Sanction]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. The eternal Father, who will
   never abandon his flock up to the close of the age, so loved obedience,
   as the Apostle testifies, that to make expiation for the sin of
   disobedience of the first parent, he humbled himself and became
   obedient unto death. Moreover, when he was about to depart from the
   world to the Father, he established Peter and his successors as his own
   representatives on the firmness of a rock. It is necessary to obey them
   as the book of the Kings testifies, so that whoever does not obey,
   incurs death . As we read in another place, the person who abandons the
   teaching of the Roman pontiff cannot be within the church; for, on the
   authority of Augustine and Gregory, obedience alone is the mother and
   protector of all virtues, it alone possessing the reward of faith.
   Therefore, on the teaching of the same Peter, we ought to be careful
   that what has been introduced in due season and for sound reasons by
   our predecessors the Roman pontiffs, especially in sacred councils, for
   the defence of obedience of this kind, of ecclesiastical authority and
   freedom, and of the apostolic see, should be duly discharged by our
   effort, devotion and diligence and be brought to the desired
   conclusion. The souls of the simple, of whom we shall have to render an
   account to God, are to be freed from the deceits and snares of the
   prince of darkness. Indeed, our predecessor of happy memory, pope
   Julius II, summoned the sacred Lateran council for lawful reasons which
   were then made clear, on the advice and with the consent of his
   venerable brothers, the cardinals of the holy Roman church, among whom
   we were then numbered. Together with the same sacred Lateran council,
   he pondered on the fact that the corruption of the kingdom of France at
   Bourges, which they call the Pragmatic Sanction, had been strong in the
   past and was still vigorous, resulting in very great danger and scandal
   to souls, and a loss and cheapening of respect for the apostolic see.
   He therefore entrusted discussion of the Pragmatic Sanction to
   specifically named cardinals and to the prelates of a certain
   congregation
   Although the aforesaid sanction should clearly be subject to nullity on
   many counts, and was supporting and preserving open schism, and
   therefore it could have been declared to be essentially of no effect,
   null and invalid, without the need for any preceding formal citation,
   yet, from a great sense of caution, our same predecessor Julius, by a
   public edict -- which was to be fixed to the church doors of Milan,
   Asti and Pavia, since there was then no safe access to France -gave
   warning and summoned the prelates of France, the chapters of churches
   and monasteries, the parlements and the layfolk supporting them and
   making use of the said sanction, and each and all of the rest who were
   thinking that there was some advantage for them in the foregoing
   individually or collectively, to appear before him and the said council
   within a fixed period, which was then clearly stated, and to declare
   the reasons why the aforesaid sanction, and its corruptive and abusive
   effect in matters touching on the authority of the Roman church and the
   sacred canons, and on the violation of ecclesiastical liberty should
   not be declared null and invalid. During the lifetime of the said
   Julius our predecessor, various obstacles made it impossible to
   implement the summons or to discuss fully the business of the
   abrogation, as had been his intention . After his death, however, the
   summons, in full lawful form, was again brought forward by the promoter
   of the sacred council, the procurator fiscal. Those summoned and not
   presenting themselves were accused of obstinacy and the request was
   made for matters to be taken further. At the time we, who have been
   brought to the highest peak of the apostolate by the favour of the
   divine mercy after duly considering the whole situation, gave no
   response to the request, for definite reasons. Later, when a variety of
   impediments were being alleged by the said persons who had been warned
   and summoned, as to why they had been unable to present themselves at
   the appointed time (as stated above), we postponed, several times at
   several sessions, with the approval of the sacred council the date
   fixed by the said summons and warning to later dates, which have now
   long gone past, so that all occasion for just excuse and complaint
   might be taken away from them.
   Although all obstacles have been removed and all dead-lines have passed
   nevertheless the aforesaid persons, despite being warned and summoned,
   have not appeared before us and the said council, nor taken any steps
   to appear, in order to bring forward a reason why the said sanction
   should not be declared null. There is therefore no longer room for any
   excuse. They can justly be regarded as obstinate; as indeed, by the
   demands of justice, we reckoned them to be. We are therefore thinking
   seriously about this Pragmatic Sanction, or rather corruption, as has
   been stated, which was issued at the time of the schism by those who
   did not have the necessary power, and which is not at all in accord
   with the rest of the christian state or with God's holy church. It was
   revoked, made void and abolished by the most christian king of France,
   Louis XI, of distinguished memory. It damages and lessens the
   authority, liberty and dignity of the apostolic see. It completely
   removes the power of the Roman pontiff to provide both cardinals of the
   holy Roman church, who work earnestly on behalf of the universal
   church, and learned men, with churches, monasteries and other
   benefices, in accordance with the demands of their status, even though
   such persons are numerous in the curia and it is by their counsel that
   the authority and power of the apostolic see, the Roman pontiff and the
   whole church is kept safe and its affairs guided and promoted into a
   prosperous state. Thus it offers excuses to church prelates of the
   aforesaid faction for breaking and violating the sacred nerve of
   obedience to ecclesiastical discipline and for setting up opposition
   against us and the apostolic see, their mother, and it opens the way
   for them to attempt such things. Clearly it is subject to nullity and
   is to be supported by no prop except of a temporary nature, or rather,
   of a kind of tolerance. Our predecessors as Roman pontiffs, for all
   their high hopes expressed in their own days, may have seemed to have
   tolerated this corruption and abuse, not being able to confront it
   completely either because of the evil nature of the times or because
   they were providing for it in some other way. We remember, however,
   that almost seventy years have passed since the publication of this
   sanction of Bourges, and that no council has been lawfully held within
   this time except the present Lateran council. Since we have been placed
   in this council by the Lord's disposition, we therefore judge and
   resolve, with Augustine as our witness, that we cannot refrain or
   desist from the eradication and total annulment of the same vile
   sanction if we are to avoid disgrace to ourself and to the many fathers
   assembled in the present council as well as to avoid danger to our own
   soul and those of the above-mentioned persons using it .
   Just as pope Leo I, our predecessor of holy memory, whose footsteps we
   readily follow insofar as we can, gave orders and brought to pass that
   the measures which had been rashly carried out at the second synod of
   Ephesus, contrary to justice and the catholic faith, were later revoked
   at the council of Chalcedon, for the sake of the constancy of the same
   faith, so we too judge that we cannot, or ought not to, withdraw from
   or abandon the revocation of so evil a sanction and its contents if we
   are to preserve our own honour, and that of the church, with a safe
   conscience. The fact that the sanction and its contents were published
   at the council of Basel and, at the instance of the same council, were
   received and recognised by the meeting at Bourges, ought not to
   influence us since all those happenings after the transfer of the same
   council of Basel took place -- the transfer being made by pope Eugenius
   IV, our predecessor of happy memory -- have remained the deeds of the
   quasi-council, or rather the conventicle, of Basel. For, especially
   after that transfer, it did not deserve to be called a council any more
   and therefore its acts could not have any force. For it is clearly
   established that only the contemporary Roman pontiff, as holding
   authority over all councils, has the full right and power to summon,
   transfer and dissolve councils. This we know not only from the witness
   of holy scripture, the statements of holy fathers and our predecessors
   as Roman pontiffs, and the decisions of the sacred canons, but also
   from the declarations of the same councils. Some of this evidence we
   have decided to repeat, and some to pass over in silence as being
   sufficiently well known .
   Thus we read that the synod of Alexandria, at which Athanasius was
   present, wrote to Felix, bishop of Rome, that the council of Nicaea had
   decided that councils ought not to be celebrated without the authority
   of the Roman pontiff . Pope Leo I transferred the second council of
   Ephesus to Chalcedon. Pope Martin V authorised his presidents at the
   council of Siena to transfer the council with no mention being made of
   the council's consent. The greatest respect was shown to our
   predecessors as Roman pontiffs: to Celestine by the first synod of
   Ephesus; to the said Leo by the synod of Chalcedon; to Agatho by the
   sixth synod; to Hadrian by the seventh synod; and to Nicholas and
   Hadrian by the eighth synod, of Constantinople. These councils
   submitted with reverence and humility to the instructions and commands
   of the same pontiffs which had been composed and issued by them in the
   sacred councils. Moreover, pope Damasus and the other bishops assembled
   at Rome, writing to the bishops at Illyricum about the council at
   Rimini, pointed out that the number of bishops assembled at Rimini
   counted for nothing since it was known that the Roman pontiff, whose
   decrees were to be preferred before all others, had not given his
   consent to their meeting. It appears that pope Leo I said the same when
   writing to all the bishops of Sicily. It was customary for the fathers
   of the ancient councils humbly to ask for and obtain a warrant and
   approbation from the Roman pontiff in order to corroborate the matters
   dealt with in their councils . This is clear from the synods and their
   acts held at Nicaea, Ephesus, Chalcedon, the sixth synod at
   Constantinople, the seventh at Nicaea, the Roman synod under Symmachus
   and the synods in Haimar's book. We would certainly be without these
   recent troubles if the fathers at Bourges and Basel had followed this
   laudable custom, which it is known that the fathers at Constance also
   finally adopted .
   We desire this matter to be brought to its proper conclusion. We are
   proceeding on the strength of the many citations issued by us and our
   said predecessor Julius, and of the other things mentioned above which
   are so notorious that they cannot be hidden by any excuses or evasions,
   as well as in virtue of our pastoral office. We are supplying for each
   and every defect, both of law and of fact, if perchance any happen to
   exist in the above. We judge and declare, from our certain knowledge
   and from the fullness of apostolic power, with the approval of the same
   sacred council, by the contents of the present document, that the
   aforesaid Pragmatic Sanction or corruption, and its approbations
   however issued, and each and every decree, chapter, statute,
   constitution or ordinance that is included, or even inserted, in any
   way in the same and has been published by others, as well as the
   customs, expressions and uses, or rather abuses, in any way resulting
   from it and observed until the present, have been and are of no force
   or value. In addition, for a more extensive safeguard, we revoke, make
   void, abrogate, quash, annul and condemn that same sanction or
   corruption of Bourges and its approval, whether expressed or tacit, as
   said above, as well as each and every thing of whatever nature included
   or even inserted in it, and we judge, declare and will them to be
   considered as of no effect, revoked, made void, abrogated, quashed,
   annulled and condemned. Moreover, since subjection to the Roman pontiff
   is necessary for salvation for all Christ's faithful, as we are taught
   by the testimony of both sacred scripture and the holy fathers, and as
   is declared by the constitution of pope Boniface VIII of happy memory,
   also our predecessor, which begins Unam sanctam, we therefore, with the
   approval of the present sacred council, for the salvation of the souls
   of the same faithful, for the supreme authority of the Roman pontiff
   and of this holy see, and for the unity and power of the church, his
   spouse, renew and give our approval to that constitution, but without
   prejudice to the declaration of pope Clement V of holy memory, which
   begins Meruit .
   In virtue of holy obedience and under the penalties and censures to be
   declared below, we forbid each and all of Christ's faithful, both laity
   and secular clergy, and regulars of whatever order including
   mendicants, and other persons without restriction, of no matter what
   status, rank or condition they may be, including cardinals of the holy
   Roman church, patriarchs, primates, archbishops, bishops, and any
   others distinguished by ecclesiastical or worldly or any other honour,
   and each and all other prelates, clerics, chapters, secular convents,
   regulars of the aforesaid orders, including abbots and priors of
   monasteries, dukes, counts, princes, barons, parlements, royal
   officials, judges, advocates, notaries and scribes, both ecclesiastical
   and secular, and any other regular or secular ecclesiastics in any high
   office, as said above, who are now or shall be living in the said
   kingdom of France and the Dauphine and wherever the said Pragmatic has
   been in force directly or indirectly, silently or openly, to presume to
   make use of the aforesaid Pragmatic Sanction, or rather corruption, in
   any way or for any reason, by keeping silence or by clear speech,
   directly or indirectly, or by any other excuse or clever evasion, in
   any judicial or extrajudicial acts, or even to appeal to it or make
   judgments on its terms, or to quash, by themselves or through another
   or others, any judicial or extra-judicial acts on the grounds of the
   general meaning of the said sanction or of parts of it, and they may
   not permit or order these things to be done by means of others. They
   are not to keep the aforesaid Pragmatic Sanction, or sections or
   decrees contained in it, in their own houses or in other public or
   private places. Indeed, they are to destroy it, or have it destroyed,
   in archives, including royal and capitular ones, and in the
   above-mentioned places within six months from the date of this present
   letter .
   The penalties to be incurred, automatically and without the need for
   any further declaration, for each and all of the aforesaid persons, if
   they act to the contrary (though may they not!), are immediate major
   excommunication, the incapacity for all and singular legal acts of any
   kind, being branded as infamous, and the penalties expressed in the law
   of treason; in addition for the aforesaid ecclesiastical and religious
   persons, the loss of all patriarchal, metropolitan and other cathedral
   churches, of all monasteries, priories and convents, and of all secular
   dignities and ecclesiastical benefices, as well as the inability to
   hold them in the future; and in addition for secular persons, the loss
   of any fiefs held for any reason from the Roman or some other church,
   and the inability to hold them in the future. They cannot be absolved
   from these penalties by any faculty or by clauses contained in
   privileges regarding the hearing of confessions, no matter by what
   persons or verbal formulae they may have been granted. Except when at
   the point of death, they can only be absolved by the Roman pontiff
   acting canonically or by someone else having a faculty from him
   specifically for that purpose .
   By the knowledge, power and statements mentioned above we expressly and
   specifically repeal anything to the contrary. This is notwithstanding
   anything mentioned above as well as constitutions, ordinances, decrees
   and statutes, however they may have been published and granted, and
   frequently renewed, repeated, confirmed and approved, as enduring in
   their force, by apostolic or any other authority, even conciliar
   authority and even by our certain knowledge and fullness of apostolic
   power, the tenor of all of which we regard as sufficiently expressed
   and included, for the purposes of the above, as if they had been
   inserted herein word for word; notwithstanding if the apostolic see has
   granted to any communities and universities, and any individual persons
   mentioned above, even if they are the aforesaid cardinals, patriarchs,
   archbishops, bishops, marquises and dukes, or any others, whether
   individually or communally, that they cannot be interdicted, suspended,
   excommunicated, deprived or incapacitated by apostolic letters which do
   not make full and express mention, word for word, of the indult in
   question; and notwithstanding any other general or special privileges,
   indulgences and apostolic letters, of whatever tenor they may be, by
   means of which, because they are not expressed or included in whole in
   the present letter, the effect of the above might be impeded or
   deferred in any way, since special mention of their contents is to be
   regarded as included, word for word, in this our letter. Let nobody
   therefore .. . If anyone however .. .
   [On religious and their privileges]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. We consider and diligently
   ponder the hardworking and anxious zeal, and the unending labours for
   the glory of the divine name, for the triumph of the catholic faith and
   the preservation of the church's unity, and for the training and
   salvation of the souls of the faithful, which are carried on by bishops
   and their superiors, who have been placed by the apostolic see at the
   head of their churches in different parts of the world, as well as by
   the friars of the different orders, especially the mendicant orders,
   who are engaged without respite or rest. So great is the satisfaction
   that has reached our heart, as a result of their fruitful labours in
   the Lord's vineyard and their opportune and praiseworthy actions, that
   we are devoting every effort to encourage the things which we know to
   contribute to the preservation of peace and quiet among them. We are
   conscious that the bishops have become partners in our anxiety .
   Ambrose bears witness that their distinction and greatness have no
   possible equal. We also know that religious have done much in the field
   of the Lord for the defence and advance of the christian religion and
   that they have produced and are daily producing abundant fruit.
   Consequently all of the faithful are aware that the good works of these
   bishops and religious have enabled the true faith to make progress and
   to spread everywhere throughout the world .
   These men have likewise not hesitated on innumerable occasions, with
   much dedication and competence, to destroy the schisms in God's church,
   to bring unity to that church and to undergo innumerable pains so that
   the same church might gain the quiet of peace. Therefore it is just
   that we direct our efforts so to unite them to one another by the bond
   of peace and by a fraternal unity and charity that, linked in unity of
   doctrine and actions, they may foster more abundant fruits in God's
   church. The exercise of spiritual rights, which concern the glory of
   God and the salvation of the souls of Christ's faithful, has been
   entrusted to bishops and their superiors in their respective dioceses,
   since they have been chosen to be sharers of our burden, as we have
   already said, and since dioceses with defined boundaries have been
   assigned to each of the bishops. We truly desire, then, that these
   spiritual rights be exercised by the bishops, and that the right of
   freely exercising them be truly, as far as possible, kept intact for
   them. If our predecessors as Roman pontiffs and the apostolic see have
   granted any such spiritual rights to the said mendicant friars to the
   harm of the bishops we consider that such concessions made to religious
   ought in future to be limited, so that the friars themselves will be
   supported in all charity by the said bishops rather than be troubled
   and disturbed. For, regulars and seculars, prelates and subjects,
   exempt and non-exempt, belong to the one universal church, outside of
   which no one at all is saved, and they all have one Lord and one faith.
   That is why it is fitting that, belonging to the one same body, they
   also have the one same will; and just as the brethren are united by the
   bond of mutual charity, so it is not fitting that they arouse among
   themselves injustice and hurt, since the Saviour says, My commandment
   is that you love one another as I have loved you .
   We wish to preserve charity and mutual goodwill among bishops, their
   superiors, prelates and friars, as well as to promote divine worship
   and the peace and tranquillity of the universal church. We know this
   can be done only if each preserves as far as possible his own
   jurisdiction. We have therefore decided and decreed, with the approval
   of the sacred council, that the said bishops, their superiors and other
   prelates may visit the parish churches which legitimately belong to the
   same friars by reason of their residences, with regard to what concerns
   the care of the parishioners and the preservation and administration of
   the sacraments, without however the exceptional trouble and expense of
   official visitors. They may punish those responsible for the churches
   and failing in this matter: if they are religious, then in accordance
   with the rules of their order within the precincts of the religious
   house, if they are secular priests or friars who hold benefices of this
   kind, then they may freely punish them as being subject to their
   jurisdiction. Both prelates and secular priests who are not
   excommunicated may celebrate masses out of devotion in the churches of
   the said religious houses, if they wish to do so, and the friars
   themselves ought to welcome them. Friars who are invited by the same
   prelates to take part in solemn processions ought to agree, provided
   the suburban friary in question is not more than a mile away from the
   city .
   The friars' superiors are bound to specify and present in person to the
   same prelates the friars whom they have chosen to hear for a time the
   confessions of the prelate's subjects, if the prelates ask for them to
   be specified and presented to them; if not, then to their vicars; with
   the condition that they are not bound to go to prelates who are more
   than two days' journey away. The friars in question may be examined by
   the same bishops and prelates, at least regarding the sufficiency of
   their learning and their other skills relative to this sacrament. If
   they are accepted, or if the refusal is unjust, then, in accordance
   with the constitution Omnis utriusque sexus, let them be considered as
   accepted at least as regards confession, and they can even hear the
   confessions of strangers. They have no power, however, to absolve
   layfolk and secular clergy from manimposed penalties. They may not
   administer the eucharist and extreme unction and the church's other
   sacraments to those whose confessions they have heard, including the
   sick and the dying, who say that their own priest has refused to give
   the sacraments to them, unless the refusal was made without a just
   reason and this is proved by the testimony of neighbours or by an
   investigation carried out before a pubic notary. They have no authority
   to administer these sacraments to persons requesting their
   ministrations except during a period of actual service to them.
   Temporary agreements and contracts between friars and prelates or
   curates are valid unless they are rejected by the next general or
   provincial chapter and the rejection is duly communicated by the
   chapter. Friars may not enter parishes bearing a cross in order to
   carry out the funerals of those who have chosen to be buried at the
   churches of their houses or institutions, unless the parish priest,
   having received due notice and a request, does not refuse, and in that
   case without prejudice to himself and the ordinary; or unless there is
   an ancient custom on this point with the friars, which is currently in
   force and is mutually agreed upon. Those who wish to be buried in the
   habit of the said friars, but who live in their own houses and not in
   enclosure, are free to choose a burial place for themselves in their
   last wills .
   Friars due to be promoted to orders are to be examined by the
   ordinaries on grammar and their competence. Provided they answer
   adequately, they ought to be readily admitted by the ordinaries. They
   may not, however, be ordained in their churches or houses or other
   places by anyone except the diocesan bishop or his deputy (the latter
   is to be asked with due reverence), unless the bishop refuses on
   insufficient grounds or is absent from his diocese. They should not ask
   for the consecration of a church or an altar, or the blessing of a
   cemetery, from another bishop; and they may not arrange for the first
   stone of a church being built for them to be laid by a strange bishop,
   unless the ordinary refuses without any just reason after he has been
   asked two or three times with due reverence and urgency. Friars may not
   bless a bride and bridegroom without the consent of those in charge of
   the parish. In order to render to the mother church the honour due to
   her, friars and secular clerics may not ring the bells of their
   churches on Holy Saturday before those of the cathedral or mother
   church have been rung, even if they are supported on this point by a
   privilege of the apostolic see. Those acting otherwise incur a penalty
   of one hundred ducats. They are to publish and observe in the churches
   of their own houses the censures which are imposed promulgated and
   solemnly published by the ordinaries in the mother churches of cities
   as well as in the collegiate and parish churches of castles and towns,
   when they are asked to do this by the same ordinaries. To provide more
   fruitfully for the salvation of the souls of Christ's faithful of both
   sexes, they are obliged to advise and encourage those whose confessions
   they have heard for a time, no matter of what standing or status they
   may be, that they are bound in conscience to pay tithes, or a portion
   of their goods or produce, in those places where such tithes or dues
   are customarily paid; and they are obliged to refuse absolution to
   those who will not pay them. They are bound, moreover, to include this
   in their public preaching and exhortations to the people when they are
   asked to do so .
   The conservators assigned for a time to the same friars by the
   apostolic see ought to be outstanding in learning and good reputation
   and of established ecclesiastical rank. They cannot oblige to appear
   before them anyone living more than two days' journey away,
   notwithstanding any privileges granted to the conservators at other
   times. Excommunicated persons wishing to enter a mendicant order cannot
   be absolved when the interests of a third party are involved, unless
   satisfaction has previously been made. Procurators, business agents and
   workers in the service of the said friars are subject to sentences of
   excommunication which have been promulgated, if they have given cause
   for them or have offered help, favour or advice to the guilty. Brothers
   and sisters of the third order, and those known as the cloaked ones,
   the girdled ones and the devotees, and others no matter how named,
   living in their own homes, can choose whatever place of burial they
   wish. They are bound, however, to receive the eucharist at Easter as
   well as extreme unction and the other sacraments of the church, with
   the exception of the sacrament of penance, from their own priest . They
   are obliged to undertake the tasks incumbent upon the laity, and they
   can be brought before lay judges in a secular court. To avoid the
   cheapening of ecclesiastical censures, and sentences of interdict being
   regarded as of little importance, members of the said third orders are
   in no way to be admitted to hear divine services in the churches of
   their orders during a period of interdict, if they have given grounds
   for the interdict or encouraged or supported those grounds, or if they
   have in any way offered help, counsel or favour to the guilty . But
   those living in an official group, or dwelling with the enclosed, and
   women who are leading a life of virginity, celibacy or chaste widowhood
   under an expressed vow and with a habit, ought to enjoy the privileges
   of the order of which they are tertiaries .
   We wish and decree that each and all of the above norms are to be
   extended to and observed by, all other religious of other orders. In
   matters not mentioned above, the rights of the said bishops and friars
   and other religious are to be maintained. We do not wish to prejudice
   these rights in any way by the above statements, or to introduce
   anything new. This is notwithstanding apostolic constitutions and
   ordinances; statutes and customs of the said orders which have been
   strengthened by oath, apostolic confirmation or any other form of
   reinforcement; and privileges, indults and apostolic letters which have
   been granted to the same orders and are contrary to what has been set
   down above or to any part of it, even what was included in Mare magnum.
   If there is required a mention or other statement that is special,
   specific, clear, distinctive, word for word, and not by general
   clauses, regarding these things and their meaning, or if some other
   carefully chosen form should be used, in order that they might be
   abrogated, then we consider their meaning to be sufficiently expressed
   and included in this present letter, we expressly and specially
   abrogate anything to the contrary, and we decree as null and void
   anything that is knowingly or unknowingly attempted to the contrary in
   these matters by any person acting on any authority .

SESSION 11 continued

   We warn the friars, in virtue of holy obedience, to revere bishops with
   fitting honour and due respect, out of the reverence owed to us and the
   apostolic see, since they act as deputies in place of the holy
   apostles. As for bishops, we urge and appeal by the tender mercy of our
   God that, while attending to the friars with well-disposed affection,
   treating them with kindness and encouraging them, they present
   themselves to them as in no sense difficult or hard or peevish, but
   rather as easy, mild, well-disposed and liberal in loving generosity,
   and that in all the above-mentioned matters they welcome them with
   ready kindness as co-workers in the Lord's vineyard and as sharers in
   their labours, and that they guard and defend their rights with all
   charity, so that both bishops and friars, whose works as burning lamps
   set on a hilltop ought to provide light to all Christ's faithful, may
   move forward from strength to strength for the glory of God, the
   triumph of the catholic faith and the salvation of peoples, and in
   consequence deserve to obtain from the Lord, the most generous
   recompenser of all good deeds, the reward of eternal life. Let nobody
   therefore . . . If anyone however . . .

SESSION 12

16 March 1517

   [Against those attacking the houses of cardinals]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Certain audacious persons
   disdain to show the appropriate deference to the cardinals of the holy
   Roman church, who are the chief pillars of the catholic church. They do
   not fear to lay violent hands, with impious boldness, on their
   possessions and properties. Their uncontrolled desire warns and induces
   us to strengthen, increase and extend -- in accordance with the
   character of the times and with what we perceive in the Lord to be
   soundly in keeping with so distinguished an office in God's church --
   those measures which, by wise planning, were established by our
   predecessors for the safe-guarding of the high office of the said
   cardinals, in order that the boldness of these people may be restrained
   before it extends even further. Indeed, there has recently grown up in
   Rome a damnable abuse and lack of restraint in wrongdoing. Thus, while
   there is a vacancy in the apostolic see, and the election of a future
   Roman pontiff is actually being discussed by the cardinals in conclave,
   if some rumour leaks out, even if false, that one of the cardinals has
   been elected as pontiff, the mob attacks his house with arms and
   contends by force with his servant-guards, while he is still in the
   conclave, over the despoiling of his house . If an entry is forced by
   breaking down the doors or digging under the wall, the mob rushes in to
   plunder all the goods that are there, unless a defence is made by armed
   guards. Sometimes there are some who are so audacious and headstrong
   that they do not fear even on other occasions to attack the houses of
   cardinals in a hostile fashion and with arms, under the guise of
   general brawling, and to strike and wound while they are there, as a
   result of which there is considerable loss to the honour of the
   cardinalate, by which the most holy church militant is fully adorned as
   by a purple garment, contempt for the cardinals is aroused, and
   occasion is given for murders and other scandals .
   We wish to suppress audacious tendencies of this kind by fitting
   punishments . We therefore renew by this letter, with the approval of
   the sacred council and by our apostolic authority, the published
   constitutions of our predecessors as Roman pontiffs, Honorius III and
   Boniface VIII of happy memory, against those pursuing any cardinal of
   the said church in a hostile manner, those assisting such persons by
   their presence, counsel or support, or knowingly harbouring or
   defending them, and those attacking their houses or dwellings, as said
   above, and their descendants and property. We decree that these
   constitutions must be observed everywhere without alteration for all
   future times. We also extend these same constitutions, with each and
   every censure and penalty contained in them, to each and every living
   person of whatever status, condition and distinction, who attacks with
   an armed band the home of any of the said cardinals, both at the time
   of the said conclave, even if the cardinal in question has been elected
   pope, and at other times and for any reasons, and who seizes anything
   in the house with violence like an enemy or wounds anyone of those
   dwelling there, and also their associates and those who have given
   orders for it to be done, or have given personal approval to the deed
   or have provided counsel and support to the attackers in the above
   matters and have defended them. This is notwithstanding apostolic
   constitutions and ordinances and other measures of whatever kind to the
   contrary. Let nobody therefore . . . If anyone however . . .
   [Constitution imposing taxes and closing the council]
   Leo, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   council, for an everlasting record. We have been set over nations and
   kingdoms, as the prophet declared, although our merits are unequal to
   this. We are suitably carrying out the duty of our office when we renew
   again that reform of the whole church and its affairs which we have
   accomplished with profit; when we plan to apply suitable remedies for
   the unchallenged observance of the reform and to make provision for
   cathedrals and metropolitan churches so that they may no longer be
   without their pastors; and when we supervise these remedies with
   ever-present attention and untiring efforts, by means of which we may
   be able to render the Lord's flock, which has been entrusted to our
   care, acceptable and submissive in the sight of the divine majesty. Our
   aim is also to crush the Turks and other infidels standing firm in the
   eastern and southern regions. They treat the way of true light and
   salvation with complete contempt and totally unyielding blindness; they
   attack the life-giving cross on which our Saviour willed to accept
   death so that by dying he might destroy death, and by the ineffable
   mystery of his most holy life he might restore life; and they make
   themselves hateful enemies of God and most bitter persecutors of the
   christian religion. Strengthened by defences not only spiritual but
   also temporal, we may be able, under God's guidance and favour, to
   oppose the bitter and frequent sallies by which, in wild rage, they
   move savagely amidst christian blood .
   Indeed, pope Julius II, our predecessor of happy memory, acting in
   union with the holy Spirit, in a laudable and legitimate manner, for
   sound reasons, with the advice and consent of his venerable brothers,
   the cardinals of the holy Roman church, of whom we were then one,
   summoned the sacred Lateran council. He held five sessions and summoned
   a sixth. He then passed from the human scene. We were then raised to
   the summit of the highest apostolate by the favour of the divine mercy.
   We had always had a heartfelt desire, even at lesser meetings, to see a
   general council being celebrated as a very important development in the
   Lord's field. We realised that an obligation had been added to our
   honourable and useful desire as a result of the duty of pastoral care
   now laid upon us. We therefore undertook this matter with a more
   burning commitment and a total readiness of mind. We gave approval in
   the said sixth session, with the advice and consent of our said brother
   cardinals and with the approval of the same sacred Lateran council, to
   the postponement of the council to a fixed date, which was then clearly
   stated, for reasons made clear from the situation and for others
   affecting our own and the minds of our said brother cardinals. The
   council was to continue towards the completion of the objectives for
   which it had been summoned; and especially that, once the terrible
   conflicts between christian princes and rulers were settled and weapons
   of war set aside, a universal and lasting peace could be established.
   Leaving nothing untried, we intended to use all our efforts to bring
   about this peace and to conclude it, as if it were a good of supreme
   advantage. We also declared that it is and shall be part of our
   unchangeable thought and intention that, once the matters concerning
   the praise of God and the exaltation of the aforesaid church have been
   completed, the holy and most necessary expedition against the enemies
   of the catholic faith shall take place and a successful triumph over
   them be accomplished with the aid of the most High. In order that those
   under an obligation to attend this most useful council might not be
   held back in any way from coming to it, and so that they might be
   unable to proffer any excuse, we provided and granted, with the
   approval of the said Lateran council, to each and all of those summoned
   to the celebration of the council by our predecessor Julius, and to
   their attendants, a safe-conduct while they were travelling to and
   staying in Rome for the purposes of the said Lateran council. We urged
   kings and princes, out of reverence for the apostolic see, not to
   molest those coming here but to permit them to travel in safety .
   We summoned the seventh session. We wanted nothing more than that those
   useful and necessary matters on account of which the said Lateran
   council had been summoned might be brought to their conclusion. We
   therefore set up three special committees of cardinals and other
   prelates to listen to and discuss matters of this kind and other
   conciliar business, and we ordered them to report to the council on
   what they had heard and discussed. One of the committees had the
   special task of establishing a universal peace between christian kings
   and princes, which was one of the chief reasons for the said council
   coming together, and of rooting out the schism; the second had the
   special task of general reform, including the reform of the curia; and
   the third had the special task of examining and abrogating the
   Pragmatic Sanction and of dealing with matters concerning the true
   faith. Each committee carefully examined many useful and necessary
   topics and accurately reported to us about them. The subjects discussed
   and investigated by them were completed and concluded by us, with God's
   favour and the approval of the sacred council, in the remaining five
   sessions of the council which we held. We then knew beyond all doubt
   that God himself, the giver of gifts, had favoured our devout desires
   and those tending to the common good, out of his exceeding goodness and
   mercy, and that he had granted to us what we had planned in our own
   mind and for which we had greatly laboured namely that once the matters
   on account of which the council had been summoned had been concluded in
   conformity with the council's aims, the council itself could be closed
   and discharged .
   The emperor-elect Maximilian, our dear son in Christ, in the time of
   our said predecessor Julius, and king Louis of France, of happy memory,
   in our own time, as well as other kings and princes adhered to the
   Lateran council, lawfully assembled in the holy Spirit, to the greatest
   satisfaction of everyone. The quasi-council at Pisa, which had been
   summoned by certain persons without the necessary authority and had
   been condemned by the same Julius who preceded us, was treated by them
   as condemned in accordance with the decision of the said Julius. The
   schism which had begun to grow from this was ended (although it is c
   ear that so long as the situation continued, it brought very many
   injures to prelates and others of Christ's faithful at various times,
   as well as to other general councils held until this time). There was
   peace for the whole church and a resulting union. The moral habits of
   churchmen as well as of secular and other persons were reformed,
   insofar as this seemed appropriate, and several matters concerning the
   true faith were defined. Several other matters, after being carefully
   examined and debated in the three committees of cardinals and prelates
   mentioned above, were considered with care and skill in the said
   council and a final decision was reached. Finally, it was reported to
   us on several occasions, through the cardinals and prelates of the
   three committees, that no topics remained for debate and discussion by
   them, and that over several months nothing at all new had been brought
   before them by anyone. The bishops who had been invited to share with
   us the responsibility for the support and care of the Lord's flock, as
   well as other prelates, had remained in Rome rather a long time beyond
   the normal usage of sacred councils, with inconvenience and loss to
   themselves and to their churches .
   Therefore there seemed to remain, of all the above things which we and
   the said committees so much desired to be completed in the council,
   only peace between kings and princes and a harmony of minds. Our
   attitude in favour of this, and our striving with every effort for its
   accomplishment, can be made abundantly clear to all who read our
   letters. God himself, who is the supreme light and truth of all things,
   knows how we never ceased to beg and implore of him, by many prayers
   and constant appeals, that he would deign of his mercy to influence the
   christian flock -- which he has entrusted to our care, despite our lack
   of merits -- to enter upon a stable and enduring peace, now that this
   same flock has been roused by the warmth of mutual charity. We have
   earnestly urged this in the Lord, whose cause is principally in
   question, upon kings and princes, by means of persuasive reasons,
   through the nuncios whom we keep at the court of the emperor-elect
   Maximilian and with the aforesaid kings and princes, and through
   letters; especially if they wish to provide and take measures, as is
   right, on behalf of the christian religion and the catholic faith,
   which have been brought into serious danger and risk by the recently
   extended power of the ruler of the Turks. We have learnt from the
   letters of the same nuncios, kings and princes that our appeals have
   been of such great power and efficacy with the said kings and princes,
   and have influenced their hearts and minds to such an extent, that the
   peace so long desired by us for the good of the whole christian state
   has been almost concluded in intention, and the hope is that if
   anything remains it will soon be resolved (by God's favour). Our heart
   exults in our Lord Jesus Christ as we ponder over this in our mind and
   spirit. We give thanks for this to him, the giver of all graces,
   because he has guided these persons to the harmony we had longed for.
   We think that all Christ's faithful should offer to God thanks and
   those signs of joy which are customary on such occasions, and that God
   be asked that the peace achieved may endure .
   It only remains, therefore, for the holy and very necessary campaign to
   be undertaken against the fury of the infidels thirsting for christian
   blood, and for all the measures decided upon as powerful safeguards in
   the eleven sessions, held partly by us and partly by our predecessor
   Julius, to be approved and renewed and ordered to be observed
   unchallenged. Accordingly, after mature deliberation on these matters
   with our brothers and other prelates, we approve and renew by apostolic
   authority, with the approval of the sacred council, all and each of the
   acts and decisions of the said eleven sessions, and the letters
   published above together with all the clauses contained in them --
   apart from certain excepted matters which we judge should be conceded
   to specified persons for the sake of the peace and unity of the
   universal church -- as well as the business carried out by the
   committees. We decree and order that they are to be observed without
   alteration for ever, and that those carrying them out are to see that
   they and their contents are observed, namely: in the Roman curia, the
   current governor of our mother city and our vicar as well as the
   auditor general of the apostolic camera, who have the power to oblige
   and compel persons subject to them; and outside the Roman curia, we
   depute for this purpose each and all local ordinaries. We forbid each
   and all of Christ's faithful, under penalty of immediate
   excommunication, to presume to interpret or gloss what has been
   produced and carried out in the present council without our permission
   and that of the apostolic see .
   We decree, with the approval of the sacred council, that the said
   campaign against the infidels is to be undertaken and carried through.
   Zeal for the faith prompts us to this. It has been so often proposed
   and promised by us and our predecessor Julius in the sessions referred
   to, when the business of the council was being explained. On several
   occasions it was communicated to, and discussed with, spokesmen at our
   court representing kings and princes. Pope Nicholas V, our predecessor
   of pious memory, summoned a general expedition against the infidels
   after the disastrous fall of Constantinople in order to crush their
   fury and to avenge the wounds of Christ. Callistus III and Pius II, of
   happy memory our predecessors as Roman pontiffs, urged on by zeal for
   the faith, followed in the same path with skill and energy. During a
   subsequent period of three years, we imitated them by means of an
   authorisation from ourselves and our said brothers for imposing and
   exacting a tithe on the revenues of churches, monasteries and other
   benefices throughout the world and for doing each and every other thing
   that is necessary and customary in a campaign of this kind. We
   continually pour forth holy, humble and earnest prayers to almighty God
   that the campaign may have a happy outcome. We order the same to be
   done by all Christ's faithful of either sex. We exhort Maximilian, the
   emperor-elect, and kings, princes and christian rulers, whose courage
   God bids us to rouse, beseeching them by the tender mercy of our God,
   Jesus Christ, and appealing to them by his fearful judgment to remember
   that they shall have to render an account of their defence and
   preservation -- even by giving their lives -- of the church itself,
   which has been redeemed by Christ's blood, and to rise up in strength
   and power for the defence of the christian faith, as is incumbent on
   them as a personal and necessary duty, with all mutual hatred being set
   aside and quarrels and conflicts among themselves being committed to
   everlasting oblivion. At this time of such great need, let them offer
   with eagerness their ready assistance in keeping with their resources.
   We urge with paternal affection and ask them that, at least during the
   campaign, out of reverence for almighty God and for the apostolic see,
   they assure the unbroken observance of the peace into which they have
   entered, so that such an important good, which we hope and desire will
   be obtained with the help of the Lord's right hand, may not be impeded
   by some interruption from discord and dissension .
   In order that prelates and others at the present council, which has
   lasted for nearly five years, may not be further wearied by their
   labours and expenses and so that they may be able to visit and bring
   encouragement to their churches, and for other reasonable and just
   causes, we bring the present council to a close and we discharge it
   with the Lord's blessing. With the approval of the same sacred council,
   we grant permission to each and all who are present at the council to
   return to their own countries. In order that they may be able to go
   back with ever increasing joy and strengthened with spiritual gifts, we
   impart to them and to all their attendants a plenary remission and
   indulgence for all their sins, once in their lifetime and again at the
   hour of death. Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however ...
