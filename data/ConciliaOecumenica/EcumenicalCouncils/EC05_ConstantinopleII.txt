The Second General Council of Constantinople, 553


Introduction

   The emperor Justinian and Pope Vigilius decided to summon this council
   after the latter withdrew his "Judgment" condemning the "Three
   Chapters" of Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret and Ibas. This
   "Judgment" had been issued on 11 April 548 but the bishops of the west
   and especially of Africa unanimously opposed it. The council was
   summoned by Justinian to Constantinople, although Vigilius would have
   preferred to convene it in Sicily or Italy so that western bishops
   might be present. It assembled on 5 May 553 in the great hall attached
   to Hagia Sophia cathedral.
   Since the Roman pontiff refused to take part in the council, because
   Justinian had summoned bishops in equal numbers from each of the five
   patriarchal sees, so that there would be many more eastern than western
   bishops present, Eutychius, patriarch of Constantinople, presided. The
   decrees of the council were signed by 160 bishops, of whom 8 were
   Africans.
   On 14 May 553 Pope Vigilius issued his "Constitution", which was signed
   by 16 bishops (9 from Italy, 2 from Africa, 2 from Illyricum and 3 from
   Asia Minor). This rejected sixty propositions of Theodore of
   Mopsuestia, but spared his personal memory and refused to condemn
   either Theodoret or Ibas since, on the testimony of the council of
   Chalcedon, all suspicion of heresy against them had been removed.
   Nevertheless, the council in its 8th session on 2 June 553 again
   condemned the "Three Chapters", for the same reasons as Justinian had
   done so, in a judgment which concludes with 14 anathemas.
   After carefully considering the matter for six months, Vigilius
   ,weighing up the persecutions of Justinian against his clergy and
   having sent a letter to Eutychius of Constantinople, approved the
   council, thus changing his mind "after the example of Augustine".
   Furthermore he anathematized Theodore and condemned his writings and
   those of Theodoret and Ibas. On 23 February 554, in a second
   "Constitution", he tried to reconcile the recent condemnation with what
   had been decreed at the council of Chalcedon.
   The council did not debate ecclesiastical discipline nor did it issue
   disciplinary canons. Our edition does not include the text of the
   anathemas against Origen since recent studies have shown that these
   anathemas cannot be attributed to this council.
   For the 14 anathemas (pp. 114-122) the translation is from the Greek
   text, since this is the more authoritative version.

Sentence against the "Three Chapters"

   Our great God and saviour Jesus Christ, as we are told in the parable
   in the gospel, gives talents to each one according to his ability, and
   at the proper time asks for an account of what has been done by each
   one. If the person to whom only one talent has been given is condemned
   because he has not worked and increased it, but has only preserved it
   without diminishment, how much more serious and more frightening must
   be the condemnation to which the person is subjected who not only fails
   to look after himself but scandalizes others and is a cause of offence
   to them ? It is clear to all believers that when a problem about the
   faith comes up it is not only the heretical person who is condemned but
   also the person who is in a position to correct the heresy of others
   and fails to do so. To those of us to whom the task has been given of
   governing the church of the Lord, there comes a fear of the
   condemnation which threatens those who neglect to do the Lord's work.
   We hurry to take care of the good seed of faith protecting it from the
   weeds of heresy which have been planted by the enemy. We observed that
   the pupils of Nestorius were trying to bring their heresy into the
   church of God by means of the heretical Theodore, bishop of Mopsuestia
   and his books as also by the writings of the heretical Theodoret and
   the disgraceful letter which is alleged to have been sent by Ibas to
   Mari the Persian. Our observations prompted us to correct what was
   happening. We assembled in this imperial city, summoned here by the
   will of God and the command of the most religious emperor.
   The most religious Vigilius happened to be present in this imperial
   city and took part in all the criticisms against the three chapters. He
   had frequently condemned them by word of mouth and in his writings.
   Later he gave a written agreement to take part in our council and to
   study with us the three chapters so that we could all issue an
   appropriate definition of the true faith. The most pious emperor,
   prompted by what was acceptable to us, encouraged a meeting between
   Vigilius and ourselves because it is proper that the priesthood should
   impose a common conclusion to matters of common concern. Consequently
   we asked his reverence to carry out his written undertakings. It did
   not seem right that the scandal over these three chapters should
   continue and that the church of God should be further disturbed. In
   order to persuade him, we reminded him of the great example left us by
   the apostles and of the traditions of the fathers. Even though the
   grace of the holy Spirit was abundant in each of the apostles, so that
   none of them required the advice of another in order to do his work,
   nevertheless they were loathe to come to a decision on the issue of the
   circumcision of gentiles until they had met together to test their
   various opinions against the witness of the holy scriptures.
   In this way they unanimously reached the conclusion which they wrote to
   the gentiles: It has seemed good to the holy Spirit and to us to lay
   upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; that you
   abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from
   what is strangled and from unchastity.
   The holy fathers, who have gathered at intervals in the four holy
   councils, have followed the examples of antiquity. They dealt with
   heresies and current problems by debate in common, since it was
   established as certain that when the disputed question is set out by
   each side in communal discussions, the light of truth drives out the
   shadows of lying.
   The truth cannot be made clear in any other way when there are debates
   about questions of faith, since everyone requires the assistance of his
   neighbour. As Solomon says in his proverbs: A brother who helps a
   brother shall be exalted like a strong city; he shall be as strong as a
   well-established kingdom. Again in Ecclesiastes he says: Two are better
   than one, for they have a good reward for their toil. And the Lord
   himself says: Amen I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about
   anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For
   where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of
   them. Vigilius was frequently invited by us all, and most distinguished
   judges were sent to him by the most pious emperor. Eventually he
   promised to give judgment personally on the three chapters. When we
   heard this promise, we remembered the warning of the Apostle that each
   of us shall give an account of himself to God. We were afraid of the
   condemnation which threatens those who scandalize one of the least
   important, and of the much more serious one which threatens those who
   scandalize so very christian an emperor, the people and all the
   churches. We also remembered what was said by God to Paul: Do not be
   afraid, but speak, and do not be silent; for I am with you, and nobody
   shall be able to harm you. When we met together, therefore, we first of
   all briefly made a confession of the faith which our lord Jesus Christ
   true God, handed down to his holy apostles and by means of them to the
   holy churches, the same faith which those who afterwards were holy
   fathers and doctors handed down to the people entrusted to them. We
   confessed that we believe, protect and preach to the holy churches that
   confession of faith which was set out at greater length by the 318 holy
   fathers who met in council at Nicaea and handed down the holy doctrine
   or creed. The 150 who met in council at Constantinople also set out the
   same faith and made a confession of it and explained it. The 200 holy
   fathers who met in the first council of Ephesus agreed to the same
   faith. We follow also the definitions of the 630 who met in council at
   Chalcedon, regarding the same faith which they both followed and
   preached. We confessed that we held to be condemned and anathematized
   all those who had been previously condemned and anathematized by the
   catholic church and by the aforesaid four councils. When we had made
   this confession in this way, we made a start on the examination of the
   three chapters. First, we considered Theodore of Mopsuestia. When all
   the blasphemies in his works were exposed, we were astonished at God's
   patience, that the tongue and mind which had formed such blasphemies
   were not straightaway burned up by divine fire. We would not even have
   allowed the official reader of these blasphemies to continue, such was
   our fear of the anger of God at even a rehearsal of them (since each
   blasphemy was worse than the one before in the extent of its heresy and
   shook to their foundation the minds of their listeners), if it had not
   been the case that those who revelled in these blasphemies seemed to us
   to require the humiliation which their exposure would bring upon them.
   All of us, angered by the blasphemies against God, burst into attacks
   and anathemas against Theodore, during and after the reading, as if he
   had been living and present there. We said: Lord, be favourable to us;
   not even the demons themselves have dared to speak such things against
   you.
   O his intolerable tongue! O the wickedness of the man ! O the proud
   hand he raised against his creator! This disgraceful man, who had made
   a promise to understand the scriptures, did not remember the words of
   the prophet Hosea: Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! They
   have become notorious because of their impiety towards me. They spoke
   evil things about me, and after they had considered them, they spoke
   even worse things against me. They will fall into a trap because of the
   depravity of their tongues. Their contempt will be turned inwards on
   themselves, because they have broken my covenant and acted impiously
   against my law. The impious Theodore deserves to come under these
   curses. He dismissed the prophecies about Christ and he vilified, as
   far as he could, the great mystery of the arrangements that have been
   made for our salvation. In many ways he tried to demonstrate that the
   divine word was nothing but fables composed for the amusement of the
   gentiles. He ridiculed the other condemnations of the impious made by
   the prophets, especially the one in which holy Habakkuk says of those
   who teach false doctrines: Woe to him who makes his neighbours drink of
   the cup of his wrath, and makes them drunk, to gaze on their caverns.
   This refers to their teachings which are full of darkness and quite
   separate from the light.
   Why ought we to add anything more? Anyone who wishes can consult the
   volumes of the heretical Theodore or the heretical chapters from his
   heretical books which have been included in our acts. Anyone can see
   his unbelievable folly and the disgraceful utterances made by him. We
   fear to continue and to rehearse again those shameful things. The
   writings of the holy fathers against him were also read out to us. We
   heard what had been written against his folly which was more than all
   the other heretics, and the historical records and imperial laws which
   set out his heresy from its beginning. Despite all this, those who
   defended his heresy, delighting in the insults offered by him to his
   creator, declared that it was improper to anathematize him after his
   death. Although we were aware of the ecclesiastical tradition
   concerning heretics, that they are anathematized even after death, we
   deemed it necessary to go into this matter as well and it can be found
   in the acts how several heretics were anathematized after they were
   dead. In many ways it has become clear to us that those who put forward
   this argument have no concern for God's judgments, nor for the
   pronouncements of the apostles, nor for the traditions of the fathers.
   We would willingly question them concerning what they would say about
   the Lord, who said of himself: He who believes in him is not condemned,
   he who does not believe in him is condemned already, because he has not
   believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God. And about that
   claim of the Apostle: Even if we, or an angel from heaven, should
   preach to you a gospel contrary to what you have received, let him be
   accursed. As we said earlier, I repeat once more: If anyone preaches to
   you a gospel contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed.
   Since the Lord declares that the person is judged already, and the
   Apostle curses even the angels if they instruct in anything different
   from what we have preached, how is it possible even for the most
   presumptuous to assert that these condemnations apply only to those who
   are still alive? Are they unaware, or rather pretending to be unaware,
   that to be judged anathematized is just the same as to be separated
   from God? The heretic, even though he has not been condemned formally
   by any individual, in reality brings anathema on himself, having cut
   himself off from the way of truth by his heresy. What reply can such
   people make to the Apostle when he writes: As for someone who is
   factious, after admonishing him once or twice, have nothing more to do
   with him, knowing that such a person is perverted and sinful; he is
   self-condemned.
   It was in the spirit of this text that Cyril of holy memory, in the
   books which he wrote against Theodore, declared as follows: "Whether or
   not they are alive, we ought to keep clear of those who are in the grip
   of such dreadful errors. It is necessary always to avoid what is
   harmful, and not to be worried about public opinion but rather to
   consider what is pleasing to God". The same Cyril of holy memory,
   writing to bishop John of Antioch and to the synod which met there
   about Theodore who was condemned with Nestorius, says, "It was
   necessary that a brilliant festival should be kept since all those who
   had expressed opinions in accordance with Nestorius had been rejected,
   whoever they were. Action was taken against all those who believed, or
   had at any time believed, in these mistaken views. This is exactly what
   we and your holiness pronounced: 'We anathematize those who assert that
   there exist two sons and two Christs. He who is preached by you and us
   is, as was said, the single Christ, both Son and Lord, the
   only-begotten as man, as learned Paul says'". Moreover in his letter to
   the priests and fathers of monks, Alexander, Martinian, John,
   Paregorious and Maximus, and to those who were living as solitaries
   along with them, he says: "The holy synod of Ephesus, meeting in
   accordance with the will of God, has pronounced sentence against the
   heresy of Nestorius and has condemned according to justice and with
   accuracy both Nestorius himself and all those who might later, in inane
   fashion, adopt the same opinions as he held, and those who had
   previously adhered to the same opinions and who were bold enough to put
   them in writing, placing upon them all an equal condemnation. It was
   quite logical that when a condemnation was issued against one person
   for such stupidity in what he said, then that condemnation should apply
   not only to that person alone but also, so to speak, against all those
   who spread the heresies and untruths. They express these falsehoods
   against the true dogmas of the church, offering worship to two sons,
   trying to divide what cannot be divided, and introducing to both heaven
   and earth the offence of the worship of man. But the sacred band of
   heavenly spirits worship along with us only one lord Jesus Christ".
   Moreover, several letters of Augustine of sacred memory, who was
   particularly outstanding among the African bishops, were read in which
   he indicates that it is correct to condemn heretics even after their
   death. Other most reverend bishops of Africa have also observed this
   church custom; moreover the holy church of Rome has issued anathemas
   against certain bishops even after they were dead, although they had
   not been accused on matters of faith while they were alive; the acts of
   our deliberations bear witness to both these cases. Since the followers
   of Theodore and his heresy, who are plainly opposed to the truth, have
   tried to adduce some sections of the writings of Cyril and Proclus of
   holy memory, as though these were in favour of Theodore, it is
   appropriate to apply to these attempts the observation of the prophet
   when he writes: The ways of the Lord are right, and the upright walk in
   them, but transgressors stumble in them. These followers have willfully
   misunderstood what the holy fathers wrote, even though it was true and
   appropriate; they have quoted these writings, dissembling excuses for
   their own iniquities. It seems that the fathers did not lift the
   anathema against Theodore but rather used the language of concession in
   order to lead away from their mistake those who offered some defence of
   Nestorius and his heresy; their aim was to lead them to perfection and
   to instruct them that not only was Nestorius, the disciple of heresy,
   condemned but also his teacher Theodore. The fathers indicate their
   intention in this matter despite the conciliatory forms used: Theodore
   was to be anathematized. This has been very clearly shown to be the
   case by us in our acts from the works of Cyril and Proclus of blessed
   memory in respect of the condemnation of Theodore and his heresy. This
   conciliatory attitude is also to be found in the holy scriptures. The
   apostle Paul employed this tactic at the start of his ministry when he
   was dealing with those who had been Jews; he circumcised Timothy so
   that by this conciliation and concession he might lead them to
   perfection. Afterwards, however, he ruled against circumcision, writing
   on the subject to the Galatians: Now I Paul say to you that if you
   receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. We found
   that the defenders of Theodore have done exactly what the heretics were
   accustomed to do. They have tried to lift the anathema on the said
   heretical Theodore by omitting some of the things which the holy
   fathers had written, by including certain confusing falsehoods of their
   own, and by quoting a letter of Cyril of blessed memory, as if all this
   were the evidence of the fathers. The passages which they quoted made
   the truth absolutely clear once the omitted sections were put back in
   their proper place. The falsehoods were quite apparent when the true
   writings were collated. In this matter those who issued these empty
   statements are those who, in the words of scripture, rely on lies, they
   make empty pleas; they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, they
   weave the spider's web.
   After we had investigated in this way Theodore and his heresy, we took
   the trouble to quote and include in our acts a few of Theodoret's
   heretical writings against true faith, against the twelve chapters of
   holy Cyril and against the first synod of Ephesus. We also included
   some of Theodoret's writings on the side of the heretical Theodore and
   Nestorius so that it would be made clear, to the satisfaction of anyone
   reading our acts, that these opinions had been properly rejected and
   anathematized.
   Thirdly, the letter which is alleged to have been written by Ibas to
   Mari the Persian was brought under scrutiny and we discovered that it
   too ought to be officially read out. When the letter was read out, its
   heretical character was immediately apparent to everyone. Until this
   time there had been some dispute as to whether the aforesaid three
   chapters ought to be condemned and anathematized. Since the supporters
   of the heretics Theodore and Nestorius were conspiring to strengthen in
   another way the case of these men and their heresy, and were alleging
   that this heretical letter, which approves and defends Theodore and
   Nestorius, had been accepted by the holy council of Chalcedon, it was
   therefore necessary for us to demonstrate that that holy synod was
   unaffected by the heresy which is present in that letter, and that
   clearly those who make such allegations are doing so not with the
   assistance of the holy council but so as to give some support to their
   own heresy by associating it with the name of Chalcedon. It was
   demonstrated in our acts that Ibas was previously accused of the same
   heresy which is contained in this letter. This accusation was levelled
   first by Proclus of holy memory, bishop of Constantinople, and
   afterwards by Theodosius of blessed memory and Flavian, the bishop
   there after Proclus, both of whom gave the task of examining the whole
   matter to Photius, bishop of Tyre, and to Eustathius, bishop of the
   city of Beirut. When Ibas was later found to be blameworthy, he was
   deposed from the episcopate. This being the state of affairs, how could
   anyone be so bold as to allege that that heretical letter was accepted
   by the holy council of Chalcedon or that the holy council of Chalcedon
   agreed with it in its entirety? So as to prevent those who misrepresent
   the holy council of Chalcedon in this way from having any further
   opportunity to do so we instructed that there should be a formal
   reading of the official pronouncements of the holy synods, namely the
   first of Ephesus and that of Chalcedon, on the subject of the letters
   of Cyril of holy memory and of Leo of blessed memory, formerly pope of
   older Rome. We gathered from these authorities that nothing which has
   been written by anyone ought to be accepted unless it has been shown
   conclusively that it is in accord with the true faith of the holy
   fathers. Therefore we broke off from our deliberations so as to
   reiterate in a formal declaration the definition of faith which was
   promulgated by the holy council of Chalcedon. We compared what was
   written in the letter with this official statement. When this
   comparison was made, it was quite apparent that the contents of the
   letter were quite contradictory to those of the definition of faith.
   The definition was in accord with the unique, permanent faith set out
   by the 318 holy fathers, and by the 150, and by those who gathered for
   the first council at Ephesus. The heretical letter, on the other hand,
   included the blasphemies of the heretical Theodore and Nestorius and
   even gave support to them and describes them as doctors, while it
   condemns the holy fathers as heretics. We make it quite clear to
   everyone that we do not intend to omit what the fathers had to say in
   the first and second investigations, which are adduced by the
   supporters of Theodore and Nestorius in support of their case. Rather
   these statements and all the others were formally read out and what
   they contained was submitted to official scrutiny, and we found that
   they had not allowed the said Ibas to be accepted until they had
   obliged him to anathematize Nestorius and his heretical doctrines which
   were affirmed in that letter. This was the view not only of the two
   bishops whose interventions some have tried to misapply but also of the
   other religious bishops of that holy council. They also acted thus in
   the case of Theodoret and insisted that he anathematize those opinions
   about which he was accused. If they would permit the acceptance of Ibas
   only if he condemned the heresy which was to be found in his letter,
   and on condition that he subscribed to a definition of faith set out by
   the council, how can an attempt be made to allege that this heretical
   letter was accepted by the same holy council? We are rightly told: What
   partnership has righteousness with iniquity? Or what fellowship has
   light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what has a
   believer in common with an unbeliever? What participation has the
   temple of God with idols?
   Now that we have given the details of what our council has achieved, we
   repeat our formal confession that we accept the four holy synods, that
   is, of Nicaea, of Constantinople, the first of Ephesus, and of
   Chalcedon. Our teaching is and has been all that they have defined
   concerning the one faith. We consider those who do not respect these
   things as foreign to the catholic church. Furthermore, we condemn and
   anathematize, along with all other heretics who have been condemned and
   anathematized by the same four holy councils and by the holy, catholic
   and apostolic church, Theodore, formerly bishop of Mopsuestia, and his
   heretical writings, and also what Theodoret heretically wrote against
   the true faith, against the twelve chapters of holy Cyril and against
   the first synod of Ephesus, and we condemn also what he wrote defending
   Theodore and Nestorius. Additionally, we anathematize the heretical
   letter which Ibas is alleged to have written to Mari the Persian. This
   letter denies that God the Word was made incarnate of the ever virgin
   Mary, the holy mother of God, and that he was made man. It also
   condemns as a heretic Cyril of holy memory, who taught the truth, and
   suggests that he held the same opinions as Apollinarius. The letter
   condemns the first synod of Ephesus for deposing Nestorius without
   proper process and investigation. It calls the twelve chapters of holy
   Cyril heretical and contrary to the orthodox faith, while it supports
   Theodore and Nestorius and their heretical teachings and writings.
   Consequently we anathematize the aforesaid three chapters, that is, the
   heretical Theodore of Mopsuestia along with his detestable writings,
   and the heretical writings of Theodoret, and the heretical letter which
   Ibas is alleged to have written. We anathematize the supporters of
   these works and those who write or have written in defence of them, or
   who are bold enough to claim that they are orthodox, or who have
   defended or tried to defend their heresy in the names of holy fathers
   or of the holy council of Chalcedon.
   These matters having been treated with thorough-going exactness, we
   bear in mind what was promised about the holy church and him who said
   that the gates of hell will not prevail against it (by these we
   understand the death-dealing tongues of heretics); we also bear in mind
   what was prophesied about the church by Hosea when he said, I shall
   betroth you to me in faithfulness and you shall know the Lord; and we
   count along with the devil, the father of lies, the uncontrolled
   tongues of heretics and their heretical writings, together with the
   heretics themselves who have persisted in their heresy even to death.
   So we declare to them: Behold all you who kindle a fire, who set brands
   alight! Walk by the light of your fire, and by the brands which you
   have kindled! Since we are under command to encourage the people with
   orthodox teaching and to speak to the heart of Jerusalem, that is the
   church of God, we very properly hurry to sow in righteousness and to
   reap the fruit of life. In doing this we are lighting for ourselves the
   lamp of knowledge from the scriptures and the teachings of the fathers.
   It has therefore seemed necessary to us to sum up in certain statements
   both our declarations of the truth and our condemnations of heretics
   and their heretical teachings.

Anathemas against the "Three Chapters"

    1. If anyone will not confess that the Father, Son and holy Spirit
       have one nature or substance, that they have one power and
       authority, that there is a consubstantial Trinity, one Deity to be
       adored in three subsistences or persons: let him be anathema. There
       is only one God and Father, from whom all things come, and one
       Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and one holy
       Spirit, in whom all things are.
    2. If anyone will not confess that the Word of God has two nativities,
       that which is before all ages from the Father, outside time and
       without a body, and secondly that nativity of these latter days
       when the Word of God came down from the heavens and was made flesh
       of holy and glorious Mary, mother of God and ever-virgin, and was
       born from her: let him be anathema.
    3. If anyone declares that the [Word] of God who works miracles is not
       identical with the Christ who suffered, or alleges that God the
       Word was with the Christ who was born of woman, or was in him in
       the way that one might be in another, but that our lord Jesus
       Christ was not one and the same, the Word of God incarnate and made
       man, and that the miracles and the sufferings which he voluntarily
       underwent in the flesh were not of the same person: let him be
       anathema.
    4. If anyone declares that it was only in respect of grace, or of
       principle of action, or of dignity or in respect of equality of
       honour, or in respect of authority, or of some relation, or of some
       affection or power that there was a unity made between the Word of
       God and the man, or if anyone alleges that it is in respect of good
       will, as if God the Word was pleased with the man, because he was
       well and properly disposed to God, as Theodore claims in his
       madness; or if anyone says that this union is only a sort of
       synonymity, as the Nestorians allege, who call the Word of God
       Jesus and Christ, and even designate the human separately by the
       names "Christ" and "Son", discussing quite obviously two different
       persons, and only pretending to speak of one person and one Christ
       when the reference is to his title, honour, dignity or adoration;
       finally if anyone does not accept the teaching of the holy fathers
       that the union occurred of the Word of God with human flesh which
       is possessed by a rational and intellectual soul, and that this
       union is by synthesis or by person, and that therefore there is
       only one person, namely the lord Jesus Christ, one member of the
       holy Trinity: let him be anathema. The notion of "union" can be
       understood in many different ways. The supporters of the wickedness
       of Apollinarius and Eutyches have asserted that the union is
       produced by a confusing of the uniting elements, as they advocate
       the disappearance of the elements that unite. Those who follow
       Theodore and Nestorius, rejoicing in the division, have brought in
       a union which is only by affection. The holy church of God,
       rejecting the wickedness of both sorts of heresy, states her belief
       in a union between the Word of God and human flesh which is by
       synthesis, that is by a union of subsistence. In the mystery of
       Christ the union of synthesis not only conserves without confusing
       the elements that come together but also allows no division.
    5. If anyone understands by the single subsistence of our lord Jesus
       Christ that it covers the meaning of many subsistences, and by this
       argument tries to introduce into the mystery of Christ two
       subsistences or two persons, and having brought in two persons then
       talks of one person only in respect of dignity, honour or
       adoration, as both Theodore and Nestorius have written in their
       madness; if anyone falsely represents the holy synod of Chalcedon,
       making out that it accepted this heretical view by its terminology
       of "one subsistence", and if he does not acknowledge that the Word
       of God is united with human flesh by subsistence, and that on
       account of this there is only one subsistence or one person, and
       that the holy synod of Chalcedon thus made a formal statement of
       belief in the single subsistence of our lord Jesus Christ: let him
       be anathema. There has been no addition of person or subsistence to
       the holy Trinity even after one of its members, God the Word,
       becoming human flesh.
    6. If anyone declares that it can be only inexactly and not truly said
       that the holy and glorious ever-virgin Mary is the mother of God,
       or says that she is so only in some relative way, considering that
       she bore a mere man and that God the Word was not made into human
       flesh in her, holding rather that the nativity of a man from her
       was referred, as they say, to God the Word as he was with the man
       who came into being; if anyone misrepresents the holy synod of
       Chalcedon, alleging that it claimed that the virgin was the mother
       of God only according to that heretical understanding which the
       blasphemous Theodore put forward; or if anyone says that she is the
       mother of a man or the Christ-bearer, that is the mother of Christ,
       suggesting that Christ is not God; and does not formally confess
       that she is properly and truly the mother of God, because he who
       before all ages was born of the Father, God the Word, has been made
       into human flesh in these latter days and has been born to her, and
       it was in this religious understanding that the holy synod of
       Chalcedon formally stated its belief that she was the mother of
       God: let him be anathema.
    7. If anyone, when speaking about the two natures, does not confess a
       belief in our one lord Jesus Christ, understood in both his
       divinity and his humanity, so as by this to signify a difference of
       natures of which an ineffable union has been made without
       confusion, in which neither the nature of the Word was changed into
       the nature of human flesh, nor was the nature of human flesh
       changed into that of the Word (each remained what it was by nature,
       even after the union, as this had been made in respect of
       subsistence); and if anyone understands the two natures in the
       mystery of Christ in the sense of a division into parts, or if he
       expresses his belief in the plural natures in the same lord Jesus
       Christ, God the Word made flesh, but does not consider the
       difference of those natures, of which he is composed, to be only in
       the onlooker's mind, a difference which is not compromised by the
       union (for he is one from both and the two exist through the one)
       but uses the plurality to suggest that each nature is possessed
       separately and has a subsistence of its own: let him be anathema.
    8. If anyone confesses a belief that a union has been made out of the
       two natures divinity and humanity, or speaks about the one nature
       of God the Word made flesh, but does not understand these things
       according to what the fathers have taught, namely that from the
       divine and human natures a union was made according to subsistence,
       and that one Christ was formed, and from these expressions tries to
       introduce one nature or substance made of the deity and human flesh
       of Christ: let him be anathema. In saying that it was in respect of
       subsistence that the only-begotten God the Word was united, we are
       not alleging that there was a confusion made of each of the natures
       into one another, but rather that each of the two remained what it
       was, and in this way we understand that the Word was united to
       human flesh. So there is only one Christ, God and man, the same
       being consubstantial with the Father in respect of his divinity,
       and also consubstantial with us in respect of our humanity. Both
       those who divide or split up the mystery of the divine dispensation
       of Christ and those who introduce into that mystery some confusion
       are equally rejected and anathematized by the church of God.
    9. If anyone says that Christ is to be worshipped in his two natures,
       and by that wishes to introduce two adorations, a separate one for
       God the Word and another for the man; or if anyone, so as to remove
       the human flesh or to mix up the divinity and the humanity,
       monstrously invents one nature or substance brought together from
       the two, and so worships Christ, but not by a single adoration God
       the Word in human flesh along with his human flesh, as has been the
       tradition of the church from the beginning: let him be anathema.
   10. If anyone does not confess his belief that our lord Jesus Christ,
       who was crucified in his human flesh, is truly God and the Lord of
       glory and one of the members of the holy Trinity: let him be
       anathema.
   11. If anyone does not anathematize Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius,
       Apollinarius Nestorius, Eutyches and Origen, as well as their
       heretical books, and also all other heretics who have already been
       condemned and anathematized by the holy, catholic and apostolic
       church and by the four holy synods which have already been
       mentioned, and also all those who have thought or now think in the
       same way as the aforesaid heretics and who persist in their error
       even to death: let him be anathema.
   12. If anyone defends the heretical Theodore of Mopsuestia, who said
       that God the Word is one, while quite another is Christ, who was
       troubled by the passions of the soul and the desires of human
       flesh, was gradually separated from that which is inferior, and
       became better by his progress in good works, and could not be
       faulted in his way of life, and as a mere man was baptized in the
       name of the Father and the Son and the holy Spirit, and through
       this baptism received the grace of the holy Spirit and came to
       deserve sonship and to be adored, in the way that one adores a
       statue of the emperor, as if he were God the Word, and that he
       became after his resurrection immutable in his thoughts and
       entirely without sin. Furthermore this heretical Theodore claimed
       that the union of God the Word to Christ is rather like that which,
       according to the teaching of the Apostle, is between a man and his
       wife: The two shall become one. Among innumerable other blasphemies
       he dared to allege that, when after his resurrection the Lord
       breathed on his disciples and said, Receive the holy Spirit, he was
       not truly giving them the holy Spirit, but he breathed on them only
       as a sign. Similarly he claimed that Thomas's profession of faith
       made when, after his resurrection, he touched the hands and side of
       the Lord, namely My Lord and my God, was not said about Christ, but
       that Thomas was in this way extolling God for raising up Christ and
       expressing his astonishment at the miracle of the resurrection.
       This Theodore makes a comparison which is even worse than this
       when, writing about the acts of the Apostles, he says that Christ
       was like Plato, Manichaeus, Epicurus and Marcion, alleging that
       just as each of these men arrived at his own teaching and then had
       his disciples called after him Platonists, Manichaeans, Epicureans
       and Marcionites, so Christ found his teaching and then had
       disciples who were called Christians. If anyone offers a defence
       for this more heretical Theodore, and his heretical books in which
       he throws up the aforesaid blasphemies and many other additional
       blasphemies against our great God and saviour Jesus Christ, and if
       anyone fails to anathematize him and his heretical books as well as
       all those who offer acceptance or defence to him, or who allege
       that his interpretation is correct, or who write on his behalf or
       on that of his heretical teachings, or who are or have been of the
       same way of thinking and persist until death in this error: let him
       be anathema.
   13. If anyone defends the heretical writings of Theodoret which were
       composed against the true faith, against the first holy synod of
       Ephesus and against holy Cyril and his Twelve Chapters, and also
       defends what Theodoret wrote to support the heretical Theodore and
       Nestorius and others who think in the same way as the aforesaid
       Theodore and Nestorius and accept them or their heresy and if
       anyone, because of them, shall accuse of being heretical the
       doctors of the church who have stated their belief in the union
       according to subsistence of God the Word; and if anyone does not
       anathematize these heretical books and those who have thought or
       now think in this way, and all those who have written against the
       true faith or against holy Cyril and his twelve chapters, and who
       persist in such heresy until they die: let him be anathema.
   14. If anyone defends the letter which Ibas is said to have written to
       Mari the Persian, which denies that God the Word, who became
       incarnate of Mary the holy mother of God and ever virgin, became
       man, but alleges that he was only a man born to her, whom it
       describes as a temple, as if God the Word was one and the man
       someone quite different; which condemns holy Cyril as if he were a
       heretic, when he gives the true teaching of Christians, and accuses
       holy Cyril of writing opinions like those of the heretical
       Apollinarius ;which rebukes the first holy synod of Ephesus,
       alleging that it condemned Nestorius without going into the matter
       by a formal examination; which claims that the twelve chapters of
       holy Cyril are heretical and opposed to the true faith; and which
       defends Theodore and Nestorius and their heretical teachings and
       books. If anyone defends the said letter and does not anathematize
       it and all those who offer a defence for it and allege that it or a
       part of it is correct, or if anyone defends those who have written
       or shall write in support of it or the heresies contained in it, or
       supports those who are bold enough to defend it or its heresies in
       the name of the holy fathers of the holy synod of Chalcedon, and
       persists in these errors until his death: let him be anathema.

   Such then are the assertions we confess. We have received them from
    1. holy Scripture, from
    2. the teaching of the holy fathers, and from
    3. the definitions about the one and the same faith made by the
       aforesaid four holy synods.

   Moreover, condemnation has been passed by us against the heretics and
   their impiety, and also against those who have justified or shall
   justify the so-called "Three Chapters", and against those who have
   persisted or will persist in their own error. If anyone should attempt
   to hand on, or to teach by word or writing, anything contrary to what
   we have regulated, then if he is a bishop or somebody appointed to the
   clergy, in so far as he is acting contrary to what befits priests and
   the ecclesiastical status, let him be stripped of the rank of priest or
   cleric, and if he is a monk or lay person, let him be anathema.
