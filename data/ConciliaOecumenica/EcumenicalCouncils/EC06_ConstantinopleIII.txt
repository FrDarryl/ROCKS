The Third General Council of Constantinople, 680-81

INTRODUCTION

   To make an end of the Monothelite controversy, Emperor Constantine IV
   asked Pope Donus in 678 to send twelve bishops and four western Greek
   monastic superiors to represent the pope at an assembly of eastern and
   western theologians. Pope Agatho, who meanwhile had succeeded Donus,
   ordered consultation in the west on this important matter. Around
   Easter 680 a synod in Rome of 125 Italian bishops, with Pope Agatho
   presiding, assessed the replies of the regional synods of the west and
   composed a profession of faith in which Monothelitism was condemned.
   Legates of the pope took this profession to Constantinople, arriving at
   the beginning of September 680.
   On 10 September 680 the emperor issued an edict to Patriarch George of
   Constantinople, ordering a council of bishops to be convoked. The
   council assembled on 7 November in the hall of the imperial palace in
   Constantinople. It immediately called itself an ecumenical council.
   There were 18 sessions, at the first eleven of which the emperor
   presided.
   In the 8th session, on 7 March 681, the council adopted the teaching of
   Pope Agatho in condemnation of Monothelitism. Patriarch Macarius of
   Antioch was one of the few who refused his assent; he was deposed in
   the 12th session.
   The doctrinal conclusions of the council were defined in the 17th
   session and promulgated in the 18th and last session on 16 September
   681. The acts of the council, signed both by 174 fathers and finally by
   the emperor himself, were sent to Pope Leo II, who had succeeded
   Agatho, and he, when he had approved them, ordered them to be
   translated into Latin and to be signed by all the bishops of the west.
   Constantine IV, however, promulgated the decrees of the council in all
   parts of the empire by imperial edict. The council did not debate
   church discipline and did not establish any disciplinary cannons.

Exposition of faith

   The only Son and Word of God the Father, who became a man like us in
   all things but sin, Christ our true God, proclaimed clearly in the
   words of the gospel; I am the light of the world; anyone who follows me
   shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life, and again,
   My peace I leave to you, my peace I give you. Our most mild emperor,
   champion of right belief and adversary of wrong belief, guided in godly
   wisdom by this teaching of peace spoken by God, has brought together
   this holy and universal assembly of ours and set at one the whole
   judgment of the church.
   Wherefore this holy and universal synod of ours, driving afar the error
   of impiety which endured for some time even till the present, following
   without deviation in a straight path after the holy and accepted
   fathers, has piously accorded in all things with the five holy and
   universal synods: that is to say, with
    1. the synod of 318 holy fathers who gathered at Nicaea against the
       madman Arius, and
    2. that which followed it at Constantinople of 150 God-led men against
       Macedonius, opponent of the Spirit, and the impious Apollinarius;
       similarly too, with
    3. the first at Ephesus of 200 godly men brought together against
       Nestorius, who thought as the Jews and
    4. that at Chalcedon of 630 God-inspired fathers against Eutyches and
       Dioscorus, hateful to God; also, in addition to these, with
    5. the fifth holy synod, the latest of them, which was gathered here
       against Theodore of Mopsuestia, Origen, Didymus and Evagrius, and
       the writings of Theodoret against the twelve chapters of the
       renowned Cyril, and the letter said to have been written by Ibas to
       Mari the Persian.

   Reaffirming the divine tenets of piety in all respects unaltered, and
   banishing the profane teachings of impiety, this holy and universal
   synod of ours has also, in its turn, under God's inspiration, set its
   seal on the creed which was made out by the 318 fathers and confirmed
   again with godly prudence by the 150 and which the other holy synods
   too accepted gladly and ratified for the elimination of all
   soul-corrupting heresy
   We believe in one God ...[Creed of Nicaea and of Constantinople 1]
   The holy and universal synod said:
   This pious and orthodox creed of the divine favour was enough for a
   complete knowledge of the orthodox faith and a complete assurance
   therein. But since from the first, the contriver of evil did not rest,
   finding an accomplice in the serpent and through him bringing upon
   human nature the poisoned dart of death, so too now he has found
   instruments suited to his own purpose--namely Theodore, who was bishop
   of Pharan, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were bishops of this
   imperial city, and further Honorius, who was pope of elder Rome, Cyrus,
   who held the see of Alexandria, and Macarius, who was recently bishop
   of Antioch, and his disciple Stephen -- and has not been idle in
   raising through them obstacles of error against the full body of the
   church sowing with novel speech among the orthodox people the heresy of
   a single will and a single principle of action in the two natures of
   the one member of the holy Trinity Christ our true God, a heresy in
   harmony with the evil belief, ruinous to the mind, of the impious
   Apollinarius, Severus and Themistius, and one intent on removing the
   perfection of the becoming man of the same one lord Jesus Christ our
   God, through a certain guileful device, leading from there to the
   blasphemous conclusion that his rationally animate flesh is without a
   will and a principle of action.
   Therefore Christ our God has stirred up the faithful emperor, the new
   David, finding in him a man after his own heart, who, as the scripture
   says, did not allow his eyes sleep or his eyelids drowsing until
   through this holy assembly of ours, brought together by God, he found
   the perfect proclamation of right belief; for according to the
   God-spoken saying, Where there are two or three gathered in my name,
   there am I in their midst.
   This same holy and universal synod, here present, faithfully accepts
   and welcomes with open hands the report of Agatho, most holy and most
   blessed pope of elder Rome, that came to our most reverend and most
   faithful emperor Constantine, which rejected by name those who
   proclaimed and taught, as has been already explained, one will and one
   principle of action in the incarnate dispensation of Christ our true
   God; and likewise it approves as well the other synodal report to his
   God-taught serenity, from the synod of 125 bishops dear to God meeting
   under the same most holy pope, as according with the holy synod at
   Chalcedon and with the Tome of the all-holy and most blessed Leo, pope
   of the same elder Rome, which was sent to Flavian, who is among the
   saints, and which that synod called a pillar of right belief, and
   furthermore with the synodal letters written by the blessed Cyril
   against the impious Nestorius and to the bishops of the east.
   Following the five holy and universal synods and the holy and accepted
   fathers, and defining in unison, it professes our lord Jesus Christ our
   true God, one of the holy Trinity, which is of one same being and is
   the source of life, to be perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity,
   the same truly God and truly man, of a rational soul and a body;
   consubstantial with the Father as regards his divinity, and the same
   consubstantial with us as regards his humanity, like us in all respects
   except for sin; begotten before the ages from the Father as regards his
   divinity, and in the last days the same for us and for our salvation
   from the holy Spirit and the virgin Mary, who is properly and truly
   called mother of God, as regards his humanity; one and the same Christ,
   Son, Lord, only-begotten, acknowledged in two natures which undergo no
   confusion, no change, no separation, no division; at no point was the
   difference between the natures taken away through the union, but rather
   the property of both natures is preserved and comes together into a
   single subsistent being [in unam personam et in unam subsistentiam
   concurrente]; he is not parted or divided into two persons, but is one
   and the same only-begotten Son, Word of God, lord Jesus Christ, just as
   the prophets taught from the beginning about him, and as Jesus the
   Christ himself instructed us, and as the creed of the holy fathers
   handed it down to us.
   And we proclaim equally two natural volitions or wills in him and two
   natural principles of action which undergo no division, no change, no
   partition, no confusion, in accordance with the teaching of the holy
   fathers. And the two natural wills not in opposition, as the impious
   heretics said, far from it, but his human will following, and not
   resisting or struggling, rather in fact subject to his divine and all
   powerful will. For the will of the flesh had to be moved, and yet to be
   subjected to the divine will, according to the most wise Athanasius.
   For just as his flesh is said to be and is flesh of the Word of God, so
   too the natural will of his flesh is said to and does belong to the
   Word of God, just as he says himself: I have come down from heaven, not
   to do my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me, calling his
   own will that of his flesh, since his flesh too became his own. For in
   the same way that his all holy and blameless animate flesh was not
   destroyed in being made divine but remained in its own limit and
   category, so his human will as well was not destroyed by being made
   divine, but rather was preserved, according to the theologian Gregory,
   who says: "For his willing, when he is considered as saviour, is not in
   opposition to God, being made divine in its entirety." And we hold
   there to be two natural principles of action in the same Jesus Christ
   our lord and true God, which undergo no division, no change, no
   partition, no confusion, that is, a divine principle of action and a
   human principle of action, according to the godly-speaking Leo, who
   says most clearly: "For each form does in a communion with the other
   that activity which it possesses as its own, the Word working that
   which is the Word's and the body accomplishing the things that are the
   body's". For of course we will not grant the existence of only a single
   natural principle of action of both God and creature, lest we raise
   what is made to the level of divine being, or indeed reduce what is
   most specifically proper to the divine nature to a level befitting
   creatures for we acknowledge that the miracles and the sufferings are
   of one and the same according to one or the other of the two natures
   out of which he is and in which he has his being, as the admirable
   Cyril said. Therefore, protecting on all sides the "no confusion" and
   "no division", we announce the whole in these brief words: Believing
   our lord Jesus Christ, even after his incarnation, to be one of the
   holy Trinity and our true God, we say that he has two natures [naturas]
   shining forth in his one subsistence[subsistentia] in which he
   demonstrated the miracles and the sufferings throughout his entire
   providential dwelling here, not in appearance but in truth, the
   difference of the natures being made known in the same one subsistence
   in that each nature wills and performs the things that are proper to it
   in a communion with the other; then in accord with this reasoning we
   hold that two natural wills and principles of action meet in
   correspondence for the salvation of the human race.
   So now that these points have been formulated by us with all precision
   in every respect and with all care, we definitely state that it is not
   allowable for anyone to produce another faith, that is, to write or to
   compose or to consider or to teach others; those who dare to compose
   another faith, or to support or to teach or to hand on another creed to
   those who wish to turn to knowledge of the truth, whether from
   Hellenism or Judaism or indeed from any heresy whatsoever, or to
   introduce novelty of speech, that is, invention of terms, so as to
   overturn what has now been defined by us, such persons, if they are
   bishops or clerics, are deprived of their episcopacy or clerical rank,
   and if they are monks or layfolk they are excommunicated.
