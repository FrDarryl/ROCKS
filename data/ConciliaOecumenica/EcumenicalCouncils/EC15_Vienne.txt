The General Council of Vienne, 1311-12

INTRODUCTION

   The general council of Vienne was summoned by pope Clement V with the
   bull Regnans in caelis, which he had written on 12 August 1308 at
   Poitiers (the Roman pontiff had remained in France from the year of his
   election, thus beginning the period of the church's history known as
   the Avignon captivity). The pope was subject to forceful pressure from
   the European states, particularly from France. Philip IV of France, the
   king who had opposed Boniface VIII so bitterly, had so much power over
   Clement V that he seems to have been able to change the whole state of
   ecclesiastical affairs at will. The council of Vienne is seen as an
   outstanding example of this political pressure, although the pope
   energetically defended the liberty of the church as far as
   circumstances allowed and he himself had the power. The council had
   been summoned for 1 October 1310 at Vienne. This city did not belong to
   the kingdom of France, though Philip IV in 1310 had occupied nearby
   Lyons by force. There were no general summonses and only 231
   ecclesiastics were invited; the others however could employ a
   procurator .

   The complaint against the Templars seems to have been the first and
   greatest concern of the council. Thus the bull convoking the council
   was written at the same time as Clement V summoned the Templar order to
   a canonical enquiry. Through the whole of Europe cases were heard
   concerning the order and individual Templars. This work had not been
   completed by 1310 and so the pope deferred the opening of the council
   to 1 October 1311. Events had moved, however, in such a way that the
   Templars' condemnation and Philip's victory seemed very probable. This
   placed the authority and freedom of the council under severe
   constraint.

   The council began at Vienne on the 16 October 1311 in the presence of
   20 cardinals, 4 patriarchs, about 100 archbishops and bishops, and a
   number of abbots and priors. From the sermon given in the first session
   by Clement V, three questions were seen as of greatest importance: the
   case of the Templars, the business of the holy Land, and the reform of
   the church. Clement-himself gave an account of the allegations which
   had been made against the Templar order. The work of the council was
   carried on outside the full assembly, that is to say, through a
   consistory of cardinals together with the pope, and through a committee
   which was elected by the council fathers from their own body and which
   seems to have acted in place of the whole council, the full assembly
   merely confirmed the decrees and bulls, promulgating them in the second
   and third sessions. A commission of cardinals was appointed in order to
   probe the grievances and advice put forward by the bishops and other
   fathers on the subject of church reform.

   The council fathers gave long and careful consideration to the case of
   the Templars. It is likely that they preferred the order to be allowed
   to defend itself against the accusations than to condemn it too easily
   and without sure proof. However, "all the difficult questions which
   were considered in the council seemed to be left doubtful or unsettled,
   or else to be treated". So when the case was still unresolved in
   January 1312, the fathers devoted themselves to the business of the
   holy Land and to decrees which seemed timely for the reform of
   ecclesiastical morals. Regarding the former, the delegates of the king
   of Aragon thought the city of Granada should first be attacked and
   occupied in order that the enemy might be enfeebled by a threat to each
   flank. Other fathers and ambassadors favoured an expedition to the east
   only. As far as we know, however, after an agreement by kings and
   princes that a crusade to the holy Land was opportune and necessary,
   and the imposition of a tithe on all ecclesiastical provinces, no
   decision was taken.

   Meanwhile in March 1312 Philip IV held a general assembly of his
   kingdom in Lyons, his object being to disturb and steamroller the minds
   of the council fathers and of the pope himself. Secret bargains had
   been made between Clement V and the envoys of Philip IV from 17 to 29
   February 1312; the council fathers were not consulted. By this
   bargaining Philip obtained the condemnation of the Templars. It is most
   likely he used the threat that he would bring a public action against
   Boniface VIII. The king of France made for Vienne on 20 March, and
   after two days Clement V delivered to the commission of cardinals for
   approval the bull by which the order of Templars was suppressed (the
   bull Vox in excelso). In the second session of the council, which took
   place on 3 April 1312, this bull was approved and the pope announced a
   future crusade. The Templars' property, of immense value, was entrusted
   to other persons by the bulls Ad providam of 2 May and Nuper in
   concilio of 16 May. The fate of the Templars themselves was decided by
   the bull Considerantes of 6 May. In the bulls Licet dudum (18 Dec.
   1312), Dudum in generali concilio (31 Dec. 1312) and Licet pridem (13
   Jan. 1313) Clement V gave further treatment to the question of the
   Templars' property.

   In the third session of the council, which was held on 6 May 1312,
   certain constitutions were promulgated. We do not know their text or
   number. In Mueller's opinion, what happened was this: the
   constitutions, with the exception of a certain number still to be
   polished in form and text, were read by the council fathers; Clement V
   then ordered the constitutions to be corrected and arranged after the
   pattern of decretal collections. This text, although read in the
   consistory held in the castle of Monteux near Carpentras on 21 March
   1314 was not promulgated, since Clement V died a month later. It was
   pope John XXII who, after again correcting the constitutions, finally
   sent them to the universities. It is difficult to decide which
   constitutions are the work of the council. We adopt Mueller's opinion
   that 38 constitutions may be counted as such, but only 20 of these have
   the words "with the approval of the sacred council". The texts that we
   publish are taken from Hefele's edition (see above p. 334, n. 17) for
   the bull Vox in excelso, and from the edition of the Vatican register
   (= Regestum) for the other bulls; for the text of the constitutions, we
   have used Friedberg's edition of Corpus Iuris Canonici (= Fr).

   [Bulls and ordinances of the Roman curia concerning the order of the
   Templars and the business of the holy Land]

   [1]. Clement, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an
   everlasting record. A voice was heard from on high, of lamentation and
   bitter weeping, for the time is coming, indeed has come, when the Lord
   shall complain through his prophet: This house has aroused my anger and
   wrath, so that I will remove it from my sight because of the evil of
   its sons, for they have provoked me to anger turning their backs to me,
   not their faces, and setting up their idols in the house in which my
   name is invoked, to defile it. They have built the high places of Baal
   in order to consecrate their sons to idols and demons. They have sinned
   deeply as in the days of Gibeah. When I learnt of such deeds of horror,
   at the dread of such notorious scandal- for who ever heard of such
   infamy? who ever saw the like?- I fell down at hearing it, I was
   dismayed at seeing it, my heart grew embittered and darkness
   overwhelmed me. Hark, a voice of the people from the city! a voice from
   the temple! the voice of the Lord rendering recompense to his enemies.
   The prophet is compelled to exclaim: Give them, Lord, a barren womb and
   dry breasts. Their worthlessness has been revealed because of their
   malice. Throw them out of your house, and let their roots dry up; let
   them not bear fruit, and let not this house be any more a stumbling
   block of bitterness or a thorn to hurt.

   Not slight is the fornication of this house, immolating its sons,
   giving them up and consecrating them to demons and not to God, to gods
   whom they did not know. Therefore this house will be desolate and in
   disgrace, cursed and uninhabited, thrown into confusion and levelled to
   the dust, lowly, forsaken, inaccessible, spurned by the anger of the
   Lord, whom it has despised; let it not be lived in but reduced to a
   wilderness. Let everyone be astonished at it and hiss at all its
   wounds. For the Lord did not choose the people on account of the place,
   but the place on account of the people. Therefore the very place of the
   temple was made to share in the punishment of the people, as the Lord
   proclaimed openly to Solomon when he built the temple for him, to
   Solomon who was filled with wisdom like a river: But if your sons turn
   aside from me, not following and honouring me but going instead after
   strange gods and worshipping them, then I will cut them off from before
   me and expel them from the land which I have given to them; and the
   temple which I have consecrated to my name I will cast out of my sight,
   and it will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. Everyone
   passing by it will be astonished and shall hiss, and shall say, "Why
   has the Lord done thus to this temple and to this house?" And they will
   say : "Because they forsook the Lord their God who bought and redeemed
   them, and followed instead Baal and other gods, worshipping and serving
   them. Therefore the Lord has brought all this evil upon them'".

   Indeed a little while ago, about the time of our election as supreme
   pontiff before we came to Lyons for our coronation, and afterwards,
   both there and elsewhere, we received secret intimations against the
   master, preceptors and other brothers of the order of Knights Templar
   of Jerusalem and also against the order itself. These men had been
   posted in lands overseas for the defence of the patrimony of our lord
   Jesus Christ, and as special warriors of the catholic faith and
   outstanding defenders of the holy Land seemed to carry the chief burden
   of the said holy Land. For this reason the holy Roman church honoured
   these brothers and the order with her special support, armed them with
   the sign of the cross against Christ's enemies, paid them the highest
   tributes of her respect, and strengthened them with various exemptions
   and privileges; and they experienced in many and various ways her help
   and that of all faithful Christians with repeated gifts of property.
   Therefore it was against the lord Jesus Christ himself that they fell
   into the sin of impious apostasy, the abominable vice of idolatry, the
   deadly crime of the Sodomites, and various heresies. Yet it was not to
   be expected nor seemed credible that men so devout, who were
   outstanding often to the shedding of their blood for Christ and were
   seen repeatedly to expose their persons to the danger of death, who
   even more frequently gave great signs of their devotion both in divine
   worship and in fasting and other observances, should be so unmindful of
   their salvation as to commit such crimes. The order, moreover, had a
   good and holy beginning; it won the approval of the apostolic see. The
   rule, which is holy, reasonable and just, had the deserved sanction of
   this see. For all these reasons we were unwilling to lend our ears to
   insinuation and accusation against the Templars; we had been taught by
   our Lord's example and the words of canonical scripture.

   Then came the intervention of our dear son in Christ, Philip, the
   illustrious king of France. The same crimes had been reported to him.
   He was not moved by greed. He had no intention of claiming or
   appropriating for himself anything from the Templars' property; rather,
   in his own kingdom he abandoned such claim and thereafter released
   entirely his hold on their goods. He was on fire with zeal for the
   orthodox faith, following in the well marked footsteps of his
   ancestors. He obtained as much information as he lawfully could. Then,
   in order to give us greater light on the subject, he sent us much
   valuable information through his envoys and letters. The scandal
   against the Templars themselves and their order in reference to the
   crimes already mentioned increased. There was even one of the knights,
   a man of noble blood and of no small reputation in the order, who
   testified secretly under oath in our presence, that at his reception
   the knight who received him suggested that he deny Christ, which he
   did, in the presence of certain other knights of the Temple, he
   furthermore spat on the cross held out to him by this knight who
   received him. He also said that he had seen the grand master, who is
   still alive, receive a certain knight in a chapter of the order held
   overseas. The reception took place in the same way, namely with the
   denial of Christ and the spitting on the cross, with quite two hundred
   brothers of the order being present. The witness also affirmed that he
   heard it said that this was the customary manner of receiving new
   members: at the suggestion of the person receiving the profession or
   his delegate, the person making profession denied Jesus Christ, and in
   abuse of Christ crucified spat upon the cross held out to him, and the
   two committed other unlawful acts contrary to Christian morality, as
   the witness himself then confessed in our presence.

   We were duty-bound by our office to pay heed to the din of such grave
   and repeated accusations. When at last there came a general hue and cry
   with the clamorous denunciations of the said king and of the dukes,
   counts, barons, other nobles, clergy and people of the kingdom of
   France, reaching us both directly and through agents and officials, we
   heard a doleful tale: that the master, preceptors and other brothers of
   the order as well as the order itself had been involved in these and
   other crimes. This seemed to be proved by many confessions,
   attestations and depositions of the master, of the visitor of France,
   and of many preceptors and brothers of the order, in the presence of
   many prelates and the inquisitor of heresy. These depositions were made
   in the kingdom of France with our authorisation, edited as public
   documents and shown to us and our brothers. Besides, the rumour and
   clamour had grown to such insistence that the hostility against both
   the order itself and the individual members of it could not be ignored
   without grave scandal nor be tolerated without imminent danger to the
   faith. Since we though unworthy, represent Christ on earth, we
   considered that we ought, following in his footsteps, to hold an
   inquiry. We called to our presence many of the preceptors, priests,
   knights and other brothers of the order who were of no small
   reputation. They took an oath, they were adjured urgently by the
   Father, Son and holy Spirit; we demanded, in virtue of holy obedience,
   invoking the divine judgment with the menace of an eternal malediction,
   that they tell the pure and simple truth. We pointed out that they were
   now in a safe and suitable place where they had nothing to fear in
   spite of the confessions they had made before others. We wished those
   confessions to be without prejudice to them. In this way we made our
   interrogation and examined as many as seventy-two, many of our brothers
   being present and following the proceedings attentively. We had the
   confessions taken down by notary and recorded as authentic documents in
   our presence and that of our brothers. After some days we had these
   confessions read in consistory in the presence of the knights
   concerned. Each was read a version in his own language; they stood by
   their confessions, expressly and spontaneously approving them as they
   had been read out.

   After this, intending to make a personal inquiry with the grand master,
   the visitor of France and the principal preceptors of the order, we
   commanded that the grand master, the visitor of France and the chief
   preceptors of Outremer, Normandy, Aquitaine and Poitou be presented to
   us while we were at Poitiers. Some of them, however, were ill at the
   time and could not ride a horse nor conveniently be brought to our
   presence. We wished to know the truth of the whole matter and whether
   their confessions and depositions, which were said to have been made in
   the presence of the inquisitor of heresy in the kingdom of France and
   witnessed by certain public notaries and many other good men, and which
   were produced in public and shown to us and our brothers by the
   inquisitor, were true. We empowered and commanded our beloved sons
   Berengar, cardinal, then with the title of Nereus and Achilleus, now
   bishop of Frascati, and Stephen, cardinal priest with the title of
   saint Cyriacus at the Baths, and Landulf, cardinal deacon with the
   title of saint Angelo, in whose prudence, experience and loyalty we
   have the fullest confidence, to make a careful investigation with the
   grand master, visitor and preceptors, concerning the truth of the
   accusations against them and individual persons of the order and
   against the order itself. If there was evidence, it was to be brought
   to us; the confessions and depositions were to be taken down in writing
   by a public notary and presented to us. The cardinals were to grant
   absolution from the sentence of excommunication, according to the form
   of the church, to the master, visitor and preceptors- a sentence
   incurred if the accusations were true- provided the accused humbly and
   devoutly requested absolution, as they ought to do.

   The cardinals went to see the grand master, the visitor and the
   preceptors personally and explained the reason for their visit. Since
   these men and other Templars resident in the kingdom of France had been
   handed over to us because they would freely and without fear of anyone
   reveal the truth sincerely to the cardinals, the cardinals by our
   apostolic authority enjoined on them this duty of telling the truth.
   The master, the visitor and the preceptors of Normandy, Outremer,
   Aquitaine and Poitou, in the presence of the three cardinals, four
   notaries and many other men of good repute, took an oath on the holy
   gospels that they would tell the truth, plainly and fully. They deposed
   one by one, in the cardinals' presence, freely and spontaneously,
   without any compulsion or fear. They confessed among other things that
   they had denied Christ and spat upon the cross at their reception into
   the order of the Temple. Some of them added that they themselves had
   received many brothers using the same rite, namely with the denial of
   Christ and the spitting on the cross. There were even some who
   confessed certain other horrible crimes and immoral deeds, we say
   nothing more of these at present. The knights confessed also that the
   content of their confessions and depositions made a little while ago
   before the inquisitor was true. These confessions and depositions of
   the grand master, visitor and preceptors were edited as a public
   document by four notaries, the master and the others being present and
   also certain men of good repute. After some days, the confessions were
   read to the accused on the orders and in the presence of the cardinals;
   each knight received an account in his own language. They persisted in
   their confessions and approved them, expressly and spontaneously, as
   they had been read out to them. After these confessions and
   depositions, they asked from the cardinals absolution from the
   excommunication incurred by the above crimes; humbly and devoutly, on
   bended knee, with hands joined, they made their petition with many
   tears. Since the church never shuts her heart to the sinner who
   returns, the cardinals granted absolution by our authority in the
   customary form of the church to the master, visitor and preceptors on
   abjuration of their heresy. On their return to our presence, the
   cardinals presented to us the confessions and depositions of the
   master, visitor and preceptors in the form of a public document, as has
   been said. They also gave us a report on their dealings with these
   knights.

   From these confessions, depositions and report we find that the master,
   the visitor and the preceptors of Outremer, Normandy, Aquitaine and
   Poitou have often committed grave offences, although some have erred
   less frequently than others. We considered that such dreadful crimes
   could not and should not go unpunished without insult to almighty God
   and to every Catholic. We decided on the advice of our brothers to hold
   an enquiry into the above crimes and transgressions. This would be
   carried out through the local ordinaries and other wise, trustworthy
   men delegated by us in the case of individual members of the order; and
   through certain prudent persons of our considered choice in the case of
   the order as a whole. After this, investigations were made both by the
   ordinaries and by our delegates into the allegations against individual
   members, and by the inquisitors appointed by us into those against the
   order itself, in every part of the world where the brothers of the
   order have usually lived. Once made and sent to us for examination,
   these investigations were very carefully read and examined, some by us
   and our brothers, cardinals of the holy Roman church others by many
   very learned, prudent, trustworthy and God-fearing men, zealous for and
   well-trained in the catholic faith, some being prelates and others not.
   This took place at Malaucene in the diocese of Vaison.

   Later we came to Vienne where there were assembled already very many
   patriarchs, archbishops, selected bishops, exempt and non-exempt
   abbots, other prelates of churches, and procurators of absent prelates
   and of chapters, all present for the council we had summoned. In the
   first session we explained to them our reasons for calling the council.
   After this, because it was difficult indeed almost impossible, for the
   cardinals and all the prelates and procurators gathered for the council
   to meet in our presence in order to discuss how to proceed in the
   matter of the Templars, we gave orders as follows. Certain patriarchs,
   archbishops, bishops, exempt and non-exempt abbots, other prelates of
   churches, and procurators from all parts of Christendom, of every
   language nation and region, were concordantly chosen out of all the
   prelates and procurators at the council. The choice was made from those
   believed to be among the more skilful, discreet and apt for
   consultation on such an important affair and for discussing it with us
   and the above-mentioned cardinals. After this we had the attestations
   received during the inquiry read publicly in the presence of the
   prelates and procurators. This reading went on during several days, for
   as long as they wished to listen, in the place assigned for the
   council, namely the cathedral church. Afterwards the said attestations
   and the summaries made from them were considered and examined, not in a
   perfunctory manner but with great care, by many of our venerable
   brethren, by the patriarch of Aquileia, by archbishops and bishops of
   the present sacred council who were specially chosen and delegated for
   the purpose, and by those whom the whole council had chosen very
   carefully and earnestly.

   We convoked therefore the said cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops and
   bishops, the exempt and non-exempt abbots, and the other prelates and
   procurators elected by the council to consider this affair, and we
   asked them, in the course of a secret consultation in our presence, how
   we should proceed, taking special account of the fact that certain
   Templars were presenting themselves in defence of their order. The
   greater part of the cardinals and nearly the whole council, that is
   those who were elected by the whole council and were representing the
   whole council on this question, in short the great majority, indeed
   four-fifths among every nation taking part, were firmly convinced, and
   the said prelates and procurators advised accordingly, that the order
   should be given an opportunity to defend itself and that it could not
   be condemned, on the basis of the proof provided thus far, for the
   heresies that had been the subject of the inquiry, without offence to
   God and injustice. Certain others on the contrary said that the
   brothers should not be allowed to make a defence of their order and
   that we should not give permission for such a defence, for if a defence
   were allowed or given there would be danger to a settlement of the
   affair and no small prejudice to the interests of the holy Land. There
   would be dispute, delay and putting off a decision, many different
   reasons were mentioned. Indeed although legal process against the order
   up to now does not permit its canonical condemnation as heretical by
   definitive sentence, the good name of the order has been largely taken
   away by the heresies attributed to it. Moreover, an almost indefinite
   number of individual members, among whom are the grand master the
   visitor of France and the chief preceptors, have been convicted of such
   heresies, errors and crimes through their spontaneous confessions.
   These confessions render the order very suspect, and the infamy and
   suspicion render it detestable to the holy church of God, to her
   prelates, to kings and other rulers, and to Catholics in general. It is
   also believed in all probability that from now on there will be found
   no good person who wishes to enter the order, and so it will be made
   useless to the church of God and the carrying on of the undertaking to
   the holy Land, for which service the knights had been destined.
   Furthermore, the putting off of a settlement or arrangement of this
   affair of the Templars, for which we had set ourselves a final decision
   or sentence to be promulgated in the present council, would lead in all
   probability to the total loss, destruction and dilapidation of the
   Templars' property. This has for long been given, bequeathed and
   granted by the faithful for the aid of the holy Land and to oppose the
   enemies of the Christian faith.

   There were therefore two opinions: some said that sentence should
   immediately be pronounced, condemning the order for the alleged crimes,
   and others objected that from the proceedings taken up to now the
   sentence of condemnation against the order could not justly be passed.
   After long and mature deliberation, having in mind God alone and the
   good of the holy Land without turning aside to right or to left, we
   elected to proceed by way of provision and ordinance, in this way
   scandal will be removed, perils avoided and property saved for the help
   of the holy Land. We have taken into account the disgrace, suspicion,
   vociferous reports and other attacks mentioned above against the order,
   also the secret reception into the order, and the divergence of many of
   the brothers from the general behaviour, way of life and morals of
   other Christians. We have noted here especially that when new members
   are received, they are made to swear not to reveal the manner of their
   reception to anyone and not to leave the order; this creates an
   unfavourable presumption. We observe in addition that the above have
   given rise to grave scandal against the order, scandal impossible to
   allay as long as the order continues to exist. We note also the danger
   to faith and to souls, the many horrible misdeeds of so many brothers
   of the order, and many other just reasons and causes, moving us to the
   following decision.

   The majority of the cardinals and of those elected by the council, a
   proportion of more than four-fifths, have thought it better, more
   expedient and advantageous for God's honour and for the preservation of
   the Christian faith, also for the aid of the holy Land and many other
   valid reasons, to suppress the order by way of ordinance and provision
   of the apostolic see, assigning the property to the use for which it
   was intended. Provision is also to be made for the members of the order
   who are still alive. This way has been found preferable to that of
   safeguarding the right of defence with the consequent postponement of
   judgment on the order. We observe also that in other cases the Roman
   church has suppressed other important orders for reasons of far less
   gravity than those mentioned above, with no fault on the part of the
   brethren. Therefore, with a sad heart, not by definitive sentence, but
   by apostolic provision or ordinance, we suppress, with the approval of
   the sacred council, the order of Templars, and its rule, habit and
   name, by an inviolable and perpetual decree, and we entirely forbid
   that anyone from now on enter the order, or receive or wear its habit,
   or presume to behave as a Templar. If anyone acts otherwise, he incurs
   automatic excommunication. Furthermore, we reserve the persons and
   property for our disposition and that of the apostolic see. We intend
   with divine grace, before the end of the present sacred council, to
   make this disposition to the honour of God the exaltation of the
   Christian faith and the welfare of the holy Land. We strictly forbid
   anyone, of whatever state or condition, to interfere in any way in this
   matter of the persons and property of the Templars. We forbid any
   action concerning them which would prejudice our arrangements and
   dispositions, or any innovation or tampering. We decree that from now
   on any attempt of this kind is null and void, whether it be made
   knowingly or in ignorance. Through this decree, however, we do not wish
   to derogate from any processes made or to be made concerning individual
   Templars by diocesan bishops and provincial councils, in conformity
   with what we have ordained at other times. Let nobody therefore ... If
   anyone ...

   Given at Vienne on 22 March in the seventh year of our pontificate.

   [2]. For an everlasting record. It belongs to Christ's vicar,
   exercising his vigilant care from the apostolic watch-tower, to judge
   the changing conditions of the times, to examine the causes of the
   affairs which crop up and to observe the characters of the people
   concerned. In this way he can give due consideration to each affair and
   act opportunely; he can tear out the thistles of vice from the field of
   the Lord so that virtue may increase; and he can remove the thorns of
   false dealing so as to plant rather than to destroy. He transfers slips
   dedicated to God into the places left empty by the eradication of the
   harmful thistles. By thus transferring and uniting in a provident and
   profitable way, he brings a joy greater than the harm he has caused to
   the people uprooted; true justice has compassion for sorrow. By
   enduring the harm and replacing it profitably, he increases the growth
   of the virtues and rebuilds what has been destroyed with something
   better.

   A little while ago we suppressed definitively and perpetually the order
   of the Knights Templar of Jerusalem because of the abominable, even
   unspeakable, deeds of its master, brothers and other persons of the
   order in all parts of the world. These men were spattered with indecent
   errors and crimes, with depravity- they were blemished and stained. We
   are silent here as to detail because the memory is so sad and unclean.
   With the approval of the sacred council we abolished the constitution
   of the order, its habit and name, not without bitterness of heart. We
   did this not by definitive sentence, since this would be unlawful
   according to the inquiries and processes carried out, but by apostolic
   provision or ordinance. We issued a strict prohibition that nobody
   might henceforth enter the order or wear its habit or presume to behave
   as a Templar. Anyone doing otherwise incurred automatic
   excommunication. We commanded, by our apostolic authority, that all the
   property of the order be left to the judgment and disposition of the
   apostolic see. We strictly forbade anyone, of whatever state or
   condition, to interfere in any way regarding the persons or property of
   the order or to act in prejudice of the direction or disposition of the
   apostolic see in this matter, or to alter or even to tamper; we decreed
   all attempts of this kind to be henceforth null and void, whether made
   knowingly or in ignorance.

   Afterwards we took care lest the said property, which over a long
   period had been given, bequeathed, granted and acquired from the
   worshippers of Christ for the help of the holy Land and to assail the
   enemies of the Christian faith, should be left without management and
   perish as belonging to nobody or be used in ways other than those
   intended by the pious devotion of the faithful. There was the further
   danger that tardiness in our arrangements and dispositions might lead
   to destruction or dilapidation. We therefore held difficult, lengthy
   and varied consultations and discussions with our brothers, the
   cardinals of the holy Roman church, with patriarchs, archbishops,
   bishops and prelates, with certain outstanding and distinguished
   persons, and with the procurators at the council of the chapters,
   convents, churches and monasteries, and of the remaining absent
   prelates, in order that, through this painstaking deliberation, a
   wholesome and beneficial disposal of the said property might be made to
   the honour of God, the increase of the faith, the exaltation of the
   church, the help of the holy Land, and the salvation and peace of the
   faithful. After especially long carefully thought out, deliberate and
   complete consultations, for many just reasons, we and the said fathers
   and patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, other prelates, and the
   outstanding and distinguished persons, then present at the council,
   finally came to a conclusion. The property should become forever that
   of the order of the Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem, of the
   Hospital itself and of our beloved sons the master and brothers of the
   Hospital, in the name of the Hospital and order of these same men, who
   as athletes of the Lord expose themselves to the danger of death for
   the defence of the faith, bearing heavy and perilous losses in lands
   overseas.

   We have observed with the fullness of sincere charity that this order
   of the Hospital and the Hospital itself is one of the bodies in which
   religious observance flourishes. Factual evidence tells us that divine
   worship is fervent, works of piety and mercy are practised with great
   earnestness, the brothers of the Hospital despise the attractions of
   the world and are devoted servants of the most High. As fearless
   warriors of Christ they are ardent in their efforts to recover the holy
   Land, despising all human perils. We bear in mind also that the more
   plentifully they are supplied with means, the more will the energy of
   the master and brothers of the order and Hospital grow, their ardour
   increase and their bravery be strengthened to repel the insults offered
   to our Redeemer and to crush the enemies of the faith. They will be
   able to carry more lightly and easily the burdens demanded in the
   execution of such an enterprise. They will therefore, not unworthily,
   be made more watchful and apply themselves with greater zeal.

   In order that we may grant them increased support, we bestow on them,
   with the approval of the sacred council, the house itself of the
   Knights Templar and the other houses, churches, chapels, oratories,
   cities, castles, towns, lands, granges, places, possessions,
   jurisdictions, revenues, rights, all the other property, whether
   immovable, movable or self-moving, and all the members together with
   their rights and belongings, both beyond and on this side of the sea,
   in each and every part of the world, at the time when the master
   himself and some brothers of the order were arrested as a body in the
   kingdom of France, namely in October 1308. The gift is to include
   everything which the Templars had, held or possessed of themselves or
   through others, or which belonged to the said house and order of
   Knights Templar, or to the master and brothers of the order as also the
   titles, actions and rights which at the time of their arrest belonged
   in any way to the house, order or persons of the order of Knights
   Templar, or could belong to them, against whomsoever of whatever
   dignity, state or condition, with all the privileges, indults,
   immunities and liberties with which the said master and brothers of the
   house and order of Knights Templar, and the house and order itself, had
   been legitimately endowed by the apostolic see or by catholic emperors,
   kings and princes, or by other members of the faithful, or in any other
   way. All this we present, grant, unite, incorporate, apply and annex in
   perpetuity, by the fullness of our apostolic power, to the said order
   of the Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem and to the Hospital itself.

   We except the property of the said former order of Knights Templar in
   the kingdoms and lands of our beloved sons in Christ, the illustrious
   kings of Castile, Aragon, Portugal and Majorca, outside the kingdom of
   France. We reserve this property, from the said gift, grant, union,
   application, incorporation and annexation, to the disposal and
   regulation of the apostolic see. We wish the prohibition made a little
   while ago by other proceedings of ours to remain in full force. Nobody
   of any state or condition may intervene in any way as regards these
   persons and property in prejudice to the regulation or disposition of
   the apostolic see. We wish that our decree concerning these persons and
   property in the kingdoms and lands of the above kings should remain in
   full force until the apostolic see makes another arrangement.

   Occupiers and unlawful detainers of the property, irrespective of
   state, condition, eminence or dignity, even if this is pontifical,
   imperial or royal, unless they abandon the property within a month
   after it is called for by the master and brothers of the Hospital, or
   by any of them, or by their procurators [. . .]. The property must be
   fully and freely restored to the order of Hospitallers and to the said
   Hospital, or to the master, priors, preceptors or brothers of the said
   Hospital, in any regions or provinces, or to any of them individually,
   or to their procurator or procurators, in the name of the said order of
   Hospitallers, even if the priors, preceptors and brothers and their
   procurators or any one of them have no special mandate from the master
   of the Hospital, provided that the procurators hold or show a special
   commission from the priors and preceptors or from any one of them, in
   the provinces or regions in which these priors and preceptors have been
   delegated. The priors, preceptors and brothers are obliged to give a
   full reckoning to the master concerning everything: conduct, actions,
   receipts and negotiations. The procurators are to render a similar
   account to the priors and preceptors, and to each one of them, by whom
   they were delegated. All who have knowingly given counsel, aid or
   favour to the occupiers and detainers mentioned above concerning such
   occupation or detention, publicly or secretly, lie under
   excommunication. Chapters, colleges or governing bodies of churches and
   monasteries, and the corporations of cities, castles, towns and other
   places, as well as the cities, castles, towns and other places
   themselves which were at fault in this, and the cities, castles and
   places in which the detainers and occupiers hold temporal lordship, if
   such temporal lords place obstacles to the giving up of the property
   and its restoration to the master and brothers of the Hospital, in the
   name of the Hospital, not desisting from such conduct within a month
   after the property is called for, are automatically laid under
   interdict. They cannot be absolved from this until they offer full
   satisfaction. Moreover the occupiers and detainers and those who have
   given them counsel, aid or favour, whether individuals or the chapters,
   colleges or governing bodies of churches or monasteries, as also the
   corporations of cities, castles, lands or other places, incur, in
   addition to the above-mentioned penalties, automatic deprivation of
   everything they hold as fiefs from the Roman or other churches. These
   fiefs are to revert freely without opposition to the churches
   concerned, and the prelates or rulers of those churches may dispose of
   the fiefs at will, as they judge will be to the advantage of the
   churches. Let nobody therefore ....If anyone . . .

   Continued in E:

   We therefore commission you by our apostolic letters, that acting
   together or in pairs or singly, directly or through one or more others,
   you induct the master or priors or preceptors or brothers of the
   Hospital, or any individual member, or their procurator or procurators,
   in the name of the Hospital, into possession of the house of the
   Knights Templar and of their other houses, churches, chapels,
   oratories, cities, castles, towns, lands, granges, places, possessions,
   jurisdictions, revenues and rights to all their other movable,
   immovable and self-moving property, with all their members, rights and
   belongings, both on the near and far side of the sea and in every part
   of the world, which the order, master and brothers of the Knights
   Templar had, held or possessed, directly or through others, at the time
   of their arrest. The Hospitallers are to be inducted by our authority
   and defended afterwards; occupiers, detainers, administrators and
   conservators are to be removed. You are to ask a full account from
   those who have been delegated by apostolic authority and any other,
   including those sub-delegated, to care for the aforesaid property. The
   account is to comprise all the fruits, revenues, incomes, rights and
   accretions. The occupiers or detainers, administrators, conservators
   and others, unless within the prescribed time they abandon the property
   and revenues, and restore them freely and fully to the order of the
   Hospital and to the same Hospital, or to the master, prior, preceptors
   or brothers of the Hospital, in the regions and provinces in which the
   property has been, including to each of them individually, or to their
   procurator or procurators, in the name of the Hospital, as said above,
   as well as those who give help, counsel or favour to the occupiers,
   detainers, administrators or conservators, are to be excommunicated by
   you, if they are individuals; but if they are chapters, colleges,
   convents or corporations, as well as the cities, castles, towns and
   places themselves at fault in this, and those in which the detainers
   and occupiers have temporal dominion and are obstructive when asked to
   abandon the property and restore it to the master and brothers of the
   Hospital, in the name of the Hospital, and refuse to desist from such
   conduct within a month, you are to lay them under interdict. The
   offenders are also to be deprived of all property which they hold in
   fief from the Roman or any other church. You will give notice
   everywhere where you think it useful and have it announced by others
   that the excommunicated persons are to be strictly avoided until they
   have made suitable satisfaction and merited absolution. No exception is
   to be made on account of any indult from the apostolic see to the
   effect that they cannot be laid under interdict, suspended or
   excommunicated by apostolic letters which do not make an express, full
   and word for word declaration. You are also to suppress any other
   objectors, if there be such, by ecclesiastical censure, disregarding
   appeals. It is our will also and we decree by our apostolic authority,
   that with the present instruction you all and singly are given power
   and jurisdiction in every detail of this matter. You may from now
   proceed freely as if this same jurisdiction were perpetuated by
   citation or by any other lawful way. The jurisdiction shall be
   considered perpetuated as though the case were no longer undecided.
   Each of you may continue the part which has been left unfinished by one
   of your colleagues, in spite of his opposition and unhampered,
   notwithstanding the constitution of pope Boniface VIII, our predecessor
   of happy memory, as often and whenever this is suitable. Given as
   above.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [3]. Clement, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for assurance in
   the present and for future record. The inquiries and various processes
   commissioned not long ago by the apostolic see through all parts of
   Christendom against the former order of Knights Templar and its
   individual members, concerning accusation of heresies, brought them
   into grave disrepute. In particular there was the accusation that the
   brothers of the former order at, and sometimes after, their reception
   denied Christ and spat in his dishonour on a cross held out to them,
   and sometimes trampled it underfoot. The master of the order, the
   visitor of France, the chief preceptors and many brothers of the order
   confessed at their trial to these heresies. The confessions cast grave
   suspicion on the order. In addition, the widespread disgrace, the
   strong suspicion, and the clamorous charges of the prelates, dukes,
   communes, barons and counts of the kingdom of France also gave grave
   scandal which could hardly be allayed without suppression of the order.
   There were many other just reasons mentioned in the legal process which
   influenced us. We therefore, with the approval of the sacred council,
   our heart filled with great bitterness and sorrow, suppressed and
   abolished the said former order of the Temple and its constitution,
   habit and name and we forbade its restoration. We did this, not by
   definitive sentence since we could not legally do this according to the
   inquiries and processes mentioned above, but by apostolic provision and
   ordinance. We reserved the persons and property of the order to the
   decision and disposal of the apostolic see. In doing so, however, we
   had no intention of derogating from the processes made or to be made
   concerning individual persons or brothers of the said former order by
   diocesan bishops and provincial councils, as we have ordained
   elsewhere.

   Now therefore we wish to provide more suitably for individual persons
   or brothers. We reserved lately for our own disposition the master of
   the former order, the visitor of France and the chief preceptors of the
   holy Land, Normandy, Aquitaine, Poitou and the province of Provence, as
   well as brother Oliver de Penne, a knight of the said former order,
   whom henceforth we reserve to the disposition of the apostolic see. We
   have decided that all the other brothers should be left to the judgment
   and disposition of provincial councils, as we have indeed done until
   now. We wish judgment to be given by these councils in accordance with
   the different cases of individuals. Thus those who have been legally
   acquitted, or will be acquitted in the future, shall be supplied with
   the goods of the former order whereby they can live as becomes their
   state. With those who have confessed concerning the above errors, we
   wish the provincial councils prudently to temper justice with mercy:
   the situation of these men and the extent of their confessions are to
   be duly weighed. With regard to those who are impenitent and have
   relapsed, if any- which God forbid- be found among them, justice and
   canonical censure are to be observed. As for those who even when
   questioned have denied their involvement in the above errors, the
   councils are to observe justice and equity according to the canons.
   With the approval of the sacred council, we hereby cite those who have
   not yet been questioned and who are not held by the power or authority
   of the church but are perhaps fugitives, to appear in person before
   their diocesans within a year from today. This we assign them as a
   precise and final limit. They are to undergo an examination by their
   diocesans, receiving a just judgment from the said councils according
   to their deserts. Great mercy however is to be shown and observed both
   to these last and to those previously mentioned, except the relapsed
   and impenitent. They should also be provided from the property of the
   order with the necessities of life; all the brothers of the former
   order, whenever they return to the obedience of the church and as long
   as they persist in that obedience, shall be maintained as becomes the
   circumstances of their state. All of them shall be placed in houses of
   the former order or in monasteries of other religious, at the expense
   however of the former order itself according to the judgment of the
   said provincial councils; but many of them shall not be placed together
   at the same time in one house or monastery.

   We order also and strictly command all those with whom and by whom the
   brothers of the former order are detained, to surrender them freely
   whenever required to do so by the metropolitans and the ordinaries of
   the brothers. If within the year those cited do not appear before the
   diocesans, as stated above, they incur automatically sentence of
   excommunication; and because in a case especially concerning the faith,
   contumacy adds strong presumption to suspicion, the contumacious who
   stubbornly remain excommunicate for a year are henceforth to be
   condemned as heretics. This citation of ours is made of set purpose and
   we wish the brothers to be obliged by it as if they had received a
   special citation personally, for as vagabonds they can in no way be
   found or at least not easily. In order, then, to prevent all
   subterfuge, we publish our edict in the present sacred council. And in
   order to bring this citation more assuredly to the knowledge of the
   brothers themselves and to the general knowledge of all, we shall have
   papers or parchments containing the citation and sealed with our bull
   hung or fastened to the doors of the principal church of Vienne. This
   will secure a loud and widespread publication of this citation, so that
   the brothers whom the citation concerns can claim no excuse that the
   citation has not reached them or that they were ignorant of it, since
   it is improbable that what is so openly made public to all can remain
   unknown or hidden to them. Furthermore, in order to observe greater
   precaution, we order the local diocesans to make public this edict of
   our citation, as soon as conveniently possible, in their cathedrals and
   in the churches at the most conspicuous places in their dioceses.

   Given at Vienne on 6 May 1312 in the seventh year.

   [4]. To all the administrators and guardians of the property of the
   former house and order of the Knights Templar, delegated by apostolic
   and any other authority. Recently we held, as the Lord so disposed, a
   general council at Vienne. There we gave long and careful consideration
   to the disposal of the former house and order of the Knights Templar.
   We thought it more acceptable to the most High, more honourable to
   those who worship in the true faith, and more useful for the aid of the
   holy Land, to grant this property to the order of the Hospital of saint
   John of Jerusalem, rather than to give it or even attach it to a new
   order to be created. There were some, however, who asserted that it
   would be better to confer the property on an order to be newly created
   than to attach it to the order of the Hospital, and so we were unable
   to obtain the result we hoped for. At last, however, by God's favour,
   on 2 May of this present month, with the approval of the sacred
   council, we judged that the property should be granted and attached and
   even united to the said Hospital or order. We made an exception, for
   certain reasons, of the Templars' property in the kingdoms and lands of
   our beloved sons in Christ, the illustrious kings ....of Castile,
   ....of Aragon, ....of Portugal, and ....of Majorca', outside the
   kingdom of France. We reserved this property for our disposition and
   that of the apostolic see, until some other arrangement be made by us
   and the apostolic see for its use to aid the holy Land.

   We therefore strictly command all of you, by apostolic ordinance, to
   restore in full, in the name of the said Hospital and order, this
   property with the revenue gathered from it, after all expenses have
   been paid, to the master and brothers of the Hospital, or to restore
   individual items to the said Hospital's individual priors or preceptors
   of the provinces or cities or dioceses or places in which the property
   lies, or to the procurator or procurators of one or more of them,
   according to the terms of your commission, within a month of being so
   required. For this the master, brothers, priors and preceptors, or
   their procurator or procurators, shall fittingly commend you, and we
   shall rightly acknowledge your prompt and devoted obedience.

   Given at Livron in the diocese of Valence on 16 May in the seventh
   year.{1}

   [5].{2} Our redeemer, the only-begotten Son of God, our Lord Jesus
   Christ, loved so much the daughter of Zion, the holy Land, that he
   chose her as his inheritance and his own patrimony. He therefore,
   clothed with our flesh, honoured her with his presence and consecrated
   her by the shedding of his precious blood. But we mourn and bitterly
   lament that so noble an inheritance of our redeemer has been turned
   over to strangers and laid low by the frenzy of the Babylonian
   persecutor, trampled underfoot by the feet of the defiled. She is
   dishonoured by the vile grasp of the unclean Saracens, faithless
   enemies of the Christian name. She has been occupied and wretchedly
   retained, the Christian people have been savagely slaughtered. To the
   insult of the creator, to the outrage and sorrow of all Christendom,
   the name of Christ is horribly blasphemed by the filthy and detestable
   conduct of the enemy. This sad region therefore weeps under the lash
   and repeatedly laments to the vicar of Christ about this intolerable
   persecution. Wounded by her disgrace, she pleads with Christian princes
   and the catholic people. She uncovers her wounds to those from whom she
   awaits the work of the healer. She demands liberation from those for
   whose salvation the author of salvation bore within her borders the
   suffering of the cross. All this and more besides, which the mind
   cannot fully conceive nor the tongue tell, rose to our heart and roused
   our mind as soon as we were called by divine favour, though unworthy,
   to the summit of apostolic dignity. We gazed tenderly at the doleful
   state of the holy Land and we applied ourselves to think out remedies
   by which, with the aid of heaven, that Land, freed from the enemy's
   criminal hands, might see, after the darkness of so many tribulations,
   the bright times of longed-for peace

   For this and other holy works acceptable to God, to be advanced by his
   almighty power, we convoked a general council in the city of Vienne{3}.
   Then, together with our brothers the cardinals of the holy Roman
   church, the patriarchs, archbishops, bishops and other prelates and our
   beloved sons in Christ the illustrious kings Philip of the Franks and
   Louis of Navarre, who were present at the council, as also some other
   eminent men and the procurators of the remaining absent prelates and of
   chapters, convents, churches and monasteries, assembled at the council,
   we held a long, complete and careful discussion on bringing aid to the
   holy Land. At last we resolved, with the council's approval, to succour
   the holy Land by a general crusade. Intending to use our apostolic
   power zealously to this end, and having duly weighed all we have said,
   we judged, with the approval of the sacred council, that a tithe should
   be imposed by our apostolic authority on all ecclesiastical revenues
   and incomes throughout the world. Only the persons and places belonging
   to the Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem and the other military
   orders were to be exempted. The tithe was to be collected and paid for
   six years to be reckoned from 1 January last, in fixed installments, as
   we should find best, and to be directed to helping the holy Land and
   opposing the infidels and the enemies of the catholic faith.{4}

   But actually we reflected of late that our letters concerning the
   imposition, collection and payment of the tithe had not reached you by
   1 January, nor could easily do so in a short time, on account of the
   great distance of those parts from the Roman curia. Wishing, then, to
   consult your ease and convenience, we have decreed that the six years
   are to begin in your region on 1 October next. We therefore ask,
   admonish and earnestly exhort you, also commanding you strictly by
   apostolic ordinance in virtue of obedience, to pay without difficulty
   the tithe for six years beginning from 1 October. The tithe is to be
   paid in the customary way, namely for the first half of the first year
   on 1 October next, and for the second half on 1 April immediately
   following, and in the same way for each of the remaining five years.
   Each of you is to pay it in full from your ecclesiastical revenues and
   incomes. If you fail to pay the tithe within the above periods, each of
   you automatically incurs sentences similar to those pronounced for
   nonpayment by you or by the suitable and trustworthy persons delegated
   by you to collect the tithe in your cities and dioceses.

   Furthermore, you are to collect the tithe from our beloved sons, the
   abbots, priors, deans, archdeacons, provosts, archpriests and other
   prelates of churches, the chapters, colleges and convents of the
   Cistercians, Cluniacs, Premonstratensians, of saint Benedict and saint
   Augustine, of the Carthusians, Grandmontines and other orders, and
   other non-exempt secular and regular ecclesiastical persons, in your
   cities and dioceses, that is, each of you in each city and diocese. The
   priors, preceptors, masters and other persons and the places of the
   Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem and of the other military orders
   are to be the only exceptions made. The tithe is to be collected by you
   or by other suitable and trustworthy persons delegated by you for this
   service in each of your cities and dioceses. It is altogether our wish
   and command that you should delegate such persons. We entrust to them
   and command them by this document to claim and collect it in full by
   our authority, in each of the cities and dioceses where they are
   delegated, from our beloved sons the abbots, priors, deans, provosts,
   archdeacons, archpriests and other prelates of churches, and the exempt
   chapters, colleges and convents of the above-mentioned orders, in your
   cities and dioceses. Only the priors, preceptors, masters, persons and
   places of the Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem and of the said other
   military orders are to be excepted.

   The tithe is to be claimed and collected in full from the
   ecclesiastical revenues and incomes, by our authority, in the customary
   way according to the years and periods mentioned above. The delegates
   are to collect it from both the exempt and the non-exempt: each is to
   hand over and assign it for each period to the person among you by whom
   he was delegated, without delay or as soon as he conveniently can. You
   are to compel them by ecclesiastical censure, without any appeal, to
   give you an account of the money claimed and collected from the
   aforesaid non-exempt persons, as well as to hand over and assign the
   tithe claimed and collected from both the exempt and the non-exempt.
   Public instruments are to be drawn up and other due precautions taken
   concerning the handing over and assigning of the tithe. In this way,
   when needed, it can be established how much, from whom, when and for
   what period the delegates received the money and how much, when and for
   what period they handed over and assigned it to each of you.

   The money which has been duly claimed and collected by you and your
   delegates from the exempt and non-exempt persons and has been handed
   over to you, including that which has been claimed and collected by
   your delegates from the said exempt persons, as mentioned above, and
   also the money which you will pay from your own revenues and incomes,
   is to be put away by each of you, together with your cathedral chapter,
   beneath the church or even elsewhere, as you think best, in some more
   becoming and safe place. Here, at your expense and that of the chapter,
   you will have it guarded carefully and faithfully, to be consigned by
   each of you to our delegates as and when shall seem good to us, for the
   business of the holy Land and the service of the faith.

   In order that you may more easily and effectively collect this tithe,
   we grant by this document full and unrestricted power to each of you to
   constrain by ecclesiastical censure directly or through your delegates,
   disregarding any appeal, the abbots, priors, deans, provosts and other
   aforesaid non-exempt persons, in your cities and dioceses. We grant the
   same power to your delegates, in each city or diocese for which they
   have been delegated, with regard to the abbots, priors, deans, provosts
   and other aforesaid exempt persons. This power may also be used to
   constrain any opponents and rebels. In addition, we grant full and
   unrestricted power to you to absolve in your cities and dioceses, after
   satisfaction has been made, the aforesaid non-exempt persons, and to
   your delegates regarding the aforesaid exempt persons who, because of
   non-payment of the tithe in due time, are bound by sentences of
   excommunication, suspension or interdict; also to dispense from
   irregularity contracted by celebrating divine worship or taking part in
   it while bound by one or more of the above sentences. In order that you
   and your delegates may have a reward for the labours undertaken, we
   enjoin on you the above things in remission of your sins.

   The tithe is to be paid even if the apostolic see has granted an indult
   to you or some of you, or to the abbots, priors and other aforesaid
   exempt or non-exempt persons, or to anyone else, that you are not
   obliged and compelled to pay, or that you cannot be laid under
   interdict, suspension or excommunication by apostolic letters which
   have not made full and express mention of this indult and its tenor
   word for word, or of the names of your orders, localities and persons.
   The same applies to any privileges, indulgences, exemptions and
   apostolic letters which have been granted generally or specially in any
   form of words by the said apostolic see to any dignities, orders,
   places or persons, and of which and their whole tenor there should be
   made in our letters word for word, special, full and express mention.
   Consider, besides, that in these duties you are engaged in God's
   business, and that you are acting in the sight of him who sees all. You
   will therefore be obliged to render an account to him and to us; we
   intend to use all diligence in this matter. You will receive due reward
   from both him and us. You should therefore act prudently and carefully,
   not only to avoid the danger of punishment and confusion, but also to
   gain the glory of praise and well-deserved reward.

   It is our wish also that each of you oblige the persons delegated by
   you for collecting the tithe, to swear that they will be diligent and
   careful in their work and to use this formula: "I swear ....by you,
   lord . . ., who am delegated by the authority of the apostolic see and
   by the same see itself to claim, collect and receive a tithe of all
   ecclesiastical revenues and incomes from all exempt and non-exempt
   ecclesiastical persons in your city and diocese, that I will faithfully
   claim, collect, receive and guard this tithe which has been imposed by
   the apostolic see for the business of the holy Land and of the catholic
   faith. Only the priors, preceptors masters and other persons and places
   of the Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem and of the other military
   orders are excepted. I shall not give way in this to any person, of
   whatever dignity, status or condition, whether from entreaty, fear,
   gratitude, favour or any other cause. I shall restore and consign the
   full tithe to you at your order. I shall render a final and integral
   account concerning everything in detail, namely to you regarding what I
   have claimed, collected and received from non-exempt persons, and to
   the delegate or delegates of the holy see regarding exempt persons. If
   you lay down your office in this matter, I shall do the same according
   to the orders of your successor. So may God help me and these holy
   gospels of God."

   [6]. For future record. Not long ago, in the general council at Vienne,
   we transferred, with the approval of the sacred council, the property,
   rights, privileges, indults, immunities and liberties of the former
   order of the Temple to the order of the Hospital of saint John of
   Jerusalem. For the sake of greater peace and concord between prelates
   of churches and other clergy on the one hand, and the brothers of the
   order of the Hospital on the other, as also for other justifiable
   reasons, we suspended, in the last session of the council, all the
   privileges granted to the Hospital by the apostolic see, and with them
   as a necessary consequence the privileges of the former Temple, which
   should be thought of as belonging to the said Hospital and transferred
   to it. We excepted the privilege of exemption, if they had any. We
   wished these privileges to be suspended at our good pleasure. There are
   some, however, who assert on insufficient grounds that the suspension
   of these privileges of the Hospital does not extend to the privileges
   of the former order of the Temple. Although there is not the faintest
   reason for such an assertion, we wish to remove from their minds the
   slightest doubt that it was our intention, by the said suspension of
   the privileges of the order of the Hospital, to suspend the privileges
   of the former Temple, which have become by the transference those of
   the Hospital itself. We declare therefore by our apostolic authority
   and decree that these, like the other privileges of the Hospital, are
   and remain suspended.

   Indeed, before the suspension, it was said in general by some of our
   brothers cardinals of the holy Roman church, to many of the prelates
   assembled at the general council, that there would be a suspension of
   the Hospital's privileges until everything that was still uncertain
   among the said prelates and other clergy, with regard to concord,
   lawsuits and disputes, had been completely settled. We observed,
   however, that if it was necessary to await the end of all these
   lawsuits and disputes, one little case might generate grave prejudice
   against the Hospitallers, and great loss might result from the
   continuing suspension of their privileges. We reflected that this might
   provide material for many misrepresentations. In the last session of
   the council, therefore, wishing to obviate such greater dangers, we
   judged it fitting to make known orally, clearly and openly, even for a
   third time, so that each and all might clearly understand, that we
   wished the said suspension of the privileges of the order of the
   Hospital to continue until we willed otherwise. We intend with the
   Lord's help to consider what is good for both sides and to make
   provision for both prelates and other clergy on the one hand, and the
   Hospitallers on the other, so that neither will have reason for
   complaint but both will receive due satisfaction. Let nobody therefore
   ...

   _______________________________________________________________________

   [7]. For an everlasting record. Not long ago, under the Lord's
   providence, we held a general council at Vienne, at which we suppressed
   the former order of the Knights Templar of Jerusalem. We granted,
   attached and joined the Templar possessions, with the approval of the
   sacred council, to the order of the Hospital of saint John of
   Jerusalem, for the help of the holy Land; with the exception, for
   certain reasons, of their property lying in the kingdoms and lands of
   our beloved sons in Christ, the illustrious kings ....of Castile,
   ....of Aragon, ....of Portugal and ....of Majorca, outside the kingdom
   of France, which we reserved for our disposal and that of the apostolic
   see until we made other arrangements. Then, in the same council, we
   made some sound provisions for furthering the cause of the holy Land
   and others by which quarrels, scandals and discord might be prevented,
   and continuous peace and concord be established, between prelates of
   churches and other clergy on the one hand and the brothers of the
   Hospital on the other. We also made provision on other points relating
   to the reform of the order of the Hospital.

   Actually, business has pressed upon us. It is like an ocean pouring
   into the apostolic see. The waters of care constantly harass our heart.
   We have not been permitted until now, and are still not permitted, to
   put into execution the arrangements we desire. In order that the fruit
   of such sound proposals may not perish through oblivion or pressure of
   business, but rather may be gathered up, by the Lord's will, at the
   opportune time, we have had the headings of these projected decrees
   inserted into the present document. Their drift is as follows. We wish
   that the transfer of property of the former order of the Temple to the
   order of the Hospital may, by our provision, be of advantage to the
   holy Land. We also wish that quarrels, scandals and discord be
   prevented between prelates and other clergy on the one hand and the
   brothers of the order on the other; that lasting concord be established
   between them; and that the order and its members be reformed, if and as
   this seems good. We have therefore made three special provisions
   regarding the order of the Hospital.

   The first has to do with the holy Land. We shall have an exact and
   careful enquiry made into the past and present possessions of the order
   of the Hospital and their exact annual value. We shall wish to know
   fully the annual value of each old and new house of the order, and how
   much this represents each year in terms of assistance to the holy Land.
   On completion of this valuation, and taking into account the necessary
   local expenditure, we shall oblige the order to maintain continuously
   in the holy Land a certain number of brothers and knights. These
   brothers and knights are to labour effectively and strive to win the
   holy Land and keep it, as far as God grants. We shall arrange and
   provide that very few brothers of the order remain on this side of the
   sea. These shall be only those required to govern the houses of the
   order and those who are old, sick or unfit for war. The young and the
   strong, who are able to fight, shall be required to go and stay
   overseas so that the holy Land may have its needs met. The order will
   thus pursue the purpose for which it was instituted, as is only right
   and fitting. In this way it will not reserve for itself great wealth or
   many persons of quality. Rather, the order will lose all occasion for
   pride or the prosecution of idle enterprises, since the brothers and
   knights who drag their feet on this side of the sea will be far fewer
   than before. The property remaining behind will also be heavily and
   more than usually burdened as a result of our above-mentioned
   provisions.

   We cannot impose on our successors the continuation of the above
   policy. Yet, in order to make this course of action possible and easier
   for them, we shall have the annual value of each house registered
   exactly in the Roman curia, and also the service which it will be able
   to provide each year for the holy Land, and the fixed number of
   brothers and knights required to stay overseas. We shall arrange that
   the registered material be kept permanently with the papal registers
   under our bull. Further, that there be no lack of carefulness or
   caution in this matter, we shall send the registered material under our
   bull to all Christian kings to be permanently kept by them in order
   that if it should happen- though may it not- that this ordinance is not
   observed by the Hospitallers, the kings themselves, being informed in
   the above manner, may more quickly and fully know where the observance
   of this ordinance has ceased. As a result, they will also be moved to
   take care that it is observed.

   Secondly, in order to establish tranquility and peace, as was said
   above, between the churches with their prelates and the order of the
   Hospital, we shall see that all the privileges of the order are fully
   shown to us. And although we have no intention whatsoever of taking
   away its exemption, if the order has such, or of granting exemption, if
   the order has none, we shall altogether take away any privileges, if
   such there be, which are odious or provide matter for quarrels, discord
   or scandals. If we happen to find areas of uncertainty which it is not
   advisable to remove, we shall clarify. In addition, we shall delegate
   in each province two of its prelates and one of our clerics or another
   cleric to provide more fully for concord, giving them full and
   unrestricted powers, so that simply and easily, and without the din of
   a court of law, they may hear and settle or make peace between the
   parties in all disputes and cases that have arisen or might arise for
   any reason between the aforesaid order and the churches and any
   ecclesiastics with regard to churches, tithes, first-fruits,
   procurations and any property or rights whatsoever. This is to include
   questions concerning the property and rights of the former order of the
   Temple. The parties may be summoned or not as they wish; charges may be
   laid or not, as they please. Before or after the delegates' decision
   there can be no appeal. Whatever they do or decide shall altogether be
   regarded as done or decided by us.

   We shall also grant to them the power of regulating the procurations
   owed by the order to the bishops in different places so that, when and
   as seems good to them, they are converted into an annual payment as
   money to be paid by the order to the bishops. The bishops, on receiving
   such payments, are bound to visit at their own expense, at a time
   suitable for them, the places making them. If this regulation does not
   seem useful, the bishops will receive on visitation the procurations
   owed to them by the churches of the order, if these are able to pay
   them. If a church cannot pay the full procuration, the above delegates
   will make an estimate of the amount payable to the bishop as the
   procuration for that church. We shall also ordain that all churches
   which have annexed to them the cure of souls and belonged to the order
   of the Hospital on account of any right of the Temple, or even on
   account of any other rights which belong or shall belong to the
   Hospital, shall be subject in all spiritual matters to their diocesans,
   notwithstanding any privilege of exemption. Indeed, in order that
   everything decreed above may be fulfilled more quickly and without
   evasion on the part of the order, and that our good will may appear to
   everyone, we suspend entirely from now all the privileges for long
   granted by the apostolic see to the order, except for the privilege of
   exemption, if possessed, and we wish them to remain suspended at our
   pleasure.

   Thirdly, concerning the order of the Hospital itself, we shall be
   making decrees regarding its regulation and reform. We shall be seeing
   and examining carefully the rules, statutes, form of government and
   progress of the order itself and of its members. We shall approve and
   confirm what is good. We shall clarify doubtful points that we find in
   need of revision in the order itself and in its personnel, both head
   and members. We shall restore the norm of truth, justice and regular
   observance with the equilibrium of reason and equity, to the advantage
   and welfare of the order and for the help of the holy Land. In this way
   the order itself will be preserved from decay and kept in a healthy and
   prosperous condition.

   The prelates of France, after the above intentions had been explained
   to them, petitioned that we should take away the privilege of
   exemption, if the order of the Hospital possessed it, or at least
   suspend such exemption, just as we have decreed the suspension of the
   order's other privileges. These prelates also declared that, as long as
   the unlettered and simple brothers of the order remain under the care
   of their simple priests, and the prelates themselves are unacquainted
   with the brothers' deeds and consciences, they can be in grave danger
   of losing their souls through having the privilege of exemption, if
   they do in fact possess it. Our reply is that because of shortness of
   time we are unable here to formulate a full and determinate decree. As
   soon as we can conveniently do so we shall with the Lord's help decree
   and provide in this matter. Also, as these prelates earnestly
   petitioned us, it is our will and decree that just as individual
   catholic kings shall receive in writing the valuation of the order's
   revenues and the other relevant information, so each province ought to
   have and shall have the same document.

   Also, in accordance with the petition of these prelates, we decree and
   determine that the compositions pending or made within the last ten
   years, which were extorted from churches and ecclesiastics through fear
   of the order of the Hospital and the order of the former Temple, do not
   disadvantage or harm the said churches and ecclesiastics in any way,
   and that if two prelates and a non-prelate delegated by us cannot reach
   agreement, then whatever is decided by one of the prelates and the
   non-prelate, or decreed by them by way of composition or agreement,
   shall have effect and full validity. Also, we wish to be as gracious as
   possible to the said prelates. Therefore we shall allow the two
   prelates delegated by us to raise in ready money the procurations of
   their dioceses while absent, and we shall have the non-prelate provided
   for in money from the property of the former order of the Temple. We
   shall also decree in accordance with the petition of the prelates of
   France, that Hospitallers who publicly receive excommunicated persons
   or those under interdict or notorious usurers for ecclesiastical
   burial, or for solemnizing their marriages or having them solemnized or
   permitting them to be solemnized in their churches against the law, or
   for administering the sacraments to outside parishioners or permitting
   this in their churches, incur automatic excommunication. And we
   strictly forbid the Hospitallers to trouble anyone unduly by use of
   apostolic letters. We shall also decree, in accordance with the
   petition of the same prelates, against the building of new churches or
   chapels, the erecting of bell-towers and the making of cemeteries; we
   shall provide adequate laws on these subjects to be observed by the
   Hospitallers.

   [8]. For an everlasting record. Some time ago, in the general council
   held at Vienne under the Lord's inspiration, we suppressed the former
   order of the Temple for certain good reasons as explained in the letter
   of suppression. After long and careful deliberations with our brothers
   and the whole council, we bestowed on the order of the Hospital of
   saint John of Jerusalem, on the Hospital itself and on our beloved
   sons, the master and brothers of the Hospital, in the name of the
   Hospital and of the order of these men, who as the Lord's athletes
   expose themselves unfailingly to the danger of death in defence of the
   faith and have borne and still bear heavy loss overseas, the house of
   the Knights Templar and their other houses, churches, chapels,
   oratories, cities, castles, towns, lands, granges and all their other
   movable, immovable and self-moving property, together with all the
   members and rights and all that belongs to them, beyond and on this
   side of the sea and in all parts of the world, which the former order
   and its master and brothers had and comprised at the time when the
   master himself and some of the brothers were arrested as a body in the
   kingdom of France, namely in October 1308.

   The property includes that which the Templars had of themselves or
   through others, and anything belonging to them in any way, with all
   their rights, privileges, indults, immunities, liberties, honours and
   charges. We donated and united all this forever to the Hospital and
   incorporated it into the Hospital, with the approval of the sacred
   council and from the fullness of our apostolic power, for the help of
   the holy Land. However, whatever rights belonged to kings, princes,
   prelates, barons, nobles and any other Catholics, before the arrest of
   the master of the former order of the Temple and of some other
   brothers, were to remain. We excepted from the said donation, union and
   incorporation the property of the former order of the Temple in the
   kingdoms and lands of our beloved sons in Christ, the illustrious kings
   ... of Castile, ... of Aragon, ... of Portugal, and ... of Majorca,
   lying outside the kingdom of France, which we reserved with good reason
   for the disposal of the apostolic see.

   In the letter of donation, union and incorporation, however, through
   the carelessness, neglect or engagements of the scribe or secretary,
   mention was omitted of the non-violation of the rights of kings,
   princes, prelates and other persons concerned. Lest therefore any doubt
   arises in the future from such an omission concerning these charges and
   rights, and any prejudice be generated against the said kings, princes,
   prelates, barons, nobles and other persons, we, who desire that
   everyone retains his rights unimpaired, wishing to provide a suitable
   remedy in the matter for the said kings, princes, prelates, barons,
   nobles and any other Catholics, declare that we have made the above
   donation, union and incorporation to the order of the Hospital of saint
   John of Jerusalem, and to the Hospital itself and its master and
   brothers, in the name of the said Hospital and order, in the way
   expressed above. We determine and decree of our certain knowledge that,
   without violation of the property of the former order of the Temple
   donated to the order of the Hospital, together with all its privileges,
   indults, immunities, liberties, rights, honours and charges, for the
   help of the holy Land, nevertheless whatever rights belonged to kings,
   princes, prelates, barons, nobles and any other Catholics, at the time
   of the said arrest of the master and some brothers of the Temple,
   remain intact, unimpaired and exactly as they would be in everything as
   if they had been distinctly and expressly mentioned in the said letter
   of donation, union and incorporation. Let nobody therefore ....

Decrees

   [1]. Adhering firmly to the foundation of the catholic faith, other
   than which, as the Apostle testifies, no one can lay, we openly profess
   with holy mother church that the only begotten Son of God, subsisting
   eternally together with the Father in everything in which God the
   Father exists, assumed in time in the womb of a virgin the parts of our
   nature united together, from which he himself true God became true man:
   namely the human, passible body and the intellectual or rational soul
   truly of itself and essentially informing the body. And that in this
   assumed nature the Word of God willed for the salvation of all not only
   to be nailed to the cross and to die on it, but also, having already
   breathed forth his spirit, permitted his side to be pierced by a lance,
   so that from the out-flowing water and blood there might be formed the
   one, immaculate and holy virginal mother church, the bride of Christ,
   as from the side of the first man in his sleep Eve was fashioned as his
   wife, in this way, to the determinate figure of the first and old Adam,
   who according to the Apostle is a type of the one who was to come, the
   truth might correspond in our last Adam, that is to say in Christ.
   This, we say, is the truth, fortified by the witness of that huge eagle
   which the prophet Ezechiel saw flying over the other gospel animals,
   namely blessed John the apostle and evangelist, who relating the event
   and order of this sacrament, said in his gospel : But when they came to
   Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs,
   but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once
   there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness- his
   testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth- that you also
   may believe.

   We, therefore, directing our apostolic attention, to which alone it
   belongs to define these things, to such splendid testimony and to the
   common opinion of the holy fathers and doctors, declare with the
   approval of the sacred council that the said apostle and evangelist,
   John, observed the right order of events in saying that when Christ was
   already dead one of the soldiers opened his side with a spear.
   Moreover, with the approval of the said council, we reject as erroneous
   and contrary to the truth of the catholic faith every doctrine or
   proposition rashly asserting that the substance of the rational or
   intellectual soul is not of itself and essentially the form of the
   human body, or casting doubt on this matter. In order that all may know
   the truth of the faith in its purity and all error may be excluded, we
   define that anyone who presumes henceforth to assert defend or hold
   stubbornly that the rational or intellectual soul is not the form of
   the human body of itself and essentially, is to be considered a
   heretic.

   All are faithfully to profess that there is one baptism which
   regenerates all those baptized in Christ, just as there is one God and
   one faith'. We believe that when baptism is administered in water in
   the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy Spirit, it is a
   perfect means of salvation for both adults and children. Yet because,
   as regards the effect of baptism in children, we find that certain
   theologians have held contrary opinions, some saying that by baptism
   guilt is indeed remitted in infants but grace is not conferred, others
   on the contrary asserting that both guilt is remitted and the virtues
   and sanctifying grace are infused with regard to habit though for the
   time being not with regard to use, we, considering the general efficacy
   of Christ's death, which through baptism is applied in like manner to
   all the baptised, choose, with the approval of the sacred council, the
   second opinion, which says that sanctifying grace and the virtues are
   conferred in baptism on both infants and adults, as more probable and
   more in harmony with the words of the saints and of modern doctors of
   theology.

   [2]. Abbots and other religious holding any major ecclesiastical office
   may not, when it is a question of priories or other places subject to
   them, bring an action against anyone on the authority of letters of the
   apostolic see or its legates, except in such places and before such
   persons as is permitted to the priors and other persons in charge of
   the priories and other places. Nor is anything else of this kind
   permissible in the case of places belonging to the table maintenance of
   these abbots and other religious, except when these places have special
   officials in charge of them. If anyone presumes to molest someone in
   contravention of the above, he is to be condemned by the judge of the
   case to pay the expenses and for any damage. Any process contrary to
   this decree is null and void.

   [3]. Although the chief official of a bishop, or a religious obtaining
   the office of conventual prior (even though that office is not
   customarily elective), may be delegated by the apostolic see or its
   legate, nevertheless we do not wish this to be observed in the cases of
   an official-forane or of a religious who is the claustal prior of his
   monastery.

   [4]. Since prelates of religious orders occasionally neglect to fill
   vacant priories, churches, offices or other benefices pertaining to
   their disposition within the time prescribed by the Lateran council,
   the local diocesan bishops shall supply for this negligence by their
   own authority in the case of the non-exempt, and by apostolic authority
   in the case of the exempt. Those which have customarily been governed
   by the secular clergy shall be conferred on secular clerics, those
   which have usually been entrusted to or conferred on only religious
   shall be conferred on the religious of the monasteries whose prelates
   were negligent. The diocesan bishops, by the same authority, shall in
   no way permit the said prelates to apply such priories, churches,
   offices or benefices to their table maintenance, to impose new payments
   or to increase the old ones any new ones imposed or old ones increased
   shall be paid back. By the said priories, churches, offices and
   benefices we mean those that are not for the table maintenance of their
   prelates and customarily have their own priors, administrators or
   rectors, even though these priors and administrators can be freely
   recalled, if necessary, to the cloister.

   In this matter we have decided to uphold the constitution of our
   predecessor pope Boniface VIII, which prohibits the property of vacant
   benefices to be appropriated by prelates or anyone else, as well as
   that other constitution of the same Boniface which forbids any
   religious to have several priories or churches with the cure of souls,
   even though the cure is exercised by someone other than himself and
   there is no danger to souls for the priories.

   [5]. So that those who are obliged to divine office in cathedrals or
   secular collegiate churches, or will be so obliged in the future, may
   be more readily moved to receive sacred orders, we decree that nobody
   henceforth may have in such churches a voice in the chapter, even
   though this is freely granted to him by the others, unless he has
   received at least the subdiaconate. Moreover, those who now hold
   peacefully dignities, parsonages, offices or prebends to which certain
   orders are annexed, or will hold them in future, shall have no voice in
   the chapter unless, having no just impediment, they receive the
   corresponding orders within a year. They shall receive only half the
   payment made to those who assist at certain hours, all customs and
   statutes to the contrary notwithstanding. The penalties, moreover,
   which are decreed by law against those refusing to be promoted to
   orders, are to remain in force.

   [6]. We wish to check, in the cases mentioned below, the expensive
   prolongation of lawsuits which, as experience teaches us, arises
   sometimes from over-precise observance of judicial order. We therefore
   decree that in cases concerning elections, postulations, or provisions,
   concerning dignities, parsonages, offices, canonries, prebends or any
   other church benefices, concerning tithes, even when those obliged to
   pay them have been admonished and can be corrected by ecclesiastical
   censure, and concerning matrimony or usury and anything connected with
   it, that a simple, easy process shall be valid without the noise and
   rhetoric of a court of justice. We wish this decree to apply not only
   to future business but also to the present, and even to cases awaiting
   appeal.

   [7].Although it is generally forbidden by the sacred canons for a
   bishop to exercise jurisdiction in a diocese other than his own, we
   nevertheless make an exception for bishops who have been driven from
   their sees by the insolence of the ungodly and do not dare, from fear
   of their persecutors, to reside in their cities and dioceses or in any
   part of them, nor to exercise their jurisdiction there directly or
   through others. Lest the wrong done to their churches by their
   expulsions remains unpunished, we have considered it necessary to
   permit that in other dioceses, from cities or other prominent places
   near their churches, where they will be able to reside securely and to
   exercise freely their jurisdiction they may freely proceed against
   their expellers and their counsellors and supporters, as justice shall
   advise. (The cities and places must be such as are untroubled by these
   expellers and their counsellors and supporters. They are to be cited
   personally or to the bishop's house, if this can be done safely; if
   not, they are to be cited publicly in the cathedral church of the place
   or of their domicile.) If however the bishops have not dared to cite
   their expellers or their counsellors or supporters in this way, or if
   these have maliciously frustrated their being cited, it is lawful for
   the bishops to cite the expellers, counsellors and supporters, or to
   have them cited, on Sundays and festivals when the people assemble for
   divine worship, so that the accused may be presumed in all probability
   to have learned of the citation. This shall take place publicly in the
   churches of the cities or other prominent places, and then the bishops
   shall proceed against their persecutors, if they refuse to appear in
   the bishops' presence within a suitable fixed time, just as if the
   citation had been made legally elsewhere. We grant also to those
   bishops, lest justice suffer, authority to exercise full jurisdiction
   over their subjects from the other dioceses in which they have to stay,
   provided that they cannot or dare not do this, either directly or
   through someone else, in their own dioceses. The subjects, however,
   excluding the expellers or their counsellors and supporters, should not
   have to travel more than two days' journey from the boundary of their
   diocese. It is our will also that the bishops first seek permission
   from the diocesans of their places of exile; if they are not able to
   obtain this, they may nevertheless proceed as we have said. Of course
   if the said bishops have asserted that they did not dare to cite the
   expellers or their counsellors and supporters, personally or to the
   bishop's house, or publicly in their cathedral church, as has been
   said, or that they maliciously prevented the citation, or that the
   bishops cannot or dare not exercise jurisdiction in their dioceses
   either directly or through someone else against these persecutors, then
   we wish these assertions to be reliable, strictly enjoining the
   bishops, under threat of the divine judgment, that they do not assert
   or invent anything false or deceptive. The neighbouring bishops, when
   asked by the exiled bishops, should give notice or have notice given
   throughout their dioceses of the verdicts and the legal processes which
   the exiled bishops have judged necessary. No prejudice shall arise from
   the passage of time, or for any other reason, to the local ordinaries
   or to anyone else having jurisdiction in these places where the
   expelled bishops also exercise jurisdiction.

   [8]. We strictly command local ordinaries to admonish by name three
   times clerics who publicly and personally engage in the butcher's trade
   or conduct taverns, that they cease to do so within a reasonable time
   to be fixed by the ordinary and never resume such trades. If after
   admonition they do not leave off or if they resume them at any time,
   then as long as they persist in the above ways of life those who are
   married shall automatically lose all clerical privileges, and those who
   are unmarried shall automatically lose their clerical privileges
   relating to things, and if the latter go about in every way as laymen
   they shall also lose automatically their personal privileges as
   clerics. As for other clerics who apply themselves publicly to secular
   commerce and trade or any occupation inconsistent with the clerical
   state, or who carry arms, the ordinaries are to be diligent in
   observing the canons, so that these clerics may be restrained from such
   misconduct and they themselves may not be guilty of reprehensible
   negligence.

   [9]. Since he who abandons the dress proper to his order, and puts on
   other clothes and wears them in public, without a good reason, renders
   himself unworthy of the privileges of that order, we ordain by the
   present constitution that any cleric wearing striped or variegated
   clothes in public, without a good reason, is automatically suspended,
   if he is beneficed, from receiving the revenues of his benefices for a
   period of six months. If however he does not have a benefice but is in
   sacred orders below the priesthood, he becomes automatically
   disqualified for the same period from obtaining an ecclesiastical
   benefice. The same penalty applies to other clerics having the tonsure
   yet wearing such clothes in public. He who holds a dignity, a parsonage
   or another benefice to which the cure of souls is annexed, as also any
   other priests and religious, whose outward garb should reveal their
   inner integrity, who without reasonable cause wear such clothing in
   public, or appear thus with a woolen band or linen cap on their heads,
   are, if beneficed, automatically suspended for a year from receiving
   the revenues of their benefices. Such other priests and religious are
   also disqualified for the same period from obtaining any ecclesiastical
   benefices. These and any other clerics who wear a gown or tabard which
   is furred to the edge and so short that the lower garment is clearly
   seen, if they are secular clergy or religious with administrative
   posts, are obliged to give the gown to the poor within a month. The
   other religious who do not have administrative posts are obliged within
   the same period to consign the gown to their superiors, to be used for
   some pious purpose. If this is not done, the above penalties, of
   suspension in the case of the beneficed clergy and of disqualification
   in the case of the rest, are incurred for the above period of time. To
   this penalty we add that clerics, especially those with benefices, may
   not wear in public chequered, red or green boots.

   [10]. The following decretal, published a little while ago by our
   predecessor pope Boniface VIII, was revoked by our predecessor pope
   Benedict XI. Since, as results have proved, the revocation did not
   bring with it the peace hoped for by its author, but rather stimulated
   the discord which it was designed to allay, we annul it altogether and
   renew, with the insistence and approval of the sacred council, the said
   decretal published by Boniface which runs as follows.

   "Boniface, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for an everlasting
   record.

   "Having been placed by the divine clemency on the chair of pastoral
   preeminence, burdened though we are by the many arduous affairs which
   flow like a torrent from all directions into the Roman curia, summoned
   by many cares distracted by many proposals, we nevertheless aim
   ardently and devote ourselves with ever-active solicitude so that, to
   the glory of the divine name, the exaltation of the catholic faith and
   the profit of faithful souls, after the thorn-bushes of disagreement
   have been rooted out and the intricacies of quarrels removed, the
   tranquility of peace may thrive with the ardour of charity, and unity
   of heart and mind may grow and persist, between the bishops charged
   with the care and rule of the Lord's flock and other persons in the
   clerical state. We know, and experience teaches us, that only in time
   of peace is the author of peace duly worshipped, nor are we ignorant
   that dissensions and scandals prepare the way to wicked acts, stir up
   rancour and hatred, and give boldness to evil living. For a long time
   past there has existed between prelates and rectors or priests and
   clerics of parish churches throughout the different provinces of the
   world on the one hand, and the friars Preacher and Minor on the other,
   grave and dangerous discord, produced by that enemy of peace, the sower
   of cockle, in the matters of preaching to the faithful, hearing their
   confessions, enjoining penances, and burying the dead who choose to be
   buried in the churches or lands of the friars.

   "As an affectionate father rightly suffers with his children, we
   carefully considered and turned over in our mind the great danger and
   loss that such discord brings, and how detestable it is in the sight of
   the divine majesty. We therefore intend with all the energy of fatherly
   care to eradicate and remove it wholly, so that with the Lord's favour
   it may never revive in the future. We desire greatly that this
   business, so close to our heart, may be beneficially and speedily
   completed by apostolic sagacity. After careful deliberation with our
   brothers, we decree and ordain, with the advice of our brothers and by
   our apostolic authority, to the honour of God and the exaltation of the
   catholic faith and for the peaceful condition of the aforesaid parties
   and the salvation of the souls of the faithful, that the friars of the
   said orders may freely preach and explain the word of God to the clergy
   and the people in their churches and other places as also in public
   places, except at that hour only when the local prelates wish to preach
   or have someone to give a special sermon in their presence; at this
   hour they shall not preach, except the prelates decide otherwise and
   give special permission. In institutes of general studies, where it is
   customary to give a special sermon to the clergy on certain days, at
   funerals, and on special feasts of the friars, they are at liberty to
   preach, unless perhaps during the hour when it is customary to preach
   to the clergy in the above places the bishop or a higher prelate should
   summon the clergy in general to his presence, or for some urgent reason
   should assemble them. In parish churches, however, the said friars may
   not preach or explain God's word, unless invited or called to do so by
   the priests of the parishes, and with their good will and assent, or
   having asked and obtained permission, unless the bishop or higher
   prelate should through them commission a friar to preach.

   "By the same authority we also decree and ordain that in each city and
   diocese in which the friars have houses, or in neighbouring cities and
   dioceses where they have no houses, the masters and priors provincial
   of the Preachers or their vicars, and the ministers general and
   provincial and the guardians of the Minors, should gather in the
   presence of the prelates of those places either personally or through
   friars whom they judge will be suitable delegates, and humbly request
   that friars chosen for the purpose may freely hear the confessions of
   those of the prelates' subjects who wish to confess to them, may impose
   salutary penances as they shall think right in God's eyes, and may
   grant absolution to them, with the leave, favour and good will of the
   prelates. The masters, priors, provincials and ministers of the orders
   are then to choose diligently sufficient persons who are suitable, of
   approved life, discreet, modest and skilled for such a salutary
   ministry and office. These they are to present or have presented to the
   prelates that by their leave, favour and good will, they may hear the
   confessions of those wishing to confess to them in the prelates' cities
   and dioceses, impose salutary penances and grant absolution, as has
   been said above. They are by no means to hear confessions outside the
   cities and dioceses for which they were appointed. We want them to be
   appointed for cities and dioceses, not for provinces. The number of
   persons to be chosen for this ministry ought to be in proportion to
   that which the number of clergy and people demands.

   "If the prelates grant the permission requested for hearing
   confessions, the said masters, ministers and others shall receive it
   with thanks, and the persons chosen should carry out the duties
   entrusted to them. If the prelates do not accept one of the friars
   presented to them, another may and should be presented in his place.
   But if the prelates issue a general refusal to the friars chosen, we
   graciously grant, from the fullness of our apostolic power, that they
   may freely and lawfully hear the confessions of those wishing to
   confess to them and impose salutary penances, and then impart
   absolution. By this permission, however, we by no means intend to give
   more ample power to such friars than is granted by law to the parish
   clergy, unless perhaps the prelates of the churches think that such
   power should be given to them.

   "To this decree and regulation of ours we add that the friars of the
   said orders may provide free burial everywhere in their churches and
   cemeteries, that is they may receive for burial all who have chosen
   these places for their burial. Yet, lest parish churches and their
   clergy, whose office it is to administer the sacraments and to whom it
   belongs by law to preach God's word and to hear the confessions of the
   faithful, should be denied their due and necessary benefits, since the
   labourer deserves his wages, we decree and ordain by the same apostolic
   authority, that the friars are obliged to give the parish clergy a
   fourth part of all the income from funerals and from everything left to
   them, expressly or not, for whatever definite purpose, even from such
   bequests of which a fourth or canonical part is not claimed by custom
   or by law, and also a fourth part of bequests made at the death or at
   the point of death of the giver, whether directly or through a third
   party. We set and also limit this amount to the fourth part by our
   apostolic authority. The friars are to see to it that bequests are not
   left to others from whom this fourth part is not owed, to the advantage
   or interest of the friars themselves, nor go in this way as gifts to
   these others; and that they do not arrange for that which would be
   given at death or in illness to the friars, to be given to themselves
   while the donors are healthy. We intend to prevent anything of this
   kind by binding the friars' consciences, so that if, which God forbid,
   any deceit or fraud has been practised by the friars themselves,
   contrary to their obligation to the said priests, rectors and pastors,
   a strict account will be demanded at the last judgment. The rectors of
   parishes, pastors and prelates may not, however, exact more than this
   portion, nor are the friars obliged to pay more, nor may they be
   compelled by anyone to do so.

   "In order that everything may go forward evenly and peacefully with the
   Lord's favour, we revoke, void, annul and invalidate completely all the
   privileges, favours and indults granted orally or in writing, in any
   form or expression of words, by ourself or our predecessors as Roman
   pontiffs to any of the said orders, and also customs, agreements and
   contracts, in so far as these are contrary to the above provisions or
   any one of them. We declare all such privileges to be null and void.
   Furthermore, by this present decree, we earnestly ask and exhort,
   indeed we strictly command, all prelates of churches, of whatever
   pre-eminence, status or dignity, and the parish priests, pastors and
   rectors, out of their reverence for God and the apostolic see, to show
   friendliness to these orders and their members, not being difficult,
   severe, hard or austere to the friars, but rather gracious, favourable
   and kind, showing them a spirit of holy generosity. They should accept
   the friars as suitable fellow-workers in the office of preaching and
   explaining God's word and in everything else mentioned above, admitting
   them with ready kindness and affection to a share in their labours, so
   as to increase their reward of eternal happiness and the fruitful
   harvest of souls. Nor let them be unaware that if perhaps they act
   otherwise, the kindness of the apostolic see, which honours these
   orders and their members with great favour and holds them in its heart,
   will with good reason be roused against them, nor can it tolerate with
   good will such behaviour without applying a suitable remedy. The
   indignation, moreover, of the heavenly king, the just rewarder, whom
   the friars serve with all earnestness, will not be lacking."

   [11]. There are religious who presume to usurp by cunning fraud, or
   under a feigned title, tithes on newly tilled land or other tithes
   owing to churches, to which they have no legal claim, or who do not
   permit or even forbid tithes to be paid to the churches on animals
   belonging to their familiars and shepherds or others whose animals
   intermingle with their flocks, or on animals which they buy in many
   places and then hand over to the keeping of sellers or others, thus
   defrauding the churches, or on land the cultivation of which they have
   entrusted to others. If such religious, after claim has been made by
   those whom it concerns, do not desist within a month from the above
   practices, or if they do not make fitting satisfaction to the defrauded
   churches within two months, they are and remain suspended from their
   offices, administrative posts and benefices until they have desisted
   and made satisfaction, as stated above. If these religious have no
   administrative posts or benefices, they incur, in place of suspension,
   the sentence of excommunication, from which they cannot receive
   absolution before making due satisfaction, notwithstanding privileges
   to the contrary. We do not wish, however, this decree to apply where
   animals are held by oblates of the religious, provided that these
   oblates have given themselves and their possessions to the religious.

   [12]. If a tithe on the benefices of anyone be granted for a time, the
   tithe can and should be raised in accordance with the customary valuing
   of the tithe in the regions in which the grant is made, and in the
   money generally current. We do not wish the chalices of churches, books
   and other equipment destined for divine worship to be taken or received
   as security or distraint by the collectors, raisers or exactors of the
   tithe, nor are such objects to be distrained or seized in any way.

   [13]. In order that those who profess poverty in any order may
   persevere more readily in the vocation to which they have been called,
   and that those who have gone over to a non-mendicant order may apply
   themselves to live there more peacefully the more the ambition which
   produces discord and division is checked, we decree, with the approval
   of the sacred council, that any mendicants, who even with apostolic
   authority shall go over to non-mendicant orders in the future or have
   hitherto done so, even though they now hold the office of prior or
   obedientiary or other offices, or have any care or government of souls
   in the non-mendicant order, shall have no voice or place in the
   chapter, even though this be granted freely to them by the others. They
   may not continue to hold the office of prior or obedientiary or other
   offices previously held, even as vicar or minister or deputy, nor may
   they have the care or government of souls either directly or on behalf
   of others. All actions contrary to this decree shall be automatically
   null and void, notwithstanding any privilege whatsoever. We do not
   however wish this constitution to extend to those mendicant orders
   which the apostolic see has allowed to continue on condition that they
   admit no more persons to profession, and to which it has granted a
   general permission for passing to other approved orders.

   [14]. That nothing unbecoming or corrupt find its way into that field
   of the Lord, namely the sacred order of the black monks, or anything
   grow into a ruinous crop, but rather that the flowers of honour and
   integrity may there produce much fruit, we decree as follows.

   We forbid the monks all excess or irregularity with regard to clothes,
   food, drink, bedding and horses. We decree that the upper garment next
   to their habit should be black, brown or white, according to the custom
   of the region in which they live. The quality of the cloth should not
   exceed monastic moderation, nor should they seek what is expensive and
   fine, but what is practical. The garment itself should be round and not
   slit, neither too long nor too short; it should have broad sleeves
   extending to the hands, not sewn or buttoned in any way. The monks
   should be content with an almuce of black cloth or fur in place of a
   hood together with the hood of the habit which they wear, or by
   arrangement of the abbot they may wear unpretentious hoods which are
   open over the shoulders. They should not wear silk in place of fur.
   They may use large summer shoes or high boots for their footwear. None
   shall presume to wear an ornate belt, knife or spurs, or ride a horse
   with the saddle highly ornamented with nails or sumptuous in any other
   way, or with a decorative iron bridle.

   In communities in which there are twelve monks or more, the abbot,
   prior or other superior may wear within the monastery walls a frock of
   the cloth customarily used for the frocks and cowls of the monastery;
   other monks in monasteries where frocks are customarily worn should use
   them also. In other monasteries, however, and in houses and priories
   where there is a smaller community, they should wear cowls which are
   closed and of becoming appearance. When the abbots, priors or other
   superiors and other monks set foot outside the monastery, they should
   wear a frock or a cowl or a closed cloak; if they wear the cloak, they
   should wear underneath it a cowl or, if they prefer, a scapular. When
   they put on albs or sacred vestments in order to minister at the divine
   offices, or when they are engaged in work, they may wear the scapular.
   Lest any uncertainty arises from the different meanings in different
   regions of the world of the words cowl and frock, we declare that by
   cowl we understand a long and full habit without sleeves, and by frock
   we understand a habit with long full sleeves.

   At least once every month, both inside and outside the monastery, each
   and all of the monks must go to confession, and on the first Sunday of
   each month they should receive communion in the monastery, except for
   some reason which they should make known to the abbot, prior or
   confessor in the monastery; they should abide by his decision. When the
   rule is read in chapter, it is to be explained in the vernacular by him
   who presides, or by someone else appointed by him, for the sake of the
   younger monks. The novices shall have a competent instructor in the
   divine offices and in regular observance.

   All shall always abstain from hunting and fowling. They shall not be
   present at them, nor presume to have hunting-dogs or birds of prey in
   their keeping or in that of others, nor permit familiars living with
   them to keep them, unless the monastery has woods, game preserves or
   warrens, or has the right to hunt on property belonging to others, in
   which there might be rabbits or other wild animals. They are then
   permitted to keep such dogs and birds, as long as they do not keep the
   hunting-dogs in the monastery or the houses in which they live or
   within the cloister, and the monks themselves do not appear at the
   hunt.

   If someone rashly violates the above regulations, he shall be subject
   to the regular discipline. If he presumes to wear unlaced high shoes,
   or a hood not open as aforesaid, he is also suspended from conferring
   benefices for a year, if he is an abbot or a prior who does not have an
   abbot above him; if anyone else, he is suspended for a year from
   administrative office, if he holds any. If he has no administrative
   office, he is automatically disqualified for a year from holding such
   office or an ecclesiastical benefice. If any are deliberately present
   at rowdy hunting or fowling or occupied in other ways with dogs and
   birds, they incur automatic suspension and disqualification, according
   to the above distinction of persons, for two years. If the abbot or
   prior has been suspended from conferring benefices, this devolves, with
   the counsel and assent of the community or its greater part, on the
   claustral prior.

   Some monks, as we hear, throw off the sweet yoke of regular observance
   and leave their monasteries, feigning that they cannot securely remain
   there, or under some other pretext, to wander about the courts of
   princes. Unless these monks' superiors grant them the pension or
   subsidy which they ask for, the monks conspire against their superiors,
   betray them or otherwise oppress them, bring about their capture and
   imprisonment, have their own monasteries burned, and occasionally even
   presume to seize in whole or in great part the property of the
   monastery. We wish to counter such unprincipled audacity. We forbid, by
   this perpetual edict, that monks and canons regular who are not
   administrators should presume, without special leave of their
   superiors, to betake themselves to the courts of princes. If, in order
   to do harm to their superiors or monasteries, they presume to go to
   such courts, we determine that they incur automatic excommunication. We
   nevertheless strictly enjoin on their superiors to restrain them with
   all diligence from visiting the said courts and from any wandering
   about; they are to correct severely those who do not obey. We decree
   that monks who keep arms inside their monastery, without leave of their
   abbot, incur the same sentence.

   Following in the footsteps of our predecessors, we forbid by a
   perpetual edict that monks presume to live alone in houses and priories
   of which they have charge. If the incomes of such priories and houses
   do not suffice for the support of two, then, unless the abbots make
   them sufficient, let the local ordinaries, with the advice and consent
   of the abbots, unite these houses and priories with neighbouring places
   belonging to the monasteries, or with offices of the monasteries, or
   with one another, as will be most convenient. The monks of the places
   which will be united to others are first to be recalled to their
   monastery, and due provision is to be made, from the incomes of the
   said places, for the clergy who are to serve there. Furthermore,
   conventual priories cannot be conferred or entrusted to anyone under
   twenty-five, and non-conventual priories having the care of souls, even
   if that care is exercised by secular priests, to anyone under twenty.
   Those who hold priories of either kind are to have themselves ordained
   priest within a year from the time of their collation or commission and
   taking possession, or before the age of twenty-five if they are
   entrusted with or collated to non-conventual priories when they are
   under that age. If they have not done this, and are without reasonable
   excuse, they are deprived of the said priories, even without previous
   admonition, and the priories may not be conferred on them again that
   time. Nobody may be given or entrusted with a priory or an
   administrative post unless he has previously made profession in a
   monastic order. Those appointed to priories or administrative posts
   outside the monastery are not permitted to remain in the monastery and
   are obliged to reside where they hold office, notwithstanding any
   contrary custom, unless they are excused for a time from this residence
   for some reasonable cause, such as studies. In order to promote divine
   worship, we decree that every monk, at the command of his abbot, should
   have himself raised to all the sacred orders, unless there is some
   lawful excuse. Further, in order that the monks may not be deprived of
   the opportunity to make progress in knowledge, there should be in each
   monastery which has sufficient means a suitable master to instruct them
   carefully in the primary branches of knowledge.

   All the foregoing, and those things which our predecessor pope Innocent
   III of happy memory decreed for greater religious observance in the
   monastic state, regarding clothing, poverty, silence, the eating of
   meat, the triennial chapter, and anything else, we approve, renew and
   expressly wish and decree to be strictly observed.

   [15]. Considering that where discipline is despised, religion suffers
   shipwreck, we have thought it especially necessary to provide that such
   contempt produces nothing discordant in those who have dedicated
   themselves to Christ by vow, staining the good name of religious life
   and offending the divine majesty. We therefore, with the approval of
   this sacred council, have judged it wise to decree that every convent
   of nuns should be visited each year by their ordinary as follows:
   exempt convents subject to the apostolic see alone, by the authority of
   that see; non-exempt convents by the ordinary's authority, and other
   exempt convents, by the authority to whom they are subject. The
   visitors are to be very careful that the nuns- some of whom, to our
   sorrow, we have heard are transgressors- do not wear silk, various furs
   or sandals; do not wear their hair long in a horn-shaped style, nor
   make use of striped and multicoloured caps, do not attend dances and
   the banquets of seculars, do not go walking through the streets and
   towns by day or night; and do not lead a luxurious life in other ways.
   They shall carefully withdraw the nuns from the excesses and
   allurements of this world and persuade them to devote themselves in
   their convents to the cultivation of the virtues which is due to the
   Lord. We order the visitors to compel the nuns to observe all this by
   suitable measures, notwithstanding exemptions and privileges of any
   kind, without prejudice however to these exemptions in other respects.
   We also decree that anyone chosen for the office of abbess in those
   convents where it is customary for abbesses to be blessed, should
   receive that blessing within a year from the time of her confirmation
   in office. If she does not, unless there be reasonable cause, she has
   completely lost her right, and provision is to be made canonically for
   the monastery to be provided with an abbess by those to whom this
   belongs. We also order, by our apostolic authority, that those women
   who are commonly called secular canonesses and who lead a life like
   that of secular canons, making no renunciation of private property and
   no profession, should be visited by the local ordinaries, who are to
   visit the non-exempt on their own authority and the exempt on the
   authority of the apostolic see. By this, however, we are not intending
   to approve the status, rule or order of secular canonesses. We command
   the visitors, in making their visitation, to be content with two
   notaries and two persons from their own church and four other men of
   undoubted honour and maturity. Those who presume to hinder the visitors
   in their task or any part of it, unless they repent on being
   admonished, incur automatic excommunication, notwithstanding any
   privileges, statutes and customs to the contrary. '

   [16]. The women commonly known as Beguines, since they promise
   obedience to nobody, nor renounce possessions, nor profess any approved
   rule are not religious at all, although they wear the special dress of
   Beguines and attach themselves to certain religious to whom they have a
   special attraction. We have heard from trustworthy sources that there
   are some Beguines who seem to be led by a particular insanity. They
   argue and preach on the holy Trinity and the divine essence, and
   express opinions contrary to the catholic faith with regard to the
   articles of faith and the sacraments of the church. These Beguines thus
   ensnare many simple people, leading them into various errors. They
   generate numerous other dangers to souls under the cloak of sanctity.
   We have frequently received unfavourable reports of their teaching and
   justly regard them with suspicion. With the approval of the sacred
   council, we perpetually forbid their mode of life and remove it
   completely from the church of God. We expressly enjoin on these and
   other women, under pain of excommunication to be incurred
   automatically, that they no longer follow this way of life under any
   form, even if they adopted it long ago, or take it up anew. We strictly
   forbid, under the same penalty, the religious mentioned above, who are
   said to have favoured these women and persuaded them to adopt the
   Beguinage way of life, to give in any way counsel, help or favour to
   women already following this way of life or taking it up anew; no
   privilege is to avail against the above. Of course we in no way intend
   by the foregoing to forbid any faithful women, whether they promise
   chastity or not, from living uprightly in their hospices, wishing to
   live a life of penance and serving the Lord of hosts in a spirit of
   humility. This they may do, as the Lord inspires them.

   [17]. It happens now and then that those in charge of hospices,
   leper-houses almshouses or hospitals disregard the care of such places
   and fail to loosen the hold of those who have usurped the goods,
   possessions and rights of these places. They indeed permit them to slip
   and be lost completely and the buildings to fall into ruin. They have
   no care that these places were founded and endowed by the faithful so
   that the poor and lepers might find a home and be supported by the
   revenues. They have the barbarity to refuse this charity, criminally
   turning the revenues to their own use, even though that which has been
   given by the faithful for a certain purpose should, except by authority
   of the apostolic see, be applied to that purpose and no other.
   Detesting such neglect and abuse, we decree, with the approval of the
   sacred council, that they to whom the duty belongs by right or by
   statute laid down at the foundation of these places, or by lawful
   custom, or by privilege of the apostolic see, should strive to reform
   these places in all that has been referred to above. They are to
   restore what has been seized, lost and alienated. They should compel
   the persons in charge to receive the poor people and maintain them in
   accordance with the resources and revenues of the places. If they are
   remiss in this, we enjoin on the local ordinaries, even if the
   institutions enjoy the privilege of exemption, to fulfil each and all
   of the foregoing, either directly or through others, and to compel the
   nonexempt rectors by their own authority and the exempt and otherwise
   privileged rectors by the authority of the apostolic see. Those who
   object, of whatever state or condition they may be, and those who give
   them counsel, help or favour, are to be checked by ecclesiastical
   censure and other legal remedies. By this, however, we do not impair
   the validity of exemptions or privileges in relation to other matters.

   In order that the above may be more readily observed, none of these
   places shall be conferred as benefices on secular clerics, even though
   this may have been observed as a custom (which we utterly condemn),
   unless it was otherwise determined at the foundation or unless the post
   is to be filled by election. But let these institutions be governed by
   prudent suitable men of good repute, who have the knowledge, good will
   and ability to rule the institutions, to take care of their property
   and defend their rights to advantage, to distribute their revenues
   faithfully for the use of needy persons, and who are not likely to
   divert the property to other uses. We lay these responsibilities on the
   consciences of those entrusted with these places, calling on the
   witness of the divine judgment. Those who are entrusted with the
   government or administration of such places shall also take an oath,
   after the manner of guardians, and make inventories of the property
   belonging to the place, and give an account each year of their
   administration to the ordinaries or others to whom these places are
   subject, or to their representatives. If anyone attempts to act
   otherwise, we decree that the appointment, provision or arrangement is
   null and void.

   We do not wish, however, the foregoing to apply to the hospices of
   military or religious orders. For these hospices we order those in
   charge of them, in virtue of holy obedience, to provide in them for the
   poor in accordance with the institutes and ancient observances of their
   orders, and to show themselves duly hospitable. They shall be compelled
   to do this by strict disciplinary measures of their superiors,
   notwithstanding any statute or custom. Furthermore, our intention is
   that, if there are hospices which have had from old times an altar or
   altars and a cemetery, with priests who celebrate divine services and
   administer the sacraments to the poor, or if the parish priests have
   been accustomed to do this, these ancient customs are to be retained.

   [18]. We wish the constitution to be observed which forbids that anyone
   even at the presentation of exempt religious, be admitted to some
   church, contrary custom notwithstanding, unless a portion of the
   revenues of that church has been assigned to him in the presence of the
   diocesan bishop, wherewith he may be able to meet his obligations to
   the bishop and have a suitable means of livelihood. We are therefore
   taking care, with the approval of the sacred council, to explain the
   constitution and to add certain considerations. Thus we strictly
   forbid, adjuring the divine judgment, diocesan bishops to admit anyone
   presented by any ecclesiastical person having the right of presentation
   to some church, unless within a certain suitable period, set beforehand
   by the bishop for the presenter, the one presented is assigned, in the
   bishop's presence, a suitable portion of the revenues. If the one
   presenting neglects to assign this within the period, we decree, lest
   this neglect harm the presentee, that the bishop should then admit him,
   unless there is some other canonical obstacle, and the power of
   assigning is to devolve on the bishop as a penalty against the
   presenter. We admonish however the diocesan bishops, adjuring the
   divine judgment, and we lay it on their consciences, that they act
   justly in assigning this portion, nor are they to be knowingly swayed
   by hatred or favour or in any other way to assign more or less than
   what is due. Of course in the churches of priories or of other places,
   regular as well as secular, in which religious or others, to whom the
   revenues belong, have been accustomed to carry the burdens mentioned
   above the above instructions are not to be observed; but the said
   religious and others are obliged to undertake all the burdens which
   would lie upon the permanent priests or vicars if the portion had been
   assigned to them, to treat the priests and vicars correctly, and to
   provide them with adequate and fitting sustenance. We wish the diocesan
   bishops to compel the religious and others by ecclesiastical censure to
   full observance of all this, including the assignation of a just
   portion by the bishop if the religious and others fail to do this
   themselves, notwithstanding any exemptions, privileges, customs or
   statutes, which we wish to be of no avail to the religious and others
   with regard to the above.

   [19]. Since it is only reasonable that those who enjoy advantages
   should not refuse the burdens connected with them, we decree by the
   following inviolable constitution that any religious who have in any
   way obtained monasteries or churches, should take care to pay the
   procurations of legates of the apostolic see and the obligations to
   bishops and others which were in force before they took possession,
   unless they are excused by privilege of the apostolic see, exemption or
   other lawful cause. We do not wish, however, that such privileges or
   exemptions should be extended to monasteries or churches which they may
   happen to acquire in the future.

   [20]. We have heard with sorrow that prelates visiting the monasteries
   of the Cistercian order, although charitably received and courteously
   served with all that is needful, are nevertheless not content with the
   food prescribed by the monastic rule. Contrary to the privileges of the
   said order they demand meat and if it is not served to them, they
   obtain it by force. Although they receive suitable alms in these
   monasteries, the prelates procure more for themselves against the will
   of the religious, sometimes even in places where neither custom nor law
   provide a title to procurations. They demand and extort money for their
   horses to be shoed, even when this is unnecessary, and their cooks
   demand and extort money by reason of their office; nor do they observe
   the arrangements made between the prelates and the monks concerning
   procurations.

   In receiving the procurations they are so oppressive that in one short
   hour they consume what would last the community for a long time. They
   have with them, while they are receiving the procurations, their
   hunting-dogs, falcons and hawks. Unless their demands are met, the
   doors of monasteries or churches are often violently broken and the
   ornaments of the church are carried off. Without any privilege from the
   apostolic see they receive several procurations in one day occasionally
   paid in money, even without making a visitation; and on the occasion of
   these procurations they often demand from the monks what these are not
   obliged to pay them, laying on the monks an intolerable burden. There
   are also some prelates who impose on exempt and other religious the
   greater part of procurations due to nuncios of the apostolic see and
   other extraordinary burdens, in order to free themselves and secular
   priests, without any consultation with the religious about dividing the
   load. In many other ways the said prelates oppress exempt monasteries
   and churches which are subject to these monasteries in both civil and
   canon law, in receiving their procurations and in imposing unaccustomed
   burdens.

   We wish therefore to provide a suitable remedy for this state of
   affairs. We decree, with the approval of the sacred council, that if
   the bishops come to the said monasteries not for visitation but for
   hospitality, they should receive graciously the refreshment offered in
   charity to them. But if the bishops come to these monasteries and
   receive the procurations due to them by common law custom, privilege or
   any other law, they may if they wish be served with meat on days when
   it is permitted, in the houses of the monasteries if these are
   available, but outside the monastic precincts, notwithstanding any
   privilege to the contrary; if the houses are not available, they may be
   served within the monastic precincts but not inside the religious door,
   as it is called. Nor do we consider it unbecoming if the fragments
   which are collected from the tables of the bishops and the members of
   their households are collected up and given by the bishops' almoners to
   the poor of the area. The prelates are carefully to refrain from all
   the other oppressions mentioned above, if they wish to avoid the
   indignation of God and of the apostolic see.

   [21]. By the present constitution we order local ordinaries, when the
   matter becomes known to them, to publish or have published by their
   subjects the sentences of excommunication and interdict pronounced by
   law against those who, either on their own initiative or at the command
   of others, exact or extort tolls or imposts, to the danger of their own
   souls and the disadvantage of those they oppress, from churches or
   ecclesiastical persons for goods that are their own, which they are not
   carrying or having carried or sending for the purposes of trade. They
   shall continue to publish such sentences until restitution is made for
   the exactions and fitting satisfaction is given.

   [22]. We are gravely disturbed that, owing to the negligence of some
   rectors, their subjects fear no punishment and so are encouraged in bad
   behaviour. Many ministers of churches have cast aside clerical modesty.
   They ought to offer to God a sacrifice of praise, the fruit of their
   lips, in purity of conscience and devotion of mind. Instead they
   presume to say or chant the canonical hours in a hurried manner,
   omitting parts, mingling with them conversation which is mostly vain,
   profane and unbecoming. They come late to choir, or often leave the
   church without good reason before the end of the office, occasionally
   carrying birds or having them carried and bringing hunting-dogs with
   them. As if regardless of their clerical obligations, they presume to
   celebrate or be present at office, even though tonsured and vested,
   with an utter lack of devotion. There are some, both clergy and laity,
   especially on the vigil of certain feasts when they ought to be in
   church persevering in prayer, who are not afraid to hold licentious
   dances in the cemeteries of the churches and occasionally to sing
   ballads and perpetrate many excesses. From this sometimes there follows
   the violation of churches and cemeteries, disgraceful conduct and
   various crimes; and the liturgical office is greatly disturbed, to the
   offence of the divine majesty and the scandal of the people nearby. In
   many churches also the vessels, vestments and other articles necessary
   for divine worship are, considering the churches' means, unworthy.

   We do not wish these transgressions to increase and become a bad
   example to others. We therefore, with the approval of the sacred
   council, forbid these practices. We decree that those whose duty it is-
   namely the local ordinaries for the non-exempt and the superiors for
   the exempt and otherwise privileged-must exercise watchful, care to get
   rid of all negligence and carelessness, to reform the above-mentioned
   things and to correct each of them. Also, the day and night office is
   to be devoutly chanted at the proper hours in cathedrals and in regular
   and collegiate churches, and in other churches it is to be fittingly
   and duly celebrated, if ordinaries and superiors wish to avoid the
   indignation of God and of the apostolic see. They are to curb, if they
   have jurisdiction, those who oppose correction, by ecclesiastical
   censure and other suitable remedies. In this and other matters which
   concern the worship of God and the reform of morals, and also the
   honourable reputation of churches and cemeteries, they are to see to
   it, as far as duty binds them, that the sacred canons are inviolably
   observed, and they shall take care to be well acquainted with these
   canons.'

   [23]. We think it altogether right and fitting that clerics, both
   religious and others, who belong to the household of a cardinal of the
   holy Roman church or of any bishop in communion with the apostolic see,
   should join with them in the divine office. We therefore concede, with
   the approval of the sacred council, that these clerics may lawfully say
   the same office as the cardinal or bishop, nor are they obliged to say
   any other.

   [24]. Among the cares lying heavily on us there is one on which we
   reflect constantly: how we may lead the erring into the way of truth
   and win them for God with the help of his grace. This is what we seek
   earnestly and longingly, to this we direct our mind with great zeal, to
   this we are alert with an ever-attentive enthusiasm. We are in no doubt
   that to attain our desire, the word of God should be fittingly
   explained and preached to great advantage. Nor are we unaware that the
   word of God is learned in vain and returns empty to the speaker if it
   is directed to the ears of those ignorant of the speaker's language. We
   are therefore following the example of him whom we, though unworthy,
   represent on earth. He wished that his apostles, going through the
   whole world to evangelize, should have a knowledge of every tongue. We
   desire earnestly that holy church should be well supplied with catholic
   scholars acquainted with the languages most in use by unbelievers.
   These scholars should know how to train unbelievers in the Christian
   way of life, and to make them members of the Christian body through
   instruction in the faith and reception of sacred baptism.

   In order, then, that skill in these languages be attained by suitable
   instruction, we have stipulated, with the approval of the sacred
   council, that schools be established for the following languages
   wherever the Roman curia happens to reside and also at Paris, Oxford,
   Bologna and Salamanca: that is, we decree that in each of these places
   there should be catholic scholars with adequate knowledge of Hebrew,
   Arabic and Chaldaic. There are to be two experts for each language in
   each place. They shall direct the schools, make faithful translations
   of books from these languages into Latin, and teach others those
   languages with all earnestness, passing on a skilful use of the
   language, so that after such instruction these others may, God
   inspiring, produce the harvest hoped for, propagating the saving faith
   among the heathen peoples. The salaries and expenses of these lecturers
   in the Roman curia will be provided by the apostolic see, those at
   Paris by the king of France, and those at Oxford, Bologna and Salamanca
   by the prelates, monasteries, chapters, convents, exempt and nonexempt
   colleges, and rectors of churches, of England, Scotland, Ireland and
   Wales, of Italy, and of Spain respectively. The burden of contributing
   shall be imposed on each in accordance with the needs of the faculties,
   notwithstanding any contrary privileges and exemptions, which however
   we do not wish to be impaired in other respects.

   [25]. It is an insult to the holy name and a disgrace to the Christian
   faith that in certain parts of the world subject to Christian princes
   where Saracens live, sometimes apart, sometimes intermingled with
   Christians, the Saracen priests commonly called Zabazala, in their
   temples or mosques, in which the Saracens meet to adore the infidel
   Mahomet, loudly invoke and extol his name each day at certain hours
   from a high place, in the hearing of both Christians and Saracens and
   there make public declarations in his honour. There is a place,
   moreover, where once was buried a certain Saracen whom other Saracens
   venerate as a saint. A great number of Saracens flock there quite
   openly from far and near. This brings disrepute on our faith and gives
   great scandal to the faithful. These practices cannot be tolerated any
   further without displeasing the divine majesty. We therefore, with the
   sacred council's approval, strictly forbid such practices henceforth in
   Christian lands. We enjoin on catholic princes, one and all, who hold
   sovereignty over the said Saracens and in whose territory these
   practices occur, and we lay on them a pressing obligation under the
   divine judgment that, as true Catholics and zealous for the Christian
   faith, they give consideration to the disgrace heaped on both them and
   other Christians. They are to remove this offence altogether from their
   territories and take care that their subjects remove it, so that they
   may thereby attain the reward of eternal happiness. They are to forbid
   expressly the public invocation of the sacrilegious name of Mahomet.
   They shall also forbid anyone in their dominions to attempt in future
   the said pilgrimage or in any way give countenance to it. Those who
   presume to act otherwise are to be so chastised by the princes for
   their irreverence, that others may be deterred from such boldness.

   [26]. The apostolic see has received many complaints that some
   inquisitors, appointed by it to suppress heresy, have overstepped the
   limits of the power given to them. They occasionally so enlarge their
   authority that what has been wisely provided by the apostolic see for
   the growth of the faith, oppresses the innocent under pretext of piety
   and results in harm to the faithful. The work of the inquisition will
   be the more successful the more solemnly, diligently and cautiously its
   investigations are prosecuted. We decree therefore, for the glory of
   God and the increase of the faith, that this work will be done by both
   diocesan bishops and by inquisitors appointed by the apostolic see. All
   worldly affection hatred and fear shall be put aside, as also any
   seeking of temporal advantage. We decree that the bishops and the
   inquisitors may act independently of one another. They may summon,
   arrest or hold for sake-keeping, even securing those arrested hand and
   foot if it seems necessary. For this we hold them responsible. They may
   also inquire about those concerning whom inquiry seems right before God
   and just. The bishop, however, without the inquisitor, or the
   inquisitor without the diocesan bishop or his officer or the delegate
   of the chapter when the see is vacant, may not commit to harsh or close
   imprisonment, which seems more like punishment than custody, or subject
   anyone to torture or pronounce sentence on anyone, if they can have
   access to each other within eight days after seeking it; any
   contravention of this has no legal validity. If nevertheless the
   bishop, or the delegate of the chapter when the see is vacant, cannot
   or will not personally meet the inquisitor, or if the inquisitor cannot
   or will not personally meet either of the other two, the matter may be
   entrusted to their proxies or settled by counsel and consent through
   letters.

   In regard to the custody of prisons for heretics, commonly called walls
   in certain regions, we have realized that much deceit has been
   practised of late, and we wish to obviate this. We decree that any such
   prison or wall, which we wish for the future to be for the joint use of
   bishop and inquisitor, shall have two principal guards, discreet,
   diligent and trustworthy, one to be appointed and provided for by the
   bishop, the other by the inquisitor. Each of these guards may have a
   loyal and trustworthy assistant. For each room of the prison there will
   be two different keys, one held by each guard. He may entrust or
   sub-delegate his key to his assistant for the purpose of ministering to
   the prisoners. Furthermore, the guards, before they assume office,
   shall, in the presence of both the bishop, or the chapter while the see
   is vacant, and the inquisitor, or their substitutes, take an oath on
   the holy gospels, which they shall touch, that they will use all
   diligence and care in their duty of guarding those placed or to be
   placed in their custody on account of the crime of heresy; that one
   guard shall say nothing in secret to a prisoner out of hearing of the
   other guard; that they will administer faithfully and without any
   deduction the provisions which the prisoners receive from the
   administration and those that they may be offered by relatives, friends
   or other trustworthy persons, unless there is an order to the contrary
   from the bishop and the inquisitor or their deputies, and that in this
   matter there will be no fraud. The assistants of the guards shall take
   the same oath in the presence of the same persons before exercising
   their office. And since it often happens that bishops have their own
   prisons, not shared with inquisitors, we wish and strictly command that
   the guards appointed by the bishop, or by the chapter while the see is
   vacant, and their assistants, shall take a similar oath before the
   inquisitors or their substitutes. Notaries of the inquisition shall
   also swear in the presence of the bishop and the inquisitor or their
   substitutes, to exercise the office of notary faithfully. The same
   shall hold good of other persons necessary for the carrying out of this
   duty.

   While it is a grave offence not to work for the extermination of heresy
   when this monstrous infection requires action, it is also a grave
   offence and deserving of severe punishment to impute maliciously such
   wickedness to the innocent. We therefore order bishops, inquisitors and
   their substitutes, in virtue of holy obedience and under threat of
   eternal damnation, that they proceed discreetly and promptly against
   those suspected of heresy, while not imputing maliciously or
   deceitfully such a disgraceful crime to an innocent person, or accusing
   him of hindering them in the execution of their office. If they fail,
   because of hatred, favour, affection, money or temporal advantage, to
   proceed against someone when they ought, against justice and their
   conscience, then the bishop or superior is suspended from office for
   three years and others incur automatic excommunication, in addition to
   other punishments imposed in accordance with the gravity of the
   offence. The same penalties apply if they presume for the same reasons
   to disturb someone with the imputation that he is a heretic or has
   hindered them in their duties. They shall obtain absolution from this
   excommunication only from the Roman pontiff, except at the hour of
   death, and then after making satisfaction. No privilege shall avail in
   this matter. We wish of course, with the approval of the sacred
   council, that any other rulings made by our predecessors concerning the
   office of the inquisition and not in conflict with the above are to
   remain in full force.

   [27]. We do not wish the splendour of the faith to be obscured, as it
   were by a dark shadow, by the indiscreet and wicked acts of any
   inquisitors of heresy. We therefore decree, with the approval of this
   sacred council, that nobody below the age of forty may be entrusted
   with the office of inquisitor. We enjoin very strictly on all
   commissaries of inquisitors or of bishops or, in vacant sees, of
   chapters that they do not, under pretext of the office of the
   inquisition, extort money by any unlawful means from anyone, or
   knowingly attempt to apply the property of churches, on account of the
   offences of clerics, even to the treasury of a church. If the
   commissaries disobey, we place them automatically under sentence of
   excommunication. They cannot be absolved, except at the moment of
   death, until they have made full satisfaction to those from whom they
   have extorted the money; all privileges, pacts and remissions are of no
   avail. Notaries and officials of the inquisition, as also the brethren
   and associates of the inquisitors and commissaries, who have secret
   knowledge that the inquisitors and commissaries have committed such
   extortions, if they wish to avoid the indignation of God and of the
   apostolic see as well as offence to both, shall strive to correct the
   culprits severely in secret. If they have such knowledge as to be able
   to offer proof if need be, they should earnestly report the matter to
   the relevant superiors of the inquisitors and commissaries, and these
   superiors are obliged to remove from office those found guilty and then
   duly to punish or correct them in other ways. Superiors of inquisitors
   who fail to do this are to be informed of this decree by the local
   ordinaries, whom we strictly order in virtue of holy obedience to make
   known these affairs to the apostolic see. Furthermore, we strictly
   forbid the inquisitors themselves to abuse in any way the concession to
   carry arms, or to have any but the necessary officials for
   accomplishing the duties of their office.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [28]. We entertain in our heart a deep longing that the catholic faith
   prosper in our time and that the perverseness of heresy be rooted out
   of Christian soil. We have therefore heard with great displeasure that
   an abominable sect of wicked men, commonly called Beghards, and of
   faithless women, commonly called Beguines, has sprung up in the realm
   of Germany. This sect, planted by the sower of evil deeds, holds and
   asserts in its sacrilegious and perverse doctrine the following errors.
    1. First, that a person in this present life can acquire a degree of
       perfection which renders him utterly impeccable and unable to make
       further progress in grace. For, as they say, if someone could
       always make further progress, he could become more perfect than
       Christ.
    2. Secondly, that it is not necessary to fast or pray after gaining
       this degree of perfection, for then the sensitive appetite has been
       so perfectly subjected to the spirit and to reason that one may
       freely grant the body whatever pleases it.
    3. Thirdly, that those who have reached the said degree of perfection
       and spirit of liberty, are not subject to human obedience nor
       obliged to any commandments of the church, for, as they say, where
       the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
    4. Fourthly, that a person can gain in this life final beatitude in
       every degree of perfection that he will obtain in the life of the
       blessed.
    5. Fifthly, that any intellectual nature in itself is naturally
       blessed, and that the soul does not need the light of glory to
       elevate it to see God and enjoy him blissfully.
    6. Sixthly, that the practice of the virtues belongs to the state of
       imperfection and the perfect soul is free from virtues.
    7. Seventhly, that to kiss a woman is a mortal sin since nature does
       not incline one to it, but the act of intercourse is not a sin,
       especially in time of temptation, since it is an inclination of
       nature.
    8. Eighthly, that at the elevation of the body of Jesus Christ, they
       ought not to rise or show reverence to it; it would be an
       imperfection for them to come down from the purity and height of
       their contemplation so far as to think about the ministry or
       sacrament of the eucharist, or about the passion of Christ as man.

   With the counterfeit appearance of sanctity they say and do other
   things also that offend the eyes of the divine majesty' and constitute
   a grave danger to souls. Since the duty of the office committed to us
   obliges us to exstirpate from the catholic church this detestable sect
   and the above execrable errors, lest they be further propagated and
   corrupt the hearts of the faithful, we condemn and utterly reject, with
   the approval of the sacred council, the sect itself and the errors
   described above, and we strictly forbid anyone henceforth to hold,
   approve or defend the errors. We decree that those who act otherwise
   are to be punished with canonical censure. The diocesans and the
   inquisitors of heresy for the regions where these Beghards and Beguines
   live, are to exercise their office with special care concerning them,
   making inquiries about their life and behaviour and about their beliefs
   in relation to the articles of faith and the sacraments of the church.
   They are to impose due punishment on those whom they find guilty,
   unless there is voluntary abjuration of the above errors and repentance
   with fitting satisfaction.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   [29]. Serious suggestions have been made to us that communities in
   certain places, to the divine displeasure and injury of the neighbour,
   in violation of both divine and human law, approve of usury. By their
   statutes, sometimes confirmed by oath, they not only grant that usury
   may be demanded and paid, but deliberately compel debtors to pay it. By
   these statutes they impose heavy burdens on those claiming the return
   of usurious payments, employing also various pretexts and ingenious
   frauds to hinder the return. We, therefore, wishing to get rid of these
   pernicious practices, decree with the approval of the sacred council
   that all the magistrates, captains, rulers, consuls, judges,
   counsellors or any other officials of these communities who presume in
   the future to make, write or dictate such statutes, or knowingly decide
   that usury be paid or, if paid, that it be not fully and freely
   restored when claimed, incur the sentence of excommunication. They
   shall also incur the same sentence unless within three months they
   delete from the books of their communities, if they have the power,
   statutes of this kind hitherto published, or if they presume to observe
   in any way these statutes or customs. Furthermore, since money-lenders
   for the most part enter into usurious contracts so frequently with
   secrecy and guile that they can be convicted only with difficulty, we
   decree that they be compelled by ecclesiastical censure to open their
   account books, when there is question of usury. If indeed someone has
   fallen into the error of presuming to affirm pertinaciously that the
   practice of usury is not sinful, we decree that he is to be punished as
   a heretic; and we strictly enjoin on local ordinaries and inquisitors
   of heresy to proceed against those they find suspect of such error as
   they would against those suspected of heresy.

   [30]. Complaints, loud, frequent and incessant come to us from certain
   religious that very many prelates- bishops, their superiors and
   others-unjustly disturb in many ways the peace of the religious. Some
   of them seize and imprison exempt religious when the law does not
   permit this. Some, by threat of severe penalties, hinder those who owe
   tithes or revenues to exempt religious from paying and prevent people
   from hearing their masses. They suspend, interdict and excommunicate
   without reasonable cause the millers of the religious, their cooks,
   servants, vassals, and members of household, and anyone who has any
   relation with them, occasionally also seizing unlawfully their goods.
   They in no way submit to the appeals which the said exempt religious
   sometimes make with good reason, because of the foregoing or other
   oppressions. They now and then seize the appellants on the occasion of
   these appeals, or they have them seized and thrown into prison.

   There are some prelates, moreover, who without lawful cause do not
   permit chaplains to celebrate nor to administer the sacraments to the
   parishioners in churches belonging fully and lawfully to the exempt
   religious. There are even some prelates who with indiscreet haste
   unjustly suspend, excommunicate, seize and imprison exempt abbots,
   monks and lay-brothers, as also clerics legally subject to them, and
   lay under interdict their churches and houses, if they do not obey even
   in matters where there is no obligation. In addition, the prelates
   exceed all measure in claiming charitable aid from the exempt religious
   themselves and from those subject to them. Contrary to law they make
   demands which are unjust and unusual. They lay new taxes and unfair
   burdens on parish churches in which exempt religious have the right of
   patronage. They do not permit legal actions and decisions justly made
   in favour of the exempt religious, by delegates of the apostolic see or
   by conservators, to be made public or to be put into execution by their
   subjects. They restrain public notaries from drawing up instruments,
   judges from administering justice, and lawyers from giving counsel or
   aid in the suits or legal business of the exempt religious.

   The prelates also refuse to admit to orders or benefices those
   presented by exempt religious who have the right of presentation,
   unless the presenters profess obedience in the greeting of the letter
   of presentation. Furthermore, these prelates, when the churches for
   which monasteries have the right of patronage become vacant, turn away
   the suitable persons presented to them and appoint people who are
   incompetent and unworthy. Certain prelates confer churches, which have
   the cure of souls and belong to the table maintenance of abbots, and
   the revenues of which they sometimes hand over for a rent to secular
   clerics, on their own clergy at the death of those secular clerics,
   even though the churches because of this are not truly vacant. Some
   prelates appropriate unjustly for themselves the rights of monks in
   churches belonging to monasteries, and so regulate the disposal of the
   revenues that not enough remains for the livelihood of the rectors.

   Some prelates, armed and with standards hoisted, destroy the mills and
   other property of exempt religious, disregarding all justice, even when
   the religious have been in possession from time immemorial. Prelates
   also often send their relatives and nephews to the monasteries in their
   cities and dioceses, occasionally with their animals and herdsmen, with
   the demand that they be provided for. Often also prelates compel abbots
   and priors of monasteries to grant the possessions of their monasteries
   or priories to their kindred and nephews either perpetually or for a
   period; these grants or pensions we wish to be of no consequence in
   law. They also compel the abbots and priors to present to them for
   vacant churches in which the monks have the right of patronage, and
   occasionally to receive into their order, their friends, kindred and
   nephews. Frequently also they permit and tacitly consent to the
   seizure, in the prelates' temporal domains, of movable and immovable
   property of the monasteries in cases not permitted by law, by the
   prelates' soldiers, vassals and secular officials. They also outrage in
   various other ways both the clerical and lay persons of the
   monasteries.

   Besides, the prelates occasionally deprive unjustly of their benefices
   abbots, priors and others, so that if they can take the revenues of the
   benefices in the first year, under pretext of a privilege which they
   claim to have, then they may be able to receive the first year's
   revenues of vacant benefices for a certain time. Not content with this,
   they seize unlawfully horses, cattle, treasure and other property of
   monasteries and vacant benefices which should be reserved for
   posterity. Some prelates sell for a time to knights and other powerful
   persons the revenues and incomes of their dignities, in order to
   oppress the neighbouring exempt religious more heavily by means of
   these people. Some even destroy monasteries without just cause. Others
   often seize houses, hospitals and other property of the monasteries,
   both movable and immovable, and retain what they have seized. Many
   times also, without just cause, they prevent exempt religious from
   repairing their houses. Certain prelates enact statutes derogatory to
   the privileges of the exempt religious. And in general, very many
   prelates unjustly inflict grave injury and loss on religious,
   especially on those who are exempt and have privileges: on their
   persons, property and rights, both spiritual and temporal.

   Since however there is for both regulars and seculars, for superiors
   and subjects, for exempt and non-exempt, one universal church, outside
   of which there is no salvation, for all of whom there is one Lord, one
   faith and one baptism, it is right that all who are of the same body
   should be of one will, and as brethren bound to one another by the bond
   of charity. It is right therefore that both prelates and others, exempt
   and non-exempt, should be content with their rights and abstain from
   inflicting injury or loss on one another. We therefore strictly
   command, by the present decree, all prelates of churches that they
   desist altogether from the oppression described above, and see to it
   that their subjects do likewise. They are to treat religious men,
   whether exempt or having privileges or non-exempt, both mendicant and
   non-mendicant, with charity, and they are to encourage them. They are
   to respect their rights and privileges as inviolable. And since what is
   specially forbidden is feared more than what is forbidden merely in
   general, we forbid most strictly that prelates presume to hinder in any
   way abbots, priors and other religious from going to their general or
   provincial chapters.

   [31 ]. Religious who presume to administer the sacrament of extreme
   unction or the eucharist to clerics or lay people or to solemnise
   marriages, without the special leave of the parish priest, or to
   absolve those excommunicated by canon law, except in cases expressed in
   law or granted to them by privilege of the apostolic see, or those
   excommunicated by sentences promulgated by provincial or synodal
   statutes, or (to use their own words) to absolve anyone from punishment
   and guilt, incur automatic excommunication. They are to be absolved
   only by the apostolic see. The local ordinaries are to announce
   publicly that they are excommunicated, once this is established, until
   notified of their absolution. The religious can make no valid appeal in
   this matter to any exemption or privilege. We also strictly forbid
   religious, in virtue of holy obedience and under threat of eternal
   malediction, to disparage prelates in their sermons or to draw the
   laity away from their churches, to publish false indulgences, to
   restrain testators, when present at the making of their wills, from
   making due restitutions or legacies to their mother churches, or to
   bring about that money legacies, or money owed or perhaps unjustly
   taken, should come or be bequeathed to themselves or to other
   individuals of their order, or to their houses, to the detriment of
   other people. Nor are they to absolve anyone in cases reserved to the
   apostolic see or to the local ordinaries. They are not to annoy
   unreasonably ecclesiastical persons who prosecute justice against them,
   especially before judges delegated by us, nor are they to bring them to
   court in more than one place, especially if these places are distant.

   Those who presume to act contrary to this decree are subject for two
   months to the penalties usually imposed by their rule or statutes on
   those who commit grave crimes or faults. Dispensation shall not be
   granted without manifest necessity. Their superiors, besides, unless
   after these excesses they make full satisfaction within a month to the
   churches or ecclesiastical persons harmed or offended, after being
   required to do so, incur automatic suspension until they have made due
   satisfaction, notwithstanding statutes or privileges of whatever tenor.
   Of course the religious who have been granted permission by the
   apostolic see to administer the sacraments to members of their
   household or to the poor in their hospices, are not affected by this
   decree.

   [32]. With the approval of the sacred council, we grant by this present
   constitution to an archbishop passing through, or perhaps turning
   aside, to exempt localities of his diocese to have the cross carried
   openly before him, to bless the people, to hear the divine offices
   there privately or publicly, also to celebrate them in pontificals and
   to have them celebrated in his presence without pontificals,
   notwithstanding any contrary privilege. In like manner we grant to a
   bishop that in exempt localities of his diocese he may bless the
   people, hear the divine offices and celebrate them there, as also have
   them celebrated in his presence. Under pretext of this concession,
   however, the archbishop or bishop may exercise no other jurisdiction in
   the exempt or privileged localities. He is not to annoy the exempt or
   privileged persons, there should be no cause for complaint and nothing
   prejudicial to the exemption or privileges of the religious. The
   archbishop or bishop does not acquire by this decree any other right.

   [33]. If anyone at the instigation of the devil has committed the
   sacrilege of wrongfully and rashly striking a bishop, or of seizing or
   banishing him, or has ordered these things to be done, or approved them
   when done by others, or been an accomplice, or given advice or shown
   favour, or knowingly defended the guilty, and has not incurred
   excommunication by canons already published, he is excommunicated by
   this our present constitution, notwithstanding any custom to the
   contrary. Indeed, with the approval of the sacred council, we consider
   such a custom to be a corruption, and the culprit may be absolved by
   the supreme pontiff only, except at the moment of death. In addition,
   he shall lose all fiefs, leases, offices and benefices, whether
   spiritual or temporal, which he holds from the church over which the
   offended bishop presides. All these shall revert freely to that church.
   The offender's descendants in the male line to the second generation
   shall be disqualified, without hope of dispensation, from holding
   ecclesiastical benefices in the city and diocese of the bishop. The
   offender's estates also, when within one diocese, shall lie under
   interdict until he has made due satisfaction. The place where the
   captured bishop is detained shall likewise be under interdict for as
   long as he remains detained. If the criminal's estates include two or
   more dioceses, then the diocese of his principal domicile and the
   diocese where the crime was committed, if the land is his, and two
   other dioceses which belong to his territory and are nearest to the
   place of the crime, shall he under the same interdict.

   Since his confusion will increase the more his offence is known, his
   excommunication will be announced in public, with the ringing of bells
   and candles burning, until he has made due satisfaction, in all the
   places where the crime was committed, as also in the churches of the
   neighbouring cities and dioceses, on all Sundays and feast days. And
   when he is to receive absolution, let him be well prepared to undergo
   the punishment imposed and, with the help of God, to perform the
   penance enjoined on him. The city, moreover, that has committed any of
   the crimes described above against its bishop, shall be placed under
   the above-mentioned interdict until it has made satisfaction. The
   authorities, counsellors, bailiffs, magistrates, advocates, consuls,
   governors and officials of any description who are at fault in this
   affair, are likewise subject to excommunication from which they can be
   absolved only in the manner stated above. All these instructions shall
   be observed all the more strictly in dealing with those who kill
   bishops, since they should be punished more severely than the offenders
   already mentioned and merit greater indignation.

   Let nobody be surprised that we do not inflict heavier punishment on
   those who perpetrate the above crimes. Alas! shameful to relate, these
   crimes are of frequent occurrence, and for the many men of violence an
   example is needed. The punishment of the offender ought to be in
   proportion to the dignity of the person wronged. Bishops are called
   most holy, are Christ's ambassadors, spiritual fathers, our brothers
   and fellow bishops, the acknowledged pillars of the church. The
   punishment, then, ought to be heavy, proportionate to the guilt of one
   who violates the dignity of such an eminent person. However, we wish to
   mitigate the severity of the punishment for the present, being prepared
   to impose other penalties if we see that the offenders' insolence
   demands such action. If of course anyone involved in the above cases
   has been absolved at the moment of death from excommunication, he shall
   incur automatically the same sentence if after recovery he does not, as
   soon as conveniently possible, present himself before the Roman pontiff
   in order to receive humbly his commands, as justice shall advise.
   Although this has been fully enough provided for elsewhere in the law,
   we thought it well to make this addition, lest someone from ignorance
   of the law should busy himself to find excuses.

   [34]. Many serious complaints have reached us that some who hold
   temporal power do not hesitate to capture ecclesiastics frequently and
   detain them with sacrilegious audacity until they resign their
   benefices, nor to prevent those summoned to the apostolic see by
   someone or by law from going there, for the most part seizing them as
   they depart. In view of the great offence to our honour and that of the
   apostolic see, as also to the peace and welfare of ecclesiastical
   persons, not to speak of the damnable scandal, we, with the approval of
   the sacred council, decree that, in addition to the penalty attached by
   the canon to such deeds, those who bring them about, if prelates, are
   suspended for three years from receiving the revenues of their
   churches. If they are lower clergy, they are automatically deprived of
   their benefices. Those who have brought about their own capture by the
   secular power- this, we have heard, sometimes occurs- as a pretext for
   not obeying a summons to the apostolic see, are to incur the same
   penalty. Resignations of benefices extorted in the above manner,
   although accepted and ratified by the prelates of those who resign,
   have no validity whatever. We enjoin on local ordinaries that, after
   learning that subjects of theirs have incurred these penalties, they do
   not delay in publishing them and, as far as it concerns them, they put
   the penalties into execution.

   [35]. Desiring to restrain those whom the rewards of virtue do not
   induce to observe the law, by the addition of new penalties and by fear
   of those to be added, we decree that transgressors of the constitution
   which forbids mendicant religious to acquire houses or places of any
   kind, or to exchange those already acquired or transfer them to others
   under any title of alienation, are automatically subject to
   excommunication.

   The same sentence of excommunication is incurred by those religious who
   presume in their sermons or otherwise to restrain their hearers from
   due payment of tithes to churches. And since it is not enough to
   abstain from evil unless good is done, we enjoin on all religious,
   invoking the divine judgment and under threat of eternal malediction,
   that whenever they preach to the people on the first, fourth and last
   Sundays of Lent, and on the feasts of the Ascension of the Lord,
   Pentecost, the Birthday of blessed John the Baptist, the Assumption and
   the Birthday of the most blessed virgin Mary, the mother of God, they
   take care to exhort their hearers expressly, if required by the rectors
   or vicars of the churches or those taking their place, and also to
   inform the consciences of their penitents in confession, that they have
   the obligation to pay tithes. If the religious knowingly evade this
   duty in their sermons on the above-mentioned days, they are to receive
   a severe rebuke from their superiors. We also strictly command the
   superiors, in virtue of holy obedience, to enact laws in accordance
   with which they may so severely punish transgressors that their
   punishment may be an example for others. The constitution of our
   predecessor of happy memory pope Gregory IX, dealing with this matter,
   is to remain in full force. Those who knowingly have neglected to
   inform the consciences of penitents with regard to payment of these
   tithes, are automatically to remain suspended from preaching until they
   inform the consciences of their penitents, if they can conveniently do
   this. They are to incur automatic excommunication if they presume to
   preach without atoning for their neglect as above. We do not however
   wish this to apply to the religious of monasteries, or the rectors of
   churches, who are in receipt of tithes.

   Rash violators of the constitution which forbids religious and secular
   clerics to induce anyone to vow, swear, pledge or otherwise promise
   that they will choose a burial place beside their churches or, having
   made this choice, that they will not alter it, incur automatically the
   same sentence of excommunication (the penalty in the said constitution
   is to remain in force); they are not to be absolved except by the
   apostolic see, except at the moment of death, notwithstanding any
   privileges or statutes of whatever tenor.

   [36]. Grave complaint has been made to us by prelates that certain
   nobles and temporal lords, when their territory has been laid under
   ecclesiastical interdict, have masses and other divine offices
   celebrated publicly and solemnly not only in the chapels of their
   houses, but also in collegiate churches and other churches of prominent
   places. They invite and, what is worse, sometimes compel now these, now
   those, to celebrate the offices. Not content with these excesses, they
   have people summoned, even those under interdict, by the ringing of
   bells and by the public crier, to hear these masses. Some of the lords
   and nobles are not afraid to order people, for the most part their own
   subjects, although they are publicly under excommunication and
   interdict, not to leave the churches while mass is being celebrated,
   even though the celebrants urge their departure. It therefore happens
   frequently that mass is left unfinished to the offence of God and the
   scandal of clergy and people. In order, then, that excesses so grave
   may not be imitated because the transgressors are left unpunished, we
   excommunicate, with the approval of the sacred council, all those who
   shall presume to compel anyone in any way in places under interdict to
   celebrate the divine offices, or to summon people in the above way to
   hear them, especially those under excommunication or interdict. The
   same penalty is imposed on those who forbid persons publicly
   excommunicated or under interdict to leave the church during mass when
   warned to do so by the celebrant, also on those publicly excommunicated
   and those under interdict who presume to remain in church when named by
   the celebrant and warned that they must leave. The excommunications can
   be remitted only by the apostolic see.

   [37]. The friars Minor receive into their churches to hear the divine
   offices in time of interdict brothers and sisters of the third order,
   instituted by blessed Francis; they are called continent or of penance.
   Since this practice generates scandal in the minds of others who are
   excluded, thus debasing ecclesiastical censure and weakening the force
   of an interdict, we strictly forbid the friars Minor to admit
   henceforth in any way to their churches for the divine offices in time
   of interdict any of the above-mentioned persons, even if they or the
   friars have privileges of any kind in this matter; we in no way favour
   such privileges. If the friars infringe this decree, they lie under
   automatic excommunication, from which they can only be absolved by the
   Roman pontiff or, if they have made satisfaction, by the local bishops,
   whom we wish to act in this matter by our authority.

   [38]. I came out of paradise, I said: I will water my garden of plants.
   Thus speaks the heavenly cultivator, who is truly the source of wisdom,
   God's Word, begotten by the Father from eternity, yet remaining in the
   Father. In these last days, made flesh in the womb of a virgin by the
   operation of the holy Spirit, he went forth to the arduous work of
   redeeming the human race, giving himself to humanity as the model of a
   heavenly life. But because so often people, overcome by the anxieties
   of this mortal life, turned their mental gaze away from such a model,
   our true Solomon has made in the realm of the church militant, among
   other gardens, a garden of delight, far from the stormy waves of the
   world, in which people might devote themselves with greater peace and
   security to contemplating and imitating the works of the exemplar, and
   he himself entered this world that he might refresh it with the fertile
   waters of his spiritual grace and teaching.

   This garden is the holy religion of the friars Minor which, enclosed
   within the firm walls of regular observance, is content with God alone
   and is constantly enriched with fresh shoots, her sons. Entering this
   garden, the beloved Son of God gathers the myrrh and spices of
   mortification and penance which by their marvellous fragrance diffuse
   to everyone the perfume of an attractive sanctity. This is that form
   and rule of the heavenly life sketched by that eminent confessor of
   Christ, saint Francis, who taught his sons its observance by both word
   and example. The observers of that holy rule, men of zeal and devotion,
   as both pupils and true sons of so great a father, aspired and still
   ardently aspire to observe that rule faithfully in all its purity and
   fullness. They perceived certain particulars of which the
   interpretation was doubtful, and they prudently had recourse to the
   apostolic see for clarification. Receiving assurance from that see, to
   which their very rule proclaims allegiance, they were able to serve the
   Lord, free from all doubt, in the fullness of charity. Several Roman
   pontiffs, our predecessors, rightfully heeded their pious and just
   requests; they defined doubtful points, promulgating certain
   interpretations and making some concessions, as they thought good for
   the consciences of the friars and the purity of religious observance.
   But because there are devout consciences which very often fear sin
   where it does not exist, and dread any turning in the way of God, the
   previous clarifications have not fully quietened the consciences of all
   the friars. There are still some points belonging to their rule and
   state of life where doubts arise, as many have often told us in public
   and private consistories. For this reason the friars themselves have
   humbly entreated us to clarify opportunely the doubts which have arisen
   and those which may arise in the future, thus applying a remedy by the
   kindness of the apostolic see.

   We have from a tender age had a warm devotion to those who profess this
   rule and to the whole order. Now that, though unworthy, we bear the
   office of universal pastor, we are the more roused to cherish them and
   to honour them more kindly and attentively, the more often we consider
   and reflect on the plentiful harvest reaped continually from their
   exemplary lives and wholesome teaching for the good of the universal
   church. Moved by the pious intentions of the petitioners, we have
   directed our efforts to carry out diligently what they ask. We have had
   a careful examination made of these doubts by several archbishops,
   bishops, masters in theology and other learned, prudent and discreet
   men.

   At the beginning of the rule it is said: "The rule and life of the
   friars Minor is this, to observe the gospel of our lord Jesus Christ,
   by living in obedience without property and in chastity"2. Also,
   further down: "Having completed a year of probation, let them be
   received to obedience, promising always to observe this life and
   rule"3. Also, towards the end of the rule: "Let us observe poverty,
   humility and the gospel of our lord Jesus Christ, which we have firmly
   promised"4. There was uncertainty whether the friars of the order were
   obliged to all the precepts and counsels of the gospel by profession of
   their rule. Some said they were obliged to all. Others, however,
   asserted that they were obliged to three only, namely "to live in
   obedience, in chastity and without property", and to what was stated as
   obligatory in the rule. With regard to this article we follow in the
   footsteps of our predecessors and, giving this article further
   clarification, we answer the doubt as follows. Since every determinate
   vow must have a defined object, he who vows to follow the rule cannot
   be considered obliged by his vow to those evangelical counsels which
   are not mentioned in the rule. And indeed this is shown to have been
   the intention of blessed Francis the founder, from the fact that he
   laid down certain counsels in the rule but omitted others. For if by
   those words, "The rule and life of the friars Minor is this" etc. he
   had intended to oblige them to all the evangelical counsels, it would
   have been superfluous and futile to include some of them and not
   others.

   However, since the nature of a restrictive term demands the exclusion
   of everything foreign to it but includes everything belonging to it, we
   declare that the friars are bound by the profession of their rule not
   only to those three vows simply and solely, but also to everything
   related to them expressed in the rule itself. For if the friars were
   obliged to observe the three vows precisely and no more, in their
   promise to observe the rule by living in "obedience, chastity and
   without property", and not also to observe everything contained in the
   rule that is relevant to those vows, then the words "I promise to
   observe always this rule" would be useless, as implying no obligation.
   We must not think, however, that blessed Francis intended to impose on
   those who profess this rule the same obligation regarding everything in
   the rule relating to the three vows, or anything else contained in the
   rule. Rather, he made a clear distinction: in some matters his words
   imply that transgression is a mortal sin, in others not, since he
   applies to some the word "precept" or its equivalent, while elsewhere
   he is content to use other expressions.

   Besides those things laid down in the rule expressly in words of
   precept or exhortation or admonition, there are some things in the
   imperative mood in either a negative or an affirmative form. Concerning
   these, there has been up to now some doubt as to whether they are of
   precept. This doubt is not made less but rather increased by the
   declaration of our predecessor pope Nicholas III' of happy memory, that
   the friars are obliged by rule to those evangelical counsels which the
   rule expresses in form of precept or prohibition or equivalent words
   and, in addition, to the observance of everything that the rule imposes
   in words of obligation. The friars therefore begged that we would, for
   their peace of conscience, graciously define which of these matters
   should be considered equivalent to precepts and obligatory. We
   therefore, delighted by their sincerity of conscience, observing that
   in matters affecting salvation the safer path is to be taken in order
   to avoid grave remorse of conscience, say that, although the friars are
   not obliged to observe everything expressed by the rule in the
   imperative mood in the way that they are obliged to observe matters
   which are explicitly or equivalently of precept, it is right for them,
   if they are to observe the rule strictly in its purity, to acknowledge
   that they are bound to observe in this way the injunctions noted below.

   In order to summarise these things which appear equivalent to precepts,
   in virtue of the words or at least of the subject-matter, or of both,
   we declare the following to be of obligation for the friars, as
   expressed in the rule: not having more tunics than one "with a hood,
   and one without a hood"2, not wearing shoes, and not riding a horse
   except in case of necessity; that the friars "wear cheap clothes"5;
   that they fast "from the feast of all saints to Christmas"6 and on
   Fridays; that "clerics recite the divine office according to the rite
   of the holy Roman church"7; that ministers and guardians take great
   care "of the needs of the sick and of the friars' clothing"8, that, "if
   a friar falls ill, the other friars are to wait on him"9; that "the
   friars are not to preach in the diocese of a bishop when he has
   forbidden them this"; that "nobody ventures at all to preach to the
   people unless he has been examined, approved and appointed for this by
   the minister general" or by others having authority according to the
   aforesaid declaration; that "friars who know that they cannot observe
   the rule in detail, may and should have recourse to their ministers"3;
   and everything laid down in the rule regarding the form of the habit of
   both novices and professed friars, the manner of reception, and
   profession, except for the habit of novices with regard to those
   admitting them (here the rule which says "according to God it may seem
   otherwise"4 may be followed). The order generally has judged, holds and
   has held from of old that wherever in the rule there occurs the words
   "they shall be bound", there is a precept and the friars ought to act
   as bound by precept.

   The confessor of Christ, when prescribing the practice of the friars
   and their ministers in relation to the reception of those entering the
   order, said in the rule: "The friars and their ministers shall take
   care not to be solicitous about their temporal goods, but leave them
   free to do with them whatever the Lord inspires them to do; the
   ministers may have leave, however, to send them to some God-fearing
   men, if counsel be needed, who may advise them how to give their goods
   to the poor"5. Many of the friars were uncertain, and still are,
   whether they may receive anything from those who enter, if it is given;
   whether they may without fault persuade them to give to individuals and
   friaries; and whether the ministers themselves or the friars ought to
   give advice concerning the disposal of property, when there are other
   suitable advisers to whom the entrants can be sent. We observe
   attentively that saint Francis intended to banish from his disciples,
   whose rule he had based on a very strict poverty, all affection for the
   temporal goods of those entering the order, especially in using the
   above words in order that, on the part of the friars, reception into
   the order might appear holy and pure. They should be seen to have no
   eye to their temporal goods, but only to deliver the novices up to the
   divine service. We say that both ministers and friars ought to abstain
   from persuasion to give them the property, and also from advice as to
   its distribution. They should send those who seek counsel to
   God-fearing men of another state, not to friars. In this way all will
   see them truly as zealous and perfect observers of their father's sound
   tradition. Since however the rule itself wishes those entering to be
   free to do as the Lord inspires concerning their property, it does not
   seem unlawful for the friars to receive something, in view of their
   needs and in accordance with the aforesaid declaration, if the entrant
   freely wishes to give it, as he would to other poor people by way of
   alms. The friars however do well to take care, in accepting such
   offerings, that they do not create an unfavourable impression by the
   amount they receive.

   The rule says that "those who have promised obedience should have one
   tunic with a hood, and another without a hood, those who wish to have
   it"; also, that "all the friars should wear cheap clothes"' . We have
   declared that the said words are equivalent to precepts. In order to
   express this more clearly, however, we say that it is not lawful to
   have more tunics, except when this is necessary in accordance with the
   rule, as our said predecessor has more fully explained. As for the
   poverty of the clothes, both of the habit and of the inner clothing, it
   is to be judged in relation to the customs and observances of the
   country, as to the colour of the cloth and the price. There cannot be
   one standard for every region. We think that this poverty in dress
   should be entrusted to the judgment of the ministers and guardians;
   they must form their own consciences, but see to it that poverty in
   dress is maintained. In the same way we leave it to the judgment of the
   ministers and guardians as to when the friars have need to wear shoes.

   The rule refers to two periods: "from the feast of all saints until
   Christmas", and especially in Lent, when the friars are obliged to
   fast. We find inserted in the rule: "at other times they are not
   obliged to fast, with the exception of Fridays"3. From these statements
   some have concluded that the friars are not obliged to observe any
   other fasts except from propriety. We declare that they are not obliged
   to fast at other times except at the times established by the church.
   For it is not probable that either he who instituted the rule or he who
   confirmed it intended to dispense the friars from observing the fasting
   days to which the general law of the church obliges other Christians.

   When St Francis, wishing his friars to be completely detached from
   money, commanded "firmly all the friars not to accept money in any
   manner, either directly or through some other person"4, this same
   predecessor of ours, in his interpretation, defined the cases and the
   ways in which the friars cannot and ought not to be called receivers of
   money against the rule and sincerity of their order. We declare that
   the friars must take the greatest care that they have no recourse to
   those who give money or their agents in ways other than those defined
   by our said predecessor, lest they deservedly be called transgressors
   of the precept and rule. For when there is a general prohibition,
   anything not expressly granted is understood to be refused. For this
   reason, all collection of money and acceptance of offerings in church
   or elsewhere, boxes for storing offerings or gifts of money, and any
   other recourse to money or those who have it which is not allowed by
   the said declaration, is, we say, completely and absolutely forbidden.
   Recourse to special friends is expressly allowed in only two cases,
   according to the rule. These are "the needs of the sick and the
   clothing of the friars"'. Our said predecessor kindly and wisely
   extended this permission, in view of their needy life, to other wants
   of the friars which can occur or even be pressing when there are no
   alms. The friars however are to observe that for no other reasons
   except the above or those of a similar kind, may they have recourse to
   such friends, either on the road or elsewhere, whether their friends
   themselves give the money or their representatives, messengers or
   trustees, whatever name they are given, even if the ways granted by the
   above declaration are entirely observed.

   The confessor of Christ wished above all that those who professed his
   rule should be completely detached from love and desire of earthly
   things, and in particular from money and its use, as is proved by his
   constantly repeating in the rule the prohibition of accepting money.
   When, therefore, the friars need, for the reasons mentioned above, to
   have recourse to those who have money, destined for their needs,
   whether they are their principal benefactors or their envoys, these
   friars should so behave in the eyes of all as to show that they are
   completely unconcerned as regards money, as indeed it does not belong
   to them. Therefore such actions as to order that the money be spent and
   in what way, to exact an account, to ask for the return of the money in
   any way, to put it away or have it put away, and to carry a money-box
   or its key, are unlawful for the friars. These actions belong properly
   to the owners who gave the money and to their agents.

   When the saint expressed the manner of the friars' poverty in the rule,
   he said: "The friars should make nothing their own, neither house nor
   land nor anything, but go confidently to seek alms as pilgrims and
   strangers serving the Lord in poverty and humility"2. This is also the
   renunciation defined by certain of our predecessors as Roman pontiffs,
   to be understood both specifically and in general. These pontiffs have
   therefore accepted for themselves and for the Roman church the absolute
   ownership of everything granted, offered or given to the friars,
   leaving them simply the right of use. Yet we have been asked to examine
   certain practices that are said to go on in the order and seem
   repugnant to the vow of poverty and the sincerity of the order.

   The following are the practices which we believe are in need of remedy.
   The friars not only allow themselves to inherit, but even bring this
   about. They sometimes accept annual revenues so high that the friaries
   concerned can live completely on them. When their affairs, even of a
   temporal kind, are debated in the courts, they assist the advocates and
   procurators; in order to encourage them, they present themselves in
   person. They accept the office of executor of wills and carry it out.
   They sometimes meddle with settlements involving usury or unjust
   acquisition and the restitution to be made. Sometimes they have not
   only extensive gardens but also large vineyards, from which they
   collect great quantities of vegetables and wine to sell. At the time of
   harvest they collect so much corn and wine by begging or buying,
   storing them in their cellars and granaries, that they can live off
   them without begging for the rest of the year. They build churches or
   other edifices, or have them built, of such size, style and costliness
   that they seem to be the abodes of the wealthy not of the poor. The
   friars in very many places have so many church ornaments and so
   obviously precious ones as to surpass in this the great cathedrals.
   They also accept indiscriminately horses and arms offered to them at
   funerals.

   Yet the community of friars, and in particular the rulers of the order,
   asserted that the above abuses, or most of them, did not exist in the
   order and any friars found guilty in such matters are punished
   rigorously. Moreover, very strict laws were passed long ago in the
   order to prevent such abuses. Wishing, therefore, to provide for the
   consciences of the friars and to remove, as far as we can, all doubt
   from their hearts, we give the following replies.

   For a way of life to be authentic, outward actions must correspond to
   the interior attitude of mind. The friars, therefore, who have torn
   themselves away from temporal possessions by so great a renunciation,
   must abstain from all that is or may seem to be contrary to that
   renunciation. Now, heirs acquire not only use of their inheritance but,
   in time, ownership also, and the friars cannot acquire anything for
   themselves in particular or for their order in general. We therefore
   declare that the absoluteness of their vow renders the friars
   altogether incapable of such inheritance, which of its nature extends
   both to money and to other movable and immovable goods. Nor may they
   allow themselves to be left or accept as a legacy the value of such
   inheritance, or a great part of it, so that it could be presumed that
   this was done by deceit; indeed, we absolutely forbid this.

   Since annual revenues are considered by law as immovable goods, and are
   contrary to poverty and mendicancy, there is no doubt that the friars
   may not accept or have revenues of any kind, given their state of life,
   just as they may not have possessions or even their use, since this use
   is not granted to them.

   Further, not only what is known to be evil, but also everything which
   has the appearance of evil, should be specially avoided by perfect men.
   Now, to be present in court and urge their case, when the law is
   concerned with matters of advantage to them, leads people to believe
   from external appearances that the friars present are seeking something
   as their own. In no way, therefore, ought the friars who profess this
   rule and vow, to meddle in legal processes in such courts. By
   abstention they will be thought well of by outsiders, and they will
   live up to the purity of their vow and avoid scandal to their
   neighbour. Indeed, the friars are to be complete strangers not only to
   the acceptance, possession, ownership or use of money, but even to any
   handling of it, as our said predecessor has repeatedly and clearly said
   in his interpretation of the rule. Also, the members of this order
   cannot go to law for any temporal thing. The friars may therefore not
   lend themselves to such legal processes, but rather consider them
   forbidden by the purity of their state, because these activities cannot
   be concluded without litigation and the management or administration of
   money. Nevertheless they do not act in a manner contrary to their state
   if they give advice for the execution of these affairs, since this
   advice does not confer upon them any jurisdiction or legal authority or
   administration with regard to temporal goods.

   Certainly it is not only lawful but very reasonable that the friars who
   devote themselves to the spiritual works of prayer and study should
   have gardens and open spaces for recollection and recreation, and
   sometimes in order to provide a bodily distraction after their
   spiritual labours, as also to cultivate vegetables for their needs. To
   keep gardens, however, in order to cultivate vegetables and other
   garden produce for sale, and vines likewise, is inconsistent with the
   rule and purity of their order. Our said predecessor has declared and
   also ordained that if, for this kind of use, someone were to leave a
   field or a vineyard or something of this nature to the friars, they
   should refrain absolutely from accepting it, since to have such things
   in order to receive the price of the produce in season is similar to
   having an income.

   Again, saint Francis has shown, both by the example of his life and by
   the words of his rule, that he wishes his brothers and sons, relying on
   divine providence, to cast their burden on the Lord, who feeds the
   birds of the air, which neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns. It
   is not likely, then, that he would have wished them to have granaries
   or wine-cellars, when they hope to live by daily begging. And for that
   reason they should not lay by provisions from some slight fear, but
   only when it is very probable from experience that they will not
   otherwise find the necessities of life. We therefore consider that the
   decision should be left to the consciences of the ministers and
   guardians, both as a body and separately in their offices and
   guardianships, acting with the advice and consent of the guardian and
   two discreet older priests from a house of the order in the area.

   The saint wished to establish his friars in the greatest poverty and
   humility, both in inclination and in fact, as practically the whole
   rule proclaims. It is only right, then, that they should in no way
   build, or allow to be built, churches or edifices of any kind which, in
   relation to the numbers of friars living there, might be considered
   excessive in number or in size. We therefore wish that, everywhere in
   the order, the friars should be satisfied with buildings which are
   modest and humble, lest outward appearances, which strike the eye,
   should contradict the great poverty promised by the heart.

   Although church ornaments and vessels are ordained to the honour of
   God's name, for which purpose God created everything, yet he who
   discerns what is secret looks chiefly at the heart of those who serve
   him, not at their hands. He does not wish to be served through things
   which jar with the professed life-style of his servants. The friars
   should therefore be content with vessels and church ornaments which are
   seemly in appearance and sufficient in size and number. Excess,
   costliness or over-elaboration in these or in anything else does not
   become the friars' profession or state of life. Everything which smacks
   of treasure and abundance detracts, in the eyes of people, from the
   profession of such great poverty. We therefore wish and command the
   friars to observe what we have said.

   As for the presents of horses and arms, we decree that everywhere and
   in everything the aforesaid declaration concerning alms of money be
   observed.

   From the above matters, however, there has arisen among the friars an
   uneasy question, namely, whether their rule obliges them to a strict
   and meagre use of things. Some of the friars believe and say that, just
   as they are vowed to a very strict renunciation of ownership, they are
   also enjoined the greatest restraint in the use of things. Other friars
   on the contrary assert that by their profession they are not obliged to
   any restrained use that is not expressed in the rule; they are however
   obliged to a temperate use, in the same way as other Christians and
   even more fittingly. Wishing, then, to give peace to the friars'
   consciences and to put an end to these disputes, we declare that the
   friars Minor in professing their rule are obliged specially to the
   strict and restrained use expressed in the rule. To say, however, as
   some are said to assert, that it is heretical to hold that a restricted
   use of things is or is not included in the vow of evangelical poverty,
   this we judge to be presumptuous and rash.

   Finally, when the rule states by whom and where the minister general
   should be elected, it makes no mention at all of the election or
   appointment of provincial ministers. There can arise some uncertainty
   among the friars on this point. We wish them to be able to go forward
   with clarity and security in all they do. We therefore declare, decree
   and ordain in this constitution of perpetual validity, that when a
   province is to be provided with a minister, his election belongs to the
   provincial chapter. It shall hold the election the day after
   assembling. The confirmation of the election belongs to the minister
   general. If this election is made by ballot, and the votes are divided
   in such a way that several ballots are made without agreement, then the
   choice made by the numerical majority of the chapter (leaving aside
   considerations of zeal or merit), notwithstanding objections of any
   kind from the other side, is to be confirmed or invalidated by the
   minister general. Having first given careful consideration to the
   matter, in accordance with his office, he shall take counsel with
   discreet members of the order, so that a decision is made which is
   pleasing to God. If the minister general invalidates the election, the
   provincial chapter shall vote again. If the chapter does not elect its
   minister on the day mentioned, the minister general shall freely
   provide a provincial minister. There are, however, certain provinces -
   Ireland, Greece and Rome- which are said to have had until now, for
   just reasons, another way of providing the provincial minister. In
   these cases, if the minister general and the general chapter judge,
   with good reason, that the provincial minister should be appointed by
   the minister general, with the advice of good religious of the order,
   rather than by the election of the provincial chapter, this shall be
   done without dispute for the provinces of Ireland, Rome and Greece when
   the previous provincial minister dies or is relieved of office on this
   side of the sea; there shall be no deceit, partiality or fraud, the
   burden resting on the consciences of those who decide the appointment.
   As for the dismissal of provincial ministers, we wish the order to
   retain the procedure which has been customary up to now. For the rest,
   if the friars are without a minister general, his duties shall be
   carried out by the vicar of the order until there is a new minister
   general. Further, if there be any attempted violation of this decree
   concerning the provincial minister, such action shall be automatically
   null and void.

   Let nobody therefore ... If anyone however ...'

   Notes

   1. 16 May 1312, from Regestum 7952

   2. The introductory address given in Regestum 9983 is omitted here
   because many other introductory addresses are known of (see Regestum
   VIII, pp. 416-420). Regestum gives two versions of the letter. The one
   used here as the base text (Regestum 9983) is addressed to each and all
   of the bishops. The other is addressed to king Philip of France (= P),
   see Regestum 8986 (19 Dec. 1312).

   3. P adds: Indeed our beloved son in Christ, Philip the illustrious
   king of the Franks, who together with our beloved son in Christ, Louis
   the illustrious king of Navarre, was present at the council, showed
   himself to be the most Christian of princes. He had the cause of the
   holy Land very much at heart. He burned with zeal of faith and devotion
   to rescue the holy Land from the hands of the impious and to right the
   wrongs there of him who underwent disgrace and shame for the sake of
   our redemption. He so directed and still directs the desires of his
   heart, that he undertook in the council the business of the general
   crusade ordained by us intending therefore to take for a certain time
   the sign of the life-giving cross, with the deliberate purpose of
   sailing personally with his forces to the aid of the holy Land.

   4. But actually we ....holy gospels of God"] And at last, commending in
   the Lord this purpose of the king, so acceptable to God, we thought it
   fitting and most proper that we and the church ought to assist such a
   glorious prince in proceeding with this great enterprise. We observed
   especially that because the cities and other places once held by the
   faithful had been laid waste by the wild rage of the enemy, there was
   no place left to admit the champions of the faith. The enterprise would
   be more costly than formerly when some of the king's ancestors and
   other Christian princes had sailed to the aid of the holy Land; then
   the cities and places were prosperous and could produce and admit
   catholic warriors. We therefore judged that the tithe for six years,
   namely that on the ecclesiastical revenues and incomes of France, which
   used to be paid in times past in that kingdom, should be granted to the
   king to help him in his enterprise, so that he might use it for the aid
   of the holy Land. We therefore ask, admonish and exhort earnestly all
   our venerable brothers, the archbishops and bishops, our beloved chosen
   sons, the abbots, priors, deans, provosts, archdeacons, archpriests and
   other prelates of churches, the chapters, colleges and convents of the
   Cistercians, Cluniacs, Premonstratensians, of saints Benedict and
   Augustine, of the Carthusians, Grandmontines and other orders, and
   other secular and regular ecclesiastical persons, exempt and
   non-exempt, in the kingdom of France, with the exception only of the
   persons and places belonging to the Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem
   and of the other military orders, by our other letters, and also
   enjoining on them strictly by apostolic ordinance and in virtue of
   obedience, to pay the tithe, each and all of them, out of reverence for
   God, the apostolic see and us, for six years, which we wish to be
   reckoned from the next feast of blessed Mary Magdalen. We enjoin
   further on each archbishop and bishop to claim and collect from each
   and all of the abbots, priors, deans, provosts, archdeacons,
   archpriests and other prelates of churches, the chapters, colleges and
   convents, and other non-exempt secular and regular ecclesiastical
   persons, in their cities and dioceses, except for the persons and
   places of the Hospital of saint John of Jerusalem and of the other
   military orders. The collection is to be made directly or through other
   persons appointed by them in each city and diocese, from the
   ecclesiastical revenues and incomes, in the usual manner for the
   periods stated below, namely for half of the first year on the next
   feast of blessed Mary Magdalen and for the remaining half on the coming
   feast of the purification of the blessed virgin Mary, and so on for the
   remaining five years. The tithe should be collected without
   difficulties being made and by our authority. We empower and command,
   by our aforesaid letters, the persons delegated by the archbishops and
   bishops to make this collection, to claim and collect this tithe by our
   authority from the abbots, priors, deans, provosts, archdeacons,
   archpriests and other prelates of churches, the chapters, colleges and
   convents, and other exempt secular and regular ecclesiastical persons,
   with the exception of the persons and places of the Hospital of saint
   John of Jerusalem and the other military orders. The tithe is to be
   collected for the years and periods mentioned above. The archbishops
   and bishops, as also their delegates, are to take care to transfer to
   you, our deputies, their own tithe and that of others as collected by
   themselves or their delegates for each of the six years. You are to
   assign the collection to the king of France or his delegate or
   delegates for the purpose of the crusade. In order that you may more
   easily and effectively collect and assign this tithe, we grant you by
   the present document free and unrestricted power, in virtue of our
   authority, to compel the archbishops and bishops and their delegates,
   disregarding any appeal, to the fulfilment and collection of this tithe
   and its assignation, as prescribed. We also grant you the same full
   power in imparting absolution to those archbishops and bishops bound by
   sentences of excommunication, suspension or interdict for not paying
   the tithe in due time, after they have made satisfaction, and of
   dispensing with those bound by such sentences who have contracted
   irregularity by celebrating or taking part in divine worship. P
