The Second General Council of the Lateran, 1139

Introduction

   In Lent of 1139 a general council was summoned by Pope Innocent II and
   held in the Lateran basilica {1} . As we know, the synod had been
   convoked the previous year; for the papal legates in England and Spain
   pressed the bishops and abbots to go to the council. Thus, a good
   number of fathers, at least five hundred, met in Rome. One of these
   came from the East, the patriarch of Antioch, but he was a Latin. With
   the pope presiding the council began on 2 April and it seems to have
   ended before 17 April, as far as we can judge from the sources.
   This council is called "general" in the records and more frequently
   "plenary" by Innocent himself. However, there is a doubt as to its
   ecumenicity for the same reasons that affect Lateran I.
   The Roman church, which for a long time had been divided in its
   obedience between Innocent II (1130-1143) and Anacletus II (1130-1138),
   seems to have overcome schism and factionalism, and indeed to have
   recovered its peace. This was due to the death of Anacletus in 1138 and
   the efforts of Bernard of Clairvaux, who had fought with the utmost
   zeal on behalf of Innocent for the restoration of unity. But Innocent,
   perhaps upset by the agreements which Anacletus had arrived at,
   vigorously cited and condemned Anacletus's part in the evil affair {2}
   , an action which seems to have provoked a complaint from Bernard.
   Some heretics were also condemned by the fathers, namely those who
   followed the monk Henry, and canons were enacted concerning the reform
   of the church. The pope and the council fathers, following the example
   and mind of Pope Gregory VII, took up a good many canons which had been
   established by previous councils, with a view to restoring
   ecclesiastical discipline to an unblemished state. They furnish a sort
   of body of precepts for the whole church, taken from councils in the
   times of Gregory VII (canon 10), Urban II (canons 3, 21-22), Callistus
   II (canons 3, 7, 23-25) and especially Innocent II (canons 1, 4-7,
   9-12, 14-20). Gratian included many of them shortly afterwards in his
   Decrees (canons 2, 4-6, 8, 19-21, 26-28 and parts of 7, 10, 12, 15-16,
   18, 22). Orderic Vitalis, however, was sceptical about their
   effectiveness in practice.
   Baronius was the first to print the thirty canons (Annales
   ecclesiastici 12,1607, 277-280), having taken them from two manuscript
   codices ("a register of the Vatican library and a Vatican codex of
   decrees"). The Roman editors shortly after produced a more accurate
   version (Rm {3} 4, 1612, 21 -23), from "manuscript codices of the
   Vatican library and of Anthony Augustine of Tarragona"; this was copied
   by all later editions, as we have verified, though with some errors.
   These later editions are as follows: Bn2 {4} 3/2 (1618) 487-489; ER {5}
   17 (1644) 123-133; LC {6} 10 (1671) 1002-1009; Hrd {7} 6/2 (1714)
   1207-1214; Cl {8} 12 (1730) 1497-1507;Msi {9} 21 (1776) 526-533.The
   canon which E.Martene and U.Durand published (Thesaurus novus
   anecdotorum, IV, Paris 1717, 139-140) as being "omitted in the
   editions, from a manuscript of St Vincent of Bisignano", is in fact the
   same as canons 15 and 30. Having collated together all these editions,
   we have followed the text of the Roman edition.

CANONS

Canon 1.

   We decree that if anyone has been ordained simoniacally, he is to
   forfeit entirely the office which he illicitly usurped.

Canon 2.

   If anyone has acquired, through payment, a prebend, priory, deanery or
   any ecclesiastical honour or preferment, or a holy thing of the church
   of any kind, such as chrism or holy oil, or the consecrations of altars
   or churches, where the execrable passion of avarice has been the
   motive, let him be deprived of the honour which he wrongly acquired,
   and let the buyer and seller and intermediary be stigmatised with the
   mark of infamy. And let nothing be demanded for sustenance or under the
   pretext of any custom from anyone before or afterwards, nor should the
   person himself presume to give anything, since this is simony; but let
   him enjoy freely and without any diminution the dignity and benefice
   which has been conferred on him

Canon 3.

   We utterly prohibit those who have been excommunicated by their bishops
   to be received by others. Indeed, whoever knowingly presumes to
   communicate someone who has been excommunicated, before he is absolved
   by the one who excommunicated him, is to be held liable to the same
   sentence.

Canon 4.

   We also enjoin that bishops as well as clergy take pains to be pleasing
   to God and to humans in both their interior and exterior comportment.
   Let them give no offence in the sight of those for whom they ought to
   be a model and example, by the excess, cut or colour of their clothes,
   nor with regard to the tonsure, but rather, as is fitting for them, let
   them exhibit holiness. If after a warning from the bishops they are
   unwilling to change their ways, let them be deprived of their
   ecclesiastical benefices.

Canon 5.

   We enjoin that what was laid down in the sacred council of Chalcedon be
   rigidly adhered to, namely, that the goods of deceased bishops are not
   to be seized by anyone at all, but are to remain freely at the disposal
   of the treasurer and the clergy for the needs of the church and the
   succeeding incumbent. Therefore, from now on, let that detestable and
   wicked rapacity cease. Furthermore, if anyone dares to attempt this
   behaviour henceforth, he is to be excommunicated. And those who despoil
   the goods of dying priests or clerics are to be subject to the same
   sentence.

Canon 6.

   We also decree that those in the orders of subdeacon and above who have
   taken wives or concubines are to be deprived of their position and
   ecclesiastical benefice. For since they ought to be in fact and in name
   temples of God, vessels of the Lord and sanctuaries of the holy Spirit,
   it is unbecoming that they give themselves up to marriage and impurity.

Canon 7.

   Adhering to the path trod by our predecessors, the Roman pontiffs
   Gregory VII, Urban and Paschal, we prescribe that nobody is to hear the
   masses of those whom he knows to have wives or concubines. Indeed, that
   the law of continence and the purity pleasing to God might be
   propagated among ecclesiastical persons and those in holy orders, we
   decree that where bishops, priests, deacons, subdeacons, canons
   regular, monks and professed lay brothers have presumed to take wives
   and so transgress this holy precept, they are to be separated from
   their partners. For we do not deem there to be a marriage which, it is
   agreed, has been contracted against ecclesiastical law. Furthermore,
   when they have separated from each other, let them do a penance
   commensurate with such outrageous behaviour.

Canon 8.

   We decree that the selfsame thing is to apply also to women religious
   if, God forbid, they attempt to marry.

Canon 9.

   Moreover, the evil and detestable practice has grown, so we understand,
   whereby monks and canons regular, after receiving the habit and making
   their profession, are learning civil law and medicine with a view to
   temporal gain, in scornful disregard of the rules of their blessed
   teachers Benedict and Augustine. In fact, burning with the fire of
   avarice, they make themselves the advocates of suits; and since they
   have to neglect the psalmody and hymns, placing their trust in the
   power of fine rhetoric instead, they confuse what is right and what is
   wrong, justice and iniquity, by reason of the variety of their
   arguments. But the imperial constitutions testify that it is truly
   absurd and reprehensible for clerics to want to be experts in the
   disputes of law courts. We decree by apostolic authority that
   lawbreakers of this kind are to be severely punished. There are also
   those who, neglecting the care of souls, completely ignore their state
   in life, promise health in return for hateful money and make themselves
   healers of human bodies. And since an immodest eye manifests an
   immodest heart, religion ought to have nothing to do with those things
   of which virtue is ashamed to speak. Therefore, we forbid by apostolic
   authority this practice to continue, so that the monastic order and the
   order of canons may be preserved without stain in a state of life
   pleasing to God, in accord with their holy purpose. Furthermore,
   bishops, abbots and priors who consent to and fail to correct such an
   outrageous practice are to be deprived of their own honours and kept
   from the thresholds of the church.

Canon 10.

   We prohibit, by apostolic authority, that the tithes of churches be
   possessed by lay people where canonical authority shows these were
   assigned for religious purposes. For whether they accept them from
   bishops or kings, or any person whatsoever, let them know that they are
   committing the crime of sacrilege and incurring the threat of eternal
   damnation, unless they hand them back to the church. We also direct
   that lay people who are in possession of churches must either restore
   them to the bishops or become subject to excommunication. We reiterate
   our decision that nobody is to hold the office of archdeacon or dean
   unless he is ordained deacon or priest; and archdeacons, deans or
   provosts who are without these orders are to be deprived of the honour
   they have received, if through disobedience they refuse to be ordained.
   Moreover, we forbid the aforesaid honours to be conferred on youths or
   those not yet in sacred orders; let them be conferred rather on those
   who are outstanding in prudence and integrity of life. We also enjoin
   that churches are not to be entrusted to hired priests and that each
   and every church with sufficient means is to have its own priest

Canon 11.

   We also prescribe that priests, clerics, monks, pilgrims, merchants and
   peasants, in their coming and going and their work on the land, and the
   animals with which they plough and carry seeds to the fields, and their
   sheep {10} , be left in peace at all times.

Canon 12.

   We decree that the truce {11} is to be inviolably observed by all from
   sunset on Wednesday until sunrise on Monday, and from Advent until the
   octave of the Epiphany, and from Quinquagesima until the octave of
   Easter. If anyone tries to break the truce, and he does not comply
   after the third warning, let his bishop pronounce sentence of
   excommunication on him, and communicate his decision in writing to the
   neighbouring bishops. Moreover let none of the bishops receive into
   communion the excommunicated person, but rather let each confirm the
   sentence received in writing. If anyone presumes to infringe this, he
   will do so at the risk of his position. Since a threefold cord is not
   quickly broken, we enjoin bishops, having regard for God alone and the
   salvation of the people, and laying aside all timidity, to furnish each
   other with mutual counsel and help towards firmly maintaining peace,
   and not to omit this duty by reason of any affection or aversion. For
   if anyone is found to be lukewarm in this work of God, let him incur
   the loss of his dignity

Canon 13.

   Furthermore, we condemn that practice accounted despicable and
   blameworthy by divine and human laws, denounced by Scripture in the old
   and new Testaments, namely, the ferocious greed of usurers; and we
   sever them from every comfort of the church, forbidding any archbishop
   or bishop, or an abbot of any order whatever or anyone in clerical
   orders, to dare to receive usurers, unless they do so with extreme
   caution; but let them be held infamous throughout their whole lives
   and, unless they repent, be deprived of a christian burial.

Canon 14.

   We entirely forbid, moreover, those abominable jousts and tournaments
   in which knights come together by agreement and rashly engage in
   showing off their physical prowess and daring, and which often result
   in human deaths and danger to souls. If any of them dies on these
   occasions, although penance and viaticum are not to be denied him when
   he requests them, he is to be deprived of a church burial.

Canon 15.

   In the same way we have decided to legislate that if anyone, at the
   instigation of the devil, incurs the guilt of the following sacrilege,
   that is, to lay violent hands on a cleric or a monk, he is to be
   subject to the bond of anathema; and let no bishop presume to absolve
   such a person unless he is in immediate danger of death, until he has
   been presented before the apostolic See and submits to its decision. We
   also prescribe that nobody dare to lay hands on those who flee to a
   church or cemetery. If anyone does this, let him be excommunicated.

Canon 16.

   It is undoubtedly the case that since ecclesiastical honours depend not
   on blood-relationships but on merit, and since the church of God awaits
   successors not on the basis of any right of inheritance, nor according
   to the flesh, it requires virtuous, wise and devout persons for its
   administration and the distribution of its offices. Therefore we
   prohibit, by apostolic authority, anyone to exercise a claim over or to
   demand, by hereditary right, churches, prebends, provostships,
   chaplaincies or any ecclesiastical offices. If anyone, unjustly and
   guilty of ambition, dares to attempt this, he will be duly punished and
   deprived of the object of his suit.

Canon 17.

   With good reason we entirely prohibit unions within the bounds of
   consanguinity; for the teachings of holy fathers and the holy church of
   God detest incestuous behaviour of this kind, which (under the
   influence of the enemy of the human race) is engaged in nowadays. Even
   the secular laws pronounce those born of such a union infamous, and
   refuse them the right of inheritance

Canon 18.

   We completely detest and forbid, by the authority of God and the
   blessed apostles Peter and Paul, that most dreadful, devastating and
   malicious crime of incendiarism For this pernicious and inimical
   calamity surpasses all other kinds of destruction. Nobody is unaware of
   the extent to which it is injurious to the people of God and the damage
   it brings to souls and bodies. It is necessary, therefore, to oppose it
   and to labour with all one's might, that so great a harm and danger be
   eradicated and suppressed for the sake of the people. If anyone, then,
   after the publication of this prohibition of ours, from some wicked
   design born of hate or vengeance, starts a fire or causes it to be
   started, or knowingly provides counsel or help to those starting one,
   let him be excommunicated. And when an arsonist dies, he is to be
   deprived of a christian burial. Nor is he to be absolved unless, having
   first made reparation for the loss according to his means, he swears
   that he will never raise a fire again. Moreover, let him be given the
   penance of remaining a whole year in Jerusalem or Spain in the service
   of God.

Canon 19.

   If any archbishop or bishop relaxes this decree, he is to make
   restitution for the loss and abstain from his episcopal office for a
   year.

Canon 20.

   As is right, we do not deny to kings and princes the power to dispense
   justice, in consultation with the archbishops and bishops.

Canon 21.

   We decree that sons of priests are to be removed from the ministries of
   the sacred altar unless they are living religiously in monasteries or
   canonries.

Canon 22.

   Because there is one thing that conspicuously causes great disturbance
   to holy church, namely, false penance, we warn our brothers in the
   episcopate and priests not to allow the souls of the laity to be
   deceived or dragged off to hell by false penances. It is agreed that a
   penance is false when many sins are disregarded and a penance is
   performed for one only, or when it is done for one sin in such a way
   that the penitent does not renounce another. Thus it is written:
   Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point, has become guilty
   of all of it; this evidently pertains to eternal life. Therefore, just
   as a person who is entangled in all sins will not enter the gate of
   eternal life, so also if a person remains in one sin {12} . False
   penance also occurs when the penitent does not resign a position at a
   court or in business which cannot be carried on without sin, or if hate
   is harboured in his heart, or if the person does not make amends to
   whomever he offended, or if an injured party does not pardon the
   offender, or if anyone unjustly carries arms.

Canon 23.

   Those who, simulating a kind of religiosity, condemn
    1. the sacrament of the Lord's body and blood,
    2. the baptism of children,
    3. the priesthood and other ecclesiastical orders, and
    4. legitimate marriages,

   we expel from the church of God and condemn as heretics, and prescribe
   that they be constrained by the secular powers. We also bind up their
   defenders in the fetter of the same condemnation. {13}

Canon 24.

   We also prescribe that no sale-price is to be demanded for chrism, holy
   oil and burials.

Canon 25.

   If anyone receives provostships, prebends or other ecclesiastical
   benefices from the hand of a lay person, let him be deprived of the
   benefice unworthily received. For the decrees of the holy fathers state
   that lay people, no matter how devout they may be, have no power of
   disposal over ecclesiastical property.

Canon 26.

   We decree that the pernicious and detestable custom which has spread
   among some women who although they live neither according to the rule
   of blessed Benedict, nor Basil nor Augustine, yet wish to be thought of
   by everyone as nuns, is to be abolished. For when, living according to
   the rule in monasteries, they ought to be in church or in the refectory
   or dormitory in common, they build for themselves their own retreats
   and private dwelling-places where, under the guise of hospitality,
   indiscriminately and without any shame they receive guests and secular
   persons contrary to the sacred canons and good morals. Because everyone
   who does evil hates the light, these women think that, hidden in the
   tabernacle of the just {14} , they can conceal themselves from the eyes
   of the Judge who sees everything; so we prohibit in every way this
   unrighteous, hateful and disgraceful conduct and forbid it to continue
   under pain of anathema.

Canon 27.

   In the same way, we prohibit nuns to come together with canons or monks
   in choir for the singing of the office.

Canon 28.

   Since the decrees of the fathers prohibit churches to be left vacant
   for more than three months, we forbid under anathema the canons of the
   episcopal see to exclude religious men from the election following on
   the death of the bishop; but let a virtuous and suitable person be
   elected as bishop with their advice. Because if an election is held
   with these religious persons excluded, where this is done without their
   knowledge and consent, it is null and void.

Canon 29.

   We prohibit under anathema that murderous art of crossbowmen and
   archers, which is hateful to God, to be employed against Christians and
   Catholics from now on.

Canon 30.

   We render void the ordinances enacted by Peter Leoni and other
   schismatics and heretics, and deem them null.
