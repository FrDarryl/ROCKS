   DECREE ON THE MINISTRY AND LIFE OF PRIESTS
   PRESBYTERORUM ORDINIS
   PROMULGATED BY HIS HOLINESS, POPE PAUL VI
   ON DECEMBER 7, 1965

   PREFACE

   1. The excellence of the order of priests in the Church has already
   been recalled to the minds of all by this sacred synod.(1) Since,
   however, in the renewal of Christ's Church tasks of the greatest
   importance and of ever increasing difficulty are being given to this
   order, it was deemed most useful to treat of the subject of priests at
   greater length and with more depth. What is said here applies to all
   priests, especially those devoted to the care of souls, with suitable
   adaptations being made for priests who are religious. Priests by sacred
   ordination and mission which they receive from the bishops are promoted
   to the service of Christ the Teacher, Priest and King. They share in
   his ministry, a ministry whereby the Church here on earth is
   unceasingly built up into the People of God, the Body of Christ and the
   Temple of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in order that their ministry be
   carried on more effectively and their lives be better provided for, in
   pastoral and human circumstances which very often change so profoundly,
   this sacred synod declares and decrees as follows.

   CHAPTER I

   THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE MINISTRY OF THE CHURCH

   2. The Lord Jesus, "whom the Father has sent into the world" (Jn 10:36)
   has made his whole Mystical Body a sharer in the anointing of the
   Spirit with which he himself is anointed.(1) In him all the faithful
   are made a holy and royal priesthood; they offer spiritual sacrifices
   to God through Jesus Christ, and they proclaim the perfections of him
   who has called them out of darkness into his marvelous light.(2)
   Therefore, there is no member who does not have a part in the mission
   of the whole Body; but each one ought to hallow Jesus in his heart,(3)
   and in the spirit of prophecy bear witness to Jesus.(4)

   The same Lord, however, has established ministers among his faithful to
   unite them together in one body in which, "not all the members have the
   same function" (Rom 12:4). These ministers in the society of the
   faithful are able by the sacred power of orders to offer sacrifice and
   to forgive sins,(5) and they perform their priestly office publicly for
   men in the name of Christ. Therefore, having sent the apostles just as
   he himself been sent by the Father,(6) Christ, through the apostles
   themselves, made their successors, the bishops,(7) sharers in his
   consecration and mission. The office of their ministry has been handed
   down, in a lesser degree indeed, to the priests.(8) Established in the
   order of the priesthood they can be co-workers of the episcopal order
   for the proper fulfillment of the apostolic mission entrusted to
   priests by Christ.(9)

   The office of priests, since it is connected with the episcopal order,
   also, in its own degree, shares the authority by which Christ builds
   up, sanctifies and rules his Body. Wherefore the priesthood, while
   indeed it presupposes the sacraments of Christian initiation, is
   conferred by that special sacrament; through it priests, by the
   anointing of the Holy Spirit, are signed with a special character and
   are conformed to Christ the Priest in such a way that they can act in
   the person of Christ the Head.(10)

   In the measure in which they participate in the office of the apostles,
   God gives priests a special grace to be ministers of Christ among the
   people. They perform the sacred duty of preaching the Gospel, so that
   the offering of the people can be made acceptable and sanctified by the
   Holy Spirit.(11) Through the apostolic proclamation of the Gospel, the
   People of God are called together and assembled. All belonging to this
   people, since they have been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, can offer
   themselves as "a sacrifice, living, holy, pleasing to God" (Rom 12:1).
   Through the ministry of the priests, the spiritual sacrifice of the
   faithful is made perfect in union with the sacrifice of Christ. He is
   the only mediator who in the name of the whole Church is offered
   sacramentally in the Eucharist and in an unbloody manner until the Lord
   himself comes.(12) The ministry of priests is directed to this goal and
   is perfected in it. Their ministry, which begins with the evangelical
   proclamation, derives its power and force from the sacrifice of Christ.
   Its aim is that "the entire commonwealth of the redeemed and the
   society of the saints be offered to God through the High Priest who
   offered himself also for us in his passion that we might be the body of
   so great a Head."(13)

   The purpose, therefore, which priests pursue in their ministry and by
   their life is to procure the glory of God the Father in Christ. That
   glory consists in this-that men working freely and with a grateful
   spirit receive the work of God made perfect in Christ and then manifest
   it in their whole lives. Hence, priests, while engaging in prayer and
   adoration, or preaching the word, or offering the Eucharistic Sacrifice
   and administering the other sacraments, or performing other works of
   the ministry for men, devote all this energy to the increase of the
   glory of God and to man's progress in the divine life. All of this,
   since it comes from the Pasch of Christ, will be crowned by the
   glorious coming of the same Lord, when he hands over the Kingdom to God
   the Father.(14)

   3. Priests, who are taken from among men and ordained for men in the
   things that belong to God in order to offer gifts and sacrifices for
   sins,(15) nevertheless live on earth with other men as brothers. The
   Lord Jesus, the Son of God, a Man sent by the Father to men, dwelt
   among us and willed to become like his brethren in all things except
   sin.(16) The holy apostles imitated him. Blessed Paul, the doctor of
   the Gentiles, "set apart for the Gospel of God" (Rom 1:1) declares that
   he became all things to all men that he might save all.(17) Priests of
   the New Testament, by their vocation and ordination, are in a certain
   sense set apart in the bosom of the People of God. However, they are
   not to be separated from the People of God or from any person; but they
   are to be totally dedicated to the work for which the Lord has chosen
   them.(18) They cannot be ministers of Christ unless they be witnesses
   and dispensers of a life other than earthly life. But they cannot be of
   service to men if they remain strangers to the life and conditions of
   men.(19) Their ministry itself, by a special title, forbids that they
   be conformed to this world;(20) yet at the same time it requires that
   they live in this world among men. They are to live as good shepherds
   that know their sheep, and they are to seek to lead those who are not
   of this sheepfold that they, too, may hear the voice of Christ, so that
   there might be one fold and one shepherd.(21) To achieve this aim,
   certain virtues, which in human affairs are deservedly esteemed,
   contribute a great deal: such as goodness of heart, sincerity, strength
   and constancy of mind, zealous pursuit of justice, affability, and
   others. The Apostle Paul commends them saying: "Whatever things are
   true, whatever honorable, whatever just, whatever holy, whatever
   loving, whatever of good repute, if there be any virtue, if anything is
   worthy of praise, think upon these things" (Phil 4:8).(22)

   CHAPTER II

   The Ministry of Priests

   SECTION I
   Priests' Functions

   4. The People of God are joined together primarily by the word of the
   living God.(1) And rightfully they expect this from their priests.(2)
   Since no one can be saved who does not first believe,(3) priests, as
   co-workers with their bishops, have the primary duty of proclaiming the
   Gospel of God to all.(4) In this way they fulfill the command of the
   Lord: "Going therefore into the whole world preach the Gospel to every
   creature" (Mk 16:15),(5) and they establish and build up the People of
   God. Through the saving word the spark of faith is lit in the hearts of
   unbelievers, and fed in the hearts of the faithful. This is the way
   that the congregation of faithful is started and grows, just as the
   Apostle describes: "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the
   word of Christ" (Rom 10:17).

   To all men, therefore, priests are debtors that the truth of the
   Gospel(6) which they have may be given to others. And so, whether by
   entering into profitable dialogue they bring people to the worship of
   God,(7) whether by openly preaching they proclaim the mystery of
   Christ, or whether in the light of Christ they treat contemporary
   problems, they are relying not on their own wisdom for it is the word
   of Christ they teach, and it is to conversion and holiness that they
   exhort all men.(8) But priestly preaching is often very difficult in
   the circumstances of the modern world. In order that it might more
   effectively move men's minds, the word of God ought not to be explained
   in a general and abstract way, but rather by applying the lasting truth
   of the Gospel to the particular circumstances of life.

   The ministry of the word is carried out in many ways, according to the
   various needs of those who hear and the special gifts of those who
   preach. In areas or communities of non-Christians, the proclaiming of
   the Gospel draws men to faith and to the sacraments of salvation.(9) In
   the Christian community, especially among those who seem to understand
   and believe little of what they practice, the preaching of the word is
   needed for the very ministering of the sacraments. They are precisely
   sacraments of faith, a faith which is born of and nourished by the
   word.(10) This is especially true of the Liturgy of the Word in the
   celebration of Mass, in which the proclaiming of the death and
   resurrection of Christ is inseparably joined to the response of the
   people who hear, and to the very offering whereby Christ ratified the
   New Testament in his blood. In this offering the faithful are united
   both by their dispositions and by their discernment of the
   sacrament.(11)

   5. God, who alone is holy and who alone bestows holiness, willed to
   take as his companions and helpers men who would humbly dedicate
   themselves to the work of sanctification. Hence, through the ministry
   of the bishop, God consecrates priests, that being made sharers by
   special title in the priesthood of Christ, they might act as his
   ministers in performing sacred functions. In the liturgy they continue
   to carry on his priestly office by the action of his Spirit.(12) By
   Baptism men are truly brought into the People of God; by the sacrament
   of Penance sinners are reconciled to God and his Church; by the
   Anointing of the Sick, the ill are given solace; and especially by the
   celebration of Mass they offer sacramentally the Sacrifice of Christ.
   In administering all sacraments, as St. Ignatius Martyr(13) has borne
   witness from the early days of the Church, priests by various titles
   are bound together hierarchically with the bishop. And so in a certain
   way they make him present in every congregation.(14)

   The other sacraments, as well as with every ministry of the Church and
   every work of the apostolate, are tied together with the Eucharist and
   are directed toward it.(15) The Most Blessed Eucharist contains the
   entire spiritual boon of the Church,(16) that is, Christ himself, our
   Pasch and Living Bread, by the action of the Holy Spirit through his
   very flesh vital and vitalizing, giving life to men who are thus
   invited and encouraged to offer themselves, their labors and all
   created things, together with him. In this light, the Eucharist shows
   itself as the source and the apex of the whole work of preaching the
   Gospel. Those under instruction are introduced by stages to a sharing
   in the Eucharist, and the faithful, already marked with the seal of
   Baptism and Confirmation, are through the reception of the Eucharist
   fully joined to the Body of Christ.

   Thus the Eucharistic Action, over which the priest presides, is the
   very heart of the congregation. So priests must instruct their people
   to offer to God the Father the Divine Victim in the Sacrifice of the
   Mass, and to join to it the offering of their own lives. In the spirit
   of Christ the Shepherd, they must prompt their people to confess their
   sins with a contrite heart in the sacrament of Penance, so that,
   mindful of his words "Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand" (Mt
   4:17), they are drawn closer to the Lord more and more each day.
   Priests likewise must instruct their people to participate in the
   celebrations of the sacred liturgy in such a way that they become
   proficient in genuine prayer. They must coax their people on to an ever
   more perfect and constant spirit of prayer for every grace and need.
   They must gently persuade everyone to the fulfillment of the duties of
   his state of life, and to greater progress in responding in a sensible
   way to the evangelical counsels. Finally, they must train the faithful
   to sing hymns and spiritual songs in their hearts to the Lord, always
   giving thanks to God the Father for all things in the name of our Lord
   Jesus Christ.(17)

   Priests themselves extend to the other hours of the day the praise and
   thanksgiving of the Eucharistic celebration in praying the Divine
   Office, offered in the name of the Church for all the people entrusted
   to their care, and indeed for the whole world.

   The house of prayer in which the Most Holy Eucharist is celebrated and
   reserved, where the faithful gather and where the presence of the Son
   of God, our Savior, offered for us on the altar of sacrifice bestows
   strength and blessings on the faithful, must be spotless and suitable
   for prayer and sacred functions.(18) There pastors and the faithful are
   called to acknowledge with grateful heart the gift of him, Who through
   his humanity constantly pours divine life into the members of his
   Body.(19) Let priests take care so to foster a knowledge of and
   facility in the liturgy, that by their own liturgical ministry
   Christian communities entrusted to their care may ever more perfectly
   give praise to God, the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit.

   6. Exercising the office of Christ, the Shepherd and Head, and
   according to their share of his authority, priests, in the name of the
   bishop, gather the family of God together as a brotherhood enlivened by
   one spirit. Through Christ they lead them in the Holy Spirit to God the
   Father.(20) For the exercise of this ministry, as for the other
   priestly duties, spiritual power is conferred upon them for the
   building up of the Church.(21) In building up of the Church, priests
   must treat all with exceptional kindness in imitation of the Lord. They
   should act toward men, not as seeking to please them,(22) but in accord
   with the demands of Christian doctrine and life. They should teach them
   and admonish them as beloved sons,(23) according to the words of the
   Apostle: "Be urgent in season, out of season, reprove, entreat, rebuke
   in all patience and doctrine" (2 Tim 4:2).(24)

   Priests therefore, as educators in the faith, must see to it either by
   themselves or through others that the faithful are led individually in
   the Holy Spirit to a development of their own vocation according to the
   Gospel, to a sincere and practical charity, and to that freedom with
   which Christ has made us free.(25) Ceremonies however beautiful, or
   associations however flourishing, will be of little value if they are
   not directed toward the education of men to Christian maturity.(26) In
   furthering this, priests should help men to see what is required and
   what is God's will in the important and unimportant events of life.
   Also, Christians should be taught that they live not only for
   themselves, but, according to the demands of the new law of charity; as
   every man has received grace, he must administer the same to
   others.(27) In this way, all will discharge in a Christian manner their
   duties in the community of men.

   Although they have obligations toward all men, priests have a special
   obligation to the poor and weak entrusted to them, for our Lord himself
   showed that he was united to them,(28) and their evangelization is
   mentioned as a sign of messianic activity.(29) With special diligence,
   attention should be given to youth and also to married people and
   parents. It is desirable that these join together in friendly meetings
   for mutual aid in leading more easily and fully and in a Christian
   manner a life that is often difficult. Priests should remember that all
   religious, both men and women, who certainly have a distinguished place
   in the house of the Lord, deserve special care in their spiritual
   progress for the good of the whole Church. Finally, and above all,
   priests must be solicitous for the sick and the dying, visiting them
   and strengthening them in the Lord.(30)

   The office of pastor is not confined to the care of the faithful as
   individuals, but also in a true sense is extended to the formation of a
   genuine Christian community. Yet the spirit of the community should be
   so fostered as to embrace not only the local church, but also the
   universal Church. The local community should promote not only the care
   of its own faithful, but, filled with a missionary zeal, it should
   prepare also the way to Christ for all men. In a special way,
   catechumens and the newly-baptized who must be educated gradually to
   know and to live the Christian life are entrusted to his care.

   No Christian community, however, is built up unless it has its basis
   and center in the celebration of the most Holy Eucharist; from this,
   therefore, all education to the spirit of community must take its
   origin.(31) This celebration, if it is to be genuine and complete,
   should lead to various works of charity and mutual help, as well as to
   missionary activity and to different forms of Christian witness.

   The ecclesial community by prayer, example, and works of penance,
   exercise a true motherhood toward souls who are to be led to Christ.
   The Christian community forms an effective instrument by which the path
   to Christ and his Church is pointed out and made smooth for
   non-believers. It is an effective instrument also for arousing,
   nourishing and strengthening the faithful for their spiritual combat.

   In building the Christian community, priests are never to put
   themselves at the service of some human faction of ideology, but, as
   heralds of the Gospel and shepherds of the Church, they are to spend
   themselves for the spiritual growth of the Body of Christ.

   SECTION 2
   Priests' Relationships with Others

   7. All priests, in union with bishops, so share in one and the same
   priesthood and ministry of Christ that the very unity of their
   consecration and mission requires their hierarchical communion with the
   order of bishops.(32) At times in an excellent manner they manifest
   this communion in liturgical concelebration as joined with the bishop
   when they celebrate the Eucharistic Sacrifice.(33) Therefore, by reason
   of the gift of the Holy Spirit which is given to priests in Holy
   Orders, bishops regard them as necessary helpers and counselors in the
   ministry and in their role of teaching, sanctifying and nourishing the
   People of God.(34) Already in the ancient ages of the Church we find
   liturgical texts proclaiming this with insistence, as when they
   solemnly call upon God to pour out upon the candidate for priestly
   ordination "the spirit of grace and counsel, so that with a pure heart
   he may help and govern the People of God,"(35) just as in the desert
   the spirit of Moses was spread abroad in the minds of the seventy
   prudent men,(36) "and using them as helpers among the people, he easily
   governed countless multitudes."(37)

   Therefore, on account of this communion in the same priesthood and
   ministry, bishops should regard priests as their brothers and
   friends(38) and be concerned as far as they are able for their material
   and especially for their spiritual well-being. For above all upon the
   bishops rests the heavy responsibility for the sanctity of their
   priests.(39) Therefore, they should exercise the greatest care in the
   continual formation of their priests.(40) They should gladly listen to
   their priests, indeed consult them and engage in dialogue with them in
   those matters which concern the necessities of pastoral work and
   welfare of the diocese. In order to put this into effect, there should
   be-in a manner suited to today's conditions and necessities,(41) and
   with a structure and norms to be determined by law-a body or senate(42)
   of priests representing all the priests. This representative body by
   its advice will be able to give the bishop effective assistance in the
   administration of the diocese.

   Priests, never losing sight of the fullness of the priesthood which the
   bishops enjoy, must respect in them the authority of Christ, the
   Supreme Shepherd. They must therefore stand by their bishops in sincere
   charity and obedience.(43) This priestly obedience, imbued with a
   spirit of cooperation is based on the very sharing in the episcopal
   ministry which is conferred on priests both through the Sacrament of
   Orders and the canonical mission.(44)

   This union of priests with their bishops is all the more necessary
   today since in our present age, for various reasons, apostolic
   undertakings must necessarily not only take on many forms but
   frequently extend even beyond the boundaries of one parish or diocese.
   No priest, therefore, can on his own accomplish his mission in a
   satisfactory way. He can do so only by joining forces with other
   priests under the direction of the Church authorities.

   8. Priests by virtue of their ordination to the priesthood are united
   among themselves in an intimate sacramental brotherhood. In individual
   dioceses, priests form one priesthood under their own bishop. Even
   though priests are assigned to different duties, nevertheless they
   carry on one priestly ministry for men. All priests are sent as
   co-workers in the same apostolate, whether they engage in parochial or
   extra-parochial ministry. This is true whether they devote their
   efforts to scientific research or teaching, or whether by manual labor
   they share in the lot of the workers themselves-if there is need for
   this and competent authority approves-or finally whether they fulfill
   some other apostolic tasks or labor designed for the apostolate. All,
   indeed, are united in the building up of the Body of Christ which,
   especially in our times, requires manifold duties and new methods. It
   is very important that all priests, whether diocesan or religious, help
   one another always to be fellow workers in the truth.(45) Each one,
   therefore, is united in special bonds of apostolic charity, ministry
   and brotherhood with the other members of this priesthood. This has
   been manifested from ancient times in the liturgy when the priests
   present at an ordination are invited to impose hands together with the
   ordaining bishop on the new candidate, and with united hearts
   concelebrate the Sacred Eucharist. Each and every priest, therefore, is
   united with his fellow priests in a bond of charity, prayer and total
   cooperation. In this manner, they manifest that unity which Christ
   willed, namely, that his own be perfected in one so that the world
   might know that the Son was sent by the Father.(46)

   Older priests, therefore, should receive younger priests as true
   brothers and help them in their first undertakings and priestly duties.
   The older ones should likewise endeavor to understand the mentality of
   younger priests, even though it be different from their own, and follow
   their projects with good will. By the same token, young priests should
   respect the age and experience of their seniors; they should seek their
   advice and willingly cooperate with them in everything that pertains to
   the care of souls. In a fraternal spirit, priests should extend
   hospitality,(47) cultivate kindliness and share their goods in
   common.(48) They should be particularly solicitous for the sick, the
   afflicted, those overburdened with work, the lonely, those exiled from
   their homeland, and those who suffer persecution.(49) They should
   gladly and joyfully gather together for recreation, remembering
   Christ's invitation to the weary apostles: "Come aside to a desert
   place, and rest awhile" (Mk 6:31). And further, in order that priests
   may find mutual assistance in the development of their spiritual and
   intellectual life, that they may be able to cooperate more effectively
   in their ministry and be saved from the dangers of loneliness which may
   arise, it is necessary that some kind of common life or some sharing of
   common life be encouraged among priests. This, however, may take many
   forms, according to different personal or pastoral needs, such as
   living together where this is possible, or having a common table, or at
   least by frequent and periodic meetings. One should hold also in high
   regard and eagerly promote those associations which, having been
   recognized by competent ecclesiastical authority, encourage priestly
   holiness in the ministry by the use of an appropriate and duly approved
   rule of life and by fraternal aid, intending thus to do service to the
   whole order of priests.

   Finally, by reason of the same communion in the priesthood, priests
   should realize that they are obliged in a special manner toward those
   priests who labor under certain difficulties. They should give them
   timely help, and also, if necessary, admonish them discreetly.
   Moreover, they should always treat with fraternal charity and
   magnanimity those who have failed in some matters, offer urgent prayers
   to God for them, and continually show themselves as true brothers and
   friends.

   9. Though priests of the New Testament, in virtue of the sacrament of
   Orders, exercise the most outstanding and necessary office of father
   and teacher among and for the People of God, they are nevertheless,
   together with all Christ's faithful, disciples of the Lord, made
   sharers in his Kingdom by the grace of God's call.(50) For priests are
   brothers among brothers(51) with all those who have been reborn at the
   baptismal font. They are all members of one and the same Body of
   Christ, the building up of which is required of everyone.(52)

   Priests, therefore, must take the lead in seeking the things of Jesus
   Christ, not the things that are their own.(53) They must work together
   with the lay faithful, and conduct themselves in their midst after the
   example of their Master, who among men "came not to be ministered unto,
   but to minister, and to give his life as redemption for many" (Mt
   20:28). Priests must sincerely acknowledge and promote the dignity of
   the laity and the part proper to them in the mission of the Church. And
   they should hold in high honor that just freedom which is due to
   everyone in the earthly city. They must willingly listen to the laity,
   consider their wants in a fraternal spirit, recognize their experience
   and competence in the different areas of human activity, so that
   together with them they will be able to recognize the signs of the
   times. While trying the spirits to see if they be of God,(54) priests
   should uncover with a sense of faith, acknowledge with joy and foster
   with diligence the various humble and exalted charisms of the laity.
   Among the other gifts of God, which are found in abundance among the
   laity, those are worthy of special mention by which not a few of the
   laity are attracted to a higher spiritual life. Likewise, they should
   confidently entrust to the laity duties in the service of the Church,
   allowing them freedom and room for action; in fact, they should invite
   them on suitable occasions to undertake worlds on their own
   initiative.(55)

   Finally priests have been placed in the midst of the laity to lead them
   to the unity of charity, "loving one another with fraternal love, eager
   to give one another precedence" (Rom 12:10). It is their task,
   therefore, to reconcile differences of mentality in such a way that no
   one need feel himself a stranger in the community of the faithful. They
   are defenders of the common good, with which they are charged in the
   name of the bishop. At the same time, they are strenuous assertors of
   the truth, lest the faithful be carried about by every wind of
   doctrine.(56) They are united by a special solicitude with those who
   have fallen away from the use of the sacraments, or perhaps even from
   the faith. Indeed, as good shepherds, they should not cease from going
   out to them.

   Mindful of the prescripts on ecumenism,(57) let them not forget their
   brothers who do not enjoy full ecclesiastical communion with us.

   Finally, they have entrusted to them all those who do not recognize
   Christ as their Savior.

   The Christian faithful, for their part, should realize their
   obligations to their priests, and with filial love they should follow
   them as their pastors and fathers. In like manner, sharing their cares,
   they should help their priests by prayer and work insofar as possible
   so that their priests might more readily overcome difficulties and be
   able to fulfill their duties more fruitfully.(58)

   SECTION 3
   The Distribution of Priests, and Vocations to the Priesthood

   10. The spiritual gift which priests receive at their ordination
   prepared them not for a sort of limited and narrow mission but for the
   widest possible and universal mission of salvation "even to the ends of
   the earth" (Acts 1:8), for every priestly ministry shares in the
   universality of the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles. The
   priesthood of Christ, in which all priests really share, is necessarily
   intended for all peoples and all times, and it knows no limits of
   blood, nationality or time, since it is already mysteriously prefigured
   in the person of Melchisedech.(59) Let priests remember, therefore,
   that the care of all churches must be their intimate concern. Hence,
   priests of such dioceses as are rich in vocations should show
   themselves willing and ready, with the permission of their own
   ordinaries (bishops), to volunteer for work in other regions, missions
   or endeavors which are poor in numbers of clergy.

   Present norms of incardination and excardination should be so revised
   that, while this ancient institution still remains intact, they will
   better correspond to today's pastoral needs. Where a real apostolic
   spirit requires it, not only should a better distribution of priests be
   brought about but there should also be favored such particular pastoral
   works as are necessary in any region or nation anywhere on earth. To
   accomplish this purpose there should be set up international
   seminaries, special personal dioceses or prelatures (vicariates), and
   so forth, by means of which, according to their particular statutes and
   always saving the right of bishops, priests may be trained and
   incardinated for the good of the whole Church.

   Priests should not be sent singly to a new field of labor, especially
   to one where they are not completely familiar with the language and
   customs; rather, after the example of the disciples of Christ,(60) they
   should be sent two or three together so that they may be mutually
   helpful to one another. Likewise, thoughtful care should be given to
   their spiritual life as well as their mental and bodily welfare; and,
   so far as is possible, the circumstances and conditions of labor should
   be adapted to individual needs and capabilities. At the same time it
   will be quite advantageous if those priests who go to work in a nation
   new to them not only know well the language of that place but also the
   psychological and social milieu peculiar to the people they go to
   serve, so that they may communicate with them easily, thus following
   the example of Paul the Apostle who could say of himself: "For when I
   was free of all I made myself the servant of all, that I might win over
   many. Among Jews I was a Jew that I might win over the Jews" (1 Cor
   9:19-20).

   11. The Shepherd and Bishop of our souls(61) so constituted his Church
   that the people whom he chose and acquired by his blood(62) would have
   its priests to the end of time, and that Christians would never be like
   sheep without a shepherd.(63) Recognizing Christ's desire, and at the
   inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the apostles considered it their duty
   to select men "who will be capable of teaching others" (2 Tim 2:2).
   This duty, then, is a part oœ the priestly mission by which every
   priest becomes a sharer in the care of the whole Church, lest ministers
   be ever lacking for the People of God on earth. Since, however, there
   is common cause between the captain of a ship and the sailors,(64) let
   all Christian people be taught that it is their duty to cooperate in
   one way or another, by constant prayer and other means at their
   disposal,(65) that the Church will always have a sufficient number of
   priests to carry out her divine mission. In the first place, therefore,
   it is the duty of priests, by the ministry of the word and by the
   example of their own lives, showing forth the spirit of service and the
   paschal joy to demonstrate to the faithful the excellence and necessity
   of the priesthood; then they should see to it that young men and adults
   whom they judge worthy of such ministry should be called by their
   bishops to ordination, sparing no effort or inconvenience in helping
   them to prepare for this call, always saving their internal and
   external freedom of action. In this effort, diligent and prudent
   spiritual direction is of the greatest value. Parents and teachers and
   all who are engaged in any way in the education of boys and young men
   should so prepare them that they will recognize the solicitude of our
   Lord for his flock, will consider the needs of the Church, and will be
   prepared to respond generously to our Lord when he calls, saying: "Here
   I am Lord, send me" (Is 6:8). This voice of the Lord calling, however,
   is never to be expected as something which in an extraordinary manner
   will be heard by the ears of the future priest. It is rather to be
   known and understood in the manner in which the will of God is daily
   made known to prudent Christians. These indications should be carefully
   noted by priests.(66)

   Works favoring vocations, therefore, whether diocesan or national, are
   highly recommended to the consideration of priests.(67) In sermons, in
   catechetical instructions, and written articles, priests should set
   forth the needs of the Church both locally and universally, putting
   into vivid light the nature and excellence of the priestly ministry,
   which consoles heavy burdens with great joys, and in which in a special
   way, as the Fathers of the Church point out, the greatest love of
   Christ can be shown.(68)

   CHAPTER III

   The Life of Priests

   SECTION 1
   The Vocation of Priests to the Life of Perfection

   12. Priests are made in the likeness of Christ the Priest by the
   Sacrament of Orders, so that they may, in collaboration with their
   bishops, work for the building up and care of the Church which is the
   whole Body of Christ, acting as ministers of him who is the Head. Like
   all other Christians they have received in the sacrament of Baptism the
   symbol and gift of such a calling and such grace that even in human
   weakness(1) they can and must seek for perfection, according to the
   exhortation of Christ: "Be you therefore perfect, as your Heavenly
   Father is perfect" (Mt 5:48). Priests are bound, however, to acquire
   that perfection in special fashion. They have been consecrated by God
   in a new manner at their ordination and made living instruments of
   Christ the Eternal Priest that they may be able to carry on in time his
   marvelous work whereby the entire family of man is again made whole by
   power from above.(2) Since, therefore, every priest in his own fashion
   acts in place of Christ himself, he is enriched by a special grace, so
   that, as he serves the flock committed to him and the entire People of
   God, he may the better grow in the grace of him whose tasks he
   performs, because to the weakness of our flesh there is brought the
   holiness of him who for us was made a High Priest "holy, guiltless,
   undefiled not reckoned among us sinners" (Heb 7:26).

   Christ, whom the Father sanctified, consecrated and sent into the
   world,(3) "gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all
   iniquity and cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuing good
   works" (Tt 2:14), and thus through suffering entered into his glory.(4)
   In like fashion, priests consecrated by the anointing of the Holy
   Spirit and sent by Christ must mortify the works of the flesh in
   themselves and give themselves entirely to the service of men. It is in
   this way that they can go forward in that holiness with which Christ
   endows them to perfect man.(5)

   Hence, those who exercise the ministry of the spirit and of justice(6)
   will be confirmed in the life of the spirit, so long as they are open
   to the Spirit of Christ, who gives them life and direction. By the
   sacred actions which are theirs daily as well as by their entire
   ministry which they share with the bishop and their fellow priests,
   they are directed to perfection in their lives. Holiness does much for
   priests in carrying on a fruitful ministry. Although divine grace could
   use unworthy ministers to effect the work of salvation, yet for the
   most part God chooses, to show forth his wonders, those who are more
   open to the power and direction of the Holy Spirit, and who can by
   reason of their close union with Christ and their holiness of life say
   with St. Paul: "And yet I am alive; or rather, not I; it is Christ that
   lives in me" (Gal 2:20).

   Hence, this holy council, to fulfill its pastoral desires of an
   internal renewal of the Church, of the spread of the Gospel in every
   land and of a dialogue with the world of today, strongly urges all
   priests that they strive always for that growth in holiness by which
   they will become consistently better instruments in the service of the
   whole People of God, using for this purpose those means which the
   Church has approved.(7)

   13. Priests who perform their duties sincerely and indefatigably in the
   Spirit of Christ arrive at holiness by this very fact.

   Since they are ministers of God's word, each day they read and hear the
   word of God, which it is their task to teach others. If at the same
   time they are ready to receive the word themselves they will grow daily
   into more perfect followers of the Lord. As St. Paul wrote to Timothy,
   "Let this be thy study, these thy employments, so that all may see how
   well thou doest. Two things claim thy attention, thyself and the
   teaching of the faith, spend thy care on them; so wilt thou and those
   who listen to thee achieve salvation" (1 Tim 4:15-16). As they seek how
   they may better teach others what they have learned,(8) they will
   better understand "the unfathomable riches of Christ" (Eph 3:8) and the
   manifold wisdom of God.(9) If they keep in mind that it is God who
   opens hearts,(10) and that power comes not from themselves but from the
   might of God,(11) in the very fact of teaching God's word they will be
   brought closer to Christ the Teacher and led by his Spirit. Thus those
   who commune with Christ share in God's love, the mystery of which, kept
   hidden from the beginning of time,(12) is revealed in Christ.

   Priests act especially in the person of Christ as ministers of holy
   things, particularly in the Sacrifice of the Mass, the sacrifice of
   Christ who gave himself for the sanctification of men. Hence, they are
   asked to take example from that with which they deal, and inasmuch as
   they celebrate the mystery of the Lord's death they should keep their
   bodies free of wantonness and lusts.(13) In the mystery of the
   Eucharistic Sacrifice, in which priests fulfill their greatest task,
   the work of our redemption is being constantly carried on;(14) and
   hence the daily celebration of Mass is strongly urged, since even if
   there cannot be present a number of the faithful, it is still an act of
   Christ and of the Church.(15) Thus when priests join in the act of
   Christ the Priest, they offer themselves entirely to God, and when they
   are nourished with the body of Christ they profoundly share in the love
   of him who gives himself as food to the faithful. In like fashion they
   are united with the intention and love of Christ when they administer
   the sacraments. This is true in a special way when in the performance
   of their duty in the sacrament of Penance they show themselves
   altogether and always ready whenever the sacrament is reasonably sought
   by the faithful. In the recitation of the Divine Office, they offer the
   voice of the Church which perseveres in prayer in the name of the whole
   human race, together with Christ who "lives on still to make
   intercession on our behalf."

   As they direct and nourish the People of God, may they be aroused by
   the example of the Good Shepherd that they may give their life for
   their sheep,(16) ready for the supreme sacrifice following the example
   of priests who, even in our own day, have not shrunk from giving their
   lives. As they are leaders in the faith and as they "enter the
   sanctuary with confidence, through the blood of Christ" (Heb 10:19)
   they approach God "with sincere hearts in the full assurance of the
   faith" (Heb 10:22) they set up a sure hope for their faithful,(17) that
   they may comfort those who are depressed by the same consolation
   wherewith God consoles them.(18) As leaders of the community they
   cultivate an asceticism becoming to a shepherd of souls, renouncing
   their personal convenience, seeking not what is useful to themselves
   but to many, for their salvation,(19) always making further progress to
   do their pastoral work better and, where needful, prepared to enter
   into new pastoral ways under the direction of the Spirit of Love, which
   breathes where it will.(20)

   14. In the world of today, when people are so burdened with duties and
   their problems, which oftentimes have to be solved with great haste,
   range through so many fields, there is considerable danger of
   dissipating their energy. Priests, too, involved and constrained by so
   many obligations of their office, certainly have reason to wonder how
   they can coordinate and balance their interior life with feverish
   outward activity. Neither the mere external performance of the works of
   the ministry, nor the exclusive engagement in pious devotion, although
   very helpful, can bring about this necessary coordination. Priests can
   arrive at this only by following the example of Christ our Lord in
   their ministry. His food was to follow the will of him who had sent him
   to accomplish his work.(21)

   In order to continue doing the will of his Father in the world, Christ
   works unceasingly through the Church. He operates through his
   ministers, and hence he remains always the source and wellspring of the
   unity of their lives. Priests, then, can achieve this coordination and
   unity of life by joining themselves with Christ to acknowledge the will
   of the Father. For them this means a complete gift of themselves to the
   flock committed to them.(22) Hence, as they fulfill the role of the
   Good Shepherd, in the very exercise of their pastoral charity they will
   discover a bond of priestly perfection which draws their life and
   activity to unity and coordination. This pastoral charity(23) flows out
   in a very special way from the Eucharistic sacrifice. This stands as
   the root and center of the whole life of a priest. What takes place on
   the altar of sacrifice, the priestly heart must make his own. This
   cannot be done unless priests through prayer continue to penetrate more
   deeply into the mystery of Christ.

   In order to measure and verify this coordination of life in a concrete
   way, let priests examine all their works and projects to see what is
   the will of God(24)-namely, to see how their endeavors compare with the
   goals of the Gospel mission of the Church. Fidelity to Christ cannot be
   separated from faithfulness to his Church. Pastoral charity requires
   that priests avoid operating in a vacuum(25) and that they work in a
   strong bond of union with their bishops and brother priests. If this be
   their program, priests will find the coordination and unity of their
   own life in the oneness of the Church's mission. They will be joined
   with the Lord and through him with the Father in the Holy Spirit. This
   will bring them great satisfaction and a full measure of happiness.(26)

   SECTION 2
   Special Spiritual Requirements in the Life of a Priest

   15. Among the virtues that priests must possess for their sacred
   ministry none is so important as a frame of mind and soul whereby they
   are always ready to know and do the will of him who sent them and not
   their own will.(27) The divine task that they are called by the Holy
   Spirit to fulfill(28) surpasses all human wisdom and human ability.
   "God chooses the weak things of the world to confound the strong" (1
   Cor 1:27). Aware of his own weakness, the true minister of Christ works
   in humility trying to do what is pleasing to God.(29) Filled with the
   Holy Spirit,(30) he is guided by him who desires the salvation of all
   men. He understands this desire of God and follows it in the ordinary
   circumstances of his everyday life. With humble disposition he waits
   upon all whom God has sent him to serve in the work assigned to him and
   in the multiple experiences of his life.

   However, the priestly ministry, since it is the ministry of the Church
   itself, can only function in the hierarchical union of the whole body.
   Pastoral charity, therefore, urges priests, as they operate in the
   framework of this union, to dedicate their own will by obedience to the
   service of God and their fellow men. In a great spirit of faith, let
   them receive and execute whatever orders the holy father, their own
   bishop, or other superiors give or recommend.

   With a willing heart let them spend and even exhaust themselves(31) in
   whatever task they are given, even though it be menial and
   unrecognized. They must preserve and strengthen a necessary oneness
   with their brothers in the ministry, especially with those whom God has
   selected as visible rulers of his Church. For in this way they are
   laboring to build the Body of Christ which grows "through every gesture
   of service."(32) This obedience is designed to promote the mature
   freedom of the children of God; by its very nature it postulates that
   in the carrying out of their work, spurred on by charity, they develop
   new approaches and methods for the greater good of the Church. With
   enthusiasm and courage, let priests propose new projects and strive to
   satisfy the needs of their flocks. Of course, they must be ready to
   submit to the decisions of those who rule the Church of God.

   By this humility and by willing responsible obedience, priests conform
   themselves to Christ. They make their own the sentiments of Jesus
   Christ who "emptied himself, taking on the form of a servant," becoming
   obedient even to death (Phil 2:7-9). By this obedience he conquered and
   made up for the disobedience of Adam, as the Apostle testifies, "for as
   by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners, so also by the
   obedience of one, many shall be made just"(Rom 5:19).

   16. (Celibacy is to be embraced and esteemed as a gift). Perfect and
   perpetual continence for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven, commended
   by Christ the Lord(33) and through the course of time as well as in our
   own days freely accepted and observed in a praiseworthy manner by many
   of the faithful, is held by the Church to be of great value in a
   special manner for the priestly life. It is at the same time a sign and
   a stimulus for pastoral charity and a special source of spiritual
   fecundity in the world.(34) Indeed, it is not demanded by the very
   nature of the priesthood, as is apparent from the practice of the early
   Church(35) and from the traditions of the Eastern Churches. where,
   besides those who with all the bishops, by a gift of grace, choose to
   observe celibacy, there are also married priests of highest merit. This
   holy synod, while it commends ecclesiastical celibacy, in no way
   intends to alter that different discipline which legitimately
   flourishes in the Eastern Churches. It permanently exhorts all those
   who have received the priesthood and marriage to persevere in their
   holy vocation so that they may fully and generously continue to expend
   themselves for the sake of the flock commended to them.(36)

   Indeed, celibacy has a many-faceted suitability for the priesthood. For
   the whole priestly mission is dedicated to the service of a new
   humanity which Christ, the victor over death, has aroused through his
   Spirit in the world and which has its origin "not of blood, nor of the
   will of the flesh, nor of the will of man but of God (Jn 1:13). Through
   virginity, then, or celibacy observed for the Kingdom of Heaven,(37)
   priests are consecrated to Christ by a new and exceptional reason. They
   adhere to him more easily with an undivided heart,(38) they dedicate
   themselves more freely in him and through him to the service of God and
   men, and they more expeditiously minister to his Kingdom and the work
   of heavenly regeneration, and thus they are apt to accept, in a broad
   sense, paternity in Christ. In this way they profess themselves before
   men as willing to be dedicated to the office committed to them-namely,
   to commit themselves faithfully to one man and to show themselves as a
   chaste virgin for Christ(39) and thus to evoke the mysterious marriage
   established by Christ, and fully to be manifested in the future, in
   which the Church has Christ as her only Spouse.(40) They give,
   moreover, a living sign of the world to come, by a faith and charity
   already made present, in which the children of the resurrection neither
   marry nor take wives.(41)

   For these reasons, based on the mystery of Christ and his mission,
   celibacy, which first was recommended to priests, later in the Latin
   Church was imposed upon all who were to be promoted to sacred orders.
   This legislation, pertaining to those who are destined for the
   priesthood, this holy synod again approves and confirms, fully trusting
   this gift of the Spirit so fitting for the priesthood of the New
   Testament, freely given by the Father, provided that those who
   participate in the priesthood of Christ through the sacrament of
   Orders-and also the whole Church-humbly and fervently pray for it. This
   sacred synod also exhorts all priests who, in following the example of
   Christ, freely receive sacred celibacy as a grace of God, that they
   magnanimously and wholeheartedly adhere to it, and that persevering
   faithfully in it, they may acknowledge this outstanding gift of the
   Father which is so openly praised and extolled by the Lord.(42) Let
   them keep before their eyes the great mysteries signified by it and
   fulfilled in it. Insofar as perfect continence is thought by many men
   to be impossible in our times, to that extent priests should all the
   more humbly and steadfastly pray with the Church for that grace of
   fidelity, which is never denied those who seek it, and use all the
   supernatural and natural aids available. They should especially seek,
   lest they omit them, the ascetical norms which have been proved by the
   experience of the Church and which are scarcely less necessary in the
   contemporary world. This holy synod asks not only priests but all the
   faithful that they might receive this precious gift of priestly
   celibacy in their hearts and ask of God that he will always bestow this
   gift upon his Church.

   17. (Relationship to the world and temporal goods, and voluntary
   poverty.) In their friendly and brotherly dealings with one another and
   with other men, priests are able to learn and appreciate human values
   and esteem created goods as gifts of God. By living in the world, let
   priests know how not to be of the world, according to the word of our
   Lord and Master.(43) By using the world as those who do not use it,(44)
   let them achieve that freedom whereby they are free from every
   inordinate concern and become docile to the voice of God in their daily
   life. From this freedom and docility grows spiritual discretion in
   which is found the right relationship to the world and earthly goods.
   Such a right relationship is of great importance to priests, because
   the mission of the Church is fulfilled in the midst of the world and
   because created goods are altogether necessary for the personal
   development of man. Let them be grateful, therefore, for all that the
   heavenly Father has given them to lead a full life rightly, but let
   them see all that comes to them in the light of faith, so that they
   might correctly use goods in response to the will of God and reject
   those which are harmful to their mission.

   For priests who have the Lord as their "portion and heritage," (Num
   18:20) temporal goods should be used only toward ends which are licit
   according to the doctrine of Christ and the direction of the Church.

   Ecclesiastical goods, properly so called, according to their nature and
   ecclesiastical law, should be administered by priests with the help of
   capable laymen as far as possible and should always be employed for
   those purposes in the pursuit of which it is licit for the Church to
   possess temporal goods-namely, for the carrying out of divine worship,
   for the procuring of honest sustenance for the clergy, and for the
   exercise of the works of the holy apostolate or works of charity,
   especially in behalf of the needy.(45) Those goods which priests and
   bishops receive for the exercise of their ecclesiastical office should
   be used for adequate support and the fulfillment of their office and
   status, excepting those governed by particular laws.(46) That which is
   in excess they should be willing to set aside for the good of the
   Church or for works of charity. Thus they are not to seek
   ecclesiastical office or the benefits of it for the increase of their
   own family wealth.(47) Therefore, in no way placing their heart in
   treasures,(48) they should avoid all greediness and carefully abstain
   from every appearance of business.

   Priests, moreover, are invited to embrace voluntary poverty by which
   they are more manifestly conformed to Christ and become eager in the
   sacred ministry. For Christ, though he was rich, became poor on account
   of us, that by his need we might become rich.(49) And by their example
   the apostles witnessed that a free gift of God is to be freely
   given,(50) with the knowledge of how to sustain both abundance and
   need.(51) A certain common use of goods, similar to the common
   possession of goods in the history of the primitive Church,(52)
   furnishes an excellent means of pastoral charity. By living this form
   of life, priests can laudably reduce to practice that spirit of poverty
   commended by Christ.

   Led by the Spirit of the Lord, who anointed the Savior and sent him to
   evangelize the poor,(53) priests, therefore, and also bishops, should
   avoid everything which in any way could turn the poor away. Before the
   other followers of Christ, let priests set aside every appearance of
   vanity in their possessions. Let them arrange their homes so that they
   might not appear unapproachable to anyone, lest anyone, even the most
   humble, fear to visit them.

   SECTION THREE
   Aids to the Life of Priests

   18. (Aids to encourage the spiritual life.) In order that, in all
   conditions of life, they may be able to grow in union with Christ,
   priests, besides the exercise of their conscious ministry, enjoy the
   common and particular means, old and new, which the Spirit never ceases
   to arouse in the People of God and which the Church commends, and
   sometimes commands,(54) for the sanctification of her members.
   Outstanding among all these spiritual aids are those acts by which the
   faithful are nourished in the Word of God at the double table of the
   Sacred Scripture and the Eucharist.(55) The importance of frequent use
   of these for the sanctification of priests is obvious to all. The
   ministers of sacramental grace are intimately united to Christ our
   Savior and Pastor through the fruitful reception of the sacraments,
   especially sacramental Penance, in which, prepared by the daily
   examination of conscience, the necessary conversion of heart and love
   for the Father of Mercy is greatly deepened. Nourished by spiritual
   reading, under the light of faith, they can more diligently seek signs
   of God's will and impulses of his grace in the various events of life,
   and so from day to day become more docile to the mission they have
   assumed in the Holy Spirit. They will always find a wonderful example
   of such docility in the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was led by the Holy
   Spirit to dedicate herself totally to the mystery of man's
   redemption.(56) Let priests love and venerate with filial devotion and
   veneration this mother of the Eternal Highpriest, Queen of Apostles and
   Protector of their own ministry.

   In the fulfillment of their ministry with fidelity to the daily
   colloquy with Christ, a visit to and veneration of the Most Holy
   Eucharist, spiritual retreats and spiritual direction are of great
   worth. In many ways, but especially through mental prayer and the vocal
   prayers which they freely choose, priests seek and fervently pray that
   God will grant them the spirit of true adoration whereby they
   themselves, along with the people committed to them, may intimately
   unite themselves with Christ the Mediator of the New Testament, and so
   as adopted children of God may be able to call out "Abba, Father" (Rom
   8:15).

   19. (Study and pastoral knowledge.) Priests are admonished by their
   bishop in the sacred rite of ordination that they "be mature in
   knowledge" and that their doctrine be "spiritual medicine for the
   People of God."(57) The knowledge of the sacred minister ought to be
   sacred because it is drawn from the sacred source and directed to a
   sacred goal. Especially is it drawn from reading and meditating on the
   Sacred Scriptures,(58) and it is equally nourished by the study of the
   Holy Fathers and other Doctors and monuments or tradition. In order,
   moreover, that they may give apt answers to questions posed by men of
   this age, it is necessary for priests to know well the doctrines of the
   magisterium and the councils and documents of the Roman pontiffs and to
   consult the best of prudent writers of theological science.

   Since human culture and also sacred science has progressed in our
   times, priests are urged to suitably and without interruption perfect
   their knowledge of divine things and human affairs and so prepare
   themselves to enter more opportunely into conversation with their
   contemporaries.

   Therefore, let priests more readily study and effectively learn the
   methods of evangelization and the apostolate. Let opportune aids be
   prepared with all care, such as the institution of courses and meetings
   according to territorial conditions, the erection of centers of
   pastoral studies, the establishment of libraries, and the qualified
   supervision of studies by suitable persons. Moreover, let bishops,
   either individually or united in groups, see to it that all their
   priests at established intervals, especially a few years after their
   ordination,(59) may be able to frequent courses in which they will be
   given the opportunity to acquire a fuller knowledge of pastoral methods
   and theological science, both in order that they may strengthen their
   spiritual life and mutually communicate their apostolic experiences
   with their brothers.(60) New pastors and those who have newly begun
   pastoral work, as well as those who are sent to other dioceses or
   nations, should be helped by these and other suitable means with
   special care.

   Finally, the bishops will be solicitous that there will be some who
   dedicate themselves to a deeper study of theology, that there will not
   be lacking suitable teachers for the formation of clerics, that the
   rest of the priests and the faithful will be helped to acquire the
   doctrine they need, and that healthy progress will be encouraged in the
   sacred disciplines, so necessary for the Church.

   20. (Providing equitable remuneration for priests.) As those dedicated
   to the service of God and the fulfillment of the office entrusted to
   them, priests deserve to receive an equitable remuneration, because
   "the laborer is worthy of his hire," (Lk 10:7)(61) and "the Lord
   directed that those who preach the Gospel should have their living from
   the Gospel" (1 Cor 9:14). Wherefore, insofar as an equitable
   remuneration of the priests would not be provided otherwise, the
   faithful themselves-that is, those in whose behalf the priest
   labors-are truly obliged to see to it that they can provide what help
   is necessary for the honorable and worthy life of the priests. The
   bishops, however, should admonish the faithful concerning this
   obligation of theirs. And they should see to if whether each individual
   for his own diocese or, more aptly, several together for their common
   territory-that norms are established according to which suitable
   support is rightly provided for those who do fulfill or have fulfilled
   a special office in the service of the People of God. The remuneration
   received by each one, in accord with his office and the conditions of
   time and place, should be fundamentally the same for all in the same
   circumstances and befitting his station. Moreover, those who have
   dedicated themselves to the service of the priesthood, by reason of the
   remuneration they receive, should not only be able to honorably provide
   for themselves but also themselves be provided with some means of
   helping the needy. For the ministry to the poor has always been held in
   great honor in the Church from its beginnings. Furthermore, this
   remuneration should be such that it will permit priests each year to
   take a suitable and sufficient vacation, something which indeed the
   bishops should see that their priests are able to have.

   Special importance ought to be given to the office fulfilled by sacred
   ministers. Therefore the so-called system of benefices should be
   relinquished or at least so reformed that the place of the benefits, or
   the right to revenue from the endowment attached to an office, would be
   held as secondary, and the first place in law would be given to the
   ecclesiastical office itself. From this it should be understood that
   whatever office is conferred in a stable manner is to be exercised for
   a spiritual purpose.

   21. (On setting up common funds and establishing a system of social
   assistance for priests.) We should always keep before our eyes the
   example of the faithful of the early Church in Jerusalem, who "held all
   things in common" (Acts 4;32) "and distribution was made to each
   according to each one's need" (Acts 4:35). So it is supremely fitting,
   at least in regions where the support of the clergy completely or
   largely depends on the offerings of the faithful, that their offerings
   for this purpose be collected by a particular diocesan institution,
   which the bishop administers with the help of priests and, when useful,
   of laymen who are expert in financial matters. Further it is hoped that
   insofar as is possible in individual dioceses or regions there be
   established a common fund enabling bishops to satisfy obligations to
   other deserving persons and meet the needs of various dioceses. This
   would also enable wealthier dioceses to help the poorer, that the need
   of the latter might be supplemented by the abundance of the former.(62)
   These common funds, even though they should be principally made up of
   the offerings of the faithful, also should be provided for by other
   duly established sources.

   Moreover, in nations where social security for the clergy is not yet
   aptly established, let the episcopal conferences see to it that-in
   accord with ecclesiastical and civil laws-there may be either diocesan
   institutes, whether federated with one another or established for
   various dioceses together, or territorial associations, which under the
   vigilance of the hierarchy would make sufficient and suitable provision
   for a program of preventive medicine, and the necessary support of
   priests who suffer from sickness, invalid conditions or old age. Let
   priests share in this established institute, prompted by a spirit of
   solidarity with their brothers to take part in their tribulations(63)
   while at the same time being freed from an anxious concern for their
   own future so that they can cultivate evangelical poverty more readily
   and give themselves fully to the salvation of souls. Let those in
   charge of this act to bring together the institutes of various nations
   in order that their strength he more firmly achieved and more broadly
   based.

   CONCLUSION AND EXHORTATION

   22. Having before our eyes the joys of the priestly life, this holy
   synod cannot at the same time overlook the difficulties which priests
   experience in the circumstances of contemporary life. For we know how
   much economic and social conditions are transformed, and even more how
   much the customs of men are changed, how much the scale of values is
   changed in the estimation of men. As a result, the ministers of the
   Church and sometimes the faithful themselves feel like strangers in
   this world, anxiously looking for the ways and words with which to
   communicate with it. For there are new obstacles which have arisen to
   the faith: the seeming unproductivity of work done, and also the bitter
   loneliness which men experience can lead them to the danger of becoming
   spiritually depressed.

   The world which today is entrusted to the loving ministry of the
   pastors of the Church is that which God so loved that he would give his
   only Son for it.(1) Truly this world, indeed weighed down with many
   sins but also endowed with many talents, provides the Church with the
   living stones(2) which are built up into the dwelling place of God in
   the Spirit.(3) This same Holy Spirit, while impelling the Church to
   open new ways to go to the world of today, suggests and favors the
   growth of fitting adaptations in the ministry of priests.

   Priests should remember that in performing their office they are never
   alone, but strengthened by the power of Almighty God, and believing in
   Christ who called them to share in his Priesthood, they should devote
   themselves to their ministry with complete trust, knowing that God can
   cause charity to grow in them.(4) Let them be mindful of their brothers
   in the priesthood as well, and also of the faithful of the entire world
   who are associated with them. For all priests cooperate in carrying out
   the saving plan of God,(5) that is, the Mystery of Christ, the
   sacrament hidden from the ages in God, which is only brought to
   fulfillment little by little through the collaboration of many
   ministries in building up the Body of Christ until it grows to the
   fullness of time. All this, hidden with Christ in God,(6) can be
   uniquely perceived by faith. For the leaders of the People of God must
   walk by faith, following the example of faithful Abraham, who in faith
   "obeyed by going out into a place which he was to receive for an
   inheritance; and he went out not knowing where he was going" (Heb
   11:8). Indeed, the dispenser of the mysteries of God can see himself in
   the man who sowed his field, of whom the Lord said: "then sleep and
   rise, night and day, and the seed should sprout without his knowing"
   (Mk 4:27). As for the rest, the Lord Jesus, who said: "Take courage, I
   have overcome the world," (Jn 16:33) did not by these words promise his
   Church a perfect victory in this world. Certainly this holy synod
   rejoices that the earth has been sown with the seed of the Gospel which
   now bears fruit in many places, under the direction of the Holy Spirit
   who fills the whole earth and who has stirred up a missionary spirit in
   the hearts of many priests and faithful. Concerning all this, this holy
   synod gives fervent thanks to the priests of the entire world. "Now to
   him who is able to accomplish all things in a measure far beyond what
   we ask or conceive in keeping with the power that is at work in us-to
   him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus" (Eph 3:20-21).

   institutions so that modern circumstances and necessities might better
   be provided for. As is evident, this synod of priests forms the
   pastoral consilium spoken of in the Decree on the Pastoral Duties of
   Bishops of Oct. 28, 1965 (n.27), of which the laity can also be
