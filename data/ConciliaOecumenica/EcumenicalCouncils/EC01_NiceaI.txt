The First Council at Nicea, 325

INTRODUCTION

   This council opened on 19 June in the presence of the emperor, but it
   is uncertain who presided over the sessions. In the extant lists of
   bishops present, Ossius of Cordova, and the presbyters Vitus and
   Vincentius are listed before the other names, but it is more likely
   that Eustathius of Antioch or Alexander of Alexandria presided. (see
   Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils, ed. Norman P. Tanner S.J.)
   The bold text in the profession of faith of the 318 fathers
   constitutes, according to Tanner "The additions made by the council to
   an underlying form of the creed", and that the underlying creed was
   most likely "derived from the baptismal formula of Caesarea put forward
   by the bishop of that city Eusebius" or that it "developed from an
   original form which existed in Jerusalem or at any rate Palestine". "A
   direct descent from the creed of Eusebius of Caesarea is manifestly out
   of the question." Vol 1, p2)
   The figure of 318 given in the heading below is from Hilary of Poitier
   and is the traditional one. Other numbers are Eusebius 250, Eustathius
   of Antioch 270., Athanasius about 300, Gelasius of Cyzicus at more than
   300.

THE PROFESSION OF FAITH OF THE 318 FATHERS

   1. We believe in one God the Father all powerful, maker of all things
   both seen and unseen. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
   only-begotten begotten from the Father, that is from the substance [Gr.
   ousias, Lat. substantia] of the Father, God from God, light from light,
   true God from true God, begotten [Gr. gennethenta, Lat. natum] not made
   [Gr. poethenta, Lat. factum], CONSUBSTANTIAL [Gr. homoousion, Lat.
   unius substantiae (quod Graeci dicunt homousion)] with the Father,
   through whom all things came to be, both those in heaven and those in
   earth; for us humans and for our salvation he came down and became
   incarnate, became human, suffered and rose up on the third day, went up
   into the heavens, is coming to judge the living and the dead. And in
   the holy Spirit.
   And those who say
   "there once was when he was not", and "before he was begotten he was
   not", and that
   he came to be from
   things that were not, or
   from another hypostasis [Gr. hypostaseos] or substance [Gr. ousias,
   Lat. substantia],
   affirming that the Son of God is subject to change or alteration
   these the catholic and apostolic church anathematises.

CANONS

Canon 1.

   If anyone in sickness has undergone surgery at the hands of physicians
   or has been castrated by barbarians, let him remain among the clergy.
   But if anyone in good health has castrated himself, if he is enrolled
   among the clergy he should be suspended, and in future no such man
   should be promoted. But, as it is evident that this refers to those who
   are responsible for the condition and presume to castrate themselves,
   so too if any have been made eunuchs by barbarians or by their masters,
   but have been found worthy, the canon admits such men to the clergy.

Canon 2.

   Since, either through necessity or through the importunate demands of
   certain individuals, there have been many breaches of the church's
   canon, with the result that men who have recently come from a pagan
   life to the faith after a short catechumenate have been admitted at
   once to the spiritual washing, and at the same time as their baptism
   have been promoted to the episcopate or the presbyterate, it is agreed
   that it would be well for nothing of the kind to occur in the future.
   For a catechumen needs time and further probation after baptism, for
   the apostle's words are clear: "Not a recent convert, or he may be
   puffed up and fall into the condemnation and the snare of the devil".
   But if with the passage of time some sin of sensuality is discovered
   with regard to the person and he is convicted by two or three
   witnesses, such a one will be suspended from the clergy. If anyone
   contravenes these regulations, he will be liable to forfeit his
   clerical status for acting in defiance of this great synod.

Canon 3.

   This great synod absolutely forbids a bishop, presbyter, deacon or any
   of the clergy to keep a woman who has been brought in to live with him,
   with the exception of course of his mother or sister or aunt, or of any
   person who is above suspicion.

Canon 4.

   It is by all means desirable that a bishop should be appointed by all
   the bishops of the province. But if this is difficult because of some
   pressing necessity or the length of the journey involved, let at least
   three come together and perform the ordination, but only after the
   absent bishops have taken part in the vote and given their written
   consent. But in each province the right of confirming the proceedings
   belongs to the metropolitan bishop.

Canon 5.

   Concerning those, whether of the clergy or the laity, who have been
   excommunicated, the sentence is to be respected by the bishops of each
   province according to the canon which forbids those expelled by some to
   be admitted by others. But let an inquiry be held to ascertain whether
   anyone has been expelled from the community because of pettiness or
   quarrelsomeness or any such ill nature on the part of the bishop.
   Accordingly, in order that there may be proper opportunity for inquiry
   into the matter, it is agreed that it would be well for synods to be
   held each year in each province twice a year, so that these inquiries
   may be conducted by all the bishops of the province assembled together,
   and in this way by general consent those who have offended against
   their own bishop may be recognised by all to be reasonably
   excommunicated, until all the bishops in common may decide to pronounce
   a more lenient sentence on these persons. The synods shall be held at
   the following times: one before Lent, so that, all pettiness being set
   aside, the gift offered to God may be unblemished; the second after the
   season of autumn.

Canon 6.

   The ancient customs of Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis shall be maintained,
   according to which the bishop of Alexandria has authority over all
   these places since a similar custom exists with reference to the bishop
   of Rome. Similarly in Antioch and the other provinces the prerogatives
   of the churches are to be preserved. In general the following principle
   is evident: if anyone is made bishop without the consent of the
   metropolitan, this great synod determines that such a one shall not be
   a bishop. If however two or three by reason of personal rivalry dissent
   from the common vote of all, provided it is reasonable and in
   accordance with the church's canon, the vote of the majority shall
   prevail.

Canon 7.

   Since there prevails a custom and ancient tradition to the effect that
   the bishop of Aelia is to be honoured, let him be granted everything
   consequent upon this honour, saving the dignity proper to the
   metropolitan.

Canon 8.

   Concerning those who have given themselves the name of Cathars, and who
   from time to time come over publicly to the catholic and apostolic
   church, this holy and great synod decrees that they may remain among
   the clergy after receiving an imposition of hands. But before all this
   it is fitting that they give a written undertaking that they will
   accept and follow the decrees of the catholic church, namely that they
   will be in communion with those who have entered into a second marriage
   and with those who have lapsed in time of persecution and for whom a
   period [of penance] has been fixed and an occasion [for reconciliation]
   allotted, so as in all things to follow the decrees of the catholic and
   apostolic church. Accordingly, where all the ordained in villages or
   cities have been found to be men of this kind alone, those who are so
   found will remain in the clergy in the same rank; but when some come
   over in places where there is a bishop or presbyter belonging to the
   catholic church, it is evident that the bishop of the church will hold
   the bishop's dignity, and that the one given the title and name of
   bishop among the so-called Cathars will have the rank of presbyter,
   unless the bishop thinks fit to let him share in the honour of the
   title. But if this does not meet with his approval, the bishop will
   provide for him a place as chorepiscopus or presbyter, so as to make
   his ordinary clerical status evident and so prevent there being two
   bishops in the city.

Canon 9.

   If any have been promoted presbyters without examination, and then upon
   investigation have confessed their sins, and if after their confession
   men have imposed hands upon such people, being moved to act against the
   canon, the canon does not admit these people, for the catholic church
   vindicates only what is above reproach.

Canon 10.

   If any have been promoted to ordination through the ignorance of their
   promoters or even with their connivance, this fact does not prejudice
   the church's canon; for once discovered they are to be deposed.

Canon 11.

   Concerning those who have transgressed without necessity or the
   confiscation of their property or without danger or anything of this
   nature, as happened under the tyranny of Licinius, this holy synod
   decrees that, though they do not deserve leniency, nevertheless they
   should be treated mercifully. Those therefore among the faithful who
   genuinely repent shall spend three years among the hearers, for seven
   years they shall be prostrators, and for two years they shall take part
   with the people in the prayers, though not in the offering.

Canon 12.

   Those who have been called by grace, have given evidence of first
   fervour and have cast off their [military] belts, and afterwards have
   run back like dogs to their own vomit, so that some have even paid
   money and recovered their military status by bribes -- such persons
   shall spend ten years as prostrators after a period of three years as
   hearers. In every case, however, their disposition and the nature of
   their penitence should be examined. For those who through their fear
   and tears and perseverance and good works give evidence of their
   conversion by deeds and not by outward show, when they have completed
   their appointed term as hearers, may properly take part in the prayers,
   and the bishop is competent to decide even more favourably in their
   regard. But those who have taken the matter lightly, and have thought
   that the outward form of entering the church is all that is required
   for their conversion, must complete their term to the full.
   13. Concerning the departing, the ancient canon law is still to be
   maintained namely that those who are departing are not to be deprived
   of their last, most necessary viaticum. But if one whose life has been
   despaired of has been admitted to communion and has shared in the
   offering and is found to be numbered again among the living, he shall
   be among those who take part in prayer only [here a variant reading in
   Les canons des conciles oecumeniques adds "until the term fixed by this
   great ecumenical synod has been completed"]. But as a general rule, in
   the case of anyone whatsoever who is departing and seeks to share in
   the eucharist, the bishop upon examining the matter shall give him a
   share in the offering.

Canon 14.

   Concerning catechumens who have lapsed, this holy and great synod
   decrees that, after they have spent three years as hearers only, they
   shall then be allowed to pray with the catechumens.

Canon 15.

   On account of the great disturbance and the factions which are caused,
   it is decreed that the custom, if it is found to exist in some parts
   contrary to the canon, shall be totally suppressed, so that neither
   bishops nor presbyters nor deacons shall transfer from city to city. If
   after this decision of this holy and great synod anyone shall attempt
   such a thing, or shall lend himself to such a proceeding, the
   arrangement shall be totally annulled, and he shall be restored to the
   church of which he was ordained bishop or presbyter or deacon.

Canon 16.

   Any presbyters or deacons or in general anyone enrolled in any rank of
   the clergy who depart from their church recklessly and without the fear
   of God before their eyes or in ignorance of the church's canon, ought
   not by any means to be received in another church, but all pressure
   must be applied to them to induce them to return to their own dioceses,
   or if they remain it is right that they should be excommunicated. But
   if anyone dares to steal away one who belongs to another and to ordain
   him in his church without the consent of the other's own bishop among
   whose clergy he was enrolled before he departed, the ordination is to
   be null.

Canon 17.

   Since many enrolled [among the clergy] have been induced by greed and
   avarice to forget the sacred text, "who does not put out his money at
   interest", and to charge one per cent [a month] on loans, this holy and
   great synod judges that if any are found after this decision to receive
   interest by contract or to transact the business in any other way or to
   charge [a flat rate of] fifty per cent or in general to devise any
   other contrivance for the sake of dishonourable gain, they shall be
   deposed from the clergy and their names struck from the roll.

Canon 18.

   It has come to the attention of this holy and great synod that in some
   places and cities deacons give communion to presbyters, although
   neither canon nor custom allows this, namely that those who have no
   authority to offer should give the body of Christ to those who do
   offer. Moreover it has become known that some of the deacons now
   receive the eucharist even before the bishops. All these practices must
   be suppressed. Deacons must remain within their own limits, knowing
   that they are the ministers of the bishop and subordinate to the
   presbyters. Let them receive the eucharist according to their order
   after the presbyters from the hands of the bishop or the presbyter. Nor
   shall permission be given for the deacons to sit among the presbyters,
   for such an arrangement is contrary to the canon and to rank. If anyone
   refuses to comply even after these decrees, he is to be suspended from
   the diaconate.

Canon 19.

   Concerning the former Paulinists who seek refuge in the catholic
   church, it is determined that they must be rebaptised unconditionally.
   Those who in the past have been enrolled among the clergy, if they
   appear to be blameless and irreproachable, are to be rebaptised and
   ordained by the bishop of the catholic church. But if on inquiry they
   are shown to be unsuitable, it is right that they should be deposed.
   Similarly with regard to deaconesses and all in general whose names
   have been included in the roll, the same form shall be observed. We
   refer to deaconesses who have been granted this status, for they do not
   receive any imposition of hands, so that they are in all respects to be
   numbered among the laity.

Canon 20.

   Since there are some who kneel on Sunday and during the season of
   Pentecost, this holy synod decrees that, so that the same observances
   may be maintained in every diocese, one should offer one's prayers to
   the Lord standing.

THE LETTER OF THE SYNOD IN NICAEA TO THE EGYPTIANS

   The bishops assembled at Nicaea, who constitute the great and holy
   synod, greet the church of the Alexandrians, by the grace of God holy
   and great, and the beloved brethren in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis.
   Since the grace of God and the most pious emperor Constantine have
   called us together from different provinces and cities to constitute
   the great and holy synod in Nicaea, it seemed absolutely necessary that
   the holy synod should send you a letter so that you may know what was
   proposed and discussed, and what was decided and enacted.
   First of all the affair of the impiety and lawlessness of Arius and his
   followers was discussed in the presence of the most pious emperor
   Constantine. It was unanimously agreed that anathemas should be
   pronounced against his impious opinion and his blasphemous terms and
   expressions which he has blasphemously applied to the Son of God,
   saying
   "he is from things that are not", and
   "before he was begotten he was not", and
   "there once was when he was not",
   saying too that
   by his own power the Son of God is capable of
   evil and
   goodness,
   and calling him
   a creature and a work.
   Against all this the holy synod pronounced anathemas, and did not allow
   this impious and abandoned opinion and these blasphemous words even to
   be heard.
   Of that man and the fate which befell him, you have doubtless heard or
   will hear, lest we should seem to trample upon one who has already
   received a fitting reward because of his own sin. Such indeed was the
   power of his impiety that Theonas of Marmarica and Secundus of
   Ptolemais shared in the consequences, for they too suffered the same
   fate.
   But since, when the grace of God had freed Egypt from this evil and
   blasphemous opinion, and from the persons who had dared to create a
   schism and a separation in a people which up to now had lived in peace,
   there remained the question of the presumption of Meletius and the men
   whom he had ordained, we shall explain to you, beloved brethren, the
   synod's decisions on this subject too. The synod was moved to incline
   towards mildness in its treatment of Meletius for strictly speaking he
   deserved no mercy. It decreed that that he might remain in his own city
   without any authority to nominate or ordain, and that he was not to
   show himself for this purpose in the country or in another city, and
   that he was to retain the bare name of his office.
   It was further decreed that those whom he had ordained, when they had
   been validated by a more spiritual ordination, were to be admitted to
   communion on condition that they would retain their rank and exercise
   their ministry, but in every respect were to be second to all the
   clergy in each diocese and church who had been nominated under our most
   honoured brother and fellow minister Alexander; they were to have no
   authority to appoint candidates of their choice or to put forward names
   or to do anything at all without the consent of the bishop of the
   catholic church, namely the bishop of those who are under Alexander.
   But those who by the grace of God and by our prayers have not been
   detected in any schism, and are spotless in the catholic and apostolic
   church, are to have authority to appoint and to put forward the names
   of men of the clergy who are worthy, and in general to do everything
   according to the law and rule of the church.
   In the event of the death of any in the church, those who have recently
   been accepted are thereupon to succeed to the office of the deceased,
   provided that they appear worthy and are chosen by the people; the
   bishop of Alexandria is to take part in the vote and confirm the
   election. This privilege, which has been granted to all others, does
   not apply to the person of Meletius because of his inveterate
   seditiousness and his mercurial and rash disposition, lest any
   authority or responsibility should be given to one who is capable of
   returning to his seditious practices.
   These are the chief and most important decrees as far as concerns Egypt
   and the most holy church of the Alexandrians. Whatever other canons and
   decrees were enacted in the presence of our lord and most honoured
   fellow minister and brother Alexander, he will himself report them to
   you in greater detail when he comes, for he was himself a leader as
   well as a participant in the events.
   The following is not found in the latin text, but is found in the greek
   text :
   We also send you the good news of the settlement concerning the holy
   pasch, namely that in answer to your prayers this question also has
   been resolved. All the brethren in the East who have hitherto followed
   the Jewish practice will henceforth observe the custom of the Romans
   and of yourselves and of all of us who from ancient times have kept
   Easter together with you. Rejoicing then in these successes and in the
   common peace and harmony and in the cutting off of all heresy, welcome
   our fellow minister, your bishop Alexander, with all the greater honour
   and love. He has made us happy by his presence, and despite his
   advanced age has undertaken such great labour in order that you too may
   enjoy peace.
   Pray for us all that our decisions may remain secure through almighty
   God and our lord Jesus Christ in the holy Spirit, to whom is the glory
   for ever and ever. Amen.
