The Second General Council of Nicaea, 787

INTRODUCTION

   A recommendation to summon an ecumenical council, in order to correct
   the iconoclast heretics, had been addressed to Empress Irene, then
   acting as regent for her son Emperor Constantine VI (780-797) who was
   still a minor, both by Patriarch Paul IV of Constantinople (who had
   repented of his earlier iconoclast views) before his abdication from
   the see in 784 and by his successor as patriarch, Tarasius. The aim was
   to unite the church and to condemn the decrees passed by the council of
   338 bishops held at Hiereia and St Mary of Blachernae in 754.
   The convocation of the council was announced to Pope Hadrian I
   (772-795) in a letter of Constantine VI and Irene, dated 29 August 784.
   They urged him either to attend in person or to send legates. Patriarch
   Tarasius sent the same message in synodal letters to the pope and the
   three eastern patriarchs. Pope Hadrian I gave his approval for the
   convocation of the council, stipulating various conditions, and sent as
   his legates the archpriest Peter and Peter, abbot of the Greek
   monastery of St Sabas in Rome.
   The council, which was summoned by an imperial edict in the summer of
   786, met for the first time on 1 August 786, in the presence of Emperor
   Constantine and Empress Irene. When the proceedings were interrupted by
   the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers, faithful to the memory of
   Emperor Constantine V (741-775), the council was adjourned until the
   arrival of a reliable army under Staurakios. It assembled again at
   Nicaea on 24 September 787, the papal legates having been recalled from
   Sicily.
   After the bishops suspected of heresy had been admitted, 263 fathers
   embraced the doctrine concerning the cult of sacred images as explained
   in the letters of Pope Hadrian I, which were read out at the second
   session.
   The question of the intercession of saints was dealt with in the fourth
   session.
   Once all these matters had been approved, a doctrinal definition was
   decreed at the seventh session.
   At the eighth and last session, which was held at the request of
   Constantine and Irene in the Magnaura palace in Constantinople, the
   definition was again decreed and proclaimed and 22 canons were read
   out. The papal legates presided over the council and were the first to
   sign the acts; but in reality it was Patriarch Tarasius who presided,
   and it was he, at the command of the council, who informed Pope Hadrian
   I about it: "the occasion when the letters of your fraternal holiness
   were read out and all acclaimed them".
   Pope Hadrian I wrote no letter in reply, yet the defence he made of the
   council in 794 against Charlemagne shows that he accepted what the
   council had decreed, and that he had sent no acknowledgement because
   the concessions which he had requested in his letter of 26 October 785
   to Constantine and Irene had not been granted to him, especially
   concerning the restoration of the papacy's patrimony to the state at
   which it had been prior to 731, that is, before Illyricum had been
   confiscated by the emperor Leo III. Emperor Constantine VI and his
   mother Irene signed the acts of the council but it is unclear whether
   or not they promulgated a decree on the matter.

Definition

   The holy, great and universal synod, by the grace of God and by order
   of our pious and Christ-loving emperor and empress, Constantine and his
   mother Irene, assembled for the second time in the famous metropolis of
   the Nicaeans in the province of the Bithynians, in the holy church of
   God named after Wisdom, following the tradition of the catholic church,
   has decreed what is here laid down.
   {The council bases itself on the inspiration of Tradition & of itself}
   The one who granted us the light of recognizing him, the one who
   redeemed us from the darkness of idolatrous insanity, Christ our God,
   when he took for his bride his holy catholic church, having no blemish
   or wrinkle, promised he would guard her and assured his holy disciples
   saying, I am with you every day until the consummation of this age.
   This promise however he made not only to them but also to us, who
   thanks to them have come to believe in his name. To this gracious offer
   some people paid no attention, being hoodwinked by the treacherous foe
   they abandoned the true line of reasoning, and setting themselves
   against the tradition of the catholic church they faltered in their
   grasp of the truth. As the proverbial saying puts it, they turned askew
   the axles of their farm carts and gathered no harvest in their hands.
   Indeed they had the effrontery to criticise the beauty pleasing to God
   established in the holy monuments; they were priests in name, but not
   in reality. They were those of whom God calls out by prophecy, Many
   pastors have destroyed my vine, they have defiled my portion. For they
   followed unholy men and trusting to their own frenzies they calumniated
   the holy church, which Christ our God has espoused to himself, and they
   failed to distinguish the holy from the profane, asserting that the
   icons of our Lord and of his saints were no different from the wooden
   images of satanic idols.
   Therefore the Lord God, not bearing that what was subject to him should
   be destroyed by such a corruption, has by his good pleasure summoned us
   together through the divine diligence and decision of Constantine and
   Irene, our faithful emperor and empress, we who are those responsible
   for the priesthood everywhere, in order that the divinely inspired
   tradition of the catholic church should receive confirmation by a
   public decree. So having made investigation with all accuracy and
   having taken counsel, setting for our aim the truth, we neither
   diminish nor augment, but simply guard intact all that pertains to the
   catholic church.
   {Recapitulation and re-affirmation of everything taught by any previous
   ecumenical council}
   Thus, following the six holy universal synods, in the first place that
   assembled in the famous metropolis of the Nicaeans {{1}Nicea I}, and
   then that held after it in the imperial, God-guarded city: {i.e. {2}
   Constantinople I} We believe in one God ...[the
   Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed follows]. We abominate and anathematize
   - Arius and those who think like him and share in his mad error; also
   Macedonius and those with him, properly called the Pneumatomachi; we
   also confess our Lady, the holy Mary, to be really and truly the
   God-bearer, because she gave birth in the flesh to Christ, one of the
   Trinity, our God, just as the first synod at {3}Ephesus decreed; it
   also expelled from the church Nestorius and those with him, because
   they were introducing a duality of persons. Along with these synods, we
   also confess the two natures of the one who became incarnate for our
   sake from the God-bearer without blemish, Mary the ever-virgin,
   recognizing that he is perfect God and perfect man, as the synod at
   {4}Chalcedon also proclaimed, when it drove from the divine precinct
   the foul-mouthed Eutyches and Dioscorus. We reject along with them
   Severus Peter and their interconnected band with their many
   blasphemies, in whose company we anathematize the mythical speculations
   of Origen, Evagrius and Didymus, as did the fifth synod, that assembled
   at {5}Constantinople. Further we declare that there are two wills and
   principles of action, in accordance with what is proper to each of the
   natures in Christ, in the way that the sixth synod, that at
   {6}Constantinople, proclaimed, when it also publicly rejected Sergius,
   Honorius, Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Macarius, those uninterested in true
   holiness, and their likeminded followers.
   To summarize, we declare that we defend free from any innovations all
   the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been
   entrusted to us.
   {Council formulates for the first time what the Church has always
   believed regarding icons}
   One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite
   in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides
   confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not
   just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit. For, things that
   mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's
   message.
   Given this state of affairs and stepping out as though on the royal
   highway, following as we are the God-spoken teaching of our holy
   fathers and the tradition of the catholic church -- for we recognize
   that this tradition comes from the holy Spirit who dwells in her-- we
   decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the
   honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether
   painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be
   exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and
   vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways, these are
   the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady
   without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of
   any of the saintly holy men.
   The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are
   those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as
   models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and
   respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration
   {latria} in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to
   the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the
   honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the
   gospels and to other sacred cult objects. Further, people are drawn to
   honour these images with the offering of incense and lights, as was
   piously established by ancient custom. Indeed, the honour paid to an
   image traverses it, reaching the model, and he who venerates the image,
   venerates the person represented in that image.
   So it is that the teaching of our holy fathers is strengthened, namely,
   the tradition of the catholic church which has received the gospel from
   one end of the earth to the other.
   So it is that we really follow Paul, who spoke in Christ, and the
   entire divine apostolic group and the holiness of the fathers, clinging
   fast to the traditions which we have received.
   So it is that we sing out with the prophets the hymns of victory to the
   church: Rejoice exceedingly O daughter of Zion, proclaim O daughter of
   Jerusalem; enjoy your happiness and gladness with a full heart. The
   Lord has removed away from you the injustices of your enemies, you have
   been redeemed from the hand of your foes. The Lord the king is in your
   midst, you will never more see evil, and peace will be upon you for
   time eternal.
   Therefore all those who dare to think or teach anything different, or
   who follow the accursed heretics in rejecting ecclesiastical
   traditions, or who devise innovations, or who spurn anything entrusted
   to the church (whether it be the gospel or the figure of the cross or
   any example of representational art or any martyr's holy relic), or who
   fabricate perverted and evil prejudices against cherishing any of the
   lawful traditions of the catholic church, or who secularize the sacred
   objects and saintly monasteries, we order that they be suspended if
   they are bishops or clerics, and excommunicated if they are monks or
   lay people.
   Anathemas concerning holy images
   If anyone does not confess that Christ our God can be represented in
   His humanity, let him be anathema.
   If anyone does not accept representation in art of evangelical scenes,
   let him be anathema.
   If anyone does not salute such representations as standing for the Lord
   and His saints, let him be anathema.
   If anyone rejects any written or unwritten Tradition of the Church, let
   him be anathema.

CANONS

Canon 1.

   For those to whom the priestly dignity is allotted, the guide-lines
   contained in the canonical regulations are testimonies and directives.
   We accept them gladly and sing out to the Lord God with David, the
   revealer of God: In the path of your testimonies I have taken delight,
   as with all manner of wealth; and, You have enjoined justice, your
   testimonies are for ever; instruct me to give me life. And if the
   prophetic voice orders us for all eternity to observe the messages of
   God and to live in them, it is obvious that they remain unshakeable and
   immoveable; thus Moses, who looked on God, declares, To these there is
   no addition, and from these there is no subtraction. The divine apostle
   takes pride in them when he cries out, These things which the angels
   long to gaze upon, and, If an angel brings you a gospel contrary to
   what you have received, let him be accursed.
   Since these things really are such and have been testified to us in
   these ways, we exult in them as a person would if he were to come
   across a great mass of booty. We joyfully embrace the sacred canons and
   we maintain complete and unshaken their regulation, both those
   expounded by those trumpets of the Spirit, the apostles worthy of all
   praise, and those from the six holy universal synods and from the
   synods assembled locally for the promulgation of such decrees, and from
   our holy fathers. Indeed all of these, enlightened by one and the same
   Spirit, decreed what is expedient. In the case of those whom they sent
   away under an anathema, we also anathematize them, those whom they
   suspended, we also suspend; those whom they excommunicated, we also
   excommunicate; those whom they placed under penalties, we also deal
   with in the same way. Let your conduct be free from avariciousness,
   contenting yourself with what you have, cried out with all explicitness
   the divine apostle Paul, who mounted to the third heaven and heard
   words that cannot be uttered.

Canon 2.

   Since we make an undertaking before God as we sing, I shall meditate on
   your judgments, I shall not neglect your words, it is essential to our
   salvation that every Christian should observe these things, but more
   especially those who have been invested with priestly dignity.
   Therefore we decree that
   everyone who is to be advanced to the grade of bishop should have a
   thorough knowledge of the psalter, in order that he may instruct all
   the clergy subordinate to him, to be initiated in that book.
   He should also be examined without fail by the metropolitan to see if
   he is willing to acquire knowledge--a knowledge that should be
   searching and not superficial--of the sacred canons, the holy gospel,
   the book of the divine apostle, and all divine scripture;
   also if he is willing to conduct himself and teach the people entrusted
   to him according to the divine commandments.
   "The substance of our hierarchy are the words handed down from God",
   that is to say, the true knowledge of the divine scriptures, as the
   great Dionysius made plain. If someone is doubtful and ill at ease with
   such conduct and teaching, let him not be ordained. For God said
   through the prophet: You rejected knowledge, and I shall reject you, so
   that you may not serve me in a priestly function.

Canon 3.

   Any election of a bishop, priest or deacon brought about by the rulers
   is to be null and void in accordance with the canon that says: "If any
   bishop, through the influence of secular rulers, acquires
   responsibility for a church because of them, let him be suspended and
   let all those who are in communion with him be excommunicated".
   It is necessary that the person who is to be advanced to a bishopric
   should be elected by bishops, as has been decreed by the holy fathers
   at Nicaea in the canon that says: "It is by all means desirable that a
   bishop should be appointed by all [the bishops] in the province. But if
   this is difficult because of some pressing necessity or the length of
   the journey involved, let at least three come together and perform the
   ordination, but only after the absent bishops have taken part in the
   vote and given their written consent. But in each province the right of
   confirming the proceedings belongs to the metropolitan".

Canon 4.

   The herald of the truth, Paul, the divine apostle, laying down a sort
   of rule for the presbyters of Ephesus, or rather for the whole priestly
   order, declared firmly: I have not coveted silver or gold or anybody's
   clothing; I have made completely plain to you that it is by working in
   this fashion that we should provide for the weak being convinced that
   it is blessed to give.
   Therefore we also, having been taught by him, decree that a bishop
   should never have any sort of design on foul profit, inventing excuses
   for his sins, nor demand any gold or silver or anything similar from
   the bishops, clerics and monks subject to him. For the apostle says:
   The unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God; and, It is not children
   who should heap up treasures for their parents, but parents for their
   children.
   So if it is discovered that somebody, because of a demand for gold or
   something similar, or because of some private infatuation of his own,
   has excluded from the liturgy or excommunicated one of the clerics
   under his authority, or has closed off one of the holy churches,
   preventing the celebration of God's liturgies in it, pouring out his
   own madness against insensible things, then he is truly senseless
   himself and he should be subjected to suffer what he would inflict and
   the penalty imposed by him will turn upon his own head, because he has
   transgressed both the law of God and the rulings of the apostles. For
   Peter also, the spokesman of the apostles, urges: Be pastors to the
   flock of God entrusted to you, not under compulsion, but willingly as
   pleasing to God, not for sordid gain but with enthusiasm, not as men
   who lord it over those entrusted to you, but as being models for the
   flock. Then when the chief shepherd is disclosed, you will carry off
   the imperishable crown of glory.

Canon 5.

   It is a sin leading to death when sinners remain uncorrected, but still
   worse is it when people flaunt their sin as they override holiness and
   truth, both preferring mammon to obedience to God and neglecting his
   legally formulated instructions. The Lord God is not present among such
   persons unless they humbly turn from their fault. Their duty is to
   approach God with a contrite heart and implore his forgiveness for
   their sin and his pardon, rather than to take pride in an unholy
   distribution of gifts: For the Lord is close to the contrite of heart.
   Therefore in the case of those who boast that they have been appointed
   in the church by distributing gifts of gold, and who pin their hopes on
   this evil custom, which alienates a person from God and from all
   priesthood, and who take this as a reason for deriding quite
   shamelessly and openly those who have been chosen by the holy Spirit
   and appointed for the virtue of their lives, without any distribution
   of gifts of gold, when they first do this each should take the lowest
   rank in his order, and if they persist they should be corrected with a
   penalty.
   If someone is found to have done this at any time in connection with an
   ordination, let matters proceed in accordance with the apostolic canon
   which says: "If some bishop or priest or deacon has obtained his
   dignity by means of money, let him and the person who performed the
   ordination be suspended, and let them be excluded completely from the
   communion, as Simon Magus was by me, Peter".
   Similarly, in accordance with canon 2 of our holy fathers at Chalcedon,
   which says "If any bishop performs an ordination for money and puts the
   unsaleable grace on sale, and ordains for money a bishop, a
   chorepiscopus, a presbyter or deacons or some others of those numbered
   among the clergy; or appoints a manager, a legal officer or a warden
   for money, or any other ecclesiastic at all for personal sordid gain;
   let him who has attempted this and been convicted stand to lose his
   personal rank, and let the person ordained profit nothing from the
   ordination or appointment he has bought; but let him be removed from
   the dignity or responsibility which he got for money. And if anyone
   appears to have acted even as a go-between in such disgraceful and
   unlawful dealings, let him too, if he is a cleric, be demoted from his
   personal rank, and if he is a lay person or a monk, let him be
   anathematized".

Canon 6.

   Although there is indeed a canon which says, "In each province the
   canonical investigations should take place twice yearly by means of a
   gathering of the bishops", because of the trouble and because those
   attending the meetings lack the resources for such journeys, the holy
   fathers of the sixth synod decreed "they should be held in any case and
   despite all excuses, once a year, and all that is incorrect should be
   put right". We also renew this canon, and should a ruler be found who
   prevents its observance, let him be excommunicated; however if one of
   the metropolitan bishops neglects its fulfillment, let him be subject
   to canonical penalties, unless it is a case of necessity, constraint or
   some other reasonable cause.
   When such a synod is held to discuss canonical and evangelical matters,
   the gathered bishops should pay particular care and attention to the
   divine and life-giving laws of God: There is a great reward for their
   observance; for a law is a lamp, a regulation is a light, and reproof
   and discipline are the path of life indeed the law of the Lord gives
   light to the eyes. However, the metropolitan bishop does not have the
   right to demand anything that a bishop may have brought with him, such
   as a beast or some other thing; and if he is convicted of doing so, let
   him pay back fourfold.

Canon 7.

   The divine apostle Paul said: The sins of some people are manifest,
   those of others appear later. Some sins take the front rank but others
   follow in their footsteps. Thus in the train of the impious heresy of
   the defamers of Christians, many other impieties appeared. Just as
   those heretics removed the sight of venerable icons from the church,
   they also abandoned other customs, which should now be renewed and
   which should be in vigour in virtue of both written and unwritten
   legislation. Therefore we decree that in venerable churches consecrated
   without relics of the holy martyrs, the installation of relics should
   take place along with the usual prayers. And if in future any bishop is
   found out consecrating a church without relics, let him be deposed as
   someone who has flouted the ecclesiastical traditions.

Canon 8.

   Since some of those who come from the religion of the Hebrews
   mistakenly think to make a mockery of Christ who is God, pretending to
   become Christians, but denying Christ in private by both secretly
   continuing to observe the sabbath and maintaining other Jewish
   practices, we decree that they shall not be received to communion or at
   prayer or into the church, but rather let them openly be Hebrews
   according to their own religion; they should not baptize their children
   or buy, or enter into possession of, a slave. But if one of them makes
   his conversion with a sincere faith and heart, and pronounces his
   confession wholeheartedly, disclosing their practices and objects in
   the hope that others may be refuted and corrected, such a person should
   be welcomed and baptized along with his children, and care should be
   taken that they abandon Hebrew practices. However if they are not of
   this sort, they should certainly not be welcomed.

Canon 9.

   All those childish baubles and bacchic rantings, the false writings
   composed against the venerable icons, should be given in at the
   episcopal building in Constantinople, so that they can be put away
   along with other heretical books. If someone is discovered to be hiding
   such books, if he is a bishop, priest or deacon, let him be suspended,
   and if he is a lay person or a monk, let him be excommunicated.

Canon 10.

   As some clerics, who despise the canonical ordinance, abandon their own
   dioceses and run off into other dioceses--something that happens with
   special frequency in this imperial, God-guarded city--and there they
   lodge with rulers, celebrating the liturgy in their chapels, let it not
   be permitted for them to be received in any house or church without the
   approval of their own bishop and that of the bishop of Constantinople.
   If they do so and persist therein, they are to be suspended.
   In the case of those who do this with the approval of the
   above-mentioned prelates, it is not permitted for them to assume
   worldly and secular responsibilities, since they are forbidden to do so
   by the sacred canons; and if someone is misled into occupying himself
   with the responsibility of the so-called high stewards, he is to desist
   or be suspended. Rather let him busy himself with the teaching of the
   children and servants, lecturing them on the divine scriptures because
   it is for such activity that he received the priesthood.

Canon 11.

   Since we are obliged to observe all the sacred canons, we ought also to
   maintain in all its integrity the one that says that there should be
   administrators in each church. Therefore if each metropolitan bishop
   installs an administrator in his own church, that is well and good; but
   if not, the bishop of Constantinople on his own authority has the right
   to appoint one over the other's church, and similarly with metropolitan
   bishops, if the bishops under them do not choose administrators to hold
   these posts in their own churches. The same rule is also to be observed
   with respect to monasteries.

Canon 12.

   If it is discovered that a bishop or a monastic superior is
   transferring episcopal or monastic farmland to the control of the
   ruler, or has been conceding it to another person, the transaction is
   null and void in accordance with the canon of the holy apostles which
   stipulates: "Let the bishop take care of all ecclesiastical affairs,
   and let him administer them as if under God's inspection. It is not
   permitted him to appropriate any of these things, nor to make a present
   of the things of God to his own relatives. Should the latter be poor,
   let him care for them as for other poor people, but let him not use
   them as an excuse for selling off the church's possessions." However,
   if he pretends that the land is a loss and brings in no profit at all,
   let him make a present of the place to clerics or landworkers, but even
   in these circumstances it should not be given to the local rulers. If
   they use evil cunning and the ruler buys up the land from the
   landworker or the cleric in question, this sale shall also be null and
   void in such circumstances, and the land should be restored to the
   bishopric or monastery. And the bishop or monastic superior who acts
   thus should be expelled, the bishop from the episcopal house and the
   monastic superior from the monastery, because they wickedly waste what
   they have not gathered.

Canon 13.

   On account of the disaster which came about in the churches due to our
   sins certain venerable houses--episcopal buildings as well as
   monasteries--were seized by certain men and became public inns. Now if
   those who hold them choose to restore them, so that they are
   established once more as formerly they were, this is good and
   excellent. However if such is not the case, should they be inscribed in
   the list of priests, we order that they be suspended, and if they are
   monks or lay persons, that they be excommunicated, seeing that they are
   criminals condemned by the Father, the Son and the holy Spirit, and let
   them be assigned there where the worm does not die and the fire is not
   quenched, because they oppose the voice of the Lord declaring, You
   shall not make my Father's house a house of trade.

Canon 14.

   It is perfectly clear to everyone that a certain order has been
   established in the priesthood, and that it is God's good pleasure that
   the appointment to priestly offices should be observed with care.
   However we have noticed that some, without the imposition of hands, are
   adopting the clerical tonsure while still youngsters, and without
   having received the imposition of hands from the bishop they are
   undertaking to read publicly from the ambo during the church service,
   even though they are acting uncanonically. We urge therefore that this
   be discontinued, and that the same regulation be observed among monks.
   Each monastic superior has permission for the imposition of hands on a
   reader for his own monastery, and only for that monastery, provided
   that the monastic superior has himself received from the bishop the
   imposition of hands to rule there, and obviously provided that he is
   himself a priest. Similarly it is an ancient custom that chorepiscopi,
   with the permission of the bishop, should appoint readers.

Canon 15.

   From now on, no cleric should be appointed to office in two churches.
   Such a procedure savours of commerce and sordid profit-making, and is
   quite foreign to ecclesiastical custom. We have learned from the Lord's
   own voice: No one can serve two masters, because either he will hate
   the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and
   despise the other. Therefore, following the advice of the apostle, Each
   should stay where he has been called, and remain in one church. In
   ecclesiastical matters, whatever is done for the sake of sordid gain
   constitutes something alien to God. But as far as the needs of this
   present life are concerned, there are various gainful occupations; each
   may use these, as he prefers, to procure what is needed for the body.
   As the apostle said: These hands of mine have provided for my own needs
   and for the persons accompanying me. These are the regulations for this
   God-protected city; for what concerns places in the country, a
   concession may be granted because of the lack of population.

Canon 16.

   All indulgence and adornment bestowed on the body is alien to the
   priestly order. Therefore all those bishops and clerics who deck
   themselves out in brilliant and showy clothes should be called to
   order, and if they persist let them be punished. The same holds for
   those who use perfumes. However, since the root of bitterness has
   sprouted, there has appeared in the catholic church the plague of a
   heresy which delights in the defamation of Christians. Those who adopt
   this heresy not only heap insults on representational art, but also
   reject all forms of reverence and make a mockery of those who live
   pious and holy lives, thus fulfilling in their own regard that saying
   of scripture, For the sinner piety is an abomination. So if persons are
   found who make fun of those who wear simple and respectful clothing,
   they should be corrected with punishment. Indeed, from the earliest
   times all those ordained to the priesthood have been accustomed to
   present themselves in public dressed in modest and respectful clothing,
   and anyone who adds to his apparel for the sake of decoration and not
   out of necessity deserves, as the great Basil remarked, to be accused
   of "vainglory". Neither did anyone dress in variegated clothes made of
   silk, nor did they add various coloured ornaments to the fringes of
   their garments. They had heard the tongue that spoke God's words
   declare, Those who dress in soft clothes are in the houses of kings.

Canon 17

   Some monks abandon their own monasteries because they desire to be in
   authority and disdain obeying others, and then they attempt to found
   houses of prayer, although they lack adequate resources. If somebody
   undertakes to do this, let him be prevented by the local bishop. If
   someone possesses adequate resources, however, his plans should be
   brought to completion. The same ruling holds for both laity and
   clerics.

Canon 18.

   Be irreproachable even for those outside, says the divine apostle. Now
   for women to live in the houses of bishops or in monasteries is a cause
   for every sort of scandal. Therefore if anybody is discovered to be
   keeping a woman, whether a slave or free, in the bishop's house or in a
   monastery in order to undertake some service, let him be censured, and
   if he persists let him be deposed. Should it happen that women are
   living in the suburban residence and the bishop or monastic superior
   wishes to journey there, no woman should be allowed to undertake any
   sort of work during the time that the bishop or monastic superior is
   present; she should stay on her own in some other area until the bishop
   has retired, in order to avoid all possible criticism.

Canon 19.

   The blight of avarice has spread to such an extent among ecclesiastical
   authorities that even some so called pious men and women, forgetting
   the Lord's commands, have been tricked into authorizing, for the sake
   of cash payments, the entry of those presenting themselves for the
   priestly order and the monastic life. Thus it happens, as the great
   Basil says, "when people begin wrongly, all they do is to be rejected",
   for it is not possible to serve God through mammon. So, if somebody is
   found out to be doing this, if he is a bishop or a male monastic
   superior or one of the priests, let him stop or be deposed, in
   accordance with canon 2 of the holy council of Chalcedon. If the person
   is a female monastic superior, let her be expelled from the monastery
   and put under obedience in another monastery, and similarly for a male
   monastic superior who has not received priestly ordination.
   With regard to gifts given by parents under the concept of dowries for
   their children, or with regard to the personally acquired goods that
   the latter present provided that those presenting them declare that
   these are gifts offered to God, we have decreed that these gifts are to
   remain in the monastery, whether the person stays or leaves, in
   accordance with their explicit undertaking, unless there is a
   reprehensible cause on the part of the person in charge.

Canon 20.

   We decree that from now on no more double monasteries are to be started
   because this becomes a cause of scandal and a stumbling block for
   ordinary folk. If there are persons who wish to renounce the world and
   follow the monastic life along with their relatives, the men should go
   off to a male monastery and their wives enter a female monastery, for
   God is surely pleased with this.
   The double monasteries that have existed up to now should continue to
   exist according to the rule of our holy father Basil, and their
   constitutions should follow his ordinances. Monks and nuns should not
   live in one monastic building, because adultery takes advantage of such
   cohabitation. No monk should have the licence to speak in private with
   a nun, nor any nun with a monk. A monk should not sleep in a female
   monastery, nor should he eat alone with a nun. When the necessary
   nourishment is being carried from the male area for the nuns, the
   female superior, accompanied by one of the older nuns, should receive
   it outside the door. And if it should happen that a monk wishes to pay
   a visit to one of his female relatives, let him speak with her in the
   presence of the female superior, but briefly and rapidly, and let him
   leave her quickly.

Canon 21.

   It is not right for a monk or a nun to leave his or her own monastery
   and transfer to another. However should this occur, it is obligatory
   that hospitality be given but such a person should not be accepted as a
   member without the agreement of his or her monastic superior.

Canon 22.

   It is very important to dedicate everything to God and not to become
   slaves of our own desires; for whether you eat or drink, the divine
   apostle says, do all for the glory of God. Now Christ our God has
   instructed us in his gospels to eradicate the beginnings of sins. So
   not only adultery is rebuked by him, but also the movement of one's
   intention towards the performance of adultery, when he says: He who
   looks on a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in
   his heart.
   Thus instructed we should purify our intentions: For if all things are
   lawful, not all things are expedient, as we learn from the words of the
   apostle. Now everybody is certainly obliged to eat in order to live,
   and in the case of those whose life includes marriage and children and
   the conditions proper to layfolk it is not reprehensible that men and
   women should eat in one another's company; though they should at least
   say grace to thank the giver of their nourishment, and they should
   avoid certain theatrical entertainments, diabolical songs, the
   strumming of lyres and the dancing fit for harlots, against all such
   there is the curse of the prophet which says, Woe on those who drink
   their wine to the sound of lyre and harp, those who pay no attention to
   the deeds of the Lord and have never a thought for the works of his
   hands. If ever such people are found among Christians, they should
   reform, and if they do not, let the canonical sanctions established by
   our predecessors be imposed on them.
   Those whose mode of life is contemplative and solitary should sit and
   be silent, because they have entered into a contract with the Lord that
   the yoke they carry will be a solitary one. Indeed, all those who have
   chosen the life of priests are certainly not free to eat privately in
   the company of women, but at the most in the company of certain
   God-fearing and pious men and women, in order that such a meal taken in
   common may draw them to spiritual betterment. Let the same be done in
   the case of relatives.
   As for another situation, if a monk or even a man in priestly orders
   happens to be making a journey and is not carrying with him his
   indispensable provisions, and then wishes to satisfy his needs in a
   public inn or in someone's house, he is allowed to do so when it is a
   case of pressing necessity.
