The Second General Council of Lyons, 1274

Introduction

   After the death of Pope Clement IV (29 November 1268) almost three
   years passed before the cardinals were able to elect a new pope,
   Gregory X (1 September 1271). The political aspect of Europe in those
   times was undergoing great change. The popes themselves in their
   struggles with the German emperors had sought help from various states
   and had placed Charles of Anjou on the throne of Sicily. This long
   conflict, which the popes fought in order to protect their freedom and
   immunity, had finally upset the traditional system of government in
   Christendom. This system depended on two institutions, the papacy and
   the empire. In the East, moreover, the emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus
   had captured Constantinople in 1261 and brought the Latin empire there
   to an end.

   Since the state of affairs was undoubtedly complex and difficult,
   Gregory X had conceived a very broad plan involving the whole Christian
   world. In this plan the eastern question was of the highest importance.
   The pope sought to conclude a treaty with Michael VIII Palaeologus and
   to unite the eastern and western churches. For if the churches were
   united and the strength of all Christian peoples were combined, the
   problem of the holy Land could be resolved and the Roman church could
   flourish with fresh authority and influence in the western states.

   Gregory X, therefore, when he convoked the general council on 31 March
   1272, outlined three themes: union with the Greeks, the crusade, and
   the reform of the church. Regarding the third theme, which was not only
   traditional in medieval councils but was also required by the actual
   state of ecclesiastical morals, the pope in March 1273 sought the
   opinion of all Christian people and asked for their help. Some reports
   sent to him for this purpose are still extant. After long preparatory
   arrangements the council assembled at Lyons and opened on 7 May 1274.
   Probably there were present about 300 bishops, 60 abbots and a large
   number of other clergy, many of whom apparently were theologians
   (Thomas Aquinas died while on his journey to Lyons), as well as king
   James of Aragon and the delegates sent by the rulers of France,
   Germany, England and Sicily. The Greeks arrived late, on 24 June, since
   they had been shipwrecked. Meanwhile a delegation of Tartars had also
   arrived. Although the number of participants does not seem to have been
   especially large, the whole Christian world was present either in
   person or through representatives, and it was evident that the council,
   as Gregory X had wished, was universal and ecumenical.

   The council had six general sessions: on 7 and 18 May, 4 or 7 June, 6,
   16 and 17 July. In the fourth session the union of the Greek church
   with the Latin church was decreed and defined, this union being based
   on the consent which the Greeks had given to the claims of the Roman
   church. In the last session the dogmatic constitution concerning the
   procession of the holy Spirit was approved, this question having been a
   cause of disagreement between the two churches. The union however
   appears to have been imposed, on the Greek side by the emperor Michael
   VIII. He wanted the support of the pope in order to deter Charles of
   Anjou from an attack on the Byzantine empire, while the majority of the
   Greek clergy opposed the union. The union was therefore fleeting,
   either because in the East the clergy steadily resisted it, or because
   the popes after Gregory X changed their plan of action.

   The weakness of the union with the Greeks also rendered a crusade
   impossible. Gregory X won the approval of the principal states of
   Europe for the undertaking and was able, in the second session, to
   impose heavy taxes (a tenth for six years) in order to carry it out
   (const. Zelus fidei, below pp. 309-314). The council however merely
   decided to engage in the crusade; no start was made at getting things
   done and the project came to nothing. Moreover Gregory died soon
   afterwards (10 January 1276), and he was not sufficiently influential
   or powerful to bring to a conclusion his plans for church and state.

   With regard to the reform of the church, Gregory complained in the
   council's last session that discussion had not been sufficient to pass
   any definite decree. However, he was able to bring about that certain
   constitutions relating to the parish should be delegated to the curia.
   For the rest, some constitutions concerning church institutions were
   approved in various sessions. The most important one prescribed that a
   pope should be elected by the college of cardinals assembled in
   conclave (const. 2); constitution 23 attempts to adjust relations
   between secular clerics and religious; constitutions 26-27 treat of
   usury; and others treat of particular questions about the reform of
   morals and of the church.

   There are at least two redactions (conciliar and post-conciliar) of the
   council's constitutions, as S. Kuttner has shown. In the second session
   the fathers had approved the decree Zelus fidei, which was rather a
   collection of constitutions about the holy Land, the crusade, the war
   against Saracens and pirates, and the order and procedure to be
   observed in the council (here for the first time the nations appear as
   ecclesiastical parts of a council). Next, twenty-eight constitutions
   were approved in the following sessions: const. 3-9, 15, 19, 24, 29-30
   in the third, const. 2, 10-12, 16-17, 20-22, 25-28, 31 in the fifth,
   const. 1, 23 in the sixth session. The pope promulgated a collection of
   the council's constitutions on 1 November 1274, sent this to the
   universities with the bull Cum nuper, and informed all the faithful in
   the encyclical Infrascriptas. In this collection, however, three of the
   thirty-one constitutions are post-conciliar (const. 13-14, 18). These
   concern the parish, on which subject the pope and the council fathers
   had decided in the last session of the council that some decrees should
   be made later on. Moreover the constitution Zelus fidei is missing from
   the collection, perhaps because it contained no juridical statutes of
   universal validity; and the other constitutions had been subjected to
   the examination of the curia and emended, notably as far as we know
   const. 2 on the conclave and const. 26-27 On usury.

   The collection of constitutions promulgated by Gregory X was
   incorporated into Boniface VIII's Liber Sextus (1298) . It also
   survives, together with the encyclical Infrascriptas, in Gregory X's
   register (=R), on which we have based our text. The conciliar
   redaction, however, is known only in part. The constitution Zelus fidei
   was discovered first by H. Finke in an Osnabruck codex (= O), and then
   by S. Kuttner, without its beginning, in a Washington codex (= W), it
   is also extant in three English cartularies, which we have not
   examined; our edition relies on the transcriptions of Finke (= F) and
   Kuttner (= K). The other constitutions of the conciliar redaction we
   know only from W and, as regards const. 2, from eight scrolls
   containing the approval of the council fathers for this constitution
   (Vatican Archives, AA. arm. I-XVIII, 2187-2194 = V I-8). We therefore
   give the conciliar redaction on the basis of V and W; but W is very
   incomplete, having only 20 constitutions (const. 2-8, 9 mutilated,
   10-12 16-17, 20, 22-23, 25-27, 31), and is full of errors. As the best
   solution at this intermediate stage, we therefore give the constitution
   Zelus fidei (below pp. 309-314) separately from the post-conciliar
   collection (below pp. 314-331), and we note in the critical apparatus
   the latter the variant readings of the conciliar redaction. In the main
   editions of the council's acts only the collection of constitutions
   promulgated by Gregory X is to be found; all these editions depend on
   Rm (4, 95-104), which is taken from R (R was edited later by Guiraud).

Constitutions

   I

   [1a]. Zeal for the faith, fervent devotion and compassionate love ought
   to rouse the hearts of the faithful, so that all who glory in the name
   of Christian grieved to the heart by the insult to their redeemer,
   should rise vigorously and openly in defence of the holy Land and
   support for God's cause. Who, filled with the light of the true faith
   and thinking over with filial affection the marvellous favours
   conferred on the human race by our saviour in the holy Land, would not
   burn with devotion and charity, and sorrow deeply with that holy Land,
   portion of the Lord's inheritance ? Whose heart will not soften with
   compassion for her, from so many proofs of love given in that land by
   our creator? Alas! the very land in which the Lord deigned to work our
   salvation and which, in order to redeem humanity by payment of his
   death, he has consecrated by his own blood, has been boldly attacked
   and occupied over a long period by the impious enemies of the Christian
   name, the blasphemous and faithless Saracens. They not only rashly
   retain their conquest, but lay it waste without fear. They slaughter
   savagely the Christian people there to the greater offence of the
   creator, to the outrage and sorrow of all who profess the catholic
   faith. "Where is the God of the Christians ?" is the Saracens' constant
   reproach, as they taunt them. Such scandals, which neither mind can
   fully conceive nor tongue tell, inflamed our heart and roused our
   courage so that we who from experience overseas have not only heard of
   those events but have looked with our eyes and touched with our hands,
   might rise to avenge, as far as we can, the insult to the crucified
   one. Our help will come from those afire with zeal of faith and
   devotion. Because the liberation of the holy Land should concern all
   who profess the catholic faith, we convoked a council, so that after
   consultation with prelates, kings, princes and other prudent men, we
   might decide and ordain in Christ the means for liberating the holy
   Land. We also proposed to lead back the Greek peoples to the unity of
   the church; proudly striving to divide in some way the Lord's seamless
   tunic, they withdrew from devotion and obedience to the apostolic see.
   We purposed also a reform of morals, which have become corrupt owing to
   the sins of both clergy and people. In everything we have mentioned he
   to whom nothing is impossible will direct our acts and counsels; when
   he wills, he makes what is difficult easy, and leveling by his power
   the crooked ways, makes straight the rough going. Indeed, in order the
   more readily to effect our plans, having regard to the risks from wars
   and dangers of journeys for those whom we judged should be summoned to
   the council, we did not spare ourself and our brothers but rather
   sought hardships so that we might arrange rest for others. We came to
   the city of Lyons with our brothers and curia, believing that in this
   place those summoned to the council might meet with less exertion and
   expense. We came undertaking various dangers and troubles, running many
   risks, to where all those summoned to the council were assembled,
   either in person or through suitable representatives. We held frequent
   consultations with them about help for the holy Land, and they, zealous
   to avenge the insult to the Saviour, thought out the best ways to
   succour the said Land and gave, as was their duty, advice and insight.
   [ I b].

   Having listened to their advice, we rightly commend their resolutions
   and praiseworthy enthusiasm for the liberation of that Land. Lest,
   however, we seem to lay on others' shoulders heavy burdens, hard to
   bear, which we are unwilling to move with our finger, we begin with
   ourself; declaring that we hold all we have from God's only-begotten
   Son, Jesus Christ, by whose gift we live, by whose favour we are
   sustained, by whose blood even we have been redeemed. We and our
   brothers, the cardinals of the holy Roman church, shall pay fully for
   six successive years a tenth of all our ecclesiastical revenues, fruits
   and incomes for the aid of the holy Land. With the approval of this
   sacred council, we decree and ordain that for the said six years,
   beginning from the next feast of the birthday of blessed John the
   Baptist, all ecclesiastical persons of whatever rank or pre-eminence,
   condition, order, or religious state or order - and we wish none to
   invoke for themselves and their churches any privileges or indults, in
   whatever form of words or expression these were granted, rather we
   recall completely those we have granted till now - shall pay wholly and
   without any reduction a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, fruits
   and incomes of each year in the following way: that is, half on the
   feast of the Lord's birth and the other half on the feast of blessed
   John the Baptist. In order to observe more carefully the reverence due
   to him whose undertaking this is, in himself and in his saints and
   especially in the glorious Virgin whose intercession we ask in this and
   in our other needs, and in order that there may be a fuller subsidy for
   the holy Land, we order that the constitution of Pope Gregory our
   predecessor of happy memory against blasphemers be inviolably observed.
   The fines prescribed in this constitution are to be exacted in full
   through the authorities of the place where blasphemy is committed, and
   through others who exercise temporal jurisdiction there. Coercive
   measures, if necessary, are to be taken through diocesan and other
   local ordinaries. The money is to be assigned to the collectors for the
   subsidy. Moreover, we strictly command confessors who hear confessions
   by ordinary jurisdiction or by privilege to prompt and enjoin on their
   penitents to give the said money to the holy Land in full satisfaction
   for their sins; and they should persuade those making wills to leave,
   in proportion to their means, some of their goods for aid to the holy
   Land. We direct also that in each church there should be placed a box
   fitted with three keys, the first to be kept in the possession of the
   bishop, the second in that of the priest of the church, the third in
   that of some conscientious lay person. The faithful are to be
   instructed to place their alms, as the Lord inspires them, in this box
   for the remission of their sins. Mass is to be sung publicly in the
   churches once a week, on a certain day to be announced by the priest,
   for the remission of such sins and especially of those offering alms.
   Besides these measures, to provide more assistance for the holy Land,
   we exhort and urge kings and princes, marquises, counts and barons,
   magistrates, governors and other secular leaders to arrange that in the
   lands subject to their jurisdiction each of the faithful pays a coin to
   the value of a tournois or of one sterling in accordance with the
   customs or circumstances of the region, and they should order a further
   small tax of no burden to anyone for the remission of sins; these
   contributions are to be made each year in aid of the holy Land, so that
   just as nobody may excuse himself from compassion for the wretched
   state of the holy Land, nobody may be dismissed from contributing or
   shut out from meriting. Also, lest these prudent arrangements
   concerning the subsidy to the holy Land be hindered by anyone's fraud
   or malice or craft, we excommunicate and anathematise one and all who
   knowingly offer hindrance, directly or indirectly, publicly or
   secretly, to the payment, as described above, of the tithes in aid of
   the holy Land.

   Furthermore, since corsairs and pirates greatly impede those travelling
   to and from that Land, by capturing and plundering them, we bind with
   the bond of excommunication them and their principal helpers and
   supporters. We forbid anyone, under threat of anathema, knowingly to
   communicate with them by contracting to buy or sell. We also order
   rulers of cities and their territories to restrain and curb such
   persons from this iniquity; otherwise it is our wish that prelates of
   churches exercise ecclesiastical severity in their land. We
   excommunicate and anathematise, moreover, those false and impious
   Christians who, in opposition to Christ and the Christian people,
   convey to the Saracens arms and iron, which they use to attack
   Christians and timber for their galleys and other ships; and we decree
   that those who sell them galleys or ships, and those who act as pilots
   in pirate Saracen ships, or give them any help or advice by way of
   machines or anything else to the detriment of Christians and especially
   of the holy Land, are to be punished with deprivation of their
   possessions and are to become the slaves of those who capture them. We
   order this sentence to be renewed publicly on Sundays and feast-days in
   all maritime towns; and the bosom of the church is not to be opened to
   such persons unless they send in aid of the holy Land all that they
   received from this damnable commerce and the same amount of their own,
   so that they are punished in proportion to their sins. If perchance
   they do not pay, they are to be punished in other ways in order that
   through their punishment others may be deterred from venturing upon
   similar rash actions. In addition, we prohibit and on pain of anathema
   forbid all Christians, for six years, to send or take their ships
   across to the lands of the Saracens who dwell in the east, so that by
   this a greater supply of shipping may be made ready for those wanting
   to cross over to help the holy Land, and so that the aforesaid Saracens
   may be deprived of the considerable help which they have been
   accustomed to receiving from this. Because it is of the utmost
   necessity for the carrying out of this business that rulers and
   Christian peoples keep peace with each other, we therefore ordain, with
   the approval of this holy and general synod, that peace be generally
   kept in the whole world among Christians, so that those in conflict
   shall be led by the prelates of churches to observe inviolably for six
   years a definitive agreement or peace or a firm truce. Those who refuse
   to comply shall be most strictly compelled to do so by a sentence of
   excommunication against their persons and an interdict on their lands,
   unless the malice of the wrongdoers is so great that they ought not to
   enjoy peace. If it happens that they make light of the church's
   censure, they may deservedly fear that the secular power will be
   invoked by ecclesiastical authority against them as disturbers of the
   business of him who was crucified. We therefore, trusting in the mercy
   of almighty God and in the authority of the blessed apostles Peter and
   Paul, do grant, by the power of binding and loosing that God has
   conferred upon us, albeit unworthy, unto all those who undertake this
   work of crossing the sea to aid the holy Land, in person and at their
   own expense, full pardon for their sins about which they are truly and
   heartily contrite and have spoken in confession, and we promise them an
   increase of eternal life at the recompensing of the just. To those who
   do not go there in person but send suitable men at their own expense,
   according to their means and status, and likewise to those who go in
   person but at others' expense, we grant full pardon for their sins. We
   wish to grant to share in this remission, according to the nature of
   their help and the intensity of their devotion, all who shall
   contribute suitably from their goods to the aid of the said Land, or
   who give useful advice and help regarding the above, and all who make
   available their own ships for the help of the holy Land or who
   undertake to build ships for this purpose. Finally, this dutiful and
   holy general synod imparts the benefit of its prayers and blessings to
   all who piously set out on this enterprise in order that it may
   contribute to their salvation.[Id].

   Not to us but to the Lord we give glory and honour; let us also thank
   him that to so sacred a council a very great number of patriarchs,
   primates, archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors provosts, deans,
   archdeacons and other prelates of churches, both personally and by
   suitable procurators, and the procurators of chapters, colleges and
   convents, have assembled at our call. However, although for the happy
   pursuit of so great an enterprise their advice would be useful, and
   their presence as beloved sons is so delightful, filling us in a
   certain way with spiritual joy, there are difficulties for some as to
   staying on. Various inconveniences result from their great number; we
   do not wish them to suffer any longer the squeezing of the enormous
   crowd; and their absence may be harmful to them and their churches. A
   certain prudent love moves us to decide with our brothers' advice how
   to lighten the burden of these representatives, while pursuing our
   object no less ardently or zealously. We therefore have decided that
   all patriarchs, primates, archbishops, bishops, abbots and priors whom
   we summoned specially and by name are to remain, they are not to depart
   without our special leave before the council ends. The other non-mitred
   abbots and priors and the other {1} abbots and priors, who were not
   summoned by us specially and by name, and the provosts, deans,
   archdeacons and other prelates of churches, and the procurators of any
   prelates, chapters, colleges and convents, have our gracious leave to
   depart with the blessing of God and our own. We commission all who so
   depart to leave enough procurators, as described below, to receive our
   commands and both the decrees of our present council and any other
   decrees that may, with God's inspiration, be issued in the future.
   Thus, all so departing are to leave behind the following adequate
   number of procurators: namely, four from the realm of France, four from
   the realm of Germany, four from the realms of the Spains, four from the
   realm of England one from the realm of Scotland {2} , two from the
   realm of Sicily, two from Lombardy, one from Tuscany, one from the
   states of the church, one from the realm of Norway, one from the realm
   of Sweden, one from the realm of Hungary {3} , one from the realm of
   Dacia, one from the realm of Bohemia, one from the duchy of Poland.
   Furthermore {4} , it has come to our ears that some archbishops,
   bishops and other prelates, when they were summoned by us to the
   council, asked an excessive contribution from their subjects and
   committed great extortion, imposing heavy taxes on them. Some of these
   prelates, although they made great exactions, did not come to the
   council. Since it neither was nor is our intention that prelates in
   coming to the council should associate the virtue of obedience with the
   oppression of their subjects, we admonish prelates one and all with
   great firmness, that none may presume to use the council as a pretext
   for burdening his subjects with taxes or exactions. If in fact some
   prelates have not come to the council and have made demands on the
   pretext of coming, it is our will and precise command that they make
   restitution without delay. Those however who have oppressed their
   subjects, demanding excessive contributions, should take care to make
   amends to them without creating difficulties, and so fulfil our
   commands that we do not have to apply a remedy by our authority.
   _______________________________________________________________________

II

   1. On the supreme Trinity and the catholic faith{5}

   1. We profess faithfully and devotedly that the holy Spirit proceeds
   eternally from the Father and the Son, not as from two principles, but
   as from one principle; not by two spirations, but by one single
   spiration. This the holy Roman church, mother and mistress of all the
   faithful, has till now professed, preached and taught; this she firmly
   holds, preaches, professes and teaches; this is the unchangeable and
   true belief of the orthodox fathers and doctors, Latin and Greek alike.
   But because some, on account of ignorance of the said indisputable
   truth, have fallen into various errors, we, wishing to close the way to
   such errors, with the approval of the sacred council, condemn and
   reprove all who presume to deny that the holy Spirit proceeds eternally
   from the Father and the Son, or rashly to assert that the holy Spirit
   proceeds from the Father and the Son as from two principles and not as
   from one.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   2. On election and the power of the elected person {6}

   2. {7} Where there is greater danger, there must certainly be greater
   foresight. We learn from the past how heavy are the losses sustained by
   the Roman church in a long vacancy, how perilous it is; we see this all
   too clearly when we wisely consider the crises undergone. Reason
   therefore openly challenges us, while we devote ourselves skillfully to
   the reform of lesser evils, certainly not to leave without appropriate
   remedy those of greater danger. We judge therefore that everything
   wisely instituted by our predecessors and especially by Pope Alexander
   III of happy memory, for avoiding discord in the election of the Roman
   pontiff, should remain altogether intact. We intend in no way to
   detract from this legislation, but to supply by the present
   constitution what experience has shown to be missing.

   With the approval of the sacred council {8} , we decree that if the
   pope dies in a city where he was residing with his curia, the cardinals
   present in that city are obliged to await the absent cardinals, but for
   ten days only. When these days have passed, whether those absent have
   arrived or not, all are to assemble in the palace where the pope lived.
   Each is to be content with one servant only, clerical or lay, at
   choice. We allow however those in evident need to have two, with the
   same choice. In this palace all are to live in common in one room, with
   no partition or curtain. Apart from free entry to a private room, the
   conclave is to be completely locked, so that no one can enter or leave.
   No one may have access to the cardinals or permission to talk secretly
   with them, nor are they themselves to admit anyone to their presence,
   except those who, by consent of all the cardinals present, might be
   summoned only for the business of the imminent election. It is not
   lawful for anyone to send a messenger or a written message to the
   cardinals or to any one of them. Whoever acts otherwise, sending a
   messenger or a written message, or speaking secretly to one of the
   cardinals, is to incur automatic excommunication. In the conclave some
   suitable window is to be left open through which the necessary food may
   be served conveniently to the cardinals, but no entry for anyone is to
   be possible through this way.

   If, which God forbid, within three days after the cardinals have
   entered the said conclave, the church has not been provided with a
   shepherd, they are to be content for the next five days, every day both
   at dinner and supper, with one dish only. If these days also pass
   without the election of a pope, henceforth only bread, wine and water
   are to be served to the cardinals until they do provide a pope. While
   the election is in process, the cardinals are to receive nothing from
   the papal treasury, nor any other revenue coming from whatever source
   to the church while the see is vacant. Everything during this period
   remains in the custody of him to whose faithfulness and care the
   treasury has been entrusted, to be kept by him for the disposal of the
   future pope. Those who have accepted something are obliged from then on
   to abstain from receiving any of the revenues due to them until they
   have made full restitution of what they have accepted in this way. The
   cardinals are to devote their time so carefully to hastening the
   election as to occupy themselves with no other business whatever unless
   perhaps there occurs such an urgent necessity as the defence of the
   states of the church or some part of them, or there be threat of such a
   great and evident danger that it seems to each and all the cardinals
   present, by general consent, that they should quickly counteract it.

   Of course if one of the cardinals does not enter the conclave, which we
   have described above, or having entered leaves without evident cause of
   illness, the others, without in any way searching for him and without
   re-admitting him to the election, may proceed freely to elect the next
   pope. If in fact, owing to sudden illness, one of them leaves the
   conclave, the election may proceed without the need for his vote, even
   while the illness lasts. But if after regaining his health or even
   before, he wishes to return, or even if other absentees, for whom a
   wait of ten days should be made as we have said, come on the scene
   while the election is still undecided, that is, before the church has
   been provided with a shepherd, they are to be admitted to the election
   in the state in which they find it; they are to keep the rules with the
   others as regards enclosure, servants, food and drink and everything
   else.

   If the Roman pontiff happens to die outside the city in which he
   resided with his curia, the cardinals are obliged to assemble in the
   city in whose territory or district the pontiff died, unless perhaps
   the city lies under interdict or persists in open rebellion against the
   Roman church. In which case they are to meet in another city, the
   nearest which is neither under interdict nor openly rebellious. In this
   city also, the same rules about waiting for absentees, living together,
   enclosure and everything else, in the episcopal palace or any other
   residence specified by the cardinals, are to be observed as above when
   the pope dies in the city where he resided with his curia.

   Moreover, since it is not enough to make laws unless there is someone
   to see that they are kept, we further ordain that the lord and other
   rulers and officials of the city where the election of the Roman
   pontiff is to be held, by the power given to them by our authority and
   the approval of the council, are to enforce the observance of
   everything prescribed above in every detail, fully and inviolably
   without any deceit and trickery, but they may not presume to restrict
   the cardinals beyond what has been said. As soon as the said lord,
   rulers and officials hear of the supreme pontiff's death, they are to
   take an oath as a body, in the presence of the clergy and people
   specially mustered for the purpose, to observe these prescriptions. If
   it happens that they commit fraud in this matter or do not observe the
   regulations with care, of whatever pre-eminence, condition or status
   they may be, they lose all privileges; they are automatically subject
   to the bond of excommunication and are forever infamous; and they are
   permanently excluded from all honours, nor may they be admitted to any
   public office. We have decreed that over and above this they are
   automatically deprived of the fiefs goods and all they hold from the
   same Roman church or any other churches, this property returns fully
   and freely to the churches themselves, to be without any opposition at
   the disposal of the administrators of those churches. The city itself
   is to be not only laid under interdict but also deprived of its
   episcopal dignity.

   Furthermore {9} , since when a disordered passion enslaves the will or
   some pledge compels it to one way of acting, the election is null from
   lack of freedom, we implore the cardinals through the tender mercy of
   our God', and we call them to witness through the sprinkling of his
   precious blood, that they consider very carefully what they are about
   to do. They are electing the vicar of Jesus Christ, the successor of
   Peter, the ruler of the universal church, the guide of the Lord's
   flock. They are to lay aside all the disorder of private affection, to
   be free from any bargain, agreement or pledge; they are not to consider
   any promise or understanding, to have no regard for their mutual
   advantage or that of their friends. They are not to look after their
   own interests or their individual convenience. Without any constraint
   on their judgment other than God, they are to seek purely and freely
   the public good, with the election alone in mind. They are to use every
   endeavour and care that is possible. Their one aim is to provide, by
   their service and speedily, what is so useful and necessary for the
   whole world, a fitting spouse for the church. Those who act otherwise
   are subject to the divine retribution, their fault never to be pardoned
   except after severe penance. We invalidate all bargains, agreements,
   pledges, promises and understandings, whether confirmed by oath or any
   other bond; we nullify all these and decree that such have no force
   whatever. No one is constrained in any way to observe them, nor anyone
   to fear that by transgressing them he is breaking faith. Rather he
   deserves praise, for even human law testifies that such transgressions
   are more acceptable to God than the keeping of the oath.

   Since the faithful should rely not so much on human resource, however
   solicitous, than on the urgency of humble and devoted prayer, we make
   an addition to this decree. In all the cities and important places, as
   soon as the death of the pope becomes known, solemn exequies are to be
   celebrated for him by clergy and people. After this, every day until
   undoubted news is brought that the church truly has her pastor, there
   is to be humble and devoted prayer to the Lord, that he who makes peace
   in his high heaven may so unite the hearts of the cardinals in their
   choice that provision may be made for the church swiftly, harmoniously,
   unanimously and beneficially, for the salvation of souls and the
   advantage of the whole world. And lest this salutary decree be
   disregarded on pretext of ignorance, we strictly order patriarchs,
   archbishops, bishops, other prelates of churches, and all who have
   faculties to explain the word of God, that they should often gather
   together the clergy and people for the purpose of urging them in
   sermons to pray earnestly and repeatedly for a swift and happy outcome
   of the conclave. With the same authority they should prescribe not only
   frequent prayer but also, as circumstances recommend, the observance of
   fasting.

   3 {10} That we may, as far as possible, close the way to evil practices
   in ecclesiastical elections, postulations and provisions, and that
   churches may not have long and dangerous vacancies or the provision of
   parsonages, dignities and other ecclesiastical benefices be delayed, we
   make this perpetual decree. When opponents to elections, postulations
   or provisions raise difficulties against the form of the election,
   postulation or provision, or against the persons of the electors or of
   the one elected or of him for whom the provision was to be made or has
   been made, and for these reasons make an appeal, the appellants are to
   express in a public document or letter of appeal every individual
   objection they intend to make against the form or persons. They shall
   do this in the presence of a qualified person or persons bearing
   witness to the truth on the above points, and they shall personally
   swear that they believe what they say to be true and can prove it. If
   this is not done, both the objectors and, during the time of appeal or
   afterwards, their adherents are to know that the power of objecting
   anything not expressed in these letters or documents is forbidden to
   them, unless there is some new evidence or there suddenly appears means
   of proving the former objections, or some facts of the past have newly
   come to the knowledge of the objectors, facts of which at the time of
   the appeal the appellants probably could have been, and in fact were,
   ignorant. They are to establish their good faith concerning this
   ignorance and the subsequent possibility of proof by taking an oath
   personally, adding in the same oath that they believe they have
   sufficient proof. It is our will certainly that the penalties imposed
   by Pope Innocent IV of happy memory on those who do not fully
   substantiate their objections against the form or the person, shall
   remain in force.

   4 {11} Blind greed and criminal, dishonest ambition, seizing on certain
   minds, drive them to the rash attempt to usurp by ingenious fraud what
   they know is forbidden to them by the law. Some, indeed, are elected to
   the government of churches and, because the law forbids any
   interference in the administration of churches before the election has
   been confirmed, contrive to have the churches entrusted to themselves
   as procurators and managers. Since it is not good to give way to human
   trickery, we wish to take wider precautions in this general
   constitution. We decree that none may henceforth presume, before
   confirmation of his election, to conduct or accept the administration
   of an office to which he has been elected, or to interfere in it, under
   the pretext of management or procuratorship or some other newly
   invented disguise, in things spiritual or temporal, directly or through
   others, in part or in whole. We decree that all who act otherwise are
   by that very fact deprived of the right they would have acquired by the
   election.

   5. {12} Not only do the laws bear witness but also experience, that
   effective teacher of reality, makes clear how damaging to churches is
   their vacancy, how dangerous it usually is to souls. Desirous, then, of
   counteracting the long duration of vacancies by suitable remedies, we
   make a perpetual decree that after there has been an election in any
   church, the electors are obliged to inform the elect as soon as
   conveniently possible and to ask his consent. The elect in his turn is
   to give it within a month from the day of being informed. If the elect
   delays beyond this, he is to know that from then on he is deprived of
   the right he would have acquired from his election, unless perhaps his
   condition is such that he cannot consent to his election without his
   superior's leave, on account of a prohibition or some disposition of
   the apostolic see {13} . The elect or his electors must then earnestly
   seek and gain the superior's leave as quickly as his presence or
   absence will permit. Otherwise, if the time has expired, even with the
   allowance made for the presence or absence of the superior, and
   permission has not been obtained, the electors are then free to proceed
   to another election. Furthermore, any elect must ask for confirmation
   of his election within three months after giving consent. If without
   lawful impediment he omits to do this within such a three-month period,
   the election is by that very fact null and void.

   6. {14} We declare, with the force of a perpetual decree, that they who
   in an election vote knowingly for an unworthy candidate are not
   deprived of the power of electing, unless they have so far persisted as
   to make the election depend on their votes, even though in nominating
   an unworthy person they have deliberately acted against their
   consciences and may rightly fear divine retribution and a punishment,
   in accordance with the offence, from the apostolic see.

   7. {15} We decree that nobody, after voting for someone whose election
   follows, or after giving consent to an election made by others, may
   oppose him concerning the election itself, except for reasons coming to
   light afterwards, or unless the elect's evil character previously
   hidden from the objector is now disclosed, or the existence of some
   other hidden vice or defect, of which in all probability he could have
   been ignorant, is revealed. He is however to guarantee his good faith
   regarding this lack of knowledge by oath.

   8. {16} If after two scrutinies one part of the electors is to be found
   more than double the number of the other, we by this decree take away
   from the minority all power of imputing lack of zeal, merit or
   authority to the majority or their candidate. We do not however forbid
   such objections as would render null, in virtue of the law itself, the
   election of the candidate so opposed.

   9. {17} The constitution of Pope Alexander IV, our predecessor of happy
   memory, rightly includes cases about episcopal elections, and those
   arising therefrom, in the category of major cases and asserts that
   their judicial inquiry subsequent to any appeal falls to the apostolic
   see. We, however, wishing to curb both the rash boldness and unbridled
   frequency of appeals, have considered that we should make provision by
   this general constitution. If someone appeals extra-judicially with an
   evidently frivolous motive in the aforesaid elections or in others
   which concern dignities higher than the episcopate, such an appeal is
   by no means to go before the apostolic see. When however in the
   business of such elections an appeal is made in writing, judicially or
   extra-judicially, from a credible motive which on proof ought to be
   considered legitimate, such business is to be brought to the apostolic
   see. Furthermore, it is lawful for the parties in these cases, provided
   there is no malice, to withdraw from such appeals before they are laid
   before the said see. Subordinate judges, who were competent for these
   cases, should on withdrawal of the appeal first of all inquire
   carefully whether there has been any irregularity. If they find such,
   they are to have no further dealings with the case itself, but shall
   set for the parties a suitable fixed term in which they are to present
   themselves with all their acts and records to the apostolic see. I

   10. {18} If among other objections against the elect or nominee or
   candidate to be promoted in any other way to some dignity, it is said
   that he clearly lacks the requisite knowledge or has some other obvious
   personal defect, we decree that there is to be an invariable order in
   discussing the objections. The candidate is to be examined first of all
   concerning the alleged defect, the outcome deciding whether other
   objections are to be considered or not. If the result of the said
   examination shows that the objections concerning the alleged defect are
   devoid of truth, we exclude the objectors altogether from pursuing
   further the case in which they have made their objections, and we
   decree that they are to be punished exactly as if they had thoroughly
   failed to prove any of their objections.

   11. {19} All those who presume to oppress clerics or any other
   ecclesiastical persons having the right of election in certain
   churches, monasteries or other pious places, because they have refused
   to elect the person for whom they were asked or urged to vote, or who
   presume to oppress their relatives or the said churches, monasteries or
   other places, robbing them of benefices or other property, either
   directly or through others, or taking revenge in other ways, are to
   know that they incur automatic excommunication.

   12 {20} We decree by a general constitution that one and all, however
   high their rank, who try to usurp the royal privileges, the custody or
   guard, or the title of advocate or defender, in churches, monasteries
   and any other pious places, and presume to take possession of their
   property during a vacancy, lie under automatic sentence of
   excommunication. The clerics of the churches, the monks of the
   monasteries, and the other persons in the above places, who abet these
   offences, are automatically excommunicated in the same way. We indeed
   strictly forbid those clerics who do not oppose, as they ought, those
   who act in such a way, to receive any income from these churches or
   places during the time they have allowed the usurpation to happen
   without opposition. Those who claim these rights by the foundation of
   the churches or of the other places, or by reason of ancient custom,
   are prudently to avoid abusing their rights and take care that their
   agents do not abuse them, so that they appropriate nothing beyond what
   pertains to the fruits or revenues accruing during the vacancy, and do
   not allow the dilapidation of the other property of which they claim to
   be the guardians but preserve it in good condition.

   13. The canon promulgated by Pope Alexander III, our predecessor of
   happy memory, decreed among other things that nobody is to be appointed
   parish priest until he is twenty-five and approved as to knowledge and
   morals; and that after his appointment, if he has not been ordained
   priest within the time fixed by the canons, despite being warned to
   this effect, he is to be removed from office and it is to be conferred
   on someone else. Since many neglect to observe this canon, we wish
   their dangerous negligence to be made good by observance of the law. We
   therefore decree that nobody is to be appointed parish priest unless he
   is suitable by knowledge, morals and age. Any appointments from now of
   those younger than twenty-five are to lack all validity. The person
   appointed is obliged to reside in the parish church of which he has
   become rector, in order that he may take more diligent care of the
   flock entrusted to him. Within a year of being appointed to his charge
   he is to have himself ordained to the priesthood. If within that time
   he has not been ordained, he is deprived of his church, even without
   previous warning, by authority of the present constitution. As to
   residence, as above described, the ordinary may grant a dispensation
   for a time and for a reasonable cause.

   14. No one may henceforth presume to give a parish church "in
   commendam" to anyone under the lawful age and not ordained priest. Such
   a commendatory may have only one parish church and there must be an
   evident need or advantage for the church itself. We declare, however,
   that such a commendam, even when properly made, is not to last more
   than six months. We decree that any contrary procedure relating to
   commendams of parish churches is invalid by law.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   15. On the circumstances of ordination and the quality of ordinands

   15. {21} We decree that those who knowingly or with affected ignorance
   or on any other pretext presume to ordain clerics of another diocese
   without permission of the ordinands' superior, are suspended for a year
   from conferring any orders. The penalties prescribed by law against
   those so ordained are to remain in full vigour. We also grant the
   faculty to clerics of the dioceses of bishops thus suspended, after
   their suspension has become public, freely to receive orders meanwhile
   from neighbouring bishops, even without their own bishop's leave, but
   in other respects canonically.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   16. On bigamists

   16. {22} Putting an end to an old debate by the present declaration, we
   declare that bigamists are deprived of any clerical privilege and are
   to be handed over to the control of the secular law, any contrary
   custom notwithstanding. We also forbid bigamists under pain of anathema
   to wear the tonsure or clerical dress.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   17. On the office of ordinary judge

   17. {23} If canons wish to suspend the celebration of divine worship,
   as is their claim from custom or otherwise in certain churches, they
   are obliged, before taking any steps to suspend the celebration, to
   express their reasons for this in a confirmation of authenticity. They
   are to consign this document or letter to the person against whom the
   suspension is directed. They are to know that if they suspend services
   without this formality or the reason expressed is not canonical, they
   shall restore all the income they have received, during the time of the
   suspension, from the church in which the suspension has taken place.
   They shall in no way receive anything owing to them for that period but
   make it over to the church in question. They will, moreover, be obliged
   to make restitution for the loss or injustice done to the person whom
   they intended to punish. If however their cause is judged to be
   canonical, the one who occasioned the suspension is to be sentenced to
   compensate the said canons and the church from which divine service has
   been withdrawn through his fault. The superior is to adjudicate the
   compensation and it is to be used for the benefit of divine worship.
   Nevertheless we utterly rebuke the detestable abuse and horrible
   impiety of those who treating with irreverent boldness crucifixes and
   images or statues of the blessed Virgin and other saints, throw them to
   the ground in order to emphasise the suspension of divine worship, and
   leave them under nettles and thorns. We forbid severely any sacrilege
   of this kind. We decree that those who disobey are to receive a hard
   retributive sentence which will so chastise the offenders as to
   suppress the like arrogance in others.

   18. Local ordinaries must strictly compel their subjects to produce the
   dispensations by which they hold canonically, as they assert, several
   dignities or churches to which is annexed the cure of souls, or a
   parsonage or dignity together with another benefice to which a similar
   cure is annexed. These dispensations are to be shown within a time
   proportionate to the situation as judged by the ordinaries themselves.
   If without just reason no dispensation has been shown within that time,
   the churches, benefices, parsonages or dignities which it is now
   obvious are held unlawfully without dispensation, are to be conferred
   freely on suitable persons by those who have the right. If on the other
   hand the dispensation shown seems clearly sufficient, the holder is not
   to be troubled in any way in the possession of these benefices
   canonically obtained. The ordinary is however to make provision that
   neither the care of souls in those churches, parsonages or dignities is
   neglected nor the benefices themselves are defrauded of the services
   owing to them. If there is doubt whether the dispensation is
   sufficient, recourse should be had to the apostolic see, to which
   judgment belongs concerning its benefices. Ordinaries, moreover, in
   bestowing parsonages, dignities and other benefices involving the cure
   of souls, are to take care not to confer one on someone already holding
   several similar benefices, unless an obviously sufficient dispensation
   is shown for those already held. Even then, we wish the ordinary to
   confer the benefice only if it appears from the dispensation that the
   beneficiary may lawfully retain this parsonage, dignity or benefice
   together with those he already holds, or if he is prepared freely to
   resign those he already holds. If not, the bestowing of such
   parsonages, dignities and benefices is to be of no consequence
   whatever.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   19. On pleading

   19 {24} It seems that we must counteract promptly the crafty
   dragging-out of lawsuits. We hope to do this effectively by giving
   suitable remedial directives to those who offer their services in legal
   matters. Since the things that have been beneficially provided by legal
   sanction concerning advocates seem to have fallen into disuse, we renew
   the same sanction by the present constitution, with some addition and
   modification. We decree that each and every advocate in the
   ecclesiastical forum, whether before the apostolic see or elsewhere, is
   to swear on the holy gospels that in all ecclesiastical causes and
   others in the same forum, of which they have assumed or will assume the
   defence, they will do their utmost for their clients in what they judge
   to be true and just. They are also to swear that at whatever part of
   the process they find out that the cause which they had accepted in
   good faith is unjust, they will cease to defend it; they will rather
   abandon it altogether, having nothing further to do with it, and will
   inviolably observe the rest of the above sanction. Proctors also are to
   be bound by a similar oath. Both advocates and proctors are obliged to
   renew this oath every year in the forum in which they have assumed
   office. Those who come before the apostolic see or to the court of some
   ecclesiastical judge, in which they have not yet taken such an oath, in
   order to act as advocate or proctor in some individual case, are to
   take a like oath, in each case, at the beginning of the litigation.
   Advocates and proctors who refuse to swear in the above way are
   forbidden to practise while their refusal persists. If they
   deliberately violate their oath, counsellors who have knowingly
   encouraged an unjust cause incur, in addition to the guilt of perjury,
   the divine and our malediction, from which they cannot be absolved
   unless they restore double the amount they accepted for such evil work
   as advocate, proctor or counsel. They are moreover obliged to make
   restitution for the loss caused to the parties wronged by their unjust
   ministry. Furthermore, lest insatiate greed drive some into contempt
   for these sound decrees, we strictly forbid an advocate to accept more
   than twenty tournois pounds for any case, a proctor more than twelve,
   as salary or even on the pretext of a reward for winning. Those who
   accept more are not in any way to acquire ownership of the excess, but
   are obliged to restitution; none of this penalty of restitution can be
   remitted in evasion of the present constitution. In addition, advocates
   who thus violate the present constitution are to be suspended from
   their office for three years. Proctors, on the other hand, shall be
   denied permission to exercise their office in a court of law.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   20. On what is done by force or because of fear

   20. {25} We annul by authority of this constitution any absolution from
   sentence of excommunication or any recall of it, or of suspension or
   even of interdict, which has been extorted by force or fear. Lest
   boldness increase when violence goes unpunished, we decree that those
   who have extorted such an absolution or withdrawal by force or fear lie
   under sentence of excommunication.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   21. On prebends and dignities

   21. {26} We have decreed that the statute of Pope Clement IV, our
   predecessor of happy memory, that dignities and benefices which become
   vacant in the Roman curia are to be conferred by nobody other than the
   Roman pontiff, is to be modified as follows. Those who have the
   conferring of these benefices and dignities may confer them validly,
   notwithstanding the said statute, but not till a month after the day on
   which the dignities and benefices have become vacant, and then only by
   themselves personally or, if they are at a distance, through their
   vicar-generals in their dioceses, to whom this charge has been
   canonically entrusted . 5
   _______________________________________________________________________

   22. On not alienating the property of the church

   22. {27} By this well-considered decree we forbid each and every
   prelate to submit, subject or subordinate the churches entrusted to
   him, their immovable property or rights, to lay people without the
   consent of his chapter and the special leave of the apostolic see. It
   is not a question of granting the property or rights in emphyteusis or
   otherwise alienating them in the form and in the cases permitted by the
   law. What is forbidden is the establishment or recognition of these
   laity as superiors from whom the property and rights are held, or
   making them the protectors, an arrangement which is called in the
   vernacular of certain places "to avow", that is, the laity are
   appointed patrons or advocates of the churches or their property,
   either perpetually or for a long period. We decree that all such
   contracts of alienation, even when fortified by oath, penalty or any
   other confirmation, which are made without the above leave and consent,
   and any consequences of these contracts, are entirely null; no right is
   conferred, no cause for prescription is provided. We decree moreover
   that prelates who disobey are automatically suspended for three years
   from office and administration, and clerics who know that the
   prohibition has been violated but fail to give notice of it to the
   superior, are automatically suspended for three years from receiving
   the fruits of benefices they hold in the church so oppressed. The laity
   indeed, who have hitherto forced prelates, chapters of churches or
   other ecclesiastical persons to make these submissions, are to be bound
   by sentence of excommunication, unless after suitable admonition,
   having given up the submission they exacted through force or fear, they
   set free the churches and return the property thus surrendered to them.
   Those also who in future shall compel prelates or other ecclesiastical
   persons to make such submissions are also to be excommunicated,
   whatever be their condition or status. Even when contracts have been or
   will be made with the due leave and consent, or on the occasion of such
   contracts, the laity are not to transgress the limits set by the nature
   of the contract itself or the law on which the contract is based. Those
   indeed who act otherwise, unless after lawful admonition they desist
   from such usurpation restoring also what they have usurped, incur
   automatic excommunication, and henceforward the way is open, if need
   be, to lay their land under ecclesiastical interdict.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   23. On religious houses, that they are to be subject to the bishop

   23 {28} A general council by a considered prohibition averted the
   excessive diversity of religious orders, lest it might lead to
   confusion. Afterwards, however, not only has the troublesome desire of
   petitioners extorted their multiplication, but also the presumptuous
   rashness of some has produced an almost unlimited crowd of diverse
   orders, especially mendicant, which have not yet merited the beginnings
   of approval. We therefore renew the constitution, and severely prohibit
   that anyone found henceforth a new order or form of religious life, or
   assume its habit. We perpetually forbid absolutely all the forms of
   religious life and the mendicant orders founded after the said council
   which have not merited confirmation of the apostolic see, and we
   suppress them in so far as they have spread. As to those orders,
   however, confirmed by the apostolic see and instituted after the
   council, whose profession, rule or constitutions forbid them to have
   revenues or possessions for their fitting support but whose insecure
   mendicancy usually provides a living through public begging, we decree
   that they may survive on the following terms. The professed members of
   these orders may continue in them if they are willing not to admit
   henceforth anyone to profession, nor to acquire a new house or land,
   nor to have power to alienate the houses or land they have, without
   special leave of the apostolic see. We reserve these possessions for
   the disposal of the apostolic see, to be used for aid to the holy Land
   or for the poor or to be turned to other pious uses through local
   ordinaries or others commissioned by the apostolic see. If the above
   conditions are violated, neither the reception of persons nor the
   acquisition of houses or land nor the alienation of these or other
   property is valid, and in addition excommunication is incurred. We also
   forbid absolutely to members of these orders, in regard to externs, the
   office of preaching and hearing confessions and the right of burial. Of
   course we do not allow the present constitution to apply to the orders
   of Preachers and Minors; their approval bears witness to their evident
   advantage to the universal church. Furthermore, we grant that the order
   of Carmelites and that of the Hermits of Saint Augustine, the
   institution of which preceded the said general council {29} , may
   remain as they are, until other regulations are made for them. We
   intend in fact to provide both for them and for the other orders, even
   the non-mendicants, as we shall see to be for the good of souls and for
   the good state of the orders. We grant also a general permission to
   members of orders to which this present constitution applies, to pass
   to the other approved orders on this condition: no order is to transfer
   itself wholly to another, no community is to transfer itself and its
   possessions wholly to another, without special permission from the
   apostolic see.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   24. On taxes and procurations

   24 {30} The boldness of wicked people demands that we should not be
   satisfied with merely forbidding offences, but should inflict
   punishment on the offenders. The constitution of Pope Innocent IV, our
   predecessor of happy memory, forbade procurations to be received in the
   form of money, or the acceptance of gifts by pastoral visitors and
   their attendants. It is said that many rashly transgress this
   constitution. We wish it to be inviolably observed and have decreed
   that it should be strengthened by adding a penalty. We decree that one
   and all who presume, because of the procuration owing to them by reason
   of a visitation, to exact money or even to accept money from someone
   willing; or to violate the constitution in another way by accepting
   gifts or, without making the visitation, accepting procurations in food
   or anything else; are obliged to give back double of what they have
   received to the church from which they received it, and this within a
   month. If they do not, from that time patriarchs, archbishops and
   bishops who put off restoration of the double payment beyond the said
   period, are to know that entry into the church is forbidden them; and
   lower clergy are to know that they are suspended from office and
   benefice until they have made full satisfaction of this double to the
   burdened churches; the remission, liberality or kindness of the givers
   is to avail nothing.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   25. On the immunity of churches

   25 {31} Holiness befits the house of the Lord; it is fitting that he
   whose abode has been established in peace should be worshipped in peace
   and with due reverence. Churches, then, should be entered humbly and
   devoutly; behaviour inside should be calm, pleasing to God, bringing
   peace to the beholders, a source not only of instruction but of mental
   refreshment. Those who assemble in church should extol with an act of
   special reverence that name with is above every name, than which no
   other under heaven has been given to people, in which believers must be
   saved, the name, that is, of Jesus Christ, who will save his people
   from their sins. Each should fulfil in himself that which is written
   for all that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow; whenever that
   glorious name is recalled, especially during the sacred mysteries of
   the mass, everyone should bow the knees of his heart, which he can do
   even by a bow of his head. In churches the sacred solemnities should
   possess the whole heart and mind; the whole attention should be given
   to prayer. Here where it is proper to offer heavenly desires with peace
   and calm, let nobody arouse rebellion, provoke clamour or be guilty of
   violence. The consultations of universities and of any associations
   whatever must cease to be held in churches, so also must public
   speeches and parliaments. Idle and, even more, foul and profane talk
   must stop; chatter in all its forms must cease. Everything, in short,
   that may disturb divine worship or offend the eyes of the divine
   majesty should be absolutely foreign to churches, lest where pardon
   should be asked for our sins, occasion is given for sin, or sin is
   found to be committed. No more business is to be conducted in churches
   or their cemeteries, especially they are not to have the bustle of
   markets and public squares. All noise of secular courts must be
   stilled. The laity are not to hold their trials in churches, more
   especially criminal cases. The church is not to be a place for lay
   judicial inquiries. Local ordinaries should see that all this is
   observed, persuade where persuasion is needed, suppress by their
   authority what is forbidden by this canon. They should also depute for
   this purpose persons in the churches who are most assiduous and
   suitable for the above aims. Moreover, the proceedings of secular
   judges, and in particular the sentences passed in these sacred places,
   are to lack all validity. Those indeed who impudently defy the above
   prohibitions, in addition to the sanctions imposed by ordinaries and
   their deputies, will have to fear the sternness of the divine
   retribution and our own until, having confessed their guilt, they have
   firmly resolved to avoid such conduct for the future.

   26. On usury

   26. {32} Wishing to close up the abyss of usury, which devours souls
   and swallows up property, we order under threat of the divine
   malediction that the constitution of the Lateran council against
   usurers be inviolably observed. Since the less convenient it is for
   usurers to lend, the more their freedom to practise usury is curtailed,
   we ordain by this general constitution as follows. Neither a college,
   nor other community, nor an individual person, of whatever dignity,
   condition or status, may permit those foreigners and others not
   originating from their territories {33} , who practise usury or wish to
   do so, to rent houses for that purpose or to occupy rented houses or to
   live elsewhere. Rather, they must expel all such notorious usurers from
   their territories within three months, never to admit any such for the
   future. Nobody is to let houses to them for usury, nor grant them
   houses under any other title {34} . Those indeed who act otherwise, if
   they are ecclesiastical persons, patriarchs, archbishops or bishops,
   are to know that they incur automatic suspension; lesser individual
   persons, excommunication, colleges or other communities, interdict. If
   they remain obdurate throughout a month, their territories shall lie
   henceforth under ecclesiastical interdict as long as the usurers remain
   there. Furthermore, if they are layfolk, they are to be restrained from
   such transgression through their ordinaries by ecclesiastical censure,
   all privileges ceasing {35}

   27 {36} Although notorious usurers give orders in their wills that
   restitution be made for their usurious gains, either in express terms
   or in general, ecclesiastical burial is nevertheless to be refused
   until full restitution has been made as far as the usurer's means
   allow, or until a pledge has been given of fitting restitution. This
   pledge is to be given to those to whom restitution is due, if they
   themselves or others who can receive for them are present. If they are
   absent, the pledge is to be given to the local ordinary or his vicar or
   the rector of the parish where the testator lives, in the presence of
   trustworthy persons from the parish (the ordinary, vicar and rector, as
   just mentioned, shall have permission to receive such pledge in their
   name by authority of the present constitution, so that these
   ecclesiastics have the right to action). The pledge may also be given
   to a public servant commissioned by the ordinary. If the sum owing from
   usury is openly known, we wish this sum always to be expressed in the
   pledge, if the amount is not clearly known, the sum is to be determined
   by the receiver of the pledge {37} . The receiver must make his
   estimate at not less than the probable amount; if he does otherwise, he
   is obliged to restitution for anything still owing. We decree that all
   religious and others who presume to grant ecclesiastical {38} burial to
   notorious usurers, contrary to this decree, are subject to the penalty
   promulgated against usurers at the Lateran council . Nobody is to
   assist at the wills of notorious usurers or hear their confessions or
   absolve them, unless they have made restitution for their usury or have
   given a fitting guarantee, as far as they can, as described above. The
   wills made in any other way by notorious usurers have no validity, but
   are by law null and void. {39}

   28. On wrongs and the loss caused

   28. {40} The distraints which in the vernacular are called "reprisals",
   by which some people are burdened in place of others, have been
   forbidden by the civil constitution as oppressive and contrary to the
   laws and natural equity. In order, however, that offenders may have
   greater fear of breaking the law where ecclesiastical persons are
   concerned, in accordance with the more particular prohibition of
   reprisals against them, we severely forbid the granting of reprisals
   against ecclesiastical persons or their goods. By this present decree
   we also forbid the extension of such reprisals, perhaps granted
   universally on pretext of some custom which we would prefer to call an
   abuse, to these persons. Those who act otherwise, by granting
   distraints or reprisals against such persons or extending the grant to
   include them, unless they revoke such presumption within a month, incur
   sentence of excommunication, if they are individuals; they are to be
   laid under ecclesiastical interdict, if they are a community.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   29. On the sentence of excommunication

   29. {41} The constitution of Pope Innocent IV, our predecessor of happy
   memory, forbids that those who communicate with excommunicated persons
   in matters carrying only a minor excommunication should be bound,
   without first receiving canonical admonition, by a major
   excommunication; the sentence of excommunication thus promulgated does
   not bind. In order to remove any scruple of ambiguity, we declare that
   the admonition is canonical only if, after all other formalities have
   been duly observed, it names the persons admonished. We decree also
   that in the course of the admonitions required for the sentence to be
   promulgated canonically, the judges, whether they give three
   admonitions or one for all three, should observe fitting intervals of
   some days, unless the urgency of the situation counsels otherwise.

   30. {42} By the present general decree we declare that the benefit of
   provisional absolution does not in any way apply to cities, villages or
   any other places against which a general interdict has been
   promulgated.

   31. {43} Whoever, from the fact that a sentence of excommunication,
   suspension or interdict has been promulgated against kings, princes,
   barons, nobles, bailiffs or their agents or anyone else, gives leave to
   someone to kill, capture or molest, in their persons or goods or in
   those of their relatives, those who have published such sentences, or
   on whose account the sentences were published, or who observe such
   sentences or refuse to communicate with those so excommunicated, unless
   they revoke in time such permission, automatically fall under sentence
   of excommunication. If property has been seized on the occasion of such
   permission, the same sentence is incurred unless the goods are returned
   within eight days or satisfaction is made for the loss. All who have
   dared to make use of the permission, or commit on their own initiative
   any of the above crimes for which we have forbidden permission to be
   given, are bound by the same sentence. Those who remain under this
   sentence of excommunication for two months cannot henceforth obtain
   absolution except through the apostolic see.

   reserve for us and our successors full freedom to declare (to change
   added in V 3, 5, 7-8), to add or to subtract, as will seem expedient
   for the common good. We therefore note the holy and pious intention of
   the same supreme pontiff, since in the said constitution he is
   concerned only with pleasing God and providing for the universal
   church. In it (In it omitted in V 1, 4, 6, 8) the supreme pontiff is
   not pursuing any private interest of his own, especially since the
   effect of the constitution extends to the time when he will no longer
   be among mortals. We also note how many dangers arose from the recent
   prolonged vacancy of the Roman church. For these reasons we accept,
   approve and expressly consent to the same constitution which obviates
   so many dangers. In testimony of which we set our seal to the present
