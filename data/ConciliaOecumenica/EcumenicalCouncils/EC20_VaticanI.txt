The First General Council of the Vatican, 1869-70

   INTRODUCTION
   This council was summoned by Pope Pius IX by the bull Aeterni Patris of
   29 June 1868. The first session was held in St Peter's basilica on 8
   December 1869 in the presence and under the presidency of the pope.
   The purpose of the council was, besides the condemnation of
   contemporary errors, to define the Catholic doctrine concerning the
   Church of Christ. In fact, in the three following sessions, there was
   discussion and approval of only two constitutions: Dogmatic
   Constitution On The Catholic Faith and First Dogmatic Constitution on
   the church of Christ, the latter dealing with the primacy and
   infallibility of the bishop of Rome. The discussion and approval of the
   latter constitution gave rise, particularly in Germany, to bitter and
   most serious controversies which led to the withdrawal from the church
   of those known as "Old Catholics".
   The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war led to the interruption of the
   council. It was in fact never resumed, nor was it ever officially
   closed. As in other councils at which the pope was present and
   presided, the decrees were in the form of bulls, at the end of which
   was the clear declaration: "with the approval of the sacred council".
   Very large numbers attended this council, including, for the first
   time, bishops from outside Europe and its neighbouring lands. Bishops
   from the eastern Orthodox churches were also invited, but did not
   come.
   The decrees of the council were published in various simultaneous
   editions. Later they were included in volume 7 of Collectio Lacensis (
   1892) and in volumes 49-53 of Mansi's collection (1923-1927). The
   collection which we use is that entitled Acta et decreta sacrosancti
   oecumenici concilii Vaticani in quatuor prionbus sessionibus, Rome
   1872. Comparison with other editions reveals no discrepancies, indeed
   absolute agreement.
   SESSION 1 : 8 December 1869
   Decree of opening of the council
   Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Most reverend fathers, is it
   your pleasure that,
   to the praise and glory of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son
   and Holy Spirit,
   for the increase and exaltation of the Catholic faith and religion,
   for the uprooting of current errors,
   for the reformation of the clergy and the Christian people, and
   for the common peace and concord of all,
   the holy ecumenical Vatican council should be opened, and be declared
   to have been opened?
   [They replied: Yes]
   Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record. Most reverend fathers, is it
   your pleasure that
   the next session of the holy ecumenical Vatican council should be held
   on the feast of the Epiphany of the Lord, that is 6 January 1870?
   [They replied: Yes]
   SESSION 2 : 6 January 1870
   Profession of faith
   I, Pius, bishop of the Catholic Church, with firm faith believe and
   profess each and every article contained in the profession of faith
   which the Holy Roman Church uses, namely:
   I believe in one God
   the Father almighty,
   maker of
   Heaven and
   earth, of
   all things
   seen and
   unseen. And in
   one Lord Jesus Christ
   the only-begotten Son of God.
   Born of the Father before all ages.
   God from God,
   light from light,
   true God from true God.
   Begotten not made,
   of one substance with the Father:
   through Whom all things were made.
   Who for us humans and for our salvation
   came down from Heaven.
   He was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary: and became man.
   He
   was crucified also for us, He suffered under Pontius Pilate and was
   buried. The third day He
   rose again according to the scriptures. He
   ascended into Heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father.
   He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead, and of
   His kingdom there shall be no end. And in
   the Holy Spirit,
   the Lord and the Giver of life, Who
   proceeds from the Father and the Son.
   Who together with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified: Who
   spoke through the prophets. And
   One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church.
   I confess one baptism for the remission of Sins.
   And I look for
   the resurrection of the dead. And
   the life of the world to come. Amen.
   Apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions and all other observances and
   constitutions of that same Church I most firmly accept and embrace.
   Likewise I accept sacred scripture
   according to that sense which Holy Mother Church held and holds,
   since it is her right to judge of the true sense and interpretation of
   the holy scriptures;
   nor will I ever receive and interpret them except according to the
   unanimous consent of the fathers.
   I profess also that
   there are seven sacraments of the new law,
   truly and properly so called,
   instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ and
   necessary for salvation,
   though each person need not receive them all.
   They are:
   1.      baptism,
   2.      confirmation,
   3.      the Eucharist,
   4.      penance,
   5.      last anointing,
   6.      order and
   7.      matrimony; and
   they confer grace.
   Of these baptism, confirmation and order may not be repeated without
   sacrilege.
   I likewise receive and accept the rites of the catholic church which
   have been received and approved in the solemn administration of all the
   aforesaid sacraments. I embrace and accept the whole and every part of
   what was defined and declared by the holy council of Trent concerning
   original sin and justification. Likewise I profess that in the mass
   there is offered to God a true, proper and propitiatory sacrifice for
   the living and the dead; and that in the most holy sacrament of the
   Eucharist there is truly, really and substantially the body and blood,
   together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that
   there takes place the conversion of the whole substance of the bread
   into His body, and of the whole substance of the wine into His blood,
   and this conversion the Catholic Church calls transubstantiation. I
   confess that under either species alone the whole and complete Christ
   and the true sacrament are received. I firmly hold that Purgatory
   exists, and that the souls detained there are helped by the suffrages
   of the faithful. Likewise, that the saints reigning with Christ are to
   be honoured and prayed to, and that they offer prayers to God on our
   behalf, and that their relics should be venerated.
   I resolutely assert that images of
   1.      Christ and
   2.      the ever virgin mother of God, and likewise those of
   3.      the other saints,
   are to be kept and retained, and that due honour and reverence is to be
   shown Them.
   I affirm that the power of indulgences was left by Christ in the
   Church, and that their use is eminently beneficial to the Christian
   people.

   I acknowledge the
   0.      Holy,
   1.      Catholic,
   2.      Apostolic and
   3.      Roman
   Church, the mother and mistress of all the churches [1] .
   Likewise
   0.      all other things which have been transmitted, defined and
   declared by the sacred canons and the ecumenical councils, especially
   the sacred Trent, I accept unhesitatingly and profess; in the same way
   1.      whatever is to the contrary, and whatever heresies have been
   condemned, rejected and anathematised by the Church, I too condemn,
   reject and anathematise.
   This true Catholic faith, < be can none which of>, which I now freely
   profess and truly hold, is what I shall steadfastly maintain and
   confess, by the help of God, in all its completeness and purity until
   my dying breath, and I shall do my best to ensure [2] that all others
   do the same. This is what I, the same Pius, promise, vow and swear. So
   help me God and these holy gospels of God.
   SESSION 3 : 24 April 1870
   Dogmatic constitution on the Catholic faith
   Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record.
   The Son of God, redeemer of the human race, our Lord Jesus Christ,
   promised, when about to return to His Heavenly Father, that He would be
   with this Church Militant upon earth all days even to the end of the
   world [3] . Hence never at any time has He ceased to stand by His
   beloved bride,
   assisting her when she teaches,
   blessing her in her labours and
   bringing her help when she is in danger.
   Now this redemptive providence appears very clearly in unnumbered
   benefits, but most especially is it manifested in the advantages which
   have been secured for the Christian world by ecumenical councils, among
   which the council of Trent requires special mention, celebrated though
   it was in evil days.
   Thence came
   1.      a closer definition and more fruitful exposition of the holy
   dogmas of religion and
   2.      the condemnation and repression of errors; thence too,
   3.      the restoration and vigorous strengthening of ecclesiastical
   discipline,
   4.      the advancement of the clergy in zeal for learning and piety,
   5.      the founding of colleges for the training of the young for the
   service of religion; and finally
   6.      the renewal of the moral life of the Christian people by a more
   accurate instruction of the faithful, and a more frequent reception of
   the sacraments. What is more, thence also came
   7.      a closer union of the members with the visible head, and an
   increased vigour in the whole Mystical Body of Christ. Thence came
   8.      the multiplication of religious orders and other organisations
   of Christian piety; thence too
   9.      that determined and constant ardour for the spreading of
   Christ's kingdom abroad in the world, even at the cost of shedding
   one's blood.
   While we recall with grateful hearts, as is only fitting, these and
   other outstanding gains, which the divine mercy has bestowed on the
   church especially by means of the last ecumenical synod, we cannot
   subdue the bitter grief that we feel at most serious evils, which have
   largely arisen either because
   the authority of the sacred synod was held in contempt by all too many,
   or because
   its wise decrees were neglected.
   Everybody knows that those heresies, condemned by the fathers of Trent,
   which rejected the divine magisterium of the church and allowed
   religious questions to be a matter for the judgment of each individual,
   have gradually collapsed into a multiplicity of sects, either at
   variance or in agreement with one another; and by this means a good
   many people have had all faith in Christ destroyed.
   Indeed even the holy Bible itself, which they at one time claimed to be
   the sole source and judge of the christian faith, is no longer held to
   be divine, but they begin to assimilate it to the inventions of myth.
   Thereupon there came into being and spread far and wide throughout the
   world that doctrine of rationalism or naturalism, - utterly opposed to
   the christian religion, since this is of supernatural origin, - which
   spares no effort to bring it about that Christ, Who alone is our Lord
   and Saviour, is shut out from the minds of people and the moral life of
   nations. Thus they would establish what they call the rule of simple
   reason or nature. The abandonment and rejection of the Christian
   religion, and the denial of God and his Christ, has plunged the minds
   of many into the abyss of pantheism, materialism and atheism, and the
   consequence is that they strive to destroy rational nature itself, to
   deny any criterion of what is right and just, and to overthrow the very
   foundations of human society.
   With this impiety spreading in every direction, it has come about,
   alas, that many even among the children of the Catholic Church have
   strayed from the path of genuine piety, and as the truth was gradually
   diluted in them, their Catholic sensibility was weakened. Led away by
   diverse and strange teachings [4] and confusing nature and grace, human
   knowledge and divine faith, they are found to distort the genuine sense
   of the dogmas which Holy Mother Church holds and teaches, and to
   endanger the integrity and genuineness of the faith.
   At the sight of all this, how can the inmost being of the Church not
   suffer anguish? For just as God wills all people to be saved and come
   to the knowledge of the truth [5] , just as Christ came to save what
   was lost [6] and to gather into one the children of God who were
   scattered abroad [7] , so the Church, appointed by God to be mother and
   mistress of nations, recognises her obligations to all and is always
   ready and anxious to raise the fallen, to steady those who stumble, to
   embrace those who return, and to strengthen the good and urge them on
   to what is better. Thus she can never cease from witnessing to the
   truth of God which heals all [8 ] and from declaring it, for she knows
   that these words were directed to her: My spirit which is upon you, and
   My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your
   mouth from this time forth and for evermore [9] .
   And so we, following in the footsteps of our predecessors, in
   accordance with our supreme apostolic office, have never left off
   teaching and defending Catholic truth and condemning erroneous
   doctrines.
   But now it is our purpose to profess and declare from this chair of
   Peter before all eyes the saving teaching of Christ, and, by the power
   given us by God, to reject and condemn the contrary errors.
   This we shall do with the bishops of the whole world as our
   co-assessors and fellow-judges, gathered here as they are in the holy
   Spirit by our authority in this ecumenical council, and relying on the
   word of God in scripture and tradition as we have received it,
   religiously preserved and authentically expounded by the Catholic
   Church Chapter 1 On God the creator of all things
   The Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church believes and
   acknowledges that there is one true and living God, Creator and Lord of
   Heaven and earth, almighty, eternal, immeasurable, incomprehensible,
   infinite in will, understanding and every perfection. Since He is one,
   singular, completely simple and unchangeable spiritual substance, e
   must be declared to be in reality and in essence,
   distinct from the world, supremely happy in Himself and from Himself,
   and inexpressibly loftier than anything besides Himself which either
   exists or can be imagined. This one true God, by His goodness and
   almighty power, not with the intention of increasing His happiness, nor
   indeed of obtaining happiness, but in order to manifest His perfection
   by the good things which He bestows on what He creates,
   by an absolutely free plan, together from the beginning of time brought
   into being from nothing the twofold created order, that is the
   spiritual and the bodily, the angelic and the earthly,
   and thereafter the human which is, in a way, common to both since it is
   composed of spirit and body [10]. Everything that God has brought into
   being He protects and governs by his providence, which reaches from one
   end of the earth to the other and orders all things well [11] . All
   things are open and laid bare to His eyes [12] , even those which will
   be brought about by the free activity of creatures.
   Chapter 2 On revelation
   The same Holy Mother Church holds and teaches that God, the source and
   end of all things,
   can be known with certainty from the consideration of created things,
   by the natural power of human reason : ever since the creation of the
   world, his invisible nature has been clearly perceived in thethings
   that have been made. [13] t was, however, pleasing to His wisdom and
   goodness to reveal Himself and the eternal laws of His will to the
   human race by another, and that a supernatural, way.
   This is how the Apostle puts it : In many and various ways God spoke of
   old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last days He has
   spoken to us by a Son [14] . It is indeed thanks to this divine
   revelation, that those matters concerning God which are not of
   themselves beyond the scope of human reason, can, even in the present
   state of the human race, be known by everyone
   without difficulty, with firm certitude and with no intermingling of
   error. It is not because of this that one must hold revelation to be
   absolutely necessary; the reason is that God directed human beings to
   asupernatural end, that is a sharing in the good things of God that
   utterly surpasses the understanding of the human mind; indeed eye has
   not seen, neither has ear heard, nor has it come into our hearts to
   conceive what things God has prepared for those who love Him [15] . Now
   this supernatural revelation, according to the belief of the universal
   church, as declared by the sacred council of Trent, is contained in
   written books and unwritten traditions, which were received by the
   apostles from the lips of Christ Himself, or came to the apostles by
   the dictation of the Holy Spirit, and were passed on as it were from
   hand to hand until they reached us [16]. The complete books of the old
   and the new Testament with all their parts, as they are listed in the
   decree of the said council and as they are found in the old Latin
   Vulgate edition, are to be received as sacred and canonical.
   These books the Church holds to be sacred and canonical not because she
   subsequently approved them by her authority after they had been
   composed by unaided human skill, nor simply because they contain
   revelation without error, but because, being written under the
   inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their Author, and were
   as such committed to the Church. Now since the decree on the
   interpretation of holy scripture, profitably made by the council of
   Trent, with the intention of constraining rash speculation, has been
   wrongly interpreted by some, we renew that decree and declare its
   meaning to be as follows: that in matters of faith and morals,
   belonging as they do to the establishing of Christian doctrine, that
   meaning of holy scripture must be held to be the true one, which Holy
   Mother Church held and holds, since it is her right to judge of the
   true meaning and interpretation of holy scripture. In consequence, it
   is not permissible for anyone to interpret holy scripture in a sense
   contrary to this, or indeed against the unanimous consent of the
   fathers.

   SESSION 3 : 24 April 1870 - Dogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith
   (continued)
   Chapter 3 On faith
   Since human beings are totally dependent on God as their creator and
   lord, and created reason is completely subject to uncreated truth, we
   are obliged to yield to God the revealer full submission of intellect
   and will by faith.
   This faith, which is the beginning of human salvation, the catholic
   church professes to be
   a supernatural virtue,
   by means of which,
   with the grace of God inspiring and assisting us,
   we believe to be true what He has revealed,
   not because we perceive its intrinsic truth by the natural light of
   reason,
   but because of the authority of God himself, who makes the revelation
   and can neither deceive nor be deceived.
   Faith, declares the Apostle, is the assurance of things hoped for, the
   conviction of things not seen [17].
   Nevertheless, in order that the submission of our faith should be in
   accordance with reason, it was God's will that there should be linked
   to the internal assistance of the holy Spirit external indications of
   his revelation, that is to say divine acts, and
   first and foremost miracles and prophecies,
   which clearly demonstrating as they do the omnipotence and infinite
   knowledge of God, are
   the most certain signs of revelation and are
   suited to the understanding of all.
   Hence
   Moses
   and the prophets,
   and especially Christ our lord himself,
   worked many absolutely clear miracles and delivered prophecies;
   while of the apostles we read:
   And they went forth and preached every, while the Lord worked with them
   and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it [18] . Again it
   is written:
   We have the prophetic word made more sure; you will do well to pay
   attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place [19] .
   Now,
   although the assent of faith is by no means a blind movement of the
   mind,
   yet no one can accept the gospel preaching
   in the way that is necessary for achieving salvation
   without the inspiration and illumination of the holy Spirit,
   who gives to all facility in accepting and believing the truth [20] .
   And so faith in itself,
   even though it may not work through charity,
   is a gift of God,
   and its operation is a work belonging to the order of salvation,
   in that a person yields true obedience to God himself when he accepts
   and collaborates with his grace which he could have rejected.
   Wherefore, by divine and catholic faith all those things are to be
   believed
   which are contained in the word of God as found in scripture and
   tradition,
   and which are proposed by the church as matters to be believed as
   divinely revealed,
   whether by her solemn judgment
   or in her ordinary and universal magisterium.
   Since, then, without faith it is impossible to please God [21] and
   reach the fellowship of his sons and daughters, it follows that
   no one can ever achieve justification without it,
   neither can anyone attain eternal life unless he or she perseveres in
   it to the end.
   So that we could fulfil our duty of embracing the true faith and of
   persevering unwaveringly in it, God, through his only begotten Son,
   founded the church,
   and he endowed his institution with clear notes to the end that she
   might be recognised by all as the guardian and teacher of the revealed
   word.
   To the catholic church alone belong all those things, so many and so
   marvellous, which have been divinely ordained to make for the manifest
   credibility of the christian faith.
   What is more,
   the church herself
   by reason of
   her astonishing propagation,
   her outstanding holiness and
   her inexhaustible fertility in every kind of goodness, by
   her catholic unity and
   her unconquerable stability,
   is a kind of great and perpetual motive of credibility and an
   incontrovertible evidence of her own divine mission.
   So it comes about that,
   like a standard lifted up for the nations [22] ,
   she both invites to herself those who have not yet believed,
   and likewise assures her sons and daughters that the faith they profess
   rests on the firmest of foundations.
   To this witness is added the effective help of power from on high.
   For,

   the kind Lord stirs up those who go astray and helps them by his grace
   so that they may come to the knowledge of the truth [23] ;
   and also confirms by his grace those whom he has translated into his
   admirable light [24],
   so that they may persevere in this light,
   not abandoning them unless he is first abandoned.
   Consequently,
   the situation of those, who
   by the heavenly gift of faith
   have embraced the catholic truth,
   is by no means the same as that of those who,
   led by human opinions,
   follow a false religion;
   for those who have accepted the faith under the guidance of the church
   can never have any just cause for changing this faith or for calling it
   into question.
   This being so, giving thanks to God the Father who has made us worthy
   to share with the saints in light [25] let us not neglect so great a
   salvation [26] , but looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our
   faith [27] , let us hold the unshakeable confession of our hope [28].
   Chapter 4 On faith and reason
   The perpetual agreement of the catholic church has maintained and
   maintains this too: that
   there is a twofold order of knowledge, distinct
   not only as regards its source,
   but also as regards its object.
   With regard to the source,
   we know at the one level by natural reason,
   at the other level by divine faith.
   With regard to the object,
   besides those things to which natural reason can attain,
   there are proposed for our belief mysteries hidden in God
   which, unless they are divinely revealed, are incapable of being
   known.
   Wherefore, when the Apostle, who witnesses that God was known to the
   gentiles from created things [29] , comes to treat of the grace and
   truth which came by Jesus Christ [30] , he declares: We impart a secret
   and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our
   glorification. None of the rulers of this age understood this. God has
   revealed it to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches
   everything, even the depths of God [31] . And the Only-begotten
   himself, in his confession to the Father, acknowledges that the Father
   has hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to
   the little ones [32] .
   Now reason,
   does indeed
   when it seeks persistently, piously and soberly,
   achieve
   by God's gift
   some understanding,
   and that most profitable,
   of the mysteries,
   whether by analogy from what it knows naturally,
   or from the connexion of these mysteries
   with one another and
   with the final end of humanity;
   but reason
   is never rendered capable of penetrating these mysteries
   in the way in which it penetrates those truths which form its proper
   object.
   For
   the divine mysteries,
   by their very nature,
   so far surpass the created understanding
   that, even when a revelation has been given and accepted by faith,
   they remain covered by the veil of that same faith and wrapped, as it
   were, in a certain obscurity,
   as long as in this mortal life we are away from the Lord,
   for we walk by faith, and not by sight [33] .
   Even though faith is above reason, there can never be any real
   disagreement between faith and reason, since
   it is the same God
   who reveals the mysteries and infuses faith, and
   who has endowed the human mind with the light of reason.
   God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever be in opposition to truth.
   The appearance of this kind of specious contradiction is chiefly due to
   the fact that either
   the dogmas of faith are not understood and explained in accordance with
   the mind of the church, or
   unsound views are mistaken for the conclusions of reason.
   Therefore we define that every assertion contrary to the truth of
   enlightened faith is totally false [34] .
   Furthermore the church which,
   together with its apostolic office of teaching,
   has received the charge of preserving the deposit of faith,
   has
   by divine appointment
   the right
   and duty
   of condemning
   what wrongly passes for knowledge,
   lest anyone be led astray by philosophy and empty deceit [35] .
   Hence all faithful Christians
   are forbidden to defend as the legitimate conclusions of science those
   opinions which are known to be contrary to the doctrine of faith,
   particularly if they have been condemned by the church; and furthermore
   they
   are absolutely bound to hold them to be errors which wear the deceptive
   appearance of truth.
   Not only can faith and reason never be at odds with one another but
   they mutually support each other, for
   on the one hand right reason
   established the foundations of the faith
   and, illuminated by its light, develops the science of divine things;
   on the other hand, faith
   delivers reason from errors and
   protects it and furnishes it with knowledge of many kinds.
   Hence, so far is the church from hindering the development of human
   arts and studies, that in fact she assists and promotes them in many
   ways. For
   she is neither ignorant nor contemptuous of the advantages which derive
   from this source for human life, rather
   she acknowledges that those things flow from God, the lord of sciences,
   and, if they are properly used, lead to God by the help of his grace.
   Nor does the church forbid these studies to employ, each within its own
   area, its own proper principles and method:
   but while she admits this just freedom,
   she takes particular care that they do not
   become infected with errors by conflicting with divine teaching, or,
   by going beyond their proper limits, intrude upon what belongs to faith
   and
   engender confusion.
   For the doctrine of the faith which God has revealed is put forward
   not as some philosophical discovery capable of being perfected by human
   intelligence,
   but as a divine deposit committed to the spouse of Christ to be
   faithfully protected and infallibly promulgated.
   Hence, too,that meaning of the sacred dogmas is ever to be maintained
   which has once been declared by holy mother church, and there must
   never be any abandonment of this sense under the pretext or in the name
   of a more profound understanding.
   May understanding, knowledge and wisdom increase as ages and centuries
   roll along, and greatly and vigorously flourish, in each and all, in
   the individual and the whole church: but this only in its own proper
   kind, that is to say, in the same doctrine, the same sense, and the
   same understanding [36] .
   CANONS
   1. On God the creator of all things

   1. If anyone denies the one true God, creator and lord of things
   visible and invisible: let him be anathema.
   2. If anyone is so bold as to assert that
   there exists nothing besides matter:
   let him be anathema.
   3. If anyone says that
   the substance or essence of God and that of all things are one and the
   same:
   let him be anathema.

   4. If anyone says
   that finite things, both corporal and spiritual, or at any rate,
   spiritual, emanated from the divine substance; or
   that the divine essence, by the manifestation and evolution of itself
   becomes all things or, finally,
   that God is a universal or indefinite being which by self determination
   establishes the totality of things distinct in genera, species and
   individuals:
   let him be anathema.
   5. If anyone
   does not confess that the world and all things which are contained in
   it, both spiritual and material, were produced, according to their
   whole substance, out of nothing by God; or
   holds that God did not create by his will free from all necessity, but
   as necessarily as he necessarily loves himself; or
   denies that the world was created for the glory of God:
   let him be anathema.
   2. On revelation
   1. If anyone says that
   the one, true God, our creator and lord, cannot be known with
   certainty
   from the things that have been made,
   by the natural light of human reason:
   let him be anathema.

   2. If anyone says that it is
   impossible, or
   not expedient,
   that human beings should be taught by means of divine revelation about
   God and
   the worship that should be shown him :
   let him be anathema.

   3. If anyone says that a human being
   cannot be divinely elevated to a
   knowledge and
   perfection
   which exceeds the natural, but
   of himself can and must reach finally the possession of all
   truth and
   goodness
   by continual development:
   let him be anathema.


   4. If anyone
   does not receive as sacred and canonical the complete books of sacred
   scripture with all their parts, as the holy council of Trent listed
   them, or
   denies that they were divinely inspired :
   let him be anathema.
   3. On faith
   1. If anyone says that
   human reason is so independent that faith cannot be commanded by God:
   let him be anathema.

   2. If anyone says that
   divine faith is not to be distinguished from natural knowledge about
   God and moral matters, and consequently that
   for divine faith it is not required that revealed truth should be
   believed because of the authority of God who reveals it:
   let him be anathema.

   3. If anyone says that
   divine revelation cannot be made credible by external signs, and that
   therefore
   men and women ought to be moved to faith only by each one's internal
   experience or private inspiration:
   let him be anathema.

   4. If anyone says that
   all miracles are impossible, and that therefore
   all reports of them, even those contained in sacred scripture, are to
   be set aside as fables or myths; or that
   miracles can never be known with certainty,
   nor can the divine origin of the christian religion be proved from
   them:
   let him be anathema.

   5. If anyone says that
   the assent to christian faith is
   not free, but is
   necessarily produced by arguments of human reason; or that
   the grace of God is necessary only for living faith which works by
   charity:
   let him be anathema.
   6. If anyone says that
   the condition of the faithful and those who have not yet attained to
   the only true faith is alike, so that
   Catholics may have a just cause for calling in doubt, by suspending
   their assent, the faith which they have already received from the
   teaching of the church, until they have completed a scientific
   demonstration of the credibility and truth of their faith:
   let him be anathema.
   4. On faith and reason
   1. If anyone says that
   in divine revelation there are contained no true mysteries properly
   so-called, but that
   all the dogmas of the faith can be understood and demonstrated by
   properly trained reason from natural principles:
   let him be anathema.

   2. If anyone says that
   human studies are to be treated with such a degree of liberty that
   their assertions may be maintained as true even when they are opposed
   to divine revelation, and that
   they may not be forbidden by the church:
   let him be anathema.

   3. If anyone says that
   it is possible that at some time, given the advancement of knowledge, a
   sense may be assigned to the dogmas propounded by the church which is
   different from that which the church has understood and understands:
   let him be anathema.
   And so in the performance of our supreme pastoral office, we beseech
   for the love of Jesus Christ and we command, by the authority of him
   who is also our God and saviour, all faithful Christians, especially
   those in authority or who have the duty of teaching, that they
   contribute their zeal and labour to the warding off and elimination of
   these errors from the church and to the spreading of the light of the
   pure faith.
   But since it is not enough to avoid the contamination of heresy unless
   those errors are carefully shunned which approach it in greater or less
   degree, we warn all of their duty to observe the constitutions and
   decrees in which such wrong opinions, though not expressly mentioned in
   this document, have been banned and forbidden by this holy see.

   SESSION 4 : 18 July 1870
   First dogmatic constitution on the church of Christ
   Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with the approval of the
   sacred council, for an everlasting record.
   The eternal shepherd and guardian of our souls [37] ,
   in order to render permanent the saving work of redemption,
   determined to build a church
   in which,
   as in the house of the living God,
   all the faithful should be linked by the bond of one
   faith and
   charity.
   Therefore, before he was glorified,
   he besought his Father,
   not for the apostles only,
   but also for those who were to believe in him through their word,
   that they all might be one as the Son himself and the Father are one
   [38] .
   So then,
   just as he sent apostles, whom he chose out of the world [39] ,
   even as he had been sent by the Father [40],
   in like manner it was his will that in his church there should be
   shepherds and teachers until the end of time.
   In order, then, that
   the episcopal office should be one and undivided and that,
   by the union of the clergy,
   the whole multitude of believers should be held together in the unity
   of
   faith and
   communion,
   he set blessed Peter over the rest of the apostles and
   instituted in him the permanent principle of both unities and
   their visible foundation.
   Upon the strength of this foundation was to be built the eternal
   temple, and the church whose topmost part reaches heaven was to rise
   upon the firmness of this foundation [41] .
   And since the gates of hell trying, if they can, to overthrow the
   church, make their assault with a hatred that increases day by day
   against its divinely laid foundation,
   we judge it necessary,
   with the approbation of the sacred council, and
   for the protection, defence and growth of the catholic flock,
   to propound the doctrine concerning the
   1.      institution,
   2.      permanence and
   3.      nature
   of the sacred and apostolic primacy,
   upon which the strength and coherence of the whole church depends.
   This doctrine is to be believed and held by all the faithful in
   accordance with the ancient and unchanging faith of the whole church.
   Furthermore, we shall proscribe and condemn the contrary errors which
   are so harmful to the Lord's flock.
   Chapter 1 On the institution of the apostolic primacy in blessed Peter
   We teach and declare that,
   according to the gospel evidence,
   a primacy of jurisdiction over the whole church of God
   was immediately and directly
   promised to the blessed apostle Peter and
   conferred on him by Christ the lord.
   [PROMISED]
   It was to Simon alone,
   to whom he had already said
   You shall be called Cephas [42] ,
   that the Lord,
   after his confession, You are the Christ, the son of the living God,
   spoke these words:
   Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona. For flesh and blood has not revealed
   this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
   And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church,
   and the gates of the underworld shall not prevail against it. I will
   give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on
   earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall
   be loosed in heaven [43] .
   [CONFERRED]
   And it was to Peter alone that Jesus,
   after his resurrection,
   confided the jurisdiction of supreme pastor and ruler of his whole
   fold, saying:
   Feed my lambs, feed my sheep [44] .
   To this absolutely manifest teaching of the sacred scriptures, as it
   has always been understood by the catholic church, are clearly opposed
   the distorted opinions of those who misrepresent the form of government
   which Christ the lord established in his church and deny that Peter, in
   preference to the rest of the apostles, taken singly or collectively,
   was endowed by Christ with a true and proper primacy of jurisdiction.
   The same may be said of those who assert that this primacy was not
   conferred immediately and directly on blessed Peter himself, but rather
   on the church, and that it was through the church that it was
   transmitted to him in his capacity as her minister.
   Therefore,
   if anyone says that
   blessed Peter the apostle was not appointed by Christ the lord as
   prince of all the apostles and visible head of the whole church
   militant; or that
   it was a primacy of honour only and not one of true and proper
   jurisdiction that he directly and immediately received from our lord
   Jesus Christ himself:
   let him be anathema.
   Chapter 2. On the permanence of the primacy of blessed Peter in the
   Roman pontiffs
   That which our lord Jesus Christ, the prince of shepherds and great
   shepherd of the sheep, established in the blessed apostle Peter, for
   the continual salvation and permanent benefit of the church, must of
   necessity remain for ever, by Christ's authority, in the church which,
   founded as it is upon a rock, will stand firm until the end of time
   [45] .
   For no one can be in doubt, indeed it was known in every age that the
   holy and most blessed Peter, prince and head of the apostles, the
   pillar of faith and the foundation of the catholic church, received the
   keys of the kingdom from our lord Jesus Christ, the saviour and
   redeemer of the human race, and that to this day and for ever he lives
   and presides and exercises judgment in his successors the bishops of
   the holy Roman see, which he founded and consecrated with his blood
   [46] .
   Therefore whoever succeeds to the chair of Peter obtains by the
   institution of Christ himself, the primacy of Peter over the whole
   church. So what the truth has ordained stands firm, and blessed Peter
   perseveres in the rock-like strength he was granted, and does not
   abandon that guidance of the church which he once received [47] .
   For this reason it has always been necessary for every church--that is
   to say the faithful throughout the world--to be in agreement with the
   Roman church because of its more effective leadership. In consequence
   of being joined, as members to head, with that see, from which the
   rights of sacred communion flow to all, they will grow together into
   the structure of a single body [48] .
   Therefore,
   if anyone says that
   it is not by the institution of Christ the lord himself (that is to
   say, by divine law) that blessed Peter should have perpetual successors
   in the primacy over the whole church; or that
   the Roman pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in this
   primacy:
   let him be anathema.
   Chapter 3. On the power and character of the primacy of the Roman
   pontiff
   And so,
   supported by the clear witness of holy scripture, and
   adhering to the manifest and explicit decrees both of our predecessors
   the Roman pontiffs and of
   general councils,
   we promulgate anew the definition of the ecumenical council of Florence
   [49] ,
   which must be believed by all faithful Christians, namely that
   the apostolic see and the Roman pontiff hold a world-wide primacy, and
   that
   the Roman pontiff is the successor of blessed Peter,
   the prince of the apostles,
   true vicar of Christ,
   head of the whole church and
   father and teacher of all christian people.
   To him, in blessed Peter, full power has been given by our lord Jesus
   Christ to
   tend,
   rule and govern
   the universal church.
   All this is to be found in the acts of the ecumenical councils and the
   sacred canons.
   Wherefore we teach and declare that,
   by divine ordinance,
   the Roman church possesses a pre-eminence of ordinary power over every
   other church, and that
   this jurisdictional power of the Roman pontiff is both
   episcopal and
   immediate.
   Both clergy and faithful,
   of whatever rite and dignity,
   both singly and collectively,
   are bound to submit to this power by the duty of hierarchical
   subordination and true obedience, and this
   not only in matters concerning faith and morals,
   but also in those which regard the discipline and government of the
   church throughout the world.
   In this way, by unity with the Roman pontiff in communion and in
   profession of the same faith , the church of Christ becomes one flock
   under one supreme shepherd [50] .
   This is the teaching of the catholic truth, and no one can depart from
   it without endangering his faith and salvation.
   This power of the supreme pontiff by no means detracts from that
   ordinary and immediate power of episcopal jurisdiction, by which
   bishops, who have succeeded to the place of the apostles by appointment
   of the holy Spirit, tend and govern individually the particular flocks
   which have been assigned to them. On the contrary, this power of theirs
   is asserted, supported and defended by the supreme and universal
   pastor; for St Gregory the Great says: "My honour is the honour of the
   whole church. My honour is the steadfast strength of my brethren. Then
   do I receive true honour, when it is denied to none of those to whom
   honour is due." [51]
   Furthermore, it follows from that supreme power which the Roman pontiff
   has in governing the whole church, that he has the right, in the
   performance of this office of his, to communicate freely with the
   pastors and flocks of the entire church, so that they may be taught and
   guided by him in the way of salvation.
   And therefore we condemn and reject the opinions of those who hold
   that
   this communication of the supreme head with pastors and flocks may be
   lawfully obstructed; or that
   it should be dependent on the civil power, which leads them to maintain
   that what is determined by the apostolic see or by its authority
   concerning the government of the church, has no force or effect unless
   it is confirmed by the agreement of the civil authority.
   Since the Roman pontiff, by the divine right of the apostolic primacy,
   governs the whole church, we likewise teach and declare that
   he is the supreme judge of the faithful [52] , and that
   in all cases which fall under ecclesiastical jurisdiction recourse may
   be had to his judgment [53] .
   The sentence of the apostolic see (than which there is no higher
   authority) is not subject to revision by anyone,
   nor may anyone lawfully pass judgment thereupon [54] . And so
   they stray from the genuine path of truth who maintain that it is
   lawful to appeal from the judgments of the Roman pontiffs to an
   ecumenical council as if this were an authority superior to the Roman
   pontiff.
   So, then,
   if anyone says that
   the Roman pontiff has merely an office of supervision and guidance,
   and
   not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole church,
   and this
   not only in matters of
   faith and morals, but also in those which concern the
   discipline and government of the church dispersed throughout the whole
   world; or that
   he has only the principal part, but not the absolute fullness, of this
   supreme power; or that
   this power of his is not ordinary and immediate both over all and each
   of the churches and over all and each of the pastors and faithful:
   let him be anathema.
   Chapter 4. On the infallible teaching authority of the Roman pontiff
   1.      That apostolic primacy which the Roman pontiff possesses as
   successor of Peter, the prince of the apostles, includes also the
   supreme power of teaching.
   o        This holy see has always maintained this,
   o        the constant custom of the church demonstrates it, and
   o        the ecumenical councils, particularly those in which East and
   West met in the union of faith and charity, have declared it.
   [councils]
   So the fathers of the fourth council of Constantinople, following the
   footsteps of their predecessors, published this solemn profession of
   faith:
   The first condition of salvation is to maintain the rule of the true
   faith. And since that saying of our lord Jesus Christ, You are Peter,
   and upon this rock I will build my church [55] , cannot fail of its
   effect, the words spoken are confirmed by their consequences. For in
   the apostolic see the catholic religion has always been preserved
   unblemished, and sacred doctrine been held in honour. Since it is our
   earnest desire to be in no way separated from this faith and doctrine,
   we hope that we may deserve to remain in that one communion which the
   apostolic see preaches, for in it is the whole and true strength of the
   christian religion [56] .
   What is more, with the approval of the second council of Lyons, the
   Greeks made the following profession:
   "The holy Roman church possesses the supreme and full primacy and
   principality over the whole catholic church. She truly and humbly
   acknowledges that she received this from the Lord himself in blessed
   Peter, the prince and chief of the apostles, whose successor the Roman
   pontiff is, together with the fullness of power. And since before all
   others she has the duty of defending the truth of the faith, so if any
   questions arise concerning the faith, it is by her judgment that they
   must be settled." [57]
   Then there is the definition of the council of Florence:
   "The Roman pontiff is the true vicar of Christ, the head of the whole
   church and the father and teacher of all Christians; and to him was
   committed in blessed Peter, by our lord Jesus Christ, the full power of
   tending, ruling and governing the whole church." [58]
   [Holy See]
   To satisfy this pastoral office, our predecessors strove unwearyingly
   that the saving teaching of Christ should be spread among all the
   peoples of the world; and with equal care they made sure that it should
   be kept pure and uncontaminated wherever it was received.
   [Custom]
   It was for this reason that the bishops of the whole world, sometimes
   individually, sometimes gathered in synods, according to the long
   established custom of the churches and the pattern of ancient usage
   referred to this apostolic see those dangers especially which arose in
   matters concerning the faith. This was to ensure that any damage
   suffered by the faith should be repaired in that place above all where
   the faith can know no failing [59] .
   [Holy See]
   The Roman pontiffs, too, as the circumstances of the time or the state
   of affairs suggested,
   sometimes by
   summoning ecumenical councils or
   consulting the opinion of the churches scattered throughout the world,
   sometimes by
   special synods, sometimes by
   taking advantage of other useful means afforded by divine providence,
   defined as doctrines to be held those things which, by God's help, they
   knew to be in keeping with
   sacred scripture and
   the apostolic traditions.
   For the holy Spirit was promised to the successors of Peter

   not so that they might, by his revelation, make known some new
   doctrine,
   but that, by his assistance, they might religiously guard and
   faithfully expound the revelation or deposit of faith transmitted by
   the apostles.
   Indeed, their apostolic teaching was
   embraced by all the venerable fathers and
   reverenced and followed by all the holy orthodox doctors,
   for they knew very well that this see of St. Peter always remains
   unblemished by any error, in accordance with the divine promise of our
   Lord and Saviour to the prince of his disciples: I have prayed for you
   that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again,
   strengthen your brethren [60] .
   This gift of truth and never-failing faith was therefore divinely
   conferred on Peter and his successors in this see so that they might
   discharge their exalted office for the salvation of all, and so that
   the whole flock of Christ might be kept away by them from the poisonous
   food of error and be nourished with the sustenance of heavenly
   doctrine. Thus the tendency to schism is removed and the whole church
   is preserved in unity, and, resting on its foundation, can stand firm
   against the gates of hell.
   But since in this very age when the salutary effectiveness of the
   apostolic office is most especially needed, not a few are to be found
   who disparage its authority, we judge it absolutely necessary to affirm
   solemnly the prerogative which the only-begotten Son of God was pleased
   to attach to the supreme pastoral office.
   Therefore,
   faithfully adhering to the tradition received from the beginning of the
   Christian faith,
   to the glory of God our Saviour,
   for the exaltation of the Catholic religion and
   for the salvation of the Christian people,
   with the approval of the sacred council,
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---------
   o        we teach and define as a divinely revealed dogma that
   §         when the Roman pontiff speaks EX CATHEDRA,
   §         that is, when,
   1.   in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all
   Christians,
   2.   in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority,
   3.   he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the
   whole Church,
   §         he possesses,
   §         by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter,
   §         that infallibility which the divine Redeemer willed His
   Church to enjoy in defining doctrine concerning faith or morals.
   §         Therefore, such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of
   themselves, and not by the consent of the church, irreformable.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---------
   10.     So then, should anyone, which God forbid, have the temerity to
   reject this definition of ours: let him be anathema.
