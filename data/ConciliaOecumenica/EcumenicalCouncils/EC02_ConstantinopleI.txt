The First General Council of Constantinople, 381

INTRODUCTION

   In the year 380 the emperors Gratian and Theodosius I decided to
   convoke this council to counter the Arians, and also to judge the case
   of Maximus the Cynic, bishop of Constantinople. The council met in May
   of the following year. One hundred and fifty bishops took part, all of
   them eastern Orthodox, since the Pneumatomachi party had left at the
   start.
   After Maximus had been condemned, Meletius, bishop of Antioch,
   appointed Gregory of Nazianzus as the lawful bishop of Constantinople
   and at first presided over the council. Then on Meletius's sudden
   death, Gregory took charge of the council up to the arrival of
   Acholius, who was to table Pope Damasus's demands: namely, that Maximus
   should be expelled as an interloper, and that the translation of
   bishops should be avoided. But when Timothy, bishop of Alexandria,
   arrived he declared Gregory's appointment invalid. Gregory resigned the
   episcopacy and Nectarius, after baptism and consecration, was installed
   as bishop and presided over the council until its closure.
   No copy of the council's doctrinal decisions, entitled tomos kai
   anathematismos engraphos (record of the tome and anathemas), has
   survived. So what is presented here is the synodical letter of the
   synod of Constantinople held in 382, which expounded these doctrinal
   decisions, as the fathers witness, in summary form: namely, along the
   lines defined by the council of Nicaea, the consubstantiality and
   coeternity of the three divine persons against the Sabellians,
   Anomoeans, Arians and Pneumatomachi, who thought that the divinity was
   divided into several natures; and the enanthropesis (taking of
   humanity) of the Word, against those who supposed that the Word had in
   no way taken a human soul. All these matters were in close agreement
   with the tome that Pope Damasus and a Roman council, held probably in
   378, had sent to the East.
   Scholars find difficulties with the creed attributed to the council of
   Constantinople. Some say that the council composed a new creed. But no
   mention is made of this creed by ancient witnesses until the council of
   Chalcedon; and the council of Constantinople was said simply to have
   endorsed the faith of Nicaea, with a few additions on the holy Spirit
   to refute the Pneumatomachian heresy. Moreover, if the latter tradition
   is accepted, an explanation must be given of why the first two articles
   of the so-called Constantinopolitan creed differ considerably from the
   Nicene creed.
   It was J. Lebon, followed by J. N. D. Kelly and A. M. Ritter, who
   worked at the solution of this problem. Lebon said that the Nicene
   creed, especially since it was adapted to use at baptism, had taken on
   a number of forms. It was one of these which was endorsed at the
   council of Constantinople and developed by additions concerning the
   holy Spirit. All the forms, altered to some extent or other, were
   described by a common title as "the Nicene faith". Then the council of
   Chalcedon mentioned the council of Constantinople as the immediate
   source of one of them, marked it out by a special name "the faith of
   the 150 fathers", which from that time onwards became its widely known
   title, and quoted it alongside the original simple form of the Nicene
   creed. The Greek text of the Constantinopolitan creed, which is printed
   below, is taken from the acts of the council of Chalcedon.
   The council of Constantinople enacted four disciplinary canons: against
   the Arian heresy and its sects (can. 1), on limiting the power of
   bishops within fixed boundaries (can. 2), on ranking the see of
   Constantinople second to Rome in honour and dignity (can. 3), on the
   condemnation of Maximus and his followers (can. 4). Canons 2-4 were
   intended to put a stop to aggrandisement on the part of the see of
   Alexandria. The two following canons, 5 and 6, were framed at the synod
   which met in Constantinople in 382. The 7th canon is an extract from a
   letter which the church of Constantinople sent to Martyrius of
   Antioch.
   The council ended on 9 July 381, and on 30 July of the same year, at
   the request of the council fathers, the emperor Theodosius ratified its
   decrees by edict.
   Already from 382 onwards, in the synodical letter of the synod which
   met at Constantinople, the council of Constantinople was given the
   title of "ecumenical". The word denotes a general and plenary council.
   But the council of Constantinople was criticised and censured by
   Gregory of Nazianzus. In subsequent years it was hardly ever mentioned.
   In the end it achieved its special status when the council of
   Chalcedon, at its second session and in its definition of the faith,
   linked the form of the creed read out at Constantinople with the Nicene
   form, as being a completely reliable witness of the authentic faith.
   The fathers of Chalcedon acknowledged the authority of the canons -- at
   least as far as the eastern church was concerned -- at their sixteenth
   session. The council's dogmatic authority in the western church was
   made clear by words of Pope Gregory I: "I confess that I accept and
   venerate the four councils (Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus and
   Chalcedon) in the same way as I do the four books of the holy
   Gospel...."
   The bishop of Rome's approval was not extended to the canons, because
   they were never brought "to the knowledge of the apostolic see''.
   Dionysius Exiguus knew only of the first four -- the ones to be found
   in the western collections. Pope Nicholas I wrote of the sixth canon to
   Emperor Michael III: "It is not found among us, but is said to be in
   force among you''.
   The English translation is from the Greek text, which is the more
   authoritative version.

The exposition of the 150 fathers

   We believe in one God the Father all-powerful, maker of heaven and of
   earth, and of all things both seen and unseen. And in one Lord Jesus
   Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten from the Father before
   all the ages, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not
   made, consubstantial with the Father, through whom all things came to
   be; for us humans and for our salvation he came down from the heavens
   and became incarnate from the holy Spirit and the virgin Mary, became
   human and was crucified on our behalf under Pontius Pilate; he suffered
   and was buried and rose up on the third day in accordance with the
   scriptures; and he went up into the heavens and is seated at the
   Father's right hand; he is coming again with glory to judge the living
   and the dead; his kingdom will have no end. And in the Spirit, the
   holy, the lordly and life-giving one, proceeding forth from the Father,
   co-worshipped and co-glorified with Father and Son, the one who spoke
   through the prophets; in one, holy, catholic and apostolic church. We
   confess one baptism for the forgiving of sins. We look forward to a
   resurrection of the dead and life in the age to come. Amen.

A letter of the bishops gathered in Constantinople [1]

   To the most honoured lords and most reverend brethren and
   fellow-ministers, Damasus, Ambrose, Britton, Valerian, Acholius,
   Anemius, Basil, and the rest of the holy bishops who met in the great
   city of Rome: the sacred synod of orthodox bishops who met in the great
   city of Constantinople sends greetings in the Lord.
   It may well be unnecessary to instruct your reverence by describing the
   many sufferings that have been brought upon us under Arian domination,
   as if you did not know already. Nor do we imagine that your piety
   considers our affairs so trivial that you need to learn what you must
   be suffering along with us. Nor were the storms which beset us such as
   to escape your notice on grounds of insignificance. The period of
   persecution is still recent and ensures that the memory remains fresh
   not only among those who have suffered but also among those who have
   through love made the lot of those who suffered their own. It was
   barely yesterday or the day before that some were freed from the bonds
   of exile and returned to their own churches through a thousand
   tribulations. The remains of others who died in exile were brought
   back. Even after their return from exile some experienced a ferment of
   hatred from the heretics and underwent a more cruel fate in their own
   land than they did abroad, by being stoned to death by them in the
   manner of the blessed Stephen. Others were torn to shreds by various
   tortures and still carry around on their bodies the marks of Christ's
   wounds and bruises. Who could number the financial penalties, the fines
   imposed on cities, the confiscations of individual property, the plots,
   the outrages, the imprisonments? Indeed all our afflictions increased
   beyond number: perhaps because we were paying the just penalty for our
   sins; perhaps also because a loving God was disciplining us by means of
   the great number of our sufferings.
   So thanks be to God for this. He has instructed his own servants
   through the weight of their afflictions, and in accordance with his
   numerous mercies he has brought us back again to a place of refreshment
   The restoration of the churches demanded prolonged attention, much time
   and hard work from us if the body of the church which had been weak for
   so long was to be cured completely by gradual treatment and brought
   back to its original soundness in religion. We may seem on the whole to
   be free from violent persecutions and to be at the moment recovering
   the churches which have long been in the grip of the heretics. But in
   fact we are oppressed by wolves who even after expulsion from the fold
   go on ravaging the flocks up and down dale, making so bold as to hold
   rival assemblies, activating popular uprisings and stopping at nothing
   which might harm the churches. As we have said, this made us take a
   longer time over our affairs.
   But now you have shown your brotherly love for us by convoking a synod
   in Rome, in accordance with God's will, and inviting us to it, by means
   of a letter from your most God-beloved emperor, as if we were limbs of
   your very own, so that whereas in the past we were condemned to suffer
   alone, you should not now reign in isolation from us, given the
   complete agreement of the emperors in matters of religion. Rather,
   according to the word of the apostle, we should reign along with you'.
   So it was our intention that if it were possible we should all leave
   our churches together and indulge our desires rather than attend to
   their needs. But who will give us wings as of a dove, so we shall fly
   and come to rest with you? This course would leave the churches
   entirely exposed, just as they are beginning their renewal; and it is
   completely out of the question for the majority. As a consequence of
   last year's letter sent by your reverence after the synod of Aquileia
   to our most God-beloved emperor Theodosius, we came together in
   Constantinople. We were equipped only for this stay in Constantinople
   and the bishops who remained in the provinces gave their agreement to
   this synod alone. We foresaw no need for a longer absence, nor did we
   hear of it in advance at all, before we gathered in Constantinople. On
   top of this the tightness of the schedule proposed allowed no
   opportunity to prepare for a longer absence, nor to brief all the
   bishops in the provinces who are in communion with us and to get their
   agreement. Since these considerations, and many more besides, prevented
   most of us from coming, we have done the next best thing both to set
   matters straight and to make your love for us appreciated: we have
   managed to convince our most venerable and reverend brethren and
   fellow-ministers, Bishops Cyriacus, Eusebius and Priscian to be willing
   to undertake the wearisome journey to you. Through them we wish to show
   that our intentions are peaceful and have unity as their goal. We also
   want to make clear that what we are zealously seeking is sound faith.
   What we have undergone -- persecutions, afflictions, imperial threats,
   cruelty from officials, and whatever other trial at the hands of
   heretics -- we have put up with for the sake of the gospel faith
   established by the 318 fathers at Nicaea in Bithynia. You, we and all
   who are not bent on subverting the word of the true faith should give
   this creed our approval. It is the most ancient and is consistent with
   our baptism. It tells us how to believe in the name of the Father and
   of the Son and of the holy Spirit: believing also, of course, that the
   Father, the Son and the holy Spirit have a single Godhead and power and
   substance, a dignity deserving the same honour and a co-eternal
   sovereignty, in three most perfect hypostases, or three perfect
   persons. So there is no place for Sabellius's diseased theory in which
   the hypostases are confused and thus their proper characteristics
   destroyed. Nor may the blasphemy of Eunomians and Arians and
   Pneumatomachi prevail, with its division of substance or of nature or
   of Godhead, and its introduction of some nature which was produced
   subsequently, or was created, or was of a different substance, into the
   uncreated and consubstantial and co-eternal Trinity. And we preserve
   undistorted the accounts of the Lord's taking of humanity, accepting as
   we do that the economy of his flesh was not soulless nor mindless nor
   imperfect. To sum up, we know that he was before the ages fully God the
   Word, and that in the last days he became fully man for the sake of our
   salvation.
   So much, in summary, for the faith which is openly preached by us. You
   can take even more heart concerning these matters if you think fit to
   consult the tome that was issued in Antioch by the synod which met
   there as well as the one issued last year in Constantinople by the
   ecumenical synod. In these documents we confessed the faith in broader
   terms and we have issued a written condemnation of the heresies which
   have recently erupted.
   With regard to particular forms of administration in the churches,
   ancient custom, as you know, has been in force, along with the
   regulation of the saintly fathers at Nicaea, that in each province
   those of the province, and with them-should the former so desire --
   their neighbours, should conduct ordinations as need might arise.
   Accordingly, as you are aware, the rest of the churches are
   administered, and the priests [= bishops] of the most prominent
   churches have been appointed, by us. Hence at the ecumenical council by
   common agreement and in the presence of the most God-beloved emperor
   Theodosius and all the clergy, and with the approval of the whole city,
   we have ordained the most venerable and God-beloved Nectarius as bishop
   of the church newly set up, as one might say, in Constantinople -- a
   church which by God's mercy we just recently snatched from the
   blasphemy of the heretics as from the lion's jaws. Over the most
   ancient and truly apostolic church at Antioch in Syria, where first the
   precious name of "Christians" came into use, the provincial bishops and
   those of the diocese of the East came together and canonically ordained
   the most venerable and God-beloved Flavian as bishop with the consent
   of the whole church, as though it would give the man due honour with a
   single voice. The synod as a whole also accepted that this ordination
   was legal. We wish to inform you that the most venerable and
   God-beloved Cyril is bishop of the church in Jerusalem, the mother of
   all the churches. He was canonically ordained some time ago by those of
   the province and at various times he has valiantly combated the
   Arians.
   We exhort your reverence to join us in rejoicing at what we have
   legally and canonically enacted. Let spiritual love link us together,
   and let the fear of the Lord suppress all human prejudice and put the
   building up of the churches before individual attachment or favour. In
   this way, with the account of the faith agreed between us and with
   christian love established among us, we shall cease to declare what was
   condemned by the apostles, "I belong to Paul, I to Apollo, I to
   Cephas"; but we shall all be seen to belong to Christ, who has not been
   divided up among us; and with God's good favour, we shall keep the body
   of the church undivided, and shall come before the judgment-seat of the
   Lord with confidence.

CANONS

Canon 1.

   The profession of faith of the holy fathers who gathered in Nicaea in
   Bithynia is not to be abrogated, but it is to remain in force. Every
   heresy is to be anathematised and in particular that of the Eunomians
   or Anomoeans, that of the Arians or Eudoxians, that of the Semi-Arians
   or Pneumatomachi, that of the Sabellians that of the Marcellians, that
   of the Photinians and that of the Apollinarians.

Canon 2.

   Diocesan bishops are not to intrude in churches beyond their own
   boundaries nor are they to confuse the churches: but in accordance with
   the canons, the bishop of Alexandria is to administer affairs in Egypt
   only; the bishops of the East are to manage the East alone (whilst
   safeguarding the privileges granted to the church of the Antiochenes in
   the Nicene canons); and the bishops of the Asian diocese are to manage
   only Asian affairs; and those in Pontus only the affairs of Pontus; and
   those in Thrace only Thracian affairs. Unless invited bishops are not
   to go outside their diocese to perform an ordination or any other
   ecclesiastical business. If the letter of the canon about dioceses is
   kept, it is clear that the provincial synod will manage affairs in each
   province, as was decreed at Nicaea. But the churches of God among
   barbarian peoples must be administered in accordance with the custom in
   force at the time of the fathers.

Canon 3.

   Because it is new Rome, the bishop of Constantinople is to enjoy the
   privileges of honour after the bishop of Rome.

Canon 4.

   Regarding Maximus the Cynic and the disorder which surrounded him in
   Constantinople: he never became, nor is he, a bishop; nor are those
   ordained by him clerics of any rank whatsoever. Everything that was
   done both to him and by him is to be held invalid.

Canon 5.

   Regarding the Tome [2] of the Westerns: we have also recognised those
   in Antioch who confess a single Godhead of Father and Son and holy
   Spirit.

Canon 6.

   There are many who are bent on confusing and overturning the good order
   of the church and so fabricate, out of hatred and a wish to slander,
   certain accusations against orthodox bishops in charge of churches.
   Their intention is none other than to blacken priests' reputations and
   to stir up trouble among peace- loving laity. For this reason the
   sacred synod of bishops assembled at Constantinople has decided not to
   admit accusers without prior examination, and not to allow everyone to
   bring accusations against church administrators -- but with- out
   excluding everyone. So if someone brings a private (that is a personal)
   complaint against the bishop on the grounds that he has been defrauded
   or in some other way unjustly dealt with by him, in the case of this
   kind of accusation neither the character nor the religion of the
   accuser will be subject to examination. It is wholly essential both
   that the bishop should have a clear conscience and that the one who
   alleges that he has been wronged, whatever his religion may be, should
   get justice.
   But if the charge brought against the bishop is of an ecclesiastical
   kind, then the characters of those making it should be examined, in the
   first place to stop heretics bringing charges against orthodox bishops
   in matters of an ecclesiastical kind. (We define "heretics" as those
   who have been previously banned from the church and also those later
   anathematised by ourselves: and in addition those who claim to confess
   a faith that is sound, but who have seceded and hold assemblies in
   rivalry with the bishops who are in communion with us.) In the second
   place, persons previously condemned and expelled from the church for
   whatever reason, or those excommunicated either from the clerical or
   lay rank, are not to be permitted to accuse a bishop until they have
   first purged their own crime. Similarly, those who are already accused
   are not permitted to accuse a bishop or other clerics until they have
   proved their own innocence of the crimes with which they are charged.
   But if persons who are neither heretics nor excommunicates, nor such as
   have been previously condemned or accused of some transgression or
   other, claim that they have some ecclesiastical charge to make against
   the bishop, the sacred synod commands that such persons should first
   lay the accusations before all the bishops of the province and prove
   before them the crimes committed by the bishop in the case. If it
   emerges that the bishops of the province are not able to correct the
   crimes laid at the bishop's door, then a higher synod of the bishops of
   that diocese, convoked to hear this case, must be approached, and the
   accusers are not to lay their accusations before it until they have
   given a written promise to submit to equal penalties should they be
   found guilty of making false accusations against the accused bishop,
   when the matter is investigated.
   If anyone shows contempt of the prescriptions regarding the above
   matters and presumes to bother either the ears of the emperor or the
   courts of the secular authorities, or to dishonour all the diocesan
   bishops and trouble an ecumenical synod, there is to be no question
   whatever of allowing such a person to bring accusations forward,
   because he has made a mockery of the canons and violated the good order
   of the church.

Canon 7.

   Those who embrace orthodoxy and join the number of those who are being
   saved from the heretics, we receive in the following regular and
   customary manner: Arians, Macedonians, Sabbatians, Novatians, those who
   call themselves Cathars and Aristae, Quartodeciman or Tetradites,
   Apollinarians-these we receive when they hand in statements and
   anathematise every heresy which is not of the same mind as the holy,
   catholic and apostolic church of God. They are first sealed or anointed
   with holy chrism on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth and ears. As we
   seal them we say: "Seal of the gift of the holy Spirit". But Eunomians,
   who are baptised in a single immersion, Montanists (called Phrygians
   here), Sabellians, who teach the identity of Father and Son and make
   certain other difficulties, and all other sects -- since there are many
   here, not least those who originate in the country of the Galatians --
   we receive all who wish to leave them and embrace orthodoxy as we do
   Greeks. On the first day we make Christians of them, on the second
   catechumens, on the third we exorcise them by breathing three times
   into their faces and their ears, and thus we catechise them and make
   them spend time in the church and listen to the scriptures; and then we
   baptise them.
