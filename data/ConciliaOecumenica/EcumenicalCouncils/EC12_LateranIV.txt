The Fourth General Council of the Lateran, 1215

Introduction

   During the pontificate of Innocent III (1198-1216) there appears to
   have occurred much growth in the reform of the church and in its
   freedom from subservience to the empire as well as in the primacy of
   the bishop of Rome and in the summoning of ecclesiastical business to
   the Roman curia. Innocent himself, turning his whole mind to the things
   of God, strove to build up the christian community. Spiritual things,
   and therefore the church, were to have first place in this endeavour;
   so that human affairs were to be dependent upon, and to draw their
   justification from, such considerations.
   The council may therefore be regarded as a great summary of the
   pontiff's work and also as his greatest initiative. He was not able,
   however, to bring it to completion since he died shortly afterwards
   (1216) . Christian disasters in the holy Land probably provided the
   occasion for Innocent to call the council. Thus the pontiff ordered a
   new crusade to be proclaimed. But he also used the crusade as an
   instrument of ecclesiastical administration, combined with reform of
   the church, namely in a fierce war against heretics which he thought
   would restore ecclesiastical society.
   The council was summoned on 19 April 1213 to meet in November 1215. All
   the bishops and abbots of the church as well as priors and even (which
   was new) chapters of churches and of religious orders -- namely
   Cistercians, Premonstratensians, Hospitallers and Templars -- and the
   kings and civil authorities throughout Europe were invited. The bishops
   were explicitly asked to propose topics for discussion at the council,
   something which does not seem to have happened at the preceding Lateran
   councils. This was done by the legates who had been dispatched
   throughout Europe to preach the crusade. In each province only one or
   two bishops were allowed to remain at home; all the rest were ordered
   to be present. The purposes of the council were clearly set forth by
   Innocent himself : "to eradicate vices and to plant virtues, to correct
   faults and to reform morals, to remove heresies and to strengthen
   faith, to settle discords and to establish peace, to get rid of
   oppression and to foster liberty, to induce princes and christian
   people to come to the aid and succour of the holy Land... ". It seems
   that when Innocent summoned the council he wished to observe the
   customs of the early ecumenical councils, and indeed this fourth
   Lateran council was regarded as an ecumenical council by all learned
   and religious men of the age.
   When the council began in the Lateran basilica in November 1215 there
   were present 404 bishops from throughout the western church, and from
   the Latin eastern church a large number of abbots, canons and
   representatives of the secular power. No Greeks were present, even
   those invited, except the patriarch of the Maronites and a legate of
   the patriarch of Alexandria. The bond with the Greek church was indeed
   neglected, and matters became more serious through the actions of Latin
   bishops living in the east or through the decrees of the council.
   The council began on 11 November with the pontiff's sermon. He was
   especially looking for a religious outcome to the council. Soon,
   however secular matters and power politics came to the fore. At the
   second session (on 20 November) the struggle for the empire between
   Frederick II and Otto IV was brought before the council and gave rise
   to a bitter and contentious debate. This affected the nature of the
   council in a way that had not been foreseen and revealed a certain
   ineffectiveness in Innocent's plans for governing the church. Finally,
   the third session (on 30 November) was devoted to reading and approving
   the constitutions, which were proposed by the pontiff himself. The last
   decree dealt with preparations for a crusade -- "Jesus Christ's
   business" -- and fixed 1 June 1217 for its start, though this was
   prevented by the pontiff's death.
   The seventy constitutions would seem to give proof of the council's
   excellent results. The work of Innocent appears clearly in them even
   though they were probably not directly composed by him. He regarded
   them as universal laws and as a summary of the jurisdiction of his
   pontificate. Few links with earlier councils survive, those with the
   third Lateran council being the only relevant ones of which we know.
   Thus,
     * the first constitution is regarded as a new profession of faith.
     * The second and third constitutions, which deal with heretics and
       contain dogmatic statements, are new.
     * The remainder, which deal with the reform of the church, appear for
       the most part to be new either in form or in content. They deal
       with
          + the church's discipline (6-13) ,
          + the reform of clerical morals (14-22) ,
          + episcopal elections and the administration of benefices
            (23-32) ,
          + exaction of taxes (33-34) ,
          + canonical suits (35-49) ,
          + matrimony (50-52) ,
          + tithes (53-61) ,
          + simony (63-66) , and
          + Jews (67-70) .

   The constitutions were first edited by Cr 2 (1538) CLXv-CLXXIIv, the
   text of which was used in Cr 2 (1551) 946-967, Su 3 (1567) 735-756, and
   Bn 3/2 (1606) 1450-1465. Roman editors produced a more accurate edition
   (Rm 4 [1612] 43-63) , collating the common text "with manuscript
   codices from the Vatican". Rm was followed by Bn 3/2 (1618) 682-696 and
   ER 28 (1644) 154-225. LC 11/1 (1671) 142-233 provided a text "in Greek
   and Latin..... from a Mazarin codex" (=M) with various readings from a
   d'Achery codex (=A) . The Greek translation, however, which LC had
   thought to be contemporary, does not provide a complete text and was
   taken from a later codex. LC was followed by Hrd 7 (1714) 15-78, Cl 13
   (1730) 927-1018, and Msi 22 (1778) 981-1068. There are many surviving
   manuscripts of the constitutions, as has been shown by Garcia, who is
   preparing a critical edition. That is to say, twenty manuscripts
   containing the constitutions and twelve others containing the
   constitutions together with commentaries; and probably there are others
   which are not yet known. The constitutions were taken into Compilatio
   IV, except 42 and [71], and into Decretalia of Gregory IX, except 42,
   49 and [71]. The present edition follows the Roman edition, but all the
   variant readings that have so far been brought to light by scholars
   have been cited with {n} referring to the endnotes.

CANONS

Canon 1. Confession of Faith

   We firmly believe and simply confess that there is only one true God,
   eternal and immeasurable, almighty, unchangeable, incomprehensible and
   ineffable, Father, Son and holy Spirit, three persons but one
   absolutely simple essence, substance or nature {1} . The Father is from
   none, the Son from the Father alone, and the holy Spirit from both
   equally, eternally without beginning or end; the Father generating, the
   Son being born, and the holy Spirit proceeding; consubstantial and
   coequal, co-omnipotent and coeternal; one principle of all things,
   creator of all things invisible and visible, spiritual and corporeal;
   who by his almighty power at the beginning of time created from nothing
   both spiritual and corporeal creatures, that is to say angelic and
   earthly, and then created human beings composed as it were of both
   spirit and body in common. The devil and other demons were created by
   God naturally good, but they became evil by their own doing. Man,
   however, sinned at the prompting of the devil.
   This holy Trinity, which is undivided according to its common essence
   but distinct according to the properties of its persons, gave the
   teaching of salvation to the human race through Moses and the holy
   prophets and his other servants, according to the most appropriate
   disposition of the times. Finally the only-begotten Son of God, Jesus
   Christ, who became incarnate by the action of the whole Trinity in
   common and was conceived from the ever virgin Mary through the
   cooperation of the holy Spirit, having become true man, composed of a
   rational soul and human flesh, one person in two natures, showed more
   clearly the way of life. Although he is immortal and unable to suffer
   according to his divinity, he was made capable of suffering and dying
   according to his humanity. Indeed, having suffered and died on the wood
   of the cross for the salvation of the human race, he descended to the
   underworld, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven. He descended
   in the soul, rose in the flesh, and ascended in both. He will come at
   the end of time to judge the living and the dead, to render to every
   person according to his works, both to the reprobate and to the elect.
   All of them will rise with their own bodies, which they now wear, so as
   to receive according to their deserts, whether these be good or bad;
   for the latter perpetual punishment with the devil, for the former
   eternal glory with Christ.
   There is indeed one universal church of the faithful, outside of which
   nobody at all is saved, in which Jesus Christ is both priest and
   sacrifice. His body and blood are truly contained in the sacrament of
   the altar under the forms of bread and wine, the bread and wine having
   been changed in substance, by God's power, into his body and blood, so
   that in order to achieve this mystery of unity we receive from God what
   he received from us. Nobody can effect this sacrament except a priest
   who has been properly ordained according to the church's keys, which
   Jesus Christ himself gave to the apostles and their successors. But the
   sacrament of baptism is consecrated in water at the invocation of the
   undivided Trinity -- namely Father, Son and holy Spirit -- and brings
   salvation to both children and adults when it is correctly carried out
   by anyone in the form laid down by the church. If someone falls into
   sin after having received baptism, he or she can always be restored
   through true penitence. For not only virgins and the continent but also
   married persons find favour with God by right faith and good actions
   and deserve to attain to eternal blessedness.

Canon 2.

   On the error of abbot Joachim
   We therefore condemn and reprove that small book or treatise which
   abbot Joachim published against master Peter Lombard concerning the
   unity or essence of the Trinity, in which he calls Peter Lombard a
   heretic and a madman because he said in his Sentences, "For there is a
   certain supreme reality which is the Father and the Son and the holy
   Spirit, and it neither begets nor is begotten nor does it proceed". He
   asserts from this that Peter Lombard ascribes to God not so much a
   Trinity as a quaternity, that is to say three persons and a common
   essence as if this were a fourth person. Abbot Joachim clearly protests
   that there does not exist any reality which is the Father and the Son
   and the holy Spirit-neither an essence nor a substance nor a nature --
   although he concedes that the Father and the Son and the holy Spirit
   are one essence, one substance and one nature. He professes, however,
   that such a unity is not true and proper but rather collective and
   analogous, in the way that many persons are said to be one people and
   many faithful one church, according to that saying : Of the multitude
   of believers there was one heart and one mind, and Whoever adheres to
   God is one spirit with him; again He who plants and he who waters are
   one, and all of us are one body in Christ; and again in the book of
   Kings, My people and your people are one. In support of this opinion he
   especially uses the saying which Christ uttered in the gospel
   concerning the faithful : I wish, Father, that they may be one in us,
   just as we are one, so that they may be made perfect in one. For, he
   says, Christ's faithful are not one in the sense of a single reality
   which is common to all. They are one only in this sense, that they form
   one church through the unity of the catholic faith, and finally one
   kingdom through a union of indissoluble charity. Thus we read in the
   canonical letter of John : For there are three that bear witness in
   heaven, the Father and the Word and the holy Spirit, and these three
   are one; and he immediately adds, And the three that bear witness on
   earth are the spirit, water and blood, and the three are one, according
   to some manuscripts.
   We, however, with the approval of this sacred and universal council,
   believe and confess with Peter Lombard that there exists a certain
   supreme reality, incomprehensible and ineffable, which truly is the
   Father and the Son and the holy Spirit, the three persons together and
   each one of them separately. Therefore in God there is only a Trinity,
   not a quaternity, since each of the three persons is that reality --
   that is to say substance, essence or divine nature-which alone is the
   principle of all things, besides which no other principle can be found.
   This reality neither begets nor is begotten nor proceeds; the Father
   begets, the Son is begotten and the holy Spirit proceeds. Thus there is
   a distinction of persons but a unity of nature. Although therefore the
   Father is one person, the Son another person and the holy Spirit
   another person, they are not different realities, but rather that which
   is the Father is the Son and the holy Spirit, altogether the same; thus
   according to the orthodox and catholic faith they are believed to be
   consubstantial. For the Father, in begetting the Son from eternity,
   gave him his substance, as he himself testifies : What the Father gave
   me is greater than all. It cannot be said that the Father gave him part
   of his substance and kept part for himself since the Father's substance
   is indivisible, inasmuch as it is altogether simple. Nor can it be said
   that the Father transferred his substance to the Son, in the act of
   begetting, as if he gave it to the Son in such a way that he did not
   retain it for himself; for otherwise he would have ceased to be
   substance. It is therefore clear that in being begotten the Son
   received the Father's substance without it being diminished in any way,
   and thus the Father and the Son have the same substance. Thus the
   Father and the Son and also the holy Spirit proceeding from both are
   the same reality.
   When, therefore, the Truth prays to the Father for those faithful to
   him, saying I wish that they may be one in us just as we are one, this
   word one means for the faithful a union of love in grace, and for the
   divine persons a unity of identity in nature, as the Truth says
   elsewhere, You must be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect {2} ,
   as if he were to say more plainly, You must be perfect in the
   perfection of grace, just as your Father is perfect in the perfection
   that is his by nature, each in his own way. For between creator and
   creature there can be noted no similarity so great that a greater
   dissimilarity cannot be seen between them. If anyone therefore ventures
   to defend or approve the opinion or doctrine of the aforesaid Joachim
   on this matter, let him be refuted by all as a heretic. By this,
   however, we do not intend anything to the detriment of the monastery of
   Fiore, which Joachim founded, because there both the instruction is
   according to rule and the observance is healthy; especially since
   Joachim ordered all his writings to be handed over to us, to be
   approved or corrected according to the judgment of the apostolic see.
   He dictated a letter, which he signed with his own hand, in which he
   firmly confesses that he holds the faith held by the Roman church,
   which is by God's plan the mother and mistress of all the faithful.
   We also reject and condemn that most perverse doctrine of the impious
   Amalric, whose mind the father of lies blinded to such an extent that
   his teaching is to be regarded as mad more than as heretical.

Canon 3.

   On Heretics
   We excommunicate and anathematize every heresy raising itself up
   against this holy, orthodox and catholic faith which we have expounded
   above. We condemn all heretics, whatever names they may go under. They
   have different faces indeed but their tails are tied together inasmuch
   as they are alike in their pride. Let those condemned be handed over to
   the secular authorities present, or to their bailiffs, for due
   punishment. Clerics are first to be degraded from their orders. The
   goods of the condemned are to be confiscated, if they are lay persons,
   and if clerics they are to be applied to the churches from which they
   received their stipends. Those who are only found suspect of heresy are
   to be struck with the sword of anathema, unless they prove their
   innocence by an appropriate purgation, having regard to the reasons for
   suspicion and the character of the person. Let such persons be avoided
   by all until they have made adequate satisfaction. If they persist in
   the excommunication for a year, they are to be condemned as heretics.
   Let secular authorities, whatever offices they may be discharging, be
   advised and urged and if necessary be compelled by ecclesiastical
   censure, if they wish to be reputed and held to be faithful, to take
   publicly an oath for the defence of the faith to the effect that they
   will seek, in so far as they can, to expel from the lands subject to
   their jurisdiction all heretics designated by the church in good faith.
   Thus whenever anyone is promoted to spiritual or temporal authority, he
   shall be obliged to confirm this article with an oath. If however a
   temporal lord, required and instructed by the church, neglects to
   cleanse his territory of this heretical filth, he shall be bound with
   the bond of excommunication by the metropolitan and other bishops of
   the province. If he refuses to give satisfaction within a year, this
   shall be reported to the supreme pontiff so that he may then declare
   his vassals absolved from their fealty to him and make the land
   available for occupation by Catholics so that these may, after they
   have expelled the heretics, possess it unopposed and preserve it in the
   purity of the faith -- saving the right of the suzerain provided that
   he makes no difficulty in the matter and puts no impediment in the way.
   The same law is to be observed no less as regards those who do not have
   a suzerain.
   Catholics who take the cross and gird themselves up for the expulsion
   of heretics shall enjoy the same indulgence, and be strengthened by the
   same holy privilege, as is granted to those who go to the aid of the
   holy Land. Moreover, we determine to subject to excommunication
   believers who receive, defend or support heretics. We strictly ordain
   that if any such person, after he has been designated as
   excommunicated, refuses to render satisfaction within a year, then by
   the law itself he shall be branded as infamous and not be admitted to
   public offices or councils or to elect others to the same or to give
   testimony. He shall be intestable, that is he shall not have the
   freedom to make a will nor shall succeed to an inheritance. Moreover
   nobody shall be compelled to answer to him on any business whatever,
   but he may be compelled to answer to them. If he is a judge sentences
   pronounced by him shall have no force and cases may not be brought
   before him; if an advocate, he may not be allowed to defend anyone; if
   a notary, documents drawn up by him shall be worthless and condemned
   along with their condemned author; and in similar matters we order the
   same to be observed. If however he is a cleric, let him be deposed from
   every office and benefice, so that the greater the fault the greater be
   the punishment. If any refuse to avoid such persons after they have
   been pointed out by the church, let them be punished with the sentence
   of excommunication until they make suitable satisfaction. Clerics
   should not, of course, give the sacraments of the church to such
   pestilent people nor give them a christian burial nor accept alms or
   offerings from them; if they do, let them be deprived of their office
   and not restored to it without a special indult of the apostolic see.
   Similarly with regulars, let them be punished with losing their
   privileges in the diocese in which they presume to commit such
   excesses.
   "There are some who holding to the form of religion but denying its
   power (as the Apostle says) , claim for themselves the authority to
   preach, whereas the same Apostle says, How shall they preach unless
   they are sent? Let therefore all those who have been forbidden or not
   sent to preach, and yet dare publicly or privately to usurp the office
   of preaching without having received the authority of the apostolic see
   or the catholic bishop of the place", be bound with the bond of
   excommunication and, unless they repent very quickly, be punished by
   another suitable penalty. We add further that each archbishop or
   bishop, either in person or through his archdeacon or through suitable
   honest persons, should visit twice or at least once in the year any
   parish of his in which heretics are said to live. There he should
   compel three or more men of good repute, or even if it seems expedient
   the whole neighbourhood, to swear that if anyone knows of heretics
   there or of any persons who hold secret conventicles or who differ in
   their life and habits from the normal way of living of the faithful,
   then he will take care to point them out to the bishop. The bishop
   himself should summon the accused to his presence, and they should be
   punished canonically if they are unable to clear themselves of the
   charge or if after compurgation they relapse into their former errors
   of faith. If however any of them with damnable obstinacy refuse to
   honour an oath and so will not take it, let them by this very fact be
   regarded as heretics. We therefore will and command and, in virtue of
   obedience, strictly command that bishops see carefully to the effective
   execution of these things throughout their dioceses, if they wish to
   avoid canonical penalties. If any bishop is negligent or remiss in
   cleansing his diocese of the ferment of heresy, then when this shows
   itself by unmistakeable signs he shall be deposed from his office as
   bishop and there shall be put in his place a suitable person who both
   wishes and is able to overthrow the evil of heresy.

Canon 4.

   On the pride of the Greeks towards the Latins
   Although we would wish to cherish and honour the Greeks who in our days
   are returning to the obedience of the apostolic see, by preserving
   their customs and rites as much as we can in the Lord, nevertheless we
   neither want nor ought to defer to them in matters which bring danger
   to souls and detract from the church's honour. For, after the Greek
   church together with certain associates and supporters withdrew from
   the obedience of the apostolic see, the Greeks began to detest the
   Latins so much that, among other wicked things which they committed out
   of contempt for them, when Latin priests celebrated on their altars
   they would not offer sacrifice on them until they had washed them, as
   if the altars had been defiled thereby. The Greeks even had the
   temerity to rebaptize those baptized by the Latins; and some, as we are
   told, still do not fear to do this. Wishing therefore to remove such a
   great scandal from God's church, we strictly order, on the advice of
   this sacred council, that henceforth they do not presume to do such
   things but rather conform themselves like obedient sons to the holy
   Roman church, their mother, so that there may be one flock and one
   shepherd. If anyone however does dare to do such a thing, let him be
   struck with the sword of excommunication and be deprived of every
   ecclesiastical office and benefice.

Canon 5.

   The dignity of the patriarchal sees
   Renewing the ancient privileges of the patriarchal sees, we decree,
   with the approval of this sacred universal synod, that after the Roman
   church, which through the Lord's disposition has a primacy of ordinary
   power over all other churches inasmuch as it is the mother and mistress
   of all Christ's faithful, the church of Constantinople shall have the
   first place, the church of Alexandria the second place, the church of
   Antioch the third place, and the church of Jerusalem the fourth place,
   each maintaining its own rank. Thus after their pontiffs have received
   from the Roman pontiff the pallium, which is the sign of the fullness
   of the pontifical office, and have taken an oath of fidelity and
   obedience to him they may lawfully confer the pallium on their own
   suffragans, receiving from them for themselves canonical profession and
   for the Roman church the promise of obedience. They may have a standard
   of the Lord's cross carried before them anywhere except in the city of
   Rome or wherever there is present the supreme pontiff or his legate
   wearing the insignia of the apostolic dignity. In all the provinces
   subject to their jurisdiction let appeal be made to them, when it is
   necessary, except for appeals made to the apostolic see, to which all
   must humbly defer.

Canon 6.

   On yearly provincial councils
   As is known to have been ordained of old by the holy fathers,
   metropolitans should not fail to hold provincial councils each year
   with their suffragans in which they consider diligently and in the fear
   of God the correction of excesses and the reform of morals, especially
   among the clergy. Let them recite the canonical rules, especially those
   which have been laid down by this general council, so as to secure
   their observance, inflicting on transgressors the punishment due. In
   order that this may be done more effectively, let them appoint for each
   diocese suitable persons, that is to say prudent and honest persons,
   who will simply and summarily, without any jurisdiction, throughout the
   whole year, carefully investigate what needs correction or reform and
   will then faithfully report these matters to the metropolitan and
   suffragans and others at the next council, so that they may proceed
   with careful deliberation against these and other matters according to
   what is profitable and decent. Let them see to the observance of the
   things that they decree, publishing them in episcopal synods which are
   to be held annually in each diocese. Whoever neglects to carry out this
   salutary statute is to be suspended from his benefices and from the
   execution of his office, until his superior decides to release him.

Canon 7.

   The correction of offences and the reform of morals
   By this inviolable constitution we decree that prelates of churches
   should prudently and diligently attend to the correction of their
   subjects' offences especially of clerics, and to the reform of morals.
   Otherwise the blood of such persons will be required at their hands. In
   order that they may be able to exercise freely this office of
   correction and reform, we decree that no custom or appeal can impede
   the execution of their decisions, unless they go beyond the form which
   is to be observed in such matters. The offences of canons of a
   cathedral church, however, which have customarily been corrected by the
   chapter, are to be corrected by the chapter in those churches which
   until now have had this custom, at the instance and on the orders of
   the bishop and within a suitable time-limit which the bishop will
   decide. If this is not done, then the bishop, mindful of God and
   putting an end to all opposition, is to go ahead with correcting the
   persons by ecclesiastical censure according as the care of souls
   requires, and he shall not omit to correct their other faults according
   as the good of souls requires, with due order however being observed in
   all things {3} . For the rest, if the canons stop celebrating divine
   services without manifest and reasonable cause, especially if this is
   in contempt of the bishop, then the bishop himself may celebrate in the
   cathedral church if he wishes, and on complaint from him, the
   metropolitan, as our delegate in the matter, may, when he has learned
   the truth, punish the persons concerned in such fashion that for fear
   of punishment they shall not venture such action in the future. Let
   prelates of churches therefore carefully see that they do not turn this
   salutary statute into a form of financial gain or other exaction, but
   rather let them carry it out assiduously and faithfully, if they wish
   to avoid canonical punishment, since in these matters the apostolic
   see, directed by the Lord, will be very vigilant.

Canon 8.

   On inquests
   "How and in what way a prelate ought to proceed to inquire into and
   punish the offences of his subjects may be clearly ascertained from the
   authorities of the new and old Testament, from which subsequent
   sanctions in canon law derive", as we said distinctly some time ago and
   now confirm with the approval of this holy council.
   "For we read in the gospel that the steward who was denounced to his
   lord for wasting his goods heard him say : What is this that I hear
   about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer
   be my steward. And in Genesis the Lord says : I will go down and see
   whether they have done altogether according to the outcry which has
   come to me. From these authorities it is clearly shown that not only
   when a subject has committed some excess but also when a prelate has
   done so, and the matter reaches the ears of the superior through an
   outcry or rumour which has come not from the malevolent and slanderous
   but from prudent and honest persons, and has come not only once but
   frequently (as the outcry suggests and the rumour proves) , then the
   superior ought diligently to seek out the truth before senior persons
   of the church. If the seriousness of the matter demands, then the fault
   of the offender should be subjected to canonical punishment. However,
   the superior should carry out the duty of his office not as if he were
   the accuser and the judge but rather with the rumour providing the
   accusation and the outcry making the denunciation. While this should be
   observed in the case of subjects, all the more carefully should it be
   observed in the case of prelates, who are set as a mark for the arrow.
   Prelates cannot please everyone since they are bound by their office
   not only to convince but also to rebuke and sometimes even to suspend
   and to bind. Thus they frequently incur the hatred of many people and
   risk ambushes. Therefore the holy fathers have wisely decreed that
   accusations against prelates should not be admitted readily, without
   careful provision being taken to shut the door not only to false but
   also to malicious accusations, lest with the columns being shaken the
   building itself collapses. They thus wished to ensure that prelates are
   not accused unjustly, and yet that at the same time they take care not
   to sin in an arrogant manner, finding a suitable medicine for each
   disease : namely, a criminal accusation which entails loss of status,
   that is to say degradation, shall in no wise be allowed unless it is
   preceded by a charge in lawful form. But when someone is so notorious
   for his offences that an outcry goes up which can no longer be ignored
   without scandal or be tolerated without danger, then without the
   slightest hesitation let action be taken to inquire into and punish his
   offences, not out of hate but rather out of charity. If the offence is
   grave, even though not involving his degradation, let him be removed
   from all administration, in accordance with the saying of the gospel
   that the steward is to be removed from his stewardship if he cannot
   give a proper account of it".
   The person about whom the inquiry is being made ought to be present,
   unless he absents himself out of contumacy. The articles of the inquiry
   should be shown to him so that he may be able to defend himself. The
   names of witnesses as well as their depositions are to be made known to
   him so that both what has been said and by whom will be apparent; and
   legitimate exceptions and responses are to be admitted, lest the
   suppression of names leads to the bold bringing false charges and the
   exclusion of exceptions leads to false depositions being made. A
   prelate should therefore act the more diligently in correcting the
   offences of his subjects in proportion as he would be worthy of
   condemnation were he to leave them uncorrected. Notorious cases aside,
   he may proceed against them in three ways : namely, by accusation,
   denunciation and inquest. Let careful precaution nevertheless be taken
   in all cases lest serious loss is incurred for the sake of a small
   gain. Thus, just as a charge in lawful form ought to precede the
   accusation, so a charitable warning ought to precede the denunciation,
   and the publication of the charge ought to precede the inquest, with
   the principle always being observed that the form of the sentence shall
   accord with the rules of legal procedure. We do not think, however,
   that this order needs to be observed in all respects as regards
   regulars, who can be more easily and freely removed from their offices
   by their own superiors, when the case requires it.

Canon 9.

   On different rites within the same faith
   Since in many places peoples of different languages live within the
   same city or diocese, having one faith but different rites and customs,
   we therefore strictly order bishops of such cities and dioceses to
   provide suitable men who will do the following in the various rites and
   languages : celebrate the divine services for them, administer the
   church's sacraments, and instruct them by word and example. We
   altogether forbid one and the same city or diocese to have more than
   one bishop, as if it were a body with several heads like a monster. But
   if for the aforesaid reasons urgent necessity demands it, the bishop of
   the place may appoint, after careful deliberation, a catholic bishop
   who is appropriate for the nations in question and who will be his
   vicar in the aforesaid matters and will be obedient and subject to him
   in all things. If any such person behaves otherwise, let him know that
   he has been struck by the sword of excommunication and if he does not
   return to his senses let him be deposed from every ministry in the
   church, with the secular arm being called in if necessary to quell such
   great insolence.

Canon 10.

   On appointing preachers
   Among the various things that are conducive to the salvation of the
   christian people, the nourishment of God's word is recognized to be
   especially necessary, since just as the body is fed with material food
   so the soul is fed with spiritual food, according to the words, man
   lives not by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth
   of God. It often happens that bishops by themselves are not sufficient
   to minister the word of God to the people, especially in large and
   scattered dioceses, whether this is because of their many occupations
   or bodily infirmities or because of incursions of the enemy or for
   other reasons-let us not say for lack of knowledge, which in bishops is
   to be altogether condemned and is not to be tolerated in the future. We
   therefore decree by this general constitution that bishops are to
   appoint suitable men to carry out with profit this duty of sacred
   preaching, men who are powerful in word and deed and who will visit
   with care the peoples entrusted to them in place of the bishops, since
   these by themselves are unable to do it, and will build them up by word
   and example. The bishops shall suitably furnish them with what is
   necessary, when they are in need of it, lest for want of necessities
   they are forced to abandon what they have begun. We therefore order
   that there be appointed in both cathedral and other conventual churches
   suitable men whom the bishops can have as coadjutors and cooperators
   not only in the office of preaching but also in hearing confessions and
   enjoining penances and in other matters which are conducive to the
   salvation of souls. If anyone neglects to do this, let him be subject
   to severe punishment.

Canon 11.

   On schoolmasters for the poor
   Zeal for learning and the opportunity to make progress is denied to
   some through lack of means. The Lateran council therefore dutifully
   decreed that "in each cathedral church there should be provided a
   suitable benefice for a master who shall instruct without charge the
   clerics of the cathedral church and other poor scholars, thus at once
   satisfying the teacher's needs and opening up the way of knowledge to
   learners". This decree, however, is very little observed in many
   churches. We therefore confirm it and add that not only in every
   cathedral church but also in other churches with sufficient resources,
   a suitable master elected by the chapter or by the greater and sounder
   part of it, shall be appointed by the prelate to teach grammar and
   other branches of study, as far as is possible, to the clerics of those
   and other churches. The metropolitan church shall have a theologian to
   teach scripture to priests and others and especially to instruct them
   in matters which are recognized as pertaining to the cure of souls. The
   income of one prebend shall be assigned by the chapter to each master,
   and as much shall be assigned by the metropolitan to the theologian.
   The incumbent does not by this become a canon but he receives the
   income of one as long as he continues to teach. If the metropolitan
   church finds providing for two masters a burden, let it provide for the
   theologian in the aforesaid way but get adequate provision made for the
   grammarian in another church of the city or diocese.

Canon 12.

   On general chapters of monks
   In every kingdom or province let there be held every three years,
   saving the right of diocesan bishops, a general chapter of those
   abbots, and priors who do not have abbots over them, who have not been
   accustomed to hold one. All should attend, unless they have a canonical
   impediment, at one of the monasteries which is suitable for the
   purpose; with this limitation, that none of them brings with him more
   than six mounts and eight persons. Let them invite in charity, at the
   start of this innovation, two neighbouring Cistercian abbots to give
   them appropriate advice and help, since from long practice the
   Cistercians are well informed about holding such chapters. The two
   abbots shall then coopt without opposition two suitable persons from
   among them. The four of them shall then preside over the whole chapter,
   in such a way however that none of them assumes the leadership; so that
   they can if necessary be changed after careful deliberation. This kind
   of chapter shall be held continuously over a certain number of days,
   according to Cistercian custom. They shall treat carefully of the
   reform of the order and the observance of the rule. What has been
   decided, with the approval of the four presiding, is to be observed
   inviolably by all without any excuse or contradiction or appeal. They
   shall also decide where the next chapter is to be held. Those attending
   shall lead a common life and divide out proportionately all the common
   expenses. If they cannot all live in the same house, let them at least
   live in groups in various houses.
   Let religious and circumspect persons be appointed at the chapter who
   will make it their business to visit on our behalf all the abbeys of
   the kingdom or province, of both monks and nuns, according to the
   manner prescribed for them. Let them correct and reform what seems to
   need correction and reform. Thus if they know of the superior of a
   place who should certainly be removed from office, let them denounce
   the person to the bishop concerned so that he may see to his or her
   removal. If the bishop will not do this, let the visitors themselves
   refer the matter to the apostolic see for examination. We wish and
   command canons regular to observe this according to their order. If
   there emerges out of this innovation any difficulty that cannot be
   resolved by the aforesaid persons, let it be referred, without offence
   being given, to the judgment of the apostolic see; but let the other
   matters, about which after careful deliberation they were in agreement,
   be observed without breach. Diocesan bishops, moreover, should take
   care to reform the monasteries under their jurisdiction, so that when
   the aforesaid visitors arrive they will find in them more to commend
   than to correct. Let them be very careful lest the said monasteries are
   weighed down by them with unjust burdens, for just as we wish the
   rights of superiors to be upheld so we do not wish to support wrongs
   done to subjects. Furthermore, we strictly command both diocesan
   bishops and those who preside at chapters to restrain by ecclesiastical
   censure, without appeal, advocates, patrons, lords' deputies,
   governors, officials, magnates, knights, and any other people, from
   daring to cause harm to monasteries in respect of their persons and
   their goods. Let them not fail to compel such persons, if by chance
   they do cause harm, to make satisfaction, so that almighty God may be
   served more freely and more peacefully.

Canon 13.

   A prohibition against new religious orders
   Lest too great a variety of religious orders leads to grave confusion
   in God's church, we strictly forbid anyone henceforth to found a new
   religious order. Whoever wants to become a religious should enter one
   of the already approved orders. Likewise, whoever wishes to found a new
   religious house should take the rule and institutes from already
   approved religious orders. We forbid, moreover, anyone to attempt to
   have a place as a monk in more than one monastery or an abbot to
   preside over more than one monastery.

Canon 14.

   Clerical incontinence
   In order that the morals and conduct of clerics may be reformed for the
   better, let all of them strive to live in a continent and chaste way,
   especially those in holy orders. Let them beware of every vice
   involving lust, especially that on account of which the wrath of God
   came down from heaven upon the sons of disobedience, so that they may
   be worthy to minister in the sight of almighty God with a pure heart
   and an unsullied body. Lest the ease of receiving pardon prove an
   incentive to sin, we decree that those who are caught giving way to the
   vice of incontinence are to be punished according to canonical
   sanctions, in proportion to the seriousness of their sins. We order
   such sanctions to be effectively and strictly observed, in order that
   those whom the fear of God does not hold back from evil may at least be
   restrained from sin by temporal punishment. Therefore anyone who has
   been suspended for this reason and presumes to celebrate divine
   services, shall not only be deprived of his ecclesiastical benefices
   but shall also, on account of his twofold fault, be deposed in
   perpetuity. Prelates who dare to support such persons in their
   wickedness, especially if they do it for money or for some other
   temporal advantage, are to be subject to like punishment. Those clerics
   who have not renounced the marriage bond, following the custom of their
   region, shall be punished even more severely if they fall into sin,
   since for them it is possible to make lawful use of matrimony.

Canon 15.

   Clerical gluttony and drunkeness
   All clerics should carefully abstain from gluttony and drunkenness.
   They should temper the wine to themselves and themselves to the wine.
   Let no one be urged to drink, since drunkenness obscures the intellect
   and stirs up lust. Accordingly we decree that that abuse is to be
   entirely abolished whereby in some places drinkers bind themselves to
   drink equal amounts, and that man is most praised who makes the most
   people drunk and himself drains the deepest cups. If anyone shows
   himself worthy of blame in these matters, let him be suspended from his
   benefice or office, unless after being warned by his superior he makes
   suitable satisfaction. We forbid all clerics to hunt or to fowl, so let
   them not presume to have dogs or birds for fowling {4} .

Canon 16.

   Decorum in the dress and behaviour of clerics
   Clerics should not practice callings or business of a secular nature,
   especially those that are dishonourable. They should not watch mimes,
   entertainers and actors. Let them avoid taverns altogether, unless by
   chance they are obliged by necessity on a journey. They should not play
   at games of chance or of dice, nor be present at such games. They
   should have a suitable crown and tonsure, and let them diligently apply
   themselves to the divine services and other good pursuits. Their outer
   garments should be closed and neither too short nor too long. Let them
   not indulge in red or green cloths, long sleeves or shoes with
   embroidery or pointed toes, or in bridles, saddles, breast-plates and
   spurs that are gilded or have other superfluous ornamentation. Let them
   not wear cloaks with sleeves at divine services in a church, nor even
   elsewhere, if they are priests or parsons, unless a justifiable fear
   requires a change of dress. They are not to wear buckles or belts
   ornamented with gold or silver, or even rings except for those whose
   dignity it befits to have them. All bishops should wear outer garments
   of linen in public and in church, unless they have been monks, in which
   case they should wear the monastic habit; and let them not wear their
   cloaks loose in public but rather fastened together behind the neck or
   across the chest.

Canon 17.

   Dissolute prelates
   We regretfully relate that not only certain lesser clerics but also
   some prelates of churches pass almost half the night in unnecessary
   feasting and forbidden conversation, not to mention other things, and
   leaving what is left of the night for sleep, they are barely roused at
   the dawn chorus of the birds and pass away the entire morning in a
   continuous state of stupor. There are others who celebrate mass barely
   four times a year and, what is worse, do not bother to attend; if they
   happen to be present when it is being celebrated, they flee the silence
   of the choir and pay attention to conversations of the laity outside
   and so while they attend to talk that is unnecessary for them, they do
   not give an attentive ear to the things of God. We altogether forbid
   these and similar things on pain of suspension. We strictly command
   such persons, in virtue of obedience, to celebrate the divine office,
   day and night alike, as far as God allows them, with both zeal and
   devotion.

Canon 18.

   Clerics to dissociate from shedding-blood
   No cleric may decree or pronounce a sentence involving the shedding of
   blood, or carry out a punishment involving the same, or be present when
   such punishment is carried out. If anyone, however, under cover of this
   statute, dares to inflict injury on churches or ecclesiastical persons,
   let him be restrained by ecclesiastical censure. A cleric may not write
   or dictate letters which require punishments involving the shedding of
   blood, in the courts of princes this responsibility should be entrusted
   to laymen and not to clerics. Moreover no cleric may be put in command
   of mercenaries or crossbowmen or suchlike men of blood; nor may a
   subdeacon, deacon or priest practise the art of surgery, which involves
   cauterizing and making incisions; nor may anyone confer a rite of
   blessing or consecration on a purgation by ordeal of boiling or cold
   water or of the red-hot iron, saving nevertheless the previously
   promulgated prohibitions regarding single combats and duels.

Canon 19.

   That profane objects may not be stored in churches
   We are unwilling to tolerate the fact that certain clerics deposit in
   churches their own and even others' furniture, so that the churches
   look like lay houses rather than basilicas of God, regardless of the
   fact that the Lord would not allow a vessel to be carried through the
   temple. There are others who not only leave their churches uncared for
   but also leave the service vessels and ministers' vestments and altar
   cloths and even corporals so dirty that they at times horrify some
   people. Because zeal for God's house consumes us, we strictly forbid
   objects of this kind to be allowed into churches, unless they have to
   be taken in on account of enemy incursions or sudden fires or other
   urgent necessities, and then in such a way that when the emergency is
   over the objects are taken back to where they came from. We also order
   the aforesaid churches, vessels, corporals and vestments to be kept
   neat and clean. For it seems too absurd to take no notice of squalor in
   sacred things when it is unbecoming even in profane things.

Canon 20.

   Chrism and the Eucharist to be kept under lock and key
   We decree that the chrism and the eucharist are to be kept locked away
   in a safe place in all churches, so that no audacious hand can reach
   them to do anything horrible or impious. If he who is responsible for
   their safe-keeping leaves them around carelessly, let him be suspended
   from office for three months; if anything unspeakable happens on
   account of his carelessness, let him be subject to graver punishment.

Canon 21.

   On yearly confession to one's own priest, yearly communion, the
   confessional seal
   All the faithful of either sex, after they have reached the age of
   discernment, should individually confess all their sins in a faithful
   manner to their own priest at least once a year, and let them take care
   to do what they can to perform the penance imposed on them. Let them
   reverently receive the sacrament of the eucharist at least at Easter
   unless they think, for a good reason and on the advice of their own
   priest, that they should abstain from receiving it for a time.
   Otherwise they shall be barred from entering a church during their
   lifetime and they shall be denied a christian burial at death. Let this
   salutary decree be frequently published in churches, so that nobody may
   find the pretence of an excuse in the blindness of ignorance. If any
   persons wish, for good reasons, to confess their sins to another priest
   let them first ask and obtain the permission of their own priest; for
   otherwise the other priest will not have the power to absolve or to
   bind them. The priest shall be discerning and prudent, so that like a
   skilled doctor he may pour wine and oil over the wounds of the injured
   one. Let him carefully inquire about the circumstances of both the
   sinner and the sin, so that he may prudently discern what sort of
   advice he ought to give and what remedy to apply, using various means
   to heal the sick person. Let him take the utmost care, however, not to
   betray the sinner at all by word or sign or in any other way. If the
   priest needs wise advice, let him seek it cautiously without any
   mention of the person concerned. For if anyone presumes to reveal a sin
   disclosed to him in confession, we decree that he is not only to be
   deposed from his priestly office but also to be confined to a strict
   monastery to do perpetual penance.

Canon 22.

   Physicians of the body to advise patients to call physicians of the
   soul
   As sickness of the body may sometimes be the result of sin -- as the
   Lord said to the sick man whom he had cured, Go and sin no more, lest
   something worse befall you -- so we by this present decree order and
   strictly command physicians of the body, when they are called to the
   sick, to warn and persuade them first of all to call in physicians of
   the soul so that after their spiritual health has been seen to they may
   respond better to medicine for their bodies, for when the cause ceases
   so does the effect. This among other things has occasioned this decree,
   namely that some people on their sickbed, when they are advised by
   physicians to arrange for the health of their souls, fall into despair
   and so the more readily incur the danger of death. If any physician
   transgresses this our constitution, after it has been published by the
   local prelates, he shall be barred from entering a church until he has
   made suitable satisfaction for a transgression of this kind. Moreover,
   since the soul is much more precious than the body, we forbid any
   physician, under pain of anathema, to prescribe anything for the bodily
   health of a sick person that may endanger his soul.

Canon 23.

   Churches are to be without a prelate for no more than 3 months
   Lest a rapacious wolf attack the Lord's flock for want of a shepherd,
   or lest a widowed church suffer grave injury to its good, we decree,
   desiring to counteract the danger to souls in this matter and to
   provide protection for the churches, that a cathedral church or a
   church of the regular clergy is not to remain without a prelate for
   more than three months. If the election has not been held within this
   time, provided there is no just impediment, then those who ought to
   have made the election are to lose the power to elect for that time and
   it is to devolve upon the person who is recognized as the immediate
   superior. The person upon whom the power has devolved, mindful of the
   Lord, shall not delay beyond three months in canonically providing the
   widowed church, with the advice of his chapter and of other prudent
   men, with a suitable person from the same church, or from another if a
   worthy candidate cannot be found in the former, if he wishes to avoid
   canonical penalty.

Canon 24.

   Democratic election of pastors
   On account of the various forms of elections which some try to invent,
   there arise many difficulties and great dangers for the bereaved
   churches. We therefore decree that at the holding of an election, when
   all are present who ought to, want to and conveniently can take part,
   three trustworthy persons shall be chosen from the college who will
   diligently find out, in confidence and individually, the opinions of
   everybody. After they have committed the result to writing, they shall
   together quickly announce it. There shall be no further appeal, so that
   after a scrutiny that person shall be elected upon whom all or the
   greater or sounder part of the chapter agree. Or else the power of
   electing shall be committed to some suitable persons who, acting on
   behalf of everybody, shall provide the bereaved church with a pastor.
   Otherwise the election made shall not be valid, unless perchance it was
   made by all together as if by divine inspiration and without flaw.
   Those who attempt to make an election contrary to the aforesaid forms
   shall be deprived of the power of electing on that occasion. We
   absolutely forbid anyone to appoint a proxy in the matter of an
   election, unless he is absent from the place where he ought to receive
   the summons and is detained from coming by a lawful impediment. He
   shall take an oath about this, if necessary, and then he may commit his
   representation to one of the college, if he so wishes. We also condemn
   clandestine elections and order that as soon as an election has taken
   place it should be solemnly published.

Canon 25.

   Invalid elections
   Whoever presumes to consent to his being elected through abuse of the
   secular power, against canonical freedom, both forfeits the benefit of
   being elected and becomes ineligible, and he cannot be elected to any
   dignity without a dispensation. Those who venture to take part in
   elections of this kind, which we declare to be invalid by the law
   itself, shall be suspended from their offices and benefices for three
   years and during that time shall be deprived of the power to elect.

Canon 26.

   Nominees for prelatures to be carefully screened
   There is nothing more harmful to God's church than for unworthy
   prelates to be entrusted with the government of souls. Wishing
   therefore to provide the necessary remedy for this disease, we decree
   by this irrevocable constitution that when anyone has been entrusted
   with the government of souls, then he who holds the right to confirm
   him should diligently examine both the process of the election and the
   character of the person elected, so that when everything is in order he
   may confirm him. For, if confirmation was granted in advance when
   everything was not in order, then not only would the person improperly
   promoted have to be rejected but also the author of the improper
   promotion would have to be punished. We decree that the latter shall be
   punished in the following way : if his negligence has been proved,
   especially if he has approved a man of insufficient learning or
   dishonest life or unlawful age, he shall not only lose the power of
   confirming the person's first successor but shall also, lest by any
   chance he escapes punishment, be suspended from receiving the fruits of
   his own benefice until it is right for him to be granted a pardon. If
   he is convicted of having erred intentionally in the matter, then he is
   to be subject to graver punishment. Bishops too, if they wish to avoid
   canonical punishment, should take care to promote to holy orders and to
   ecclesiastical dignities men who will be able to discharge worthily the
   office entrusted to them. Those who are immediately subject to the
   Roman pontiff shall, to obtain confirmation of their office, present
   themselves personally to him, if this can conveniently be done, or send
   suitable persons through whom a careful inquiry can be made about the
   process of the election and the persons elected. In this way, on the
   strength of the pontiff's informed judgment, they may finally enter
   into the fullness of their office, when there is no impediment in canon
   law. For a time, however, those who are in very distant parts, namely
   outside Italy, if they were elected peaceably, may by dispensation, on
   account of the needs and benefit of the churches, administer in things
   spiritual and temporal, but in such a way that they alienate nothing
   whatever of the church's goods. They may receive the customary
   consecration or blessing.

Canon 27.

   Candidates for the priesthood to be carefully trained and scrutinized
   To guide souls is a supreme art. We therefore strictly order bishops
   carefully to prepare those who are to be promoted to the priesthood and
   to instruct them, either by themselves or through other suitable
   persons, in the divine services and the sacraments of the church, so
   that they may be able to celebrate them correctly. But if they presume
   henceforth to ordain the ignorant and unformed, which can indeed easily
   be detected, we decree that both the ordainers and those ordained are
   to be subject to severe punishment. For it is preferable, especially in
   the ordination of priests, to have a few good ministers than many bad
   ones, for if a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into
   the pit.

Canon 28.

   Who asks to resign must resign
   Certain persons insistently ask for permission to resign and obtain it,
   but then do not resign. Since in such a request to resign they would
   seem to have in mind either the good of the churches over which they
   preside or their own well-being, neither of which do we wish to be
   impeded either by the arguments of any people seeking their own
   interests or even by a certain fickleness, we therefore decree that
   such persons are to be compelled to resign.

Canon 29.

   Multiple benefices require papal dispensation
   With much foresight it was forbidden in the Lateran council for anyone
   to receive several ecclesiastical dignities and several parish
   churches, contrary to the regulations of the sacred canons, on pain of
   both the recipient losing what he had received and the conferrer being
   deprived of the power to confer. On account of the presumption and
   covetousness of certain persons, however, none or little fruit is
   resulting from this statute. We therefore, desiring to remedy the
   situation more clearly and expressly, ordain by this present decree
   that whoever receives any benefice with the cure of souls attached, if
   he was already in possession of such a benefice, shall be deprived by
   the law itself of the benefice held first, and if perchance he tries to
   retain this he shall also be deprived of the second benefice. Moreover,
   the person who has the right to confer the first benefice may freely
   bestow it, after the recipient has obtained a second benefice, on
   someone who seems to deserve it. If he delays in conferring it beyond
   three months, however, then not only is the collation to devolve upon
   another person, according to the statute of the Lateran council, but
   also he shall be compelled to assign to the use of the church belonging
   to the benefice as much of his own income as is established as having
   been received from the benefice while it was vacant. We decree that the
   same is to be observed with regard to parsonages adding that nobody
   shall presume to hold several dignities or parsonages in the same
   church even if they do not have the cure of souls. As for exalted and
   lettered persons, however, who should be honoured with greater
   benefices, it is possible for them to be dispensed by the apostolic
   see, when reason demands it.

Canon 30.

   Penalties for bestowing ecclesiatical benefices on the unworthy
   It is very serious and absurd that prelates of churches, when they can
   promote suitable men to ecclesiastical benefices, are not afraid to
   choose unworthy men who lack both learning and honesty of behaviour and
   who follow the urgings of the flesh rather than the judgment of reason.
   Nobody of a sound mind is ignorant of how much damage to churches
   arises from this. Wishing therefore to remedy this ill, we order that
   they pass over unworthy persons and appoint suitable persons who are
   willing and able to offer a pleasing service to God and to the
   churches, and that careful inquiry be made about this each year at the
   provincial council. Therefore he who has been found guilty after a
   first and second correction is to be suspended from conferring
   benefices by the provincial council, and a prudent and honest person is
   to be appointed at the same council to make up for the suspended
   person's failure in this matter. The same is to be observed with regard
   to chapters who offend in these matters. The offence of a metropolitan,
   however, shall be left by the council to be reported to the judgment of
   the superior. In order that this salutary provision may have fuller
   effect, a sentence of suspension of this kind may not be relaxed at all
   without the authority of the Roman pontiff or of the appropriate
   patriarch, so that in this too the four patriarchal sees shall be
   specially honoured.

Canon 31.

   Canons' sons cannot be canons where their fathers are
   In order to abolish a very bad practice that has grown up in many
   churches, we strictly forbid the sons of canons, especially if they are
   illegitimate, to become canons in the secular churches in which their
   fathers hold office. If the contrary is attempted, we declare it to be
   invalid. Those who attempt to make such persons canons are to be
   suspended from their benefices.

Canon 32.

   Parish priests to have adequate incomes
   There has grown up in certain parts a vicious custom which should be
   eradicated, namely that patrons of parish churches and certain other
   people claim the incomes from the churches wholly for themselves and
   leave to the priests, for the appointed services, such a small portion
   that they cannot live fittingly on it. For in some regions, as we have
   learnt for certain, parish priests receive for their sustenance only a
   quarter of a quarter, that is to say a sixteenth, of the tithes. Whence
   it comes about in these regions that almost no parish priest can be
   found who is even moderately learned. As the mouth of the ox should not
   be muzzled when it is treading out the grain, and he who serves at the
   altar should live from it, we therefore decree that, notwithstanding
   any custom of a bishop or a patron or anyone else, a sufficient portion
   is to be assigned to the priest. He who has a parish church is to serve
   it not through a vicar but in person, in the due form which the care of
   that church requires, unless by chance the parish church is annexed to
   a prebend or a dignity. In that case we allow that he who has such a
   prebend or dignity should make it his business, since he must serve in
   the greater church, to have a suitable and permanent vicar canonically
   instituted in the parish church; and the latter is to have, as has been
   said, a fitting portion from the revenues of the church. Otherwise let
   him know that by the authority of this decree he is deprived of the
   parish church, which is freely to be conferred on someone else who is
   willing and able to do what has been said. We utterly forbid anyone to
   dare deceitfully to confer a pension on another person, as it were as a
   benefice, from the revenues of a church which has to maintain its own
   priest.

Canon 33.

   Renumeration for visitations to be reasonable
   Procurations which are due, by reason of a visitation, to bishops,
   archdeacons or any other persons, as well as to legates or nuncios of
   the apostolic see, should by no means be exacted, without a clear and
   necessary reason, unless the visitations were carried out in person,
   and then let them observe the moderation in transport and retinue laid
   down in the Lateran council. We add the following moderation with
   regard to legates and nuncios of the apostolic see : that when it is
   necessary for them to stay in any place, and in order that the said
   place may not be burdened too much on their behalf, they may receive
   moderate procurations from other churches and persons that have not yet
   been burdened with procurations of their own, on condition that the
   number of procurations does-not exceed the number of days in the stay;
   and when any of the churches or persons have not sufficient means of
   their own, two or more of them may be combined into one. Those who
   exercise the office of visitation, moreover, shall not seek their own
   interests but rather those of Jesus Christ, by devoting themselves to
   preaching and exhortation, to correction and reformation, so that they
   may bring back fruit which does not perish. He who dares to do the
   contrary shall both restore what he has received and pay a like amount
   in compensation to the church which he has thus burdened.

Canon 34.

   Prelates forbidden to procure ecclesiastical services at a profit
   Many prelates, in order to meet the cost of a procuration or some
   service to a legate or some other person, extort from their subjects
   more than they pay out, and in trying to extract a profit from their
   losses they look for booty rather than help in their subjects. We
   forbid this to happen in the future. If by chance anyone does attempt
   it, he shall restore what he has extorted and be compelled to give the
   same amount to the poor. The superior to whom a complaint about this
   has been submitted shall suffer canonical punishment if he is negligent
   in executing this statute.

Canon 35.

   On appeal procedures
   In order that due honour may be given to judges and consideration be
   shown to litigants in the matter of trouble and expenses, we decree
   that when somebody sues an adversary before the competent judge, he
   shall not appeal to a superior judge before judgment has been given,
   without a reasonable cause; but rather let him proceed with his suit
   before the lower judge, without it being possible for him to obstruct
   by saying that he sent a messenger to a superior judge or even procured
   letters from him before they were assigned to the delegated judge.
   When, however, he thinks that he has reasonable cause for appealing and
   has stated the probable grounds of the appeal before the same judge,
   such namely that if they were proved they would be reckoned legitimate,
   the superior judge shall examine the appeal. If the latter thinks the
   appeal is unreasonable, he shall send the appellant back to the lower
   judge and sentence him to pay the costs of the other party; otherwise
   he shall go ahead, saving however the canons about major cases being
   referred to the apostolic see.

Canon 36.

   On interlocutory sentences
   Since the effect ceases when the cause ceases, we decree that if an
   ordinary judge or a judge delegate has pronounced a comminatory or an
   interlocutory sentence which would prejudice one of the litigants if
   its execution was ordered, and then acting on good advice refrains from
   putting it into effect, he shall proceed freely in hearing the case,
   notwithstanding any appeal made against such a comminatory or
   interlocutory sentence, provided he is not open to suspicion for some
   other legitimate reason. This is so that the process is not held up for
   frivolous reasons.

Canon 37.

   On Summons by Apostolic Letter
   Some people, abusing the favour of the apostolic see, try to obtain
   letters from it summoning people to distant judges, so that the
   defendant, wearied by the labour and expense of the action, is forced
   to give in or to buy off the importunate bringer of the action. A trial
   should not open the way to injustices that are forbidden by respect for
   the law. We therefore decree that nobody may be summoned by apostolic
   letters to a trial that is more than two days' journey outside his
   diocese, unless the letters were procured with the agreement of both
   parties or expressly mention this constitution. There are other people
   who, turning to a new kind of trade, in order to revive complaints that
   are dormant or to introduce new questions, make up suits for which they
   procure letters from the apostolic see without authorization from their
   superiors. They then offer the letters for sale either to the
   defendant, in return for his not being vexed with trouble and expense
   on account of them, or to the plaintiff, in order that by means of them
   he may wear out his adversary with undue distress. Lawsuits should be
   limited rather than encouraged. We therefore decree by this general
   constitution that if anyone henceforth presumes to seek apostolic
   letters on any matter without a special mandate from his superior, then
   the letters are invalid and he is to be punished as a forger, unless by
   chance persons are involved for whom a mandate should not in law be
   demanded.

Canon 38.

   Written records of trials to be kept
   An innocent litigant can never prove the truth of his denial of a false
   assertion made by an unjust judge, since a denial by the nature of
   things does not constitute a direct proof. We therefore decree, lest
   falsehood prejudice truth or wickedness prevail over justice, that in
   both ordinary and extraordinary trials the judge shall always employ
   either a public official, if he can find one, or two suitable men to
   write down faithfully all the judicial acts -- that is to say the
   citations, adjournments, objections and exceptions, petitions and
   replies, interrogations, confessions, depositions of witnesses,
   productions of documents, interlocutions {5} , appeals, renunciations,
   final decisions and the other things that ought to be written down in
   the correct order -- stating the places, times and persons. Everything
   thus written down shall be given to the parties in question, but the
   originals shall remain with the scribes, so that if a dispute arises
   over how the judge conducted the case, the truth can be established
   from the originals. With this measure being applied, such deference
   will be paid to honest and prudent judges that justice for the innocent
   will not be harmed by imprudent and wicked judges. A judge who neglects
   to observe this constitution shall, if some difficulty arises from his
   negligence, be punished as he deserves by a superior judge; nor shall
   presumption be made in favour of his handling of the case except
   insofar as it accords with the legal documents.

Canon 39.

   On knowingly receiving stolen goods
   It often happens, when a person has been unjustly robbed and the object
   has been transferred by the robber to a third party, that he is not
   helped by an action of restitution against the new possessor because he
   has lost the advantage of possession, and he loses in effect the right
   of ownership on account of the difficulty of proving his case. We
   therefore decree, notwithstanding the force of civil law, that if
   anyone henceforth knowingly receives such a thing, then the one robbed
   shall be favoured by his being awarded restitution against the one in
   possession. For the latter as it were succeeds the robber in his vice,
   inasmuch as there is not much difference, especially as regards danger
   to the soul, between unjustly hanging on to another's property and
   seizing it.

Canon 40.

   True owner is the true possessor even if not possessing the object for
   a year
   It sometimes happens that when possession of something is awarded to
   the plaintiff in a suit, on account of the contumacy of the other
   party, yet because of force or fraud over the thing he is unable to
   obtain custody of it within a year, or having gained it he loses it.
   Thus the defendant profits from his own wickedness, because in the
   opinion of many the plaintiff does not qualify as the true possessor at
   the end of a year. Lest therefore a contumacious party is in a better
   position than an obedient one, we decree, in the name of canonical
   equity, that in the aforesaid case the plaintiff shall be established
   as the true possessor after the year has elapsed. Furthermore, we issue
   a general prohibition against promising to abide by the decision of a
   layman in spiritual matters, since it is not fitting for a layman to
   arbitrate in such matters.

Canon 41.

   No one is to knowingly prescribe an object to the wrong party
   Since whatever does not proceed from faith is sin, and since in general
   any constitution or custom which cannot be observed without mortal sin
   is to be disregarded, we therefore define by this synodal judgment that
   no prescription, whether canonical or civil, is valid without good
   faith. It is therefore necessary that the person who prescribes should
   at no stage be aware that the object belongs to someone else.

Canon 42.

   Clerics and laity are not to usurp each others rights
   Just as we desire lay people not to usurp the rights of clerics, so we
   ought to wish clerics not to lay claim to the rights of the laity. We
   therefore forbid every cleric henceforth to extend his jurisdiction,
   under pretext of ecclesiastical freedom, to the prejudice of secular
   justice. Rather, let him be satisfied with the written constitutions
   and customs hitherto approved, so that the things of Caesar may be
   rendered unto Caesar, and the things of God may be rendered unto God by
   a right distribution.

Canon 43.

   Clerics cannot be forced to take oaths of fealty to those from whom
   they hold no temporalities
   Certain laymen try to encroach too far upon divine right when they
   force ecclesiastics who do not hold any temporalities from them to take
   oaths of fealty to them. Since a servant stands or falls with his Lord,
   according to the Apostle, we therefore forbid, on the authority of this
   sacred council, that such clerics be forced to take an oath of this
   kind to secular persons.

Canon 44.

   Only clerics may dispose of church property
   Lay people, however devout, have no power to dispose of church
   property. Their lot is to obey, not to be in command. We therefore
   grieve that charity is growing cold in some of them so that they are
   not afraid to attack through their ordinances, or rather their
   fabrications, the immunity of ecclesiastical freedom, which has in the
   past been protected with many privileges not only by holy fathers but
   also by secular princes. They do this not only by alienating fiefs and
   other possessions of the church and by usurping jurisdictions but also
   by illegally laying hands on mortuaries and other things which are seen
   to belong to spiritual justice. We wish to ensure the immunity of
   churches in these matters and to provide against such great injuries.
   We therefore decree, with the approval of this sacred council, that
   ordinances of this kind and claims to fiefs or other goods of the
   church, made by way of a decree of the lay power, without the proper
   consent of ecclesiastical persons, are invalid since they can be said
   to be not laws but rather acts of destitution or destruction and
   usurpations of jurisdiction. Those who dare to do these things are to
   be restrained by ecclesiastical censure.

Canon 45.

   Penalties for patrons who steal church goods or physically harm their
   clerics
   Patrons of churches, lords' deputies and advocates have displayed such
   arrogance in some provinces that they not only introduce difficulties
   and evil designs when vacant churches ought to be provided with
   suitable pastors, but they also presume to dispose of the possessions
   and other goods of the church as they like and, what is dreadful to
   relate, they are not afraid to set about killing prelates. What was
   devised for protection should not be twisted into a means of
   repression. We therefore expressly forbid patrons, advocates and lords'
   deputies henceforth to appropriate more in the aforesaid matters than
   is permitted in law. If they dare to do the contrary, let them be
   curbed with the most severe canonical penalties. We decree, moreover,
   with the approval of this sacred council, that if patrons or advocates
   or feudatories or lords' deputies or other persons with benefices
   venture with unspeakable daring to kill or to mutilate, personally or
   through others, the rector of any church or other cleric of that
   church, then the patron shall lose completely his right of patronage,
   the advocate his advocation, the feudatory his fief, the lord's deputy
   his deputyship and the beneficed person his benefice. And lest the
   punishment be remembered for less time than the crime, nothing of the
   aforesaid shall descend to their heirs, and their posterity to the
   fourth generation shall in nowise be admitted into a college of clerics
   or to hold the honour of any prelacy in a religious house, except when
   out of mercy they are dispensed to do so.

Canon 46.

   Taxes cannot be levied on the Church, but the Church can volunteer
   contributions for the common good
   The Lateran council, wishing to provide for the immunity of the church
   against officials and governors of cities and other persons who seek to
   oppress churches and churchmen with tallages and taxes and other
   exactions, forbade such presumption under pain of anathema. It ordered
   transgressors and their supporters to be excommunicated until they made
   adequate satisfaction. If at some time, however, a bishop together with
   his clergy foresee so great a need or advantage that they consider,
   without any compulsion, that subsidies should be given by the churches,
   for the common good or the common need, when the resources of the laity
   are not sufficient, then the above-mentioned laymen may receive them
   humbly and devoutly and with thanks. On account of the imprudence of
   some, however, the Roman pontiff, whose business it is to provide for
   the common good, should be consulted beforehand. We add, moreover,
   since the malice of some against God's church has not abated, that the
   ordinances and sentences promulgated by such excommunicated persons, or
   on their orders, are to be deemed null and void and shall never be
   valid. Since fraud and deceit should not protect anyone, let nobody be
   deceived by false error to endure an anathema during his term of
   government as though he is not obliged to make satisfaction afterwards.
   For we decree that both he who has refused to make satisfaction and his
   successor, if he does not make satisfaction within a month, is to
   remain bound by ecclesiastical censure until he makes suitable
   satisfaction, since he who succeeds to a post also succeeds to its
   responsibilities.

Canon 47.

   On unjust excommunication
   With the approval of this sacred council, we forbid anyone to
   promulgate a sentence of excommunication on anyone, unless an adequate
   warning has been given beforehand in the presence of suitable persons,
   who can if necessary testify to the warning. If anyone dares to do the
   contrary, even if the sentence of excommunication is just, let him know
   that he is forbidden to enter a church for one month and he is to be
   punished with another penalty if this seems expedient. Let him
   carefully avoid proceeding to excommunicate anyone without manifest and
   reasonable cause. If he does so proceed and, on being humbly requested,
   does not take care to revoke the process without imposing punishment,
   then the injured person may lodge a complaint of unjust excommunication
   with a superior judge. The latter shall then send the person back to
   the judge who excommunicated him, if this can be done without the
   danger of a delay, with orders that he is to be absolved within a
   suitable period of time. If the danger of delay cannot be avoided, the
   task of absolving him shall be carried out by the superior judge,
   either in person or through someone else, as seems expedient, after he
   has obtained adequate guarantees. Whenever it is established that the
   judge pronounced an unjust excommunication, he shall be condemned to
   make compensation for damages to the one excommunicated, and be
   nonetheless punished in another way at the discretion of the superior
   judge if the nature of the fault calls for it, since it is not a
   trivial fault to inflict so great a punishment on an innocent person --
   unless by chance he erred for reasons that are credible -- especially
   if the person is of praiseworthy repute. But if nothing reasonable is
   proved against the sentence of excommunication by the one making the
   complaint, then the complainant shall be condemned in punishment, for
   the unreasonable trouble caused by his complaint, to make compensation
   or in some other way according to the discretion of the superior judge,
   unless by chance his error was based on something that is credible and
   so excuses him; and he shall moreover be compelled upon a pledge to
   make satisfaction in the matter for which he was justly excommunicated,
   or else he shall be subject again to the former sentence which is to be
   inviolably observed until full satisfaction has been made. If the
   judge, however, recognizes his error and is prepared to revoke the
   sentence, but the person on whom it was passed appeals, for fear that
   the judge might revoke it without making satisfaction, then the appeal
   shall not be admitted unless the error is such that it may deserve to
   be questioned. Then the judge, after he has given sufficient security
   that he will appear in court before the person to whom the appeal had
   been made or one delegated by him, shall absolve the excommunicated
   person and thus shall not be subject to the prescribed punishment. Let
   the judge altogether beware, if he wishes to avoid strict canonical
   punishment, lest out of a perverse intention to harm someone he
   pretends to have made an error.

Canon 48.

   Challenging an ecclesiastical judge
   Since a special prohibition has been made against anyone presuming to
   promulgate a sentence of excommunication against someone without
   adequate warning being given beforehand, we therefore wish to provide
   against the person warned being able, by means of a fraudulent
   objection or appeal, to escape examination by the one issuing the
   warning. We therefore decree that if the person alleges he holds the
   judge suspect, let him bring before the same judge an action of just
   suspicion; and he himself in agreement with his adversary (or with the
   judge, if he happens not to have an adversary) shall together choose
   arbiters or, if by chance they are unable to reach agreement together,
   he shall choose one arbiter and the other another, to take cognisance
   of the action of suspicion. If these cannot agree on a judgment they
   shall call in a third person so that what two of them decide upon shall
   have binding force. Let them know that they are bound to carry this out
   faithfully, in accordance with the command strictly enjoined by us in
   virtue of obedience and under the attestation of the divine judgment.
   If the action of suspicion is not proved in law before them within a
   suitable time, the judge shall exercise his jurisdiction; if the action
   is proved, then with the consent of the objector the challenged judge
   shall commit the matter to a suitable person or shall refer it to a
   superior judge so that he may conduct the matter as it should be
   conducted. As for the person who has been warned but then hastens to
   make an appeal, if his offence is made manifest in law by the evidence
   of the case or by his own confession or in some other way, then
   provocation of this kind is not to be tolerated, since the remedy of an
   appeal was not established to defend wickedness but to protect
   innocence. If there is some doubt about his offence, then the appellant
   shall, lest he impedes the judge's action by the subterfuge of a
   frivolous appeal, set before the same judge the credible reason for his
   appeal, such namely that if it was proved it would be considered
   legitimate. Then if he has an adversary, let him proceed with his
   appeal within the time laid down by the same judge according to the
   distances, times and nature of the business involved. If he does not
   prosecute his appeal, the judge himself shall proceed notwithstanding
   the appeal. If the adversary does not appear when the judge is
   proceeding in virtue of his office, then once the reason for the appeal
   has been verified before the superior judge the latter shall exercise
   his jurisdiction. If the appellant fails to get the reason for his
   appeal verified, he shall be sent back to the judge from whom it has
   been established that he appealed maliciously. We do not wish the above
   two constitutions to be extended to regulars, who have their own
   special observances. '

Canon 49.

   Penalties for excommunication out of avarice
   We absolutely forbid, under threat of the divine judgment, anyone to
   dare to bind anyone with the bond of excommunication, or to absolve
   anyone so bound, out of avarice. We forbid this especially in those
   regions where by custom an excommunicated person is punished by a money
   penalty when he is absolved. We decree that when it has been
   established that a sentence of excommunication was unjust, the
   excommunicator shall be compelled by ecclesiastical censure to restore
   the money thus extorted, and shall pay as much again to his victim for
   the injury unless he was deceived by an understandable error. If
   perchance he is unable to pay, he shall be punished in some other way.

Canon 50.

   Prohibition of marriage is now perpetually restricted to the fourth
   degree
   It should not be judged reprehensible if human decrees are sometimes
   changed according to changing circumstances, especially when urgent
   necessity or evident advantage demands it, since God himself changed in
   the new Testament some of the things which he had commanded in the old
   Testament. Since the prohibitions against contracting marriage in the
   second and third degree of affinity, and against uniting the offspring
   of a second marriage with the kindred of the first husband, often lead
   to difficulty and sometimes endanger souls, we therefore, in order that
   when the prohibition ceases the effect may also cease, revoke with the
   approval of this sacred council the constitutions published on this
   subject and we decree, by this present constitution, that henceforth
   contracting parties connected in these ways may freely be joined
   together. Moreover the prohibition against marriage shall not in future
   go beyond the fourth degree of consanguinity and of affinity, since the
   prohibition cannot now generally be observed to further degrees without
   grave harm. The number four agrees well with the prohibition concerning
   bodily union about which the Apostle says, that the husband does not
   rule over his body, but the wife does; and the wife does not rule over
   her body, but the husband does; for there are four humours in the body,
   which is composed of the four elements. Although the prohibition of
   marriage is now restricted to the fourth degree, we wish the
   prohibition to be perpetual, notwithstanding earlier decrees on this
   subject issued either by others or by us. If any persons dare to marry
   contrary to this prohibition, they shall not be protected by length of
   years, since the passage of time does not diminish sin but increases
   it, and the longer that faults hold the unfortunate soul in bondage the
   graver they are.

Canon 51.

   Clandestine marriages forbidden
   Since the prohibition against marriage in the three remotest degrees
   has been revoked, we wish it to be strictly observed in the other
   degrees. Following in the footsteps of our predecessors, we altogether
   forbid clandestine marriages and we forbid any priest to presume to be
   present at such a marriage. Extending the special custom of certain
   regions to other regions generally, we decree that when marriages are
   to be contracted they shall be publicly announced in the churches by
   priests, with a suitable time being fixed beforehand within which
   whoever wishes and is able to may adduce a lawful impediment. The
   priests themselves shall also investigate whether there is any
   impediment. When there appears a credible reason why the marriage
   should not be contracted, the contract shall be expressly forbidden
   until there has been established from clear documents what ought to be
   done in the matter. If any persons presume to enter into clandestine
   marriages of this kind, or forbidden marriages within a prohibited
   degree, even if done in ignorance, the offspring of the union shall be
   deemed illegitimate and shall have no help from their parents'
   ignorance, since the parents in contracting the marriage could be
   considered as not devoid of knowledge, or even as affecters of
   ignorance. Likewise the offspring shall be deemed illegitimate if both
   parents know of a legitimate impediment and yet dare to contract a
   marriage in the presence of the church, contrary to every prohibition.
   Moreover the parish priest who refuses to forbid such unions, or even
   any member of the regular clergy who dares to attend them, shall be
   suspended from office for three years and shall be punished even more
   severely if the nature of the fault requires it. Those who presume to
   be united in this way, even if it is within a permitted degree, are to
   be given a suitable penance. Anybody who maliciously proposes an
   impediment, to prevent a legitimate marriage, will not escape the
   church's vengeance.

Canon 52.

   On rejecting evidence from hearsay at a matrimonial suit
   It was at one time decided out of a certain necessity, but contrary to
   the normal practice, that hearsay evidence should be valid in reckoning
   the degrees of consanguinity and affinity, because on account of the
   shortness of human life witnesses would not be able to testify from
   first-hand knowledge in a reckoning as far as the seventh degree.
   However, because we have learned from many examples and definite proofs
   that many dangers to lawful marriages have arisen from this, we have
   decided that in future witnesses from hearsay shall not be accepted in
   this matter, since the prohibition does not now exceed the fourth
   degree, unless there are persons of weight who are trustworthy and who
   learnt from their elders, before the case was begun, the things that
   they testify : not indeed from one such person since one would not
   suffice even if he or she were alive, but from two at least, and not
   from persons who are of bad repute and suspect but from those who are
   trustworthy and above every objection, since it would appear rather
   absurd to admit in evidence those whose actions would be rejected. Nor
   should there be admitted in evidence one person who has learnt what he
   testifies from several, or persons of bad repute who have learnt what
   they testify from persons of good repute, as though they were more than
   one and suitable witnesses, since even according to the normal practice
   of courts the assertion of one witness does not suffice, even if he is
   a person resplendent with authority, and since legal actions are
   forbidden to persons of bad repute. The witnesses shall affirm on oath
   that in bearing witness in the case they are not acting from hatred or
   fear or love or for advantage; they shall designate the persons by
   their exact names or by pointing out or by sufficient description, and
   shall distinguish by a clear reckoning every degree of relationship on
   either side; and they shall include in their oath the statement that it
   was from their ancestors that they received what they are testifying
   and that they believe it to be true. They shall still not suffice
   unless they declare on oath that they have known that the persons who
   stand in at least one of the aforesaid degrees of relationship, regard
   each other as blood-relations. For it is preferable to leave alone some
   people who have been united contrary to human decrees than to separate,
   contrary to the Lord's decrees, persons who have been joined together
   legitimately.

Canon 53.

   On those who give their fields to others to be cultivated so as to
   avoid tithes
   In some regions there are intermingled certain peoples who by custom,
   in accordance with their own rites, do not pay tithes, even though they
   are counted as christians. Some landlords assign their lands to them so
   that these lords may obtain greater revenues, by cheating the churches
   of the tithes. Wishing therefore to provide for the security of
   churches in these matters, we decree that when lords make over their
   lands to such persons in this way for cultivation, the lords must pay
   the tithes to the churches in full and without objection, and if
   necessary they shall be compelled to do so by ecclesiastical censure.
   Such tithes are indeed to be paid of necessity, inasmuch as they are
   owed in virtue of divine law or of approved local custom.

Canon 54.

   Tithes should be paid before taxes
   It is not within human power that the seed should answer to the sower
   since, according to the saying of the Apostle, Neither he who plants
   nor he who waters is anything, but rather he who gives the growth,
   namely God, who himself brings forth much fruit from the dead seed.
   Now, some people from excess of greed strive to cheat over tithes,
   deducting from crops and first-fruits the rents and dues, which
   meanwhile escape the payment of tithes. Since the Lord has reserved
   tithes unto himself as a sign of his universal lordship, by a certain
   special title as it were, we decree, wishing to prevent injury to
   churches and danger to souls, that in virtue of this general lordship
   the payment of tithes shall precede the exaction of dues and rents, or
   at least those who receive untithed rents and dues shall be forced by
   ecclesiastical censure, seeing that a thing carries with it its burden,
   to tithe them for the churches to which by right they are due.

Canon 55.

   Tithes are to be paid on lands acquired, notwithstanding privileges
   Recently abbots of the Cistercian order, assembled in a general
   chapter, wisely decreed at our instance that the brethren of the order
   shall not in future buy possessions from which tithes are due to
   churches, unless by chance it is for founding new monasteries; and that
   if such possessions were given to them by the pious devotion of the
   faithful, or were bought for founding new monasteries, they would
   assign them for cultivation to other people, who would pay the tithes
   to the churches, lest the churches be further burdened on account of
   the Cistercians' privileges. We therefore decree that on lands assigned
   to others and on future acquisitions, even if they cultivate them with
   their own hands or at their own expense, they shall pay tithes to the
   churches which previously received the tithes from the lands, unless
   they decide to compound in another way with the churches. Since we
   consider this decree to be acceptable and right, we wish it to be
   extended to other regulars who enjoy similar privileges, and we order
   prelates of churches to be readier and more effectual in affording them
   full justice with regard to those who wrong them and to take pains to
   maintain their privileges more carefully and completely.

Canon 56.

   A parish priest shall not lose a tithe on account of some people making
   a pact
   Many regulars, as we have learnt, and sometimes secular clerics, when
   letting houses or granting fiefs, add a pact, to the prejudice of the
   parish churches, to the effect that the tenants and vassals shall pay
   tithes to them and shall choose to be buried in their ground. We
   utterly reject pacts of this kind, since they are rooted in avarice,
   and we declare that whatever is received through them shall be returned
   to the parish churches.

Canon 57.

   Interpreting the words of privileges
   In order that privileges which the Roman church has granted to certain
   religious may remain unimpaired, we have decided that certain things in
   them must be clarified lest through their not being well understood
   they lead to abuse, on account of which they could deservedly be
   revoked. For, a person deserves to lose a privilege if he abuses the
   power entrusted to him. The apostolic see has rightly granted an indult
   to certain regulars to the effect that ecclesiastical burial should not
   be refused to deceased members of their fraternity if the churches to
   which they belong happen to be under an interdict as regards divine
   services, unless the persons were excommunicated or interdicted by
   name, and that they may carry off for burial to their own churches
   their confraters whom prelates of churches will not allow to be buried
   in their own churches, unless the confraters have been excommunicated
   or interdicted by name. However, we understand this to refer to
   confraters who have changed their secular dress and have been
   consecrated to the order while still alive, or who in their lifetime
   have given their property to them while retaining for themselves as
   long as they live the usufruct of it. Only such persons may be buried
   at the non-interdicted churches of these regulars and of others in
   which they have chosen to be buried. For if it were understood of any
   persons joining their fraternity for the annual payment of two or three
   pennies, ecclesiastical discipline would be loosened and brought into
   contempt. Even the latter may, however, obtain a certain remission
   granted to them by the apostolic see. It has also been granted to such
   regulars that if any of their brethren, whom they have sent to
   establish fraternities or to receive taxes, comes to a city or a castle
   or a village which is under an interdict as regards divine services,
   then churches may be opened once in the year at their "joyous entry" so
   that the divine services may be celebrated there, after excommunicated
   persons have been excluded. We wish this to be understood as meaning
   that in a given city, castle or town one church only shall be opened
   for the brethren of a particular order, as mentioned above, once in the
   year. For although it was said in the plural that churches may be
   opened at their "joyous entry", this on a true understanding refers not
   to each individual church of a given place but rather to the churches
   of the aforesaid places taken together. Otherwise if they visited all
   the churches of a given place in this way, the sentence of interdict
   would be brought into too much contempt. Those who dare to usurp
   anything for themselves contrary to the above declarations shall be
   subjected to severe punishment.

Canon 58.

   On the same in favour of bishops
   We wish to extend to bishops, in favour of the episcopal office, the
   indult which has already been given to certain religious. We therefore
   grant that when a country is under a general interdict, the bishops may
   sometimes celebrate the divine services, behind closed doors and in a
   lowered voice, without the ringing of bells, after excommunicated and
   interdicted persons have been excluded, unless this has been expressly
   forbidden to them. We grant this, however, to those bishops who have
   not given any cause for the interdict, lest they use guile or fraud of
   any sort and so turn a good thing into a damaging loss.

Canon 59.

   Religious cannot give surety without permission of his abbot and
   convent
   We wish and order to be extended to all religious what has already been
   forbidden by the apostolic see to some of them : namely that no
   religious, without the permission of his abbot and the majority of his
   chapter, may stand surety for someone or accept a loan from another
   beyond a sum fixed by the common opinion. Otherwise the convent shall
   not be held responsible in any way for his actions, unless perchance
   the matter has clearly redounded to the benefit of his house. Anyone
   who presumes to act contrary to this statute shall be severely
   disciplined.

Canon 60.

   Abbots not to encroach on episcopal office
   From the complaints which have reached us from bishops in various parts
   of the world, we have come to know of serious and great excesses of
   certain abbots who, not content with the boundaries of their own
   authority, stretch out their hands to things belonging to the episcopal
   dignity : hearing matrimonial cases, enjoining public penances, even
   granting letters of indulgences and like presumptions. It sometimes
   happens from this that episcopal authority is cheapened in the eyes of
   many. Wishing therefore to provide for both the dignity of bishops and
   the well-being of abbots in these matters, we strictly forbid by this
   present decree any abbot to reach out for such things, if he wishes to
   avoid danger for himself, unless by chance any of them can defend
   himself by a special concession or some other legitimate reason in
   respect of such things.

Canon 61.

   Religious may not receive tithes from lay hands
   It was forbidden at the Lateran council, as is known, for any regulars
   to dare to receive churches or tithes from lay hands without the
   bishop's consent, or in any way to admit to the divine services those
   under excommunication or those interdicted by name. We now forbid it
   even more strongly and will take care to see that offenders are
   punished with condign penalties. We decree, nevertheless that in
   churches which do not belong to them by full right the regulars shall,
   in accordance with the statutes of that council, present to the bishop
   the priests who are to be instituted, for examination by him about the
   care of the people; but as for the priests' ability in temporal
   matters, the regulars shall furnish the proof unto themselves. Let them
   not dare to remove those who have been instituted without consulting
   the bishop. We add, indeed, that they should take care to present those
   who are either noted for their way of life or recommended by prelates
   on probable grounds.

Canon 62.

   Regarding saint's relics
   The christian religion is frequently disparaged because certain people
   put saints' relics up for sale and display them indiscriminately. In
   order that it may not be disparaged in the future, we ordain by this
   present decree that henceforth ancient relics shall not be displayed
   outside a reliquary or be put up for sale. As for newly discovered
   relics, let no one presume to venerate them publicly unless they have
   previously been approved by the authority of the Roman pontiff.
   Prelates, moreover, should not in future allow those who come to their
   churches, in order to venerate, to be deceived by lying stories or
   false documents, as has commonly happened in many places on account of
   the desire for profit. We also forbid the recognition of
   alms-collectors, some of whom deceive other people by proposing various
   errors in their preaching, unless they show authentic letters from the
   apostolic see or from the diocesan bishop. Even then they shall not be
   permitted to put before the people anything beyond what is contained in
   the letters.
   We have thought it good to show the form of letter which the apostolic
   see generally grants to alms-collectors, in order that diocesan bishops
   may follow it in their own letters. It is this : "Since, as the Apostle
   says, we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ to receive
   according to what we have done in the body, whether it be good or bad,
   it behooves us to prepare for the day of the final harvest with works
   of mercy and to sow on earth, with a view to eternity, that which, with
   God returning it with multiplied fruit, we ought to collect in heaven;
   keeping a firm hope and confidence, since he who sows sparingly reaps
   sparingly, and he who sows bountifully shall reap bountifully unto
   eternal life. Since the resources of a hospital may not suffice for the
   support of the brethren and the needy who flock to it, we admonish and
   exhort all of you in the Lord, and enjoin upon you for the remission of
   your sins, to give pious alms and grateful charitable assistance to
   them, from the goods that God has bestowed upon you; so that their need
   may be cared for through your help, and you may reach eternal happiness
   through these and other good things which you may have done under God's
   inspiration. "
   Let those who are sent to seek alms be modest and discreet, and let
   them not stay in taverns or other unsuitable places or incur useless or
   excessive expenses, being careful above all not to wear the garb of
   false religion. Moreover, because the keys of the church are brought
   into contempt and satisfaction through penance loses its force through
   indiscriminate and excessive indulgences, which certain prelates of
   churches do not fear to grant, we therefore decree that when a basilica
   is dedicated, the indulgence shall not be for more than one year,
   whether it is dedicated by one bishop or by more than one, and for the
   anniversary of the dedication the remission of penances imposed is not
   to exceed forty days. We order that the letters of indulgence, which
   are granted for various reasons at different times, are to fix this
   number of days, since the Roman pontiff himself, who possesses the
   plenitude of power, is accustomed to observe this moderation in such
   things.

Canon 63.

   On simony
   As we have certainly learnt, shameful and wicked exactions and
   extortions are levied in many places and by many persons, who are like
   the sellers of doves in the temple, for the consecration of bishops,
   the blessing of abbots and the ordination of clerics. There is fixed
   how much is to be paid for this or that and for yet another thing. Some
   even strive to defend this disgrace and wickedness on the grounds of
   long-established custom, thereby heaping up for themselves still
   further damnation. Wishing therefore to abolish so great an abuse, we
   altogether reject such a custom which should rather be termed a
   corruption. We firmly decree that nobody shall dare to demand or extort
   anything under any pretext for the conferring of such things or for
   their having been conferred. Otherwise both he who receives and he who
   gives such an absolutely condemned payment shall be condemned with
   Gehazi and Simon.

Canon 64.

   Simony with regards to monks and nuns
   The disease of simony has infected many nuns to such an extent that
   they admit scarcely any as sisters without a payment, wishing to cover
   this vice with the pretext of poverty. We utterly forbid this to happen
   in the future. We decree that whoever commits such wickedness in the
   future, both the one admitting and the one admitted, whether she be a
   subject or in authority, shall be expelled from her convent without
   hope of reinstatement, and be cast into a house of stricter observance
   to do perpetual penance. As regards those who were admitted in this way
   before this synodal statute, we have decided to provide that they be
   moved from the convents which they wrongly entered, and be placed in
   other houses of the same order. If perchance they are too numerous to
   be conveniently placed elsewhere, they may be admitted afresh to the
   same convent, by dispensation, after the prioress and lesser officials
   have been changed, lest they roam around in the world to the danger of
   their souls. We order the same to be observed with regard to monks and
   other religious. Indeed, lest such persons be able to excuse themselves
   on the grounds of simplicity or ignorance, we order diocesan bishops to
   have this decree published throughout their dioceses every year.

Canon 65.

   Simony and extortion
   We have heard that certain bishops, on the death of rectors of
   churches, put these churches under an interdict and do not allow anyone
   to be instituted to them until they have been paid a certain sum of
   money. Moreover, when a knight or a cleric enters a religious house or
   chooses to be buried with religious, the bishops raise difficulties and
   obstacles until they receive something in the way of a present, even
   when the person has left nothing to the religious house. Since we
   should abstain not only from evil itself but also from every appearance
   of evil, as the Apostle says, we altogether forbid exactions of this
   kind. Any offender shall restore double the amount exacted, and this is
   to be faithfully used for the benefit of the places harmed by the
   exactions.

Canon 66.

   Simony and avarice in clerics
   It has frequently been reported to the apostolic see that certain
   clerics demand and extort payments for funeral rites for the dead, the
   blessing of those marrying, and the like; and if it happens that their
   greed is not satisfied, they deceitfully set up false impediments. On
   the other hand some lay people, stirred by a ferment of heretical
   wickedness, strive to infringe a praiseworthy custom of holy church,
   introduced by the pious devotion of the faithful, under the pretext of
   canonical scruples. We therefore both forbid wicked exactions to be
   made in these matters and order pious customs to be observed, ordaining
   that the church's sacraments are to be given freely but also that those
   who maliciously try to change a praiseworthy custom are to be
   restrained, when the truth is known, by the bishop of the place.

Canon 67.

   Jews and excessive Usury
   The more the christian religion is restrained from usurious practices,
   so much the more does the perfidy of the Jews grow in these matters, so
   that within a short time they are exhausting the resources of
   Christians. Wishing therefore to see that Christians are not savagely
   oppressed by Jews in this matter, we ordain by this synodal decree that
   if Jews in future, on any pretext, extort oppressive
   andexcessive interest from Christians, then they are to be removed from
   contact with Christians until they have made adequate satisfaction for
   the immoderate burden. Christians too, if need be, shall be compelled
   by ecclesiastical censure, without the possibility of an appeal, to
   abstain from commerce with them. We enjoin upon princes not to be
   hostile to Christians on this account, but rather to be zealous in
   restraining Jews from so great oppression. We decree, under the same
   penalty, that Jews shall be compelled to make satisfaction to churches
   for tithes and offerings due to the churches, which the churches were
   accustomed to receive from Christians for houses and other possessions,
   before they passed by whatever title to the Jews, so that the churches
   may thus be preserved from loss.

Canon 68.

   Jews appearing in public
   A difference of dress distinguishes Jews or Saracens from Christians in
   some provinces, but in others a certain confusion has developed so that
   they are indistinguishable. Whence it sometimes happens that by mistake
   Christians join with Jewish or Saracen women, and Jews or Saracens with
   christian women. In order that the offence of such a damnable mixing
   may not spread further, under the excuse of a mistake of this kind, we
   decree that such persons of either sex, in every christian province and
   at all times, are to be distinguished in public from other people by
   the character of their dress -- seeing moreover that this was enjoined
   upon them by Moses himself, as we read. They shall not appear in public
   at all on the days of lamentation and on passion Sunday; because some
   of them on such days, as we have heard, do not blush to parade in very
   ornate dress and are not afraid to mock Christians who are presenting a
   memorial of the most sacred passion and are displaying signs of grief.
   What we most strictly forbid however, is that they dare in any way to
   break out in derision of the Redeemer. We order secular princes to
   restrain with condign punishment those who do so presume, lest they
   dare to blaspheme in any way him who was crucified for us, since we
   ought not to ignore insults against him who blotted out our
   wrongdoings.

Canon 69.

   Jews not to hold public offices
   It would be too absurd for a blasphemer of Christ to exercise power
   over Christians. We therefore renew in this canon, on account of the
   boldness of the offenders, what the council of Toledo providently
   decreed in this matter : we forbid Jews to be appointed to public
   offices, since under cover of them they are very hostile to Christians.
   If, however, anyone does commit such an office to them let him, after
   an admonition, be curbed by the provincial council, which we order to
   be held annually, by means of an appropriate sanction. Any official so
   appointed shall be denied commerce with Christians in business and in
   other matters until he has converted to the use of poor Christians, in
   accordance with the directions of the diocesan bishop, whatever he has
   obtained from Christians by reason of his office so acquired, and he
   shall surrender with shame the office which he irreverently assumed. We
   extend the same thing to pagans.

Canon 70.

   Jewish converts may not retain their old rite
   Certain people who have come voluntarily to the waters of sacred
   baptism, as we learnt, do not wholly cast off the old person in order
   to put on the new more perfectly. For, in keeping remnants of their
   former rite, they upset the decorum of the christian religion by such a
   mixing. Since it is written, cursed is he who enters the land by two
   paths, and a garment that is woven from linen and wool together should
   not be put on, we therefore decree that such people shall be wholly
   prevented by the prelates of churches from observing their old rite, so
   that those who freely offered themselves to the christian religion may
   be kept to its observance by a salutary and necessary coercion. For it
   is a lesser evil not to know the Lord's way than to go back on it after
   having known it.

Canon 71.

   Crusade to recover the holy Land
   It is our ardent desire to liberate the holy Land from infidel hands.
   We therefore declare, with the approval of this sacred council and on
   the advice of prudent men who are fully aware of the circumstances of
   time and place, that crusaders are to make themselves ready so that all
   who have arranged to go by sea shall assemble in the kingdom of Sicily
   on 1 June after next : some as necessary and fitting at Brindisi and
   others at Messina and places neighbouring it on either side, where we
   too have arranged to be in person at that time, God willing, so that
   with our advice and help the christian army may be in good order to set
   out with divine and apostolic blessing. Those who have decided to go by
   land should also take care to be ready by the same date. They shall
   notify us meanwhile so that we may grant them a suitable legate a
   latere for advice and help. Priests and other clerics who will be in
   the christian army, both those under authority and prelates, shall
   diligently devote themselves to prayer and exhortation, teaching the
   crusaders by word and example to have the fear and love of God always
   before their eyes, so that they say or do nothing that might offend the
   divine majesty. If they ever fall into sin, let them quickly rise up
   again through true penitence. Let them be humble in heart and in body,
   keeping to moderation both in food and in dress, avoiding altogether
   dissensions and rivalries, and putting aside entirely any bitterness or
   envy, so that thus armed with spiritual and material weapons they may
   the more fearlessly fight against the enemies of the faith, relying not
   on their own power but rather trusting in the strength of God. We grant
   to these clerics that they may receive the fruits of their benefices in
   full for three years, as if they were resident in the churches, and if
   necessary they may leave them in pledge for the same time.
   To prevent this holy proposal being impeded or delayed, we strictly
   order all prelates of churches, each in his own locality, diligently to
   warn and induce those who have abandoned the cross to resume it, and
   them and others who have taken up the cross, and those who may still do
   so, to carry out their vows to the Lord. And if necessary they shall
   compel them to do this without any backsliding, by sentences of
   excommunication against their persons and of interdict on their lands,
   excepting only those persons who find themselves faced with an
   impediment of such a kind that their vow deservedly ought to be
   commuted or deferred in accordance with the directives of the apostolic
   see. In order that nothing connected with this business of Jesus Christ
   be omitted, we will and order patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, abbots
   and others who have the care of souls to preach the cross zealously to
   those entrusted to them. Let them beseech kings, dukes, princes,
   margraves, counts, barons and other magnates, as well as the
   communities of cities, vills and towns -- in the name of the Father,
   Son and holy Spirit, the one, only, true and eternal God -- that those
   who do not go in person to the aid of the holy Land should contribute,
   according to their means, an appropriate number of fighting men
   together with their necessary expenses for three years, for the
   remission of their sins in accordance with what has already been
   explained in general letters and will be explained below for still
   greater assurance. We wish to share in this remission not only those
   who contribute ships of their own but also those who are zealous enough
   to build them for this purpose. To those who refuse, if there happen to
   be any who are so ungrateful to our lord God, we firmly declare in the
   name of the apostle that they should know that they will have to answer
   to us for this on the last day of final judgment before the fearful
   judge. Let them consider beforehand, however with what conscience and
   with what security it was that they were able to confess before the
   only-begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ, to whom the Father gave all
   things into his hands, if in this business, which is as it were
   peculiarly his, they refuse to serve him who was crucified for sinners,
   by whose beneficence they are sustained and indeed by whose blood they
   have been redeemed.
   Lest we appear to be laying on men's shoulders heavy and unbearable
   burdens which we are not willing to lighten, like those who say yes but
   do nothing behold we, from what we have been able to save over and
   above necessities and moderate expenses, grant and give thirty thousand
   pounds to this work, besides the shipping which we are giving to the
   crusaders of Rome and neighbouring districts. We will assign for this
   purpose, moreover, three thousand marks of silver, which we have left
   over from the alms of certain of the faithful, the rest having been
   faithfully distributed for the needs and benefit of the aforesaid Land
   by the hands of the abbot patriarch of Jerusalem, of happy memory, and
   of the masters of the Temple and of the Hospital. We wish, however,
   that other prelates of churches and all clerics may participate and
   share both in the merit and in the reward. We therefore decree, with
   the general approval of the council, that all clerics, both those under
   authority and prelates, shall give a twentieth of their ecclesiastical
   revenues for three years to the aid of the holy Land, by means of the
   persons appointed by the apostolic see for this purpose; the only
   exceptions being certain religious who are rightly to be exempted from
   this taxation and likewise those persons who have taken or will take
   the cross and so will go in person. We and our brothers, cardinals of
   the holy Roman church, shall pay a full tenth. Let all know, moreover,
   that they are obliged to observe this faithfully under pain of
   excommunication, so that those who knowingly deceive in this matter
   shall incur the sentence of excommunication. Because it is right that
   those who persevere in the service of the heavenly ruler should in all
   justice enjoy special privilege, and because the day of departure is
   somewhat more than a year ahead, crusaders shall therefore be. exempt
   from taxes or levies and other burdens. We take their persons and goods
   under the protection of St Peter and ourself once they have taken up
   the cross. We ordain that they are to be protected by archbishops,
   bishops and all prelates of the church, and that protectors of their
   own are to be specially appointed for this purpose, so that their goods
   are to remain intact and undisturbed until they are known for certain
   to be dead or to have returned. If anyone dares to act contrary to
   this, let him be curbed by ecclesiastical censure.
   If any of those setting out are bound by oath to pay interest, we
   ordain that their creditors shall be compelled by the same punishment
   to release them from their oath and to desist from exacting the
   interest; if any of the creditors does force them to pay the interest,
   we command that he be forced by similar punishment to restore it. We
   order that Jews be compelled by the secular power to remit interest,
   and that until they do so all intercourse shall be denied them by all
   Christ's faithful under pain of excommunication. Secular princes shall
   provide a suitable deferral for those who cannot now pay their debts to
   Jews, so that after they have undertaken the journey and until there is
   certain knowledge of their death or of their return, they shall not
   incur the inconvenience of paying interest. The Jews shall be compelled
   to add to the capital, after they have deducted their necessary
   expenses, the revenues which they are meanwhile receiving from property
   held by them on security. For, such a benefit seems to entail not much
   loss, inasmuch as it postpones the repayment but does not cancel the
   debt. Prelates of churches who are negligent in showing justice to
   crusaders and their families should know that they will be severely
   punished.
   Furthermore, since corsairs and pirates greatly impede help for the
   holy Land, by capturing and plundering those who are travelling to and
   from it, we bind with the bond of excommunication everyone who helps or
   supports them. We forbid anyone, under threat of anathema, knowingly to
   communicate with them by contracting to buy or to sell; and we order
   rulers of cities and their territories to restrain and curb such
   persons from this iniquity. Otherwise, since to be unwilling to
   disquiet evildoers is none other than to encourage them, and since he
   who fails to oppose a manifest crime is not without a touch of secret
   complicity, it is our wish and command that prelates of churches
   exercise ecclesiastical severity against their persons and lands. We
   excommunicate and anathematize, moreover, those false and impious
   Christians who, in opposition to Christ and the christian people,
   convey arms to the Saracens and iron and timber for their galleys. We
   decree that those who sell them galleys or ships, and those who act as
   pilots in pirate Saracen ships, or give them any advice or help by way
   of machines or anything else, to the detriment of the holy Land, are to
   be punished with deprivation of their possessions and are to become the
   slaves of those who capture them. We order this sentence to be renewed
   on Sundays and feast-days in all maritime towns; and the bosom of the
   church is not to be opened to such persons unless they send in aid of
   the holy Land the whole of the damnable wealth which they received and
   the same amount of their own, so that they are punished in proportion
   to their offence. If perchance they do not pay, they are to be punished
   in other ways in order that through their punishment others may be
   deterred from venturing upon similar rash actions. In addition, we
   prohibit and on pain of anathema forbid all Christians, for four years,
   to send or take their ships across to the lands of the Saracens who
   dwell in the east, so that by this a greater supply of shipping may be
   made ready for those wanting to cross over to help the holy Land, and
   so that the aforesaid Saracens may be deprived of the not
   inconsiderable help which they have been accustomed to receiving from
   this.
   Although tournaments have been forbidden in a general way on pain of a
   fixed penalty at various councils, we strictly forbid them to be held
   for three years, under pain of excommunication, because the business of
   the crusade is much hindered by them at this present time. Because it
   is of the utmost necessity for the carrying out of this business that
   rulers of the christian people keep peace with each other, we therefore
   ordain, on the advice of this holy general synod, that peace be
   generally kept in the whole christian world for at least four years, so
   that those in conflict shall be brought by the prelates of churches to
   conclude a definitive peace or to observe inviolably a firm truce.
   Those who refuse to comply shall be most strictly compelled to do so by
   an excommunication against their persons and an interdict on their
   lands, unless their wrongdoing is so great that they ought not to enjoy
   peace. If it happens that they make light of the church's censure, they
   may deservedly fear that the secular power will be invoked by
   ecclesiastical authority against them as disturbers of the business of
   him who was crucified.
   We therefore, trusting in the mercy of almighty God and in the
   authority of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, do grant, by the
   power of binding and loosing that God has conferred upon us, albeit
   unworthy, unto all those who undertake this work in person and at their
   own expense, full pardon for their sins about which they are heartily
   contrite and have spoken in confession, and we promise them an increase
   of eternal life at the recompensing of the just; also to those who do
   not go there in person but send suitable men at their own expense,
   according to their means and status, and likewise to those who go in
   person but at others' expense, we grant full pardon for their sins. We
   wish and grant to share in this remission, according to the quality of
   their help and the intensity of their devotion, all who shall
   contribute suitably from their goods to the aid of the said Land or who
   give useful advice and help. Finally, this general synod imparts the
   benefit of its blessings to all who piously set out on this common
   enterprise in order that it may contribute worthily to their salvation.
