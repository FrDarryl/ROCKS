The Fourth General Council of Constantinople, 869-70

INTRODUCTION

   This council, designated as the eighth ecumenical council by western
   canonists, is not found in any canonical collections of the Byzantines;
   its acts and canons are completely ignored by them. Modern scholars
   have shown that it was included in the list of ecumenical councils only
   later, that is, after the eleventh century. We have decided to include
   the council, for the sake of historical completeness.
   Emperor Basil I and the patriarch Ignatius, after being restored to his
   see of Constantinople, asked Pope Nicholas I to call a council to
   decide about the bishops and priests who had been ordained by Photius.
   It was held at Constantinople after the arrival of legates from Pope
   Hadrian II, who had meanwhile succeeded Nicholas. These legates were
   Donatus, Stephen and Marinus and they presided at the council. It began
   in the cathedral of Hagia Sophia on 5 October 869. The tenth and last
   session was held on 28 February 870, when 27 canons were read out and
   approved by the council. All who were willing to sign the Liber
   satisfactionis, which had been sent by Pope Hadrian II, were admitted
   to the council. The account made by Anastasius contains the authentic
   list of those who signed the acts of the council. Emperor Basil I and
   his sons, Constantine and Leo, signed the acts after the patriarchs and
   in the same year they promulgated the council's decisions, after
   drawing up a decree for this purpose.
   As regards the canonical authority of these deliberations, various
   facts regarding the council held in the cathedral of Hagia Sophia in
   November 879, so that Photius might be restored to the see of
   Constantinople, should be remembered. Peter, a Roman cardinal, presided
   at this council. It took account of a letter of Pope John VIII, which
   had been sent to the emperor and translated into Greek. This reads
   (chapter 4): "We declare that the synod held at Rome against the most
   holy patriarch Photius in the time of the most blessed pope Hadrian, as
   well as the holy synod of Constantinople attacking the same most holy
   Photius (i.e., in 869-870), are totally condemned and abrogated and
   must in no way be invoked or named as synods. Let this not happen".
   Some people have thought that this text had been altered by Photius;
   but in the so-called "unaltered" text of the letter this passage is
   replaced by dots (. . .), and the following passage reads: "For the see
   of blessed Peter, the key-bearer of the heavenly kingdom, has the power
   to dissolve, after suitable appraisal, any bonds imposed by bishops.
   This is so because it is agreed that already many patriarchs, for
   example Athanasius .. .. after having been condemned by a synod, have
   been, after formal acquittal by the apostolic see, promptly
   reinstated". Ivo of Chartres explicitly affirms: "The synod of
   Constantinople which was held against Photius must not be recognised.
   John VIII wrote to the patriarch Photius (in 879): We make void that
   synod which was held against Photius at Constantinople and we have
   completely blotted it out for various reasons as well as for the fact
   that Pope Hadrian did not sign its acts". Ivo adds from the
   instructions that John VIII gave to his legates for the council in 879:
   "You will say that, as regards the synods which were held against
   Photius under Pope Hadrian at Rome or Constantinople, we annul them and
   wholly exclude them from the number of the holy synods". For these
   reasons there is no ground for thinking that the text was altered by
   Photius.
   An authentic copy of the acts of the council of 869-870 was sent to
   Rome, as of right. Anastasius, the librarian, ordered a complete copy
   to be made for himself. Then, when the legates' copy was stolen, he
   translated his own copy into Latin, on Pope Hadrian's orders, making a
   word for word translation. Anastasius also makes it plain that the
   Greeks adopted every means to distort the acts, "by abbreviating here
   and by expanding or changing there". He adds: "Whatever is found in the
   Latin copy of the acts of the eighth synod is completely free from the
   alloy of falsehood; however, whatever more is found in the Greek text
   is thoroughly infected with poisonous lies".
   The Greek text has been partly preserved from total destruction in the
   summary of an anonymous writer who copied out anti-Photian texts. This
   summary has 14 canons, as opposed to the 27 of Anastasius, and only
   contains excerpts, dealing with the most important points, of these
   canons. Where comparison is possible, the Latin version of Anastasius
   hardly departs from the Greek text. Indeed it is so literal that at
   times it can only be understood by comparison with the Greek text, and
   when the latter is missing we must sometimes rely on conjecture.

[Definition of the holy and universal eighth synod]

   The holy, great and universal synod, which was assembled by God's will
   and the favour of our divinely approved emperors Basil and Constantine,
   the holy friends of Christ, in this royal and divinely protected city
   and in the most famous church bearing the name of holy and great
   Wisdom, declared the following.
   The Word, of one nature with the almighty God and Father, is he who
   established heaven like a vault and fixed the ends of the earth and the
   place of all other things. He made it to be contingent and he rules,
   preserves and saves it. He says through the voice of the prophet,
   Isaiah: Lift up your eyes to heaven, because heaven has been fashioned
   like smoke, but the earth shall wear out like a garment; its
   inhabitants shall perish like them; but my salvation shall last for
   ever and my justice shall not fail. He was made like us for our sake
   and has established on earth heavenly justice and said, Heaven and
   earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away. He said to all
   who believed in him: If you continue in my word, you will truly be my
   disciples, and you will know the truth and the truth will make you
   free.
   It was our God and Lord of infinite power alone who, just like a farmer
   of supreme wisdom and power, uprooted and scattered and rightfully
   obliterated many others from an earlier time and from long ago who,
   given over to lies and in opposition to the truth, were sowing -- to
   use the gospel image -- evil tares in his field, that is, in the
   church, and were trying to overwhelm the pure grain of divine justice.
   He always prepared his manner of deliverance so as to give warning, he
   established his justice and revealed it with greater clarity. But
   nevertheless, in our time too, the sower of tares is trying to make the
   field of the church useless through some utterly depraved and impious
   people. With that one and the same providence, he has shown that this
   field is worthy of compassion and snatched it from the filth of
   iniquity and called it back to its ancient purity. For, to destroy
   injustice and reinforce divine justice, he has raised up, as an
   unwavering follower of his commandments, a person proved to be
   incorrupt in both his knowledge and his maintenance of the truth, our
   most devout and serene emperor, who is a friend of divine justice and
   an enemy of injustice. He, by means of the divine help and the overall
   favour of the church, has gathered together architects from the ends of
   the earth into this royal city, which must be built up by God, and has
   assembled a universal synod which, while guarding the strong defences
   of
     * the gospel sanctions,
     * the laws of Moses and the prophets together with
     * the commands of the apostles
     * and fathers as well as of
     * the councils,

   has revived the established forms of right conduct and proclaimed truth
   and justice in the courts of the church.
   {Now the customary recapitulation and reassertion of all previous
   ecumenical councils}
   Consequently, all of us bishops who have come to take part in the synod
   and to strengthen the true and undefiled faith of Christians and the
   teaching of orthodox religion, we declare our belief in one God, in
   three persons consubstantial, divine and autonomous, as, for example,
   we may look at the one nature of light in three suns not unlike each
   other or in the same number of dazzling objects. We confess, indeed,
   God to be one, unique in respect of substance, but threefold or three
   if we are speaking of him in respect of persons, and we declare he has
   not received from himself that he has been made, nor in any way
   whatsoever from anyone else; but that he is alone, ever existing
   without beginning, and eternal, ever the same and like to himself, and
   suffering no change or alteration, that he exists as the maker and
   source of all beings endowed with intelligence and feeling. For the
   holy and great synod of { 1 } Nicaea spoke thus when expounding the
   creed: Light from light, true God, clearly declaring the Son to be from
   the Father who is true God, and the rest as the catholic church
   received it. We too, accepting this in the identical meaning,
   anathematize as of unsound mind and an enemy of the truth, Arius and
   all who, with him and following him, speculate with faulty perceptions
   on the term "hetero-substantial", that is otherness of substance and
   unlikeness, with reference to the divinely-ruling and blessed Trinity.
   But no less do we accept the second, holy and universal synod {2
   Constantinople I}, and we anathematize that adversary of the Spirit or
   rather adversary of God, Macedonius; for we admit in the distinction of
   persons no difference of substance between the Father, the Son and the
   divine and autonomous Spirit, as the aforementioned heresiarchs did,
   nor do we confuse, like the lunatic Sabellius, the persons in one and
   the same substance. Moreover, we also confess that the unique Word of
   God became incarnate and was made like us for our sake, for it was not
   an angel or an envoy but the Lord himself who came and saved us and was
   made Emmanuel with us; and he was true God, God of Israel and saviour
   of all, in accordance with the divine and prophetic utterances. For
   this reason we confess that Mary, most holy and without experience of
   marriage, who bore him, is properly and truly mother of God, just as
   the third universal synod, which first assembled at { 3 } Ephesus,
   proclaimed. In union with that council we too anathematize Nestorius,
   that worshipper of the man and most self-opinionated individual who
   possessed a Jewish mentality. We teach that the one and same Christ and
   Lord is twofold, that is, perfect God and perfect man, possessing in
   one person the differences of each nature but keeping their properties
   always unchangeable and unconfused, just as the fourth, holy and
   universal synod {4 Chalcedon } solemnly taught. In accepting this synod
   together with the three councils previously enumerated, just like the
   quadruplicity of the holy gospels, we anathematize the insane Eutyches
   and the mad Dioscorus. In addition, proclaiming the two natures in the
   one Christ, according to the still clearer teaching of the fifth, holy
   and universal synod { 5 Constantinople II}, we anathematize Severus ,
   Peter and Zoharas the Syrian, as well as Origen with his useless
   knowledge, Theodore of Mopsuestia and Didymus along with Evagrius, who
   also, although of the same or different opinions, were ensnared in the
   same pit of damnation.
   Further, we accept the sixth, holy and universal synod {6
   Constantinople III}, which shares the same beliefs and is in harmony
   with the previously mentioned synods in that it wisely laid down that
   in the two natures of the one Christ there are, as a consequence, two
   principles of action and the same number of wills. So, we anathematize
   Theodore who was bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter,
   the unholy prelates of the church of Constantinople, and with these,
   Honorius of Rome, Cyrus of Alexandria as well as Macarius of Antioch
   and his disciple Stephen, who followed the false teachings of the
   unholy heresiarchs Apollinarius, Eutyches and Severus and proclaimed
   that the flesh of God, while being animated by a rational and
   intellectual soul, was without a principle of action and without a
   will, they themselves being impaired in their senses and truly without
   reason. For if the one and same Christ and God exists as perfect God
   and perfect man, it is most certain that none of the natures which
   belong to him can exist partially without a will or without a principle
   of action, but that he carried out the mystery of his stewardship when
   willing and acting in accordance with each substance; this is how the
   chorus of all God's spokesmen, having knowledge of it from the apostles
   down to our own time, have constructed a colourful representation of
   that human form, assigning to each part of the one Christ natural
   properties distinct from each other, by which the meanings and
   conceptions of his divine nature and of his human nature are believed
   beyond all doubt to remain without confusion.
   We also know that the seventh, holy and universal synod, held for the
   second time at { 7 } Nicaea, taught correctly when it professed the one
   and same Christ as both invisible and visible lord, incomprehensible
   and comprehensible, unlimited and limited, incapable and capable of
   suffering, inexpressible and expressible in writing. In agreement with
   that synod, this holy and universal synod publicly anathematizes
   Anastasius , Constantine and Nicetas , that irrational prelature whose
   name stinks, or, to put it better, that plain corruption; so too
   Theodosius of Ephesus, Sisinnius Pastilas and Basil Tricacabus, not
   forgetting Theodoret, Antony and John, once prelates of new Rome, the
   royal city of Christians, but better called defamers of Christ. They
   declared by word and deed that, despite what the list of prophets
   proclaimed about Christ, he had been incapable of destroying the
   statues of the idols. Furthermore, we also anathematize Theodore, who
   was called Krithinos, whom this great and holy synod summoned and
   condemned and loudly dinned an anathema into his ears. Similarly we
   anathematize all those who agreed with or supported those who said that
   the Word of the divine incarnation came about and existed by fantasy
   and supposition, indeed that through the removal of the image of our
   Christ and saviour there came the simultaneous removal of the accepted
   form of the true body which bore God within it. Everything which cannot
   be grasped by the imagination is surely to be understood in two ways,
   either as not existing or as in fact existing but minimally
   understandable, inasmuch as being invisible and hidden.
   Therefore, if anyone happens to have taught any of these things about
   Christ the God and saviour of us all, he will be clearly proclaimed an
   enemy of true religion, since the first of these declares that Emmanuel
   was not truly made man and the second declares that he was indeed man
   but lacked human qualities, laid aside the flesh he assumed and had
   recourse in everything to his divine [nature] and to his
   incomprehensibility; this is alien to all the divinely inspired
   scriptures, which also clearly state that he will come once more as
   judge of all, and he is to be seen in the same way as he was seen by
   his disciples and apostles when he was taken up into heaven.
   That theory is full of Manichaean ideas and ungodliness inasmuch as it
   foolishly declares that a saying of the divinely inspired David was
   spoken about Christ, in which it says, He has set his tabernacle in the
   sun, since this impiety supposes that the casting off and laying aside
   of the Lord's deified body is meant. But the word of truth confidently
   says, both concerning the well-named Manes and all those who share his
   thought and are authors of the heresy about the destruction of icons
   and all other heresiarchs and enemies of religion: They have not known
   nor understood, but they walked in darkness. 0 you who abandon the
   right way and walk in the way of darkness, who rejoice in wrongdoing
   and exult in evil conversion; O you whose paths are evil and steps
   crooked so that they take you far from the right way and make you
   foreign to right thinking! Again, those who sowed what was corrupted by
   the wind have received destruction as their reward; and again, He that
   trusts in lies feeds the winds: and the same person runs after birds
   that fly away. For he has abandoned the rows of his vines, he wanders
   in the furrows of his field; for he wanders through a waterless desert
   and a great parched plain, yet gathers no fruit in his hands.
   For this reasons [the church] brands all these with an anathema and,
   besides recognizing the seven, holy and universal synods already
   enumerated by us, has gathered together this eighth universal synod
   through the grace of our all powerful Christ and God and the piety and
   zeal of our most serene and divinely strengthened emperor, to cut down
   and destroy the shoots of injustice that have sprung up against those
   synods, together with the evil stirrings and influences, in order to
   bring about peaceful order in the church and stability in the world.
   For it is not only the removal of true teaching which knows how to
   destroy those of evil mind and to agitate and disturb the church, but
   also quibbling over the meaning of the divine commandments equally
   brings the same destruction on those who are not vigilant, and the
   world is filled with storms and disturbances by those who are reckoned
   as Christians.
   {Now the council strikes out on its own}
   This is what happened in recent times through the folly, cunning and
   evil machinations of the wretched Photius. He entered the sheepfold not
   through the door but through a window, and, like a thief or a robber, a
   destroyer of souls, as the Lord's words indicate, has tried, on every
   occasion and by every means, to steal, slaughter and destroy the
   right-thinking sheep of Christ and, by engineering all manner of
   persecution, he has not ceased from contriving numerous arrests and
   imprisonments, confiscations of property, protracted periods of exile
   and, in addition to these, accusations, charges, false testimonies and
   forgeries against all who worked for true religion and fought for the
   truth. For he, like another Severus or Dioscorus, engineered the
   expulsion of the most just, lawful and canonically appointed high
   priest of the church of Constantinople, namely the most holy patriarch
   Ignatius, and like an adulterous robber, breaking into his see and
   repeatedly submitting him to a thousand charges involving dethronement
   and as many anathemas, he roused continuous turmoil and storms for all
   the churches of Christ our saviour, in a multiplicity of ways.
   However, the salt of the earth has not lost its savour, nor has the eye
   of the church become completely darkened, nor has the light of true
   religion been extinguished by the spirits of wickedness; nor has the
   fire of divine charity lost its destroying and burning power over
   sinful and worthless material, nor has the word of the Lord, which is
   sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of thoughts, been found
   ineffectual, nor did the foundation of solid stone collapse when
   submerged by swollen waters and floods of rivers and storms, but the
   precious cornerstone, which was laid down in Sion, that is, in the
   church, upon which the foundation stone of the apostles and prophets
   was laid for the building up of the church, in our time has sent out
   from every one of the church's established ranks, even into the ruling
   city, the new Rome, many other stones rolling over the land, as the
   prophet says, to destroy and lay waste the intrigues of those who
   desired and attempted to destroy truth and divine justice.
   But with greater force and particular significance, Nicholas, the most
   blessed and aptly-named pope of old Rome, was sent from above as
   another cornerstone for the church, preserving as far as possible the
   figurative likeness, as from an exalted and pre-eminent place, to
   confront the carefully organised opposition of Photius. By the missiles
   of his letters and speeches, he struck down the powerful leading
   supporters of Photius and, reflecting a story of the old Testament,
   after the manner of the zealot Phinehas, he pierced Photius with the
   lance of truth as if he were another Midianite defiling the assembly of
   Israel; and he completely destroyed him on his not [added in Hrd [1]]
   agreeing to accept the remedies of a healing discipline aimed at
   treating the scars and healing the adulterous wound, and just as
   another Peter dealt with Ananias and Sapphira, who stole what belonged
   to God, by an anathema included as it were in his priestly dignity, he
   committed him to death.
   Following these directives and decrees, the most religious friend of
   Christ, our emperor, whom the heavenly Emperor and Lord of majesty has
   raised up for the salvation of the world, has consigned Photius to a
   suitable place and recalled the most holy patriarch Ignatius to his
   rightful seat. Furthermore, for the perfect discernment and definition
   of what is agreed to be good and is beneficial, he has gathered
   together vicars from all the patriarchal seats and the whole college of
   bishops which is under his authority. Those of us who came together
   have celebrated this great and universal synod and, with much
   examination, testing and discussion, with due care and consistency, we
   have cut out with the sword of the spirit the roots of scandals and
   weeds along with their shoots, as we establish the truly innocent and
   most holy patriarch Ignatius in the controlling seat, while we condemn
   Photius, the interloper and illegal occupier with all his supporters
   and promoters of evil. For almighty God says somewhere by the mouth of
   a prophet: Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them
   out of my house. I will do no more to love them. Ephraim is stricken,
   their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; and again: Canaan,
   there is a deceitful balance in his hand, he has loved oppression. And
   Ephraim said: But yet I am become rich, I have found for myself a place
   of repose: all his labours shall not find me, despite the iniquities
   that I have committed; and again: And the house of Jacob shall possess
   their own possessions. The house of Jacob shall be afire and the house
   of Joseph aflame, and the house of Esau stubble; they shall burn them
   and consume them, and there shall be no survivor to the house of Esau,
   for the Lord has spoken.
   For the wretched Photius was truly like the person who did not make God
   his refuge; but trusted in the abundance of his cunning and sought
   refuge in the vanity of his iniquities, following the example of
   Ephraim of old, in turning his back on the divine mercy; the word of
   the prophet mocks and derides him, saying: Ephraim is become as bread
   baked under ashes, that is not turned. Strangers have devoured his
   strength and he knew it not, grey hairs also are spread upon him, and
   he is ignorant of it. He shall be humbled by the insult of Israel
   before his face; and in all this he has not returned to the Lord, his
   God. Ephraim is become as a dove, that called upon the table of Egypt
   and went to the Assyrians. When they shall go, I will spread my net
   upon them as upon the birds of the air; I will bring them down, I will
   strike them to make their tribulation heard. For Photius was lifted up
   to the heights of arrogance in attacking the most blessed pope of old
   Rome, Nicholas, and he vomited out the poison of his evil. He gathered
   together false vicars from three supposedly eastern sees, set up what
   was thought to be a synodical council, and, making lists of the names
   of accusers and witnesses, fashioning profiles and speeches which
   seemed to be suited to each person who plays a part in a synodical
   investigation, and making up, writing down and organizing forged
   records as accounts of those proceedings, he had the audacity to
   anathematize the aforementioned most blessed pope Nicholas and all
   those in communion with him. Photius did this in such a way that as a
   result all the existing bishops and priests, that is, the other
   patriarchal sees and all the clerics within them, were included in the
   same anathema, for all were most certainly in communion with the
   leading bishop, and amongst them himself and his followers. The word of
   the prophet condemns and refutes him when it says: They have multiplied
   their transgressions, they have enacted extraneous laws and invoked
   their confession; and again: They conceived in their heart lying words
   and turned justice back, and righteousness has stood afar off from
   them; for truth has been destroyed in their streets and they have been
   unable to follow the right path. Truth has disappeared and changed
   their mind so that it cannot understand. And: He who turns from evil is
   attacked, and the Lord saw and it displeased him because there was no
   judgment, and again: Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of
   Judah and for four, I will grant them no reprieve; because they have
   rejected the law of the Lord and have not kept his statutes. Therefore,
   as regards the man who has acted in this way and has disturbed and
   shaken the whole holy, catholic and apostolic church with so many
   brazen attacks of this kind, has utterly refused to be converted and
   repent, and has refused to submit to the decrees and judgment of the
   holy patriarchal sees, just as long ago the most blessed pope Nicholas
   and then his successor, the most holy pope Hadrian,
   ·  anathematized him, so too this holy and universal synod has reproved
   him and put him under an ever severer anathema while addressing to him,
   in the person of all God's people, the words of the prophet Isaiah:
   Just as a garment soiled in blood will not be clean, so you will not be
   clean, for you have defiled the church of Christ and have been a source
   of scandal and destruction to the people of God on many counts and in
   many ways. We command that those who do not share this view, but give
   Photius their willing support, if they are bishops or clerics, must be
   deposed for ever; we anathematize monks or lay people, until such time
   as they are converted from their false ways and wickedness.

Canons

Canon 1.

   If we wish to proceed without offence along the true and royal road of
   divine justice, we must keep the declarations and teachings of the holy
   fathers as if they were so many lamps which are always alight and
   illuminating our steps which are directed towards God. Therefore,
   considering and esteeming these as a second word of God, in accordance
   with the great and most wise Denis, let us sing most willingly along
   with the divinely inspired David, The commandment of the Lord is
   bright, enlightening the eyes, and, Your word is a lamp to my feet and
   a light to my paths; and with the author of Proverbs we say, Your
   commandment is a lamp and your law a light, and like Isaiah we cry to
   the lord God with loud voice, because your commands are a light for the
   earth. For the exhortations and warnings of the divine canons are
   rightly likened to light inasmuch as the better is distinguished from
   the worse and what is advantageous and useful is distinguished from
   what is not helpful but harmful.
   Therefore we declare that we are preserving and maintaining the canons
   which have been entrusted to the holy, catholic and apostolic church by
   the holy and renowned apostles, and by universal as well as local
   councils of orthodox [bishops], and even by any inspired father or
   teacher of the church. Consequently, we rule our own life and conduct
   by these canons and we decree that all those who have the rank of
   priests and all those who are described by the name of Christian are,
   by ecclesiastical law, included under the penalties and condemnations
   as well as, on the other hand, the absolutions and acquittals which
   have been imposed and defined by them. For Paul, the great apostle,
   openly urges us to preserve the traditions which we have received,
   either by word or by letter, of the saints who were famous in times
   past.

Canon 2.

   Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over
   your souls, as persons who will have to give account, commands Paul,
   the great apostle. So, having both the most blessed pope Nicholas as
   the instrument of the holy Spirit and his successor, the most holy pope
   Hadrian, we declare and order that everything which has been expounded
   and promulgated by them in a synod at various times, both for the
   defence and well-being of the church of Constantinople and of its chief
   priest, namely Ignatius, its most holy patriarch, as well as for the
   expulsion and condemnation of Photius, the upstart and usurper, should
   be maintained and observed together with the canons there set forth,
   unchanged and unaltered, and no bishop, priest or deacon or anyone from
   the ranks of the clergy should dare to overturn or reject any of these
   things.
   Whoever, then, shall be found, after these directives of ours,
   despising any of the articles or decrees which have been promulgated by
   these popes, must be stripped of his dignity and rank, if he is a
   priest or cleric; a monk or lay person, of whatever dignity, must be
   excommunicated until he repents and promises to observe all the decrees
   in question.

Canon 3.

   We decree that the sacred image of our lord Jesus Christ, the redeemer
   and saviour of all people, should be venerated with honour equal to
   that given to the book of the holy gospels. For, just as through the
   written words which are contained in the book, we all shall obtain
   salvation, so through the influence that colours in painting exercise
   on the imagination, all, both wise and simple, obtain benefit from what
   is before them; for as speech teaches and portrays through syllables,
   so too does painting by means of colours. It is only right then, in
   accordance with true reason and very ancient tradition, that icons
   should be honoured and venerated in a derivative way because of the
   honour which is given to their archetypes, and it should be equal to
   that given to the sacred book of the holy gospels and the
   representation of the precious cross.
   If anyone then does not venerate the icon of Christ, the saviour, let
   him not see his face when he comes in his father's glory to be
   glorified and to glorify his saints', but let him be cut off from his
   communion and splendour; similarly the image of Mary, his immaculate
   mother and mother of God, we also paint the icons of the holy angels
   just as divine scripture depicts them in words; we also honour and
   venerate those of the highly renowned apostles, prophets, martyrs and
   holy men as well as those of all the saints. Let those who are not so
   disposed be anathema from the Father, the Son and the holy Spirit.

Canon 4.

   In tearing up by the roots the love of power, as being an evil root
   nourishing the scandals which have arisen in the church, we condemn,
   with a just decree, him who boldly, cunningly and unlawfully, like a
   dangerous wolf, leapt into the sheepfold of Christ; we are speaking
   about Photius, who has filled the whole world with a thousand upheavals
   and disturbances. We declare that he never was nor is now a bishop, nor
   must those, who were consecrated or given advancement by him to any
   grade of the priesthood, remain in that state to which they were
   promoted. Moreover, we debar from this kind of preferment those who
   received from Photius the customary rescripts for promotion to special
   office.
   As for the churches which Photius and those who were ordained by him
   are thought to have consecrated and the altars which they are thought
   to have renovated after they had been torn down, we decree that they
   are to be consecrated, anointed and renovated again. In sum, everything
   that was done in his person and by him, for the establishing or
   penalizing of the sacerdotal state, has been abrogated. For the God of
   the whole universe says through his prophet: Because you have rejected
   knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me and, You have
   forgotten the laws of your God, I also will forget your children. The
   more they increased, the more they sinned against me; I will change
   their glory into shame. They feed on the sin of my people; they bloat
   their souls with their iniquities. And again he says: Because Ephraim
   has multiplied altars for sinning, they have become to him altars for
   sins; 1 will write copiously about them.

Canon 5.

   Since we desire to ensure, in Christ, that the stability of the canons
   should always remain firm in the churches, we renew and confirm the
   limits and conditions which were formerly decreed by the holy apostles
   and our holy fathers and which made it a law in the church that nobody,
   who is a neophyte in the faith or priestly office, should be made a
   bishop, lest he be puffed up and fall into the judgment and snare of
   the devil, as the Apostle says. Therefore, in accordance with the
   previous canons, we declare that nobody of senatorial rank or a secular
   way of life, who has recently been admitted to the tonsure with the
   intention or expectation of the honour of becoming a bishop or
   patriarch, and who has been made a cleric or monk, should rise to such
   a level, even if he is shown to have completed a considerable time in
   each stage of the divine priesthood. For it is clear that the tonsure
   was not received for religious reasons, love of God or hope of
   progressing along the path of the virtues, but for love of glory and
   honour. We exclude such people still more rigorously if they are pushed
   forward by imperial backing.
   However, if someone gives no suspicion of seeking the worldly benefits
   just mentioned, but, prompted by the actual good of a humility which is
   centered on Christ, renounces the world and becomes a cleric or monk
   and, while passing through every ecclesiastical grade, is found without
   reproach and of good character during the periods of time currently
   established, so that he completes one year in the order of lector, two
   in that of subdeacon, three as deacon and four as priest, this holy and
   universal synod has decreed that such a one may be chosen and admitted.
   As for those who have remained religiously in the order of cleric or
   monk and have been judged worthy of the dignity and honour of the
   episcopacy, we reduce the aforesaid period of time to that which the
   superiors of these bishops approved at the time. If, however, anyone
   has been advanced to this supreme honour contrary to this directive of
   ours, he must be condemned and completely excluded from all priestly
   functions, because he has been elevated contrary to the sacred canons.

Canon 6.

   It appears that Photius, after the sentences and condemnations most
   justly pronounced against him by the most holy pope Nicholas for his
   criminal usurpation of the church of Constantinople, in addition to his
   other evil deeds, found some men of wicked and sycophantic character
   from the squares and streets of the city and proposed and designated
   them as vicars of the three most holy patriarchal sees in the east. He
   formed with these a church of evil-doers and a fraudulent council and
   set in motion accusations and charges entailing deposition against the
   most blessed pope Nicholas and repeatedly, impudently and boldly issued
   anathemas against him and all those in communion with him. The records
   of all these things have been seen by us, records which were cobbled
   together by him with evil intent and lying words, and all of which have
   been burnt during this very synod.
   Therefore, to safeguard church order, we anathematize first and
   foremost the above-mentioned Photius for the reason given; next
   everyone who henceforth acts deceitfully and fraudulently and falsifies
   the word of truth and goes through the motions of having false vicars
   or composes books full of deceptions and explains them in favour of his
   own designs. With equal vigour Martin, the most holy pope of Rome, a
   valiant contender for the true faith, rejected behaviour of this kind
   by a synodal decree.

Canon 7.

   Moses, the divine spokesman, clearly declares in his law that what is
   right should also be rightly executed, since a good act is not good
   unless it is carried out in accordance with reason. So it is indeed
   good and very advantageous to paint holy and venerable images as also
   to teach others the disciplines of divine and human wisdom. But it is
   not good nor at all profitable for any of these things to be done by
   those who are unworthy.
   For this reason we declare and proclaim that those declared anathema by
   this holy and universal synod may not, on any account, work on sacred
   images in holy places of worship nor teach anywhere at all, until they
   are converted from their error and wickedness. Whoever, therefore,
   after this directive of ours, admits them in any way to paint sacred
   images in churches, or to teach, must be removed from office if he is a
   cleric; if he is a lay person, he must be excommunicated and debarred
   from taking part in the divine mysteries.

Canon 8.

   The great apostle Paul says somewhere: All things are lawful for me,
   but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not
   all things are beneficial. Therefore, we ought to do everything for the
   advantage and perfection of the holy church of God and nothing at all
   to promote controversy and vainglory. Since a report has come to our
   ears that not only heretics and those who have wrongly obtained the
   patriarchate of Constantinople, but also the orthodox and legitimate
   patriarchs, demand and extract from the order of priests guarantees,
   written in their own hands, which are designed for the security,
   benefit and, as it were, permanence of the above persons, it has
   therefore seemed good to this holy and universal synod that nobody at
   all should do this from now on, with the exception of what is demanded
   at the time of episcopal consecrations, according to rule and custom,
   in order to witness to the purity of our faith; every other way of
   doing it is completely inappropriate and has no part in the building up
   of the church. So whoever dares to nullify this directive of ours,
   either by asking for such a document or by providing it to those who
   ask, shall lose his own office.

Canon 9.

   From the very beginning the wretched Photius brought about in the
   church of Constantinople an abundance of all kinds of wickedness. We
   have learnt that even before his tyrannical period in office he used to
   give documents, signed by his own hand, to his followers who were
   learning the wisdom that has been made foolish by God, even though this
   system was clearly a new invention and thoroughly alien to our holy
   fathers and doctors of the church.
   Since therefore they direct us to loose every bond of wickedness and to
   make void enforced contracts, the holy and universal synod has declared
   that nobody, from now on, should hold or keep such a contract, but all,
   without hindrance, hesitation or fear, may both teach and study if they
   are competent for either task, with the exception of those who are
   found to be enslaved to error or heretical beliefs since we strictly
   forbid such persons to teach or to pursue studies. If anyone shall be
   found rejecting and transgressing against this directive, he shall lose
   his rank if he is a cleric; if a lay person, he shall be excommunicated
   as one who does not believe the Lord's word which says, Whatever you
   bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth
   shall be loosed in heaven .

Canon 10.

   As divine scripture clearly proclaims, Do not find fault before you
   investigate, and understand first and then find fault, and does our law
   judge a person without first giving him a hearing and learning what he
   does?. Consequently this holy and universal synod justly and fittingly
   declares and lays down that no lay person or monk or cleric should
   separate himself from communion with his own patriarch before a careful
   enquiry and judgment in synod, even if he alleges that he knows of some
   crime perpetrated by his patriarch, and he must not refuse to include
   his patriarch's name during the divine mysteries or offices.
   In the same way we command that bishops and priests who are in distant
   dioceses and regions should behave similarly towards their own
   metropolitans, and metropolitans should do the same with regard to
   their own patriarchs. If anyone shall be found defying this holy synod,
   he is to be debarred from all priestly functions and status if he is a
   bishop or cleric; if a monk or lay person, he must be excluded from all
   communion and meetings of the church until he is converted by
   repentance and reconciled.

Canon 11.

   Though the old and new Testament teach that a man or woman has one
   rational and intellectual soul, and all the fathers and doctors of the
   church, who are spokesmen of God, express the same opinion, some have
   descended to such a depth of irreligion, through paying attention to
   the speculations of evil people, that they shamelessly teach as a dogma
   that a human being has two souls, and keep trying to prove their heresy
   by irrational means using a wisdom that has been made foolishness.
   Therefore this holy and universal synod is hastening to uproot this
   wicked theory now growing like some loathsome form of weed. Carrying in
   its hand the winnowing fork of truth, with the intention of consigning
   all the chaff to inextinguishable fire, and making clean the threshing
   floor of Christ, in ringing tones it declares anathema the inventors
   and perpetrators of such impiety and all those holding similar views;
   it also declares and promulgates that nobody at all should hold or
   preserve in any way the written teaching of the authors of this
   impiety. If however anyone presumes to act in a way contrary to this
   holy and great synod, let him be anathema and an outcast from the faith
   and way of life of Christians.

Canon 12

   The apostolic and conciliar canons clearly forbid the nomination and
   consecration of bishops which have come about as a result of the power
   and intrigues of the civil authorities. Therefore we declare and
   proclaim, in full agreement with them, that if any bishop has received
   his consecration through the manipulation and constraint of such
   persons, he should be deposed absolutely as one who has desired and
   consented to have the gift of God not from the will of God and
   ecclesiastical law and decree, but from human beings and through their
   machinations as a result of the prompting of carnal desire.

Canon 13

   The divine word says, The worker is worthy of his pay For this reason
   we too decree and proclaim that the clerics of the great church [of
   Constantinople], who have served in the lower orders, may rise to the
   higher grades and, if they have shown themselves worthy, may deservedly
   enjoy higher dignities, since some of those who now enjoy them either
   will be called through promotion to more important duties or will
   vacate them by dying. But those who do not belong to this particular
   clergy and yet insinuate themselves into it, must not receive the
   dignities and honours due to those who have laboured in it a long time,
   for in that case the clerics of the church [of Constantinople] would be
   found to have no promotion.
   Those who manage the houses or estates of leading persons must by no
   means have the possibility of being admitted or inducted into the
   clergy of the great church [of Constantinople]: No soldier on service
   for God gets entangled in civilian pursuits. If indeed anyone, contrary
   to the directive we have now issued, is promoted to any dignity
   whatsoever in this great church, he must be excluded from all
   ecclesiastical dignity as one who has been promoted contrary to the
   decision of the great synod.

Canon 14

   We declare that those who are called by divine grace to the office of
   bishop, since they bear the image and likeness of the holy hierarchies
   in heaven, that is of the angels, in accordance with what is clearly an
   hierarchical dignity and function, should be held as worthy of all
   honour on the part of everyone, rulers and ruled alike.
   We also declare that they must not go to meet a general or any other
   high official a long way from their churches, nor should they dismount
   from their horses or mules a long way off or bow down in fear and
   trembling and prostrate themselves; nor should they go to table for
   dinner with secular dignitaries and show the same honours as they do to
   generals, but according to what is in keeping with their own spiritual
   dignity and honour, they should render to everyone his due: Tribute to
   whom tribute is due, honour to whom honour is due. They must show that
   the confessors of the emperors, who are friends of Christ, and those
   who have the same dignity, deserve great respect from the leading
   persons of those emperors. Thus the bishop will have the courage to
   reprimand generals and other leading officials and all other secular
   authorities as often as he finds them doing something unjust or
   unreasonable, and in this way to correct them and make them better.
   But if some bishop, after the holy directive of this council, shall
   ignore the honour duly and canonically bestowed on him, and permits
   something to happen according to the old, debased and disordered custom
   which is contrary to what has now been declared, he must be suspended
   for a year and the official involved is to be considered unworthy to
   take part in the mysteries or the means of grace for two years.

Canon 15

   This holy and universal synod, in renewing the canons of the apostles
   and fathers, has decreed that no bishop may sell or in any way dispose
   of precious objects or consecrated vessels except for the reason laid
   down long ago by the ancient canons, that is to say, objects received
   for the redemption of captives. They must not hand over endowments of
   churches by emphyteutic leases nor put on sale other agricultural
   properties, thereby damaging ecclesiastical revenues. We decree that
   such revenues are for church purposes, the feeding of the poor and the
   assistance of pilgrims. However, bishops have full powers to improve
   and enlarge, as opportunity offers, the ecclesiastical properties which
   produce these revenues. Moreover, they have the right to apportion or
   bestow their own property on whomsoever they wish and choose, in
   accordance with their own powers and rights of ownership.
   Now that this decree has been made, whoever appears to have acted in a
   way contrary to this holy and universal synod, must be deposed on the
   grounds of violating divine law and precepts. Any sale which was made
   by the bishop, either in writing or otherwise, must be made entirely
   void, as well as any emphyteutic lease or any other act disposing of
   precious objects or endowments. Whoever buys or acquires any of the
   aforementioned precious objects or endowments and does not restore to
   the church what belongs to it and does not hand over for burning the
   bills of sale or leases, is anathema until he does what has been
   determined by this holy and universal synod.
   If a bishop is found guilty of having built a monastery with the
   revenues of a church, he must hand over the monastery to the same
   church. But if he built it from his own money or other sources, he may
   have it for his whole life under his own jurisdiction and direction; he
   may also bequeath it after his death to whomsoever he wishes, but it
   may not be used as a secular dwelling.

Canon 16

   A matter which merits great sorrow, even many tears, has come to our
   ears from many of the faithful. They say that under the previous
   emperor some laymen of the senatorial order were seen to plait their
   hair and arrange it on their heads, and to adopt a kind of priestly
   dignity in accordance with their different ranks at the emperor's
   court. They did this by wearing various ornaments and articles of
   clothing which are proper to priests and, as it was thought, made
   themselves out to be bishops by wearing a pallium over their shoulders
   and every other piece of episcopal dress. They also adopted as their
   patriarch the one who took the leading role in these buffooneries. They
   insulted and made a mockery of a variety of holy things, such as
   elections, promotions and consecrations of bishops, or by bringing up
   subtle but false accusations against bishops, and condemning and
   deposing them, switching in turn from distress to collusion as
   prosecutors and defendants.
   Such a way of behaving has never been heard of since time began, even
   among the pagans. It shows that those we have now brought to light are
   in a worse and more wretched state than the pagan nations. The sacred
   and universal synod, therefore, has declared and promulgated that these
   attempts to do evil must be condemned as crimes, and no member of the
   faithful who bears the name of Christian should henceforth attempt to
   do or tolerate such a thing, or to protect by silence anyone who has
   committed such an impious act. If any emperor or any powerful or
   influential person should attempt to mock holy things in such a way, or
   with evil intent to carry out or permit such a great wrong to be done
   against the divine priesthood, he must first be condemned by the
   patriarch of the time, acting with his fellow bishops, and be
   excommunicated and declared unworthy to share in the divine mysteries,
   and then he must accept certain other corrective practices and penances
   which are judged appropriate. Unless he repents quickly, he must be
   declared anathema by this holy and universal synod as one who has
   dishonoured the mystery of the pure and spotless faith.
   However, if the patriarch of Constantinople and his suffragan bishops
   come to know of any others who have committed crimes of this kind and
   neglect to act against them with the necessary zeal, they must be
   deposed and debarred from the dignity of their priesthood. Those who in
   any way have shown, or shall show in future, such impious conduct and
   have not confessed it in any way and received the appropriate penance,
   are declared excommunicate by this synod for three years; during the
   first year they must remain outside the church as public penitents,
   during the second year they may stand inside the church among the.
   ranks of the catechumens, during the third year they may join the
   faithful and thus become worthy of the sanctifying effects of the holy
   mysteries.

Canon 17

   The first, holy and universal synod of Nicaea orders that the ancient
   custom should be preserved throughout Egypt and the provinces subject
   to her, so that the bishop of Alexandria has them all under his
   authority; it declares, "Because such a custom has prevailed in the
   city of Rome". Therefore this great and holy synod decrees that in old
   and new Rome and the sees of Antioch and Jerusalem the ancient custom
   must be preserved in all things, so that their prelates should have
   authority over all the metropolitans whom they promote or confirm in
   the episcopal dignity, either through the imposition of hands or the
   bestowal of the pallium; that is to say, the authority to summon them,
   in case of necessity, to a meeting in synod or even to reprimand and
   correct them, when a report about some wrongdoing leads to an
   accusation.
   But since some metropolitans give as an excuse for not responding to
   the summons of their apostolic prelate that they are detained by their
   temporal rulers, it has been decided that such an excuse will be
   utterly invalid. For since a ruler frequently holds meetings for his
   own purposes, it is intolerable that he should prevent leading prelates
   from going to synods for ecclesiastical business or hold some back from
   their meetings. We have learnt, however, that such an obstacle and
   alleged refusal of permission can come about in various ways at the
   suggestion of the metropolitan.
   Metropolitans have had the custom of holding synods twice a year and
   therefore, they say, they cannot possibly come to the chief one, that
   of the patriarch. But this holy and universal synod, without forbidding
   the meetings held by the metropolitans, is conscious that the synods
   summoned by the patriarchal see are more necessary and profitable than
   the metropolitan ones, and so demands that they take place. A
   metropolitan synod affects the good order of only one province, a
   patriarchal synod often affects the good order of a whole civil
   diocese, and in this way the common good is provided for. So it is
   fitting that the common good take priority over a particular one,
   especially when the summons to meet has been issued by those of greater
   authority. The fact is that certain metropolitans seem to regard with
   contempt the ancient custom and canonical tradition, by their not
   meeting together for the common good. Therefore the laws of the church
   demand, with severe penalties and leaving no loop-hole, that they
   comply with the summons of their patriarchs whether they are summoned
   as a body or individually.
   We refuse to listen to the offensive claim made by some ignorant people
   that a synod cannot be held in the absence of the civil authorities.
   The reason for this is that the sacred canons have never prescribed the
   presence of secular rulers at synods but only the presence of bishops.
   Hence we find that they have not been present at synods but only at
   universal councils. Furthermore, it is not right that secular rulers
   should be observers of matters that sometimes come before the priests
   of God.
   Therefore, if any metropolitan ignores his patriarch and disobeys his
   summons, whether addressed to him alone or to several or to all, unless
   prevented by a genuine illness or a pagan invasion, and for two whole
   months after notice of the summons makes no attempt to visit his
   patriarch, or if he hides in some way or pretends he has no knowledge
   of the patriarch's summons, he must be excommunicated. If he shows the
   same stubbornness and disobedience for a year, he must be
   unconditionally deposed and suspended from all sacerdotal functions and
   excluded from the dignity and honour that belong to metropolitans. If
   any metropolitan disobeys even this directive, let him be anathema.
