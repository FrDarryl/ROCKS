The First General Council of the Lateran, 1123

INTRODUCTION

   In 1123, during the pontificate of Pope Callistus II, a general Roman
   council was held "for various important matters of the church", as
   Callistus himself says in the letter of convocation which he sent on 25
   June 1122 to bishop Baldric of Doll. A great number of bishops, abbots
   and religious, numbering at least 300, gathered in Rome from the
   western churches, although none that we know of came from the eastern
   churches {1 } . There is no evidence that legates of the emperor Henry
   V took part. The council began on 18 March 1123, with the pope
   presiding. There were at least two sessions. The council ended before 6
   April, probably on 27 March.
   This council is often called "general" in the letters and decrees of
   Pope Callistus II. It is reasonable, however, to doubt its ecumenicity.
   Indeed the manner in which the council was called and conducted by the
   pope and the fathers differed from that of the older councils. Moreover
   several other councils, similar to Lateran I, were convened in the 11th
   and 12th centuries but were not termed ecumenical. The ecumenicity of
   this council seems, as far as we can tell, to have been confirmed later
   by the tradition of the Roman church.
   There had long been conflict between church and state, though some sort
   of a solution had been reached a short time before at the Concordat of
   Worms (September 1122). Thus, questions concerning the investiture of
   prelates and the freedom of the church were a major concern of the
   council. The said concordat was approved and confirmed by the council's
   authority, though not without opposition on the part of many, as Gerhoh
   of Reichersberg {2 } testifies; canons 3-4, 8 and 12 make mention of
   this debate. Thereby a measure of peace and discipline was restored to
   the church.
   The fathers devoted themselves principally to the reform of the church,
   to the abolition of simony and to the correction of ecclesiastical
   abuses. There were a few other matters of lesser importance. Also, the
   struggle for the Corsican episcopacy between the churches of Genoa and
   Pisa was a considerable problem, and a commission of twenty-four
   fathers had to be created by the pope in order to resolve the matter;
   for this see canons 1, 7, and also canons 2, 5-6, 9, 11, 16. Thus pope
   Callistus, following as closely as he could the examples of Gregory VII
   and Urban II {3 } , and supported by the approval of the council,
   brought to a successful conclusion matters which had engrossed the
   whole church's effort and zeal for almost fifty years.
   A number of canons were ratified by the council fathers, perhaps at the
   session on 27 March. Many of these were included in Gratian's Decrees
   (c. 1140), namely canons 1, 3-4, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16B, 19-22B, and part of
   8, 18B. As far as we know, Baronius was the first to print others which
   Gratian did not accept (Br {4 } 12, 1607, 149-150; ed. Theiner 18,
   1869, 343-344). Twelve more follow in the Roman edition (Rm {5 } 4,
   1612, 16- 17), where a complete text of the canons may be found. We
   have examined all the canons in the following: Bn {6 } 3/2 (1618)
   464-465; ER {7 } 27 (1644) 37-43; S. Baluze, in P. de Marca,
   Dissertationum de concordia sacerdotii et imperii ...libri II Paris
   l663, 363 (=BdM); LC10 {8 } (l67l) 896-900; Hrd {9 } 6/2 (1714)
   1111-1114; Cl {10 } 12 (1730) 1333-1337; E. Martene and U. Durand, in
   Veterum scriptorum et monumentorum ... collectio, VII Paris 1733,
   68-69, four canons only (= MD); Msi {11 } 2 (1748) 355-358; Msi 21
   (1776) 281-286; G.H. Pertz, in MGH {12 } , Leges in f.Ã¸, II/2 Hanover
   1837, 182-183 (= Pertz); PL 163 (1854) 1361-1365; L. Weiland, in MGH,
   Const., I Hanover 1893, 574-576 (= MGH).
   The text of the canons presents some difficulties. Bn 2, ER, LC, Hrd,
   Cl and Msi must have printed the same text as that used by Rm (though
   with some differences). This commonly accepted version, which we call
   B, consists of 22 canons and seems to derive from two manuscript
   codices (not from Rm, since this has the different readings). In
   addition, seven canons (2, 5, 10-11, 13, 15, 17) printed by Br seem to
   relate to B, even though they often do not agree with 13 in their
   readings. A second version of the canons, "from an ancient manuscript
   codex of the monastery of Aniane", which is now in the Bibliotheque
   Nationale in Paris, was published by BdM. The order of the canons in
   it, and often the readings, are different from B; moreover six canons
   (11 and the last five, 18-22B) are missing and two (15-16) are
   completely different from B. Regarding this other version, which we
   call alpha, MD published four canons (6, 12, 15- 16) "from a manuscript
   of the marquis of Laubes", and Pertz published sixteen canons (15 and
   18-22B are missing, in place of which are what appear to be two
   rubrics) from Vienna MS. Codex of Canon Law 91 (now 2178). Migne
   transcribed the text of Pertz. LC took several readings of (alpha and
   included them in B[eta] as variant readings. Finally, the text printed
   by Msi "from a Pistoia codex of canons", as well as the order of canons
   in it, appear similar to alpha; although canons 15-16 are preserved
   according to the B text and 18-19 are added to B. If alpha is earlier
   than B, then the text of Msi seems to date from an earlier time and to
   have been corrected occasionally from B; therefore we conclude that
   this text belongs to alpha.
   We believe the (alpha version is older than B[eta].For, the canons from
   alpha(except ll-12, 15-17) are mentioned in Simeon of Durham's
   "Historia Regum" {13 } (= S), which is contemporaneous. This point has
   not been noticed by scholars. In addition, Gratian's Decrees ascribe
   the last 5 canons to the earlier pontificate of Urban II (1088-99) and
   not to the time of Lateran I, as Br noted; therefore alpha seems right
   to omit these five canons. The document on which Br and possibly Rm
   depend is a Vatican codex "which contains the Collection of Anselm [of
   Lucca], in which the canons of this council are included as an appendix
   after chapter 55". Maybe, therefore, our B should be attributed to this
   peculiar version in Anselm of Lucca's text. Certainly all the known
   manuscript codices are related to alpa, so far as we are aware {14 } ,
   including the 12th century Vatican Reginensis lat. 987 (= R), which was
   the first to be examined by us. We think that little confidence can be
   placed in MGH, which is the only critical edition so far made. Its
   editor, Weiland, divided the sources into three groups: the "Parisian",
   more correctly called the "Roman"- the Pistoian codex; and the codices
   used by BdM and Pertz. But he completely ignored the similarities
   between the three groups, and in the end collated only the two sources
   of the third group, omitting for no reason canon 17. We have collated
   together R and all the other editions, and have prepared our text with
   the alpha version as the basis. We think that R and BdM are the most
   reliable sources. We have relegated the alternative version of canons
   15-16 to a footnote, and the last five canons to an appendix. We have
   not used the MGH text except in a few instances. There is a preface to
   the canons in R, S, BdM and Msi vol 1, but we do not reproduce it.

CANONS

Canon 1.

   Following the examples of the holy fathers and renewing them as we are
   bound by our office, by the authority of the apostolic see we
   altogether forbid anyone to be ordained or promoted in the church of
   God for money. If anyone indeed should have been ordained or promoted
   in the church in such a fashion, let him be utterly deprived of the
   office acquired. {15 }

Canon 2.

   {16 } We absolutely forbid those excommunicated by their own bishops to
   be received into communion by other bishops, abbots and clergy {17 }

Canon 3.

   {18 } No one may consecrate as a bishop someone who is not canonically
   elected. If anyone should presume to do this, let both consecrator and
   consecrated be deposed {19 } beyond hope of restoration.

Canon 4.

   {20 } Absolutely no archdeacon, archpriest {21 } , provost or dean {22
   } may grant to anyone the care of souls or prebends in a church without
   the decision or consent of the bishop. Rather, as it is constituted by
   the holy canons, let the care of souls and the dispensing of
   ecclesiastical affairs remain in the decision and power of the bishop.
   Indeed, if anyone presumes to do something against this, or to claim
   for himself the power which pertains to the bishop, let him be banished
   from the bounds of the church

Canon 5.

   {23 } The ordinations made by the heresiarch Burdinus {24 }, after he
   was condemned by the Roman church, and whatever was afterwards done by
   pseudo-bishops ordained by him, we judge to be null and void.

Canon 6.

   {25 } No one except a priest {26 } may be ordained to the office of
   provost, archpriest or dean; no one except a deacon may be ordained to
   the office of archdeacon. {27 } {28 }

Canon 7.

   {29 } We absolutely forbid priests, deacons or subdeacons to live with
   concubines and wives, and to cohabit with other women, except those
   whom the council of Nicaea permitted to dwell with them solely on
   account of necessity, namely a mother, sister, paternal or maternal
   aunt, or other such persons, about whom no suspicion could justly arise

Canon 8.

   {30 } We further resolve, in accordance with the statute of the most
   blessed pope Stephen, that lay persons, however religious they may be,
   have no power to dispose of any ecclesiastical business; but following
   the apostolic canons, let the bishop have the care of all
   ecclesiastical matters, and let him manage them as in the sight of God.
   Therefore {31 } if any prince or other lay person should arrogate to
   himself the disposition or donation {32 } of ecclesiastical things or
   possessions, let him be regarded as sacrilegious.

Canon 9.

   {33 } We prohibit unions between blood relatives, because both the
   divine and secular laws prohibit them. For, the divine laws not only
   cast out those doing this and their progeny but also call them
   accursed; the secular laws call such people disreputable and deprive
   them of inheritance. We, therefore, following our fathers, mark them
   with infamy and judge them to be infamous.
   [crusades]

Canon 10.

   {34 } To those who set out for Jerusalem and offer effective help
   towards the defence of the christian people and overcoming the tyranny
   of the infidels, we grant the remission of their sins, and we place
   their houses and families and all their goods under the protection of
   blessed Peter and the Roman church, just as has been decreed by our
   lord pope Urban. Whoever dares to distrain or carry off their houses,
   families and goods, while they are on their way, shall be punished with
   excommunication. {35 } Those who have put crosses on their clothes,
   with a view to journeying to Jerusalem or to Spain, and have later
   taken them off, we command by our apostolic authority to wear the
   crosses again and to complete the journey between this Easter and the
   following Easter. Otherwise, from that moment we cut them off from
   entry into church and forbid divine services in all their lands, apart
   from the baptism of infants and confessions for the dying.

Canon 11.

   {36 } With the advice of our brothers and of the whole curia, and also
   with the wish and consent of the prefect, we order the abolition of
   that immoral practice hitherto obtaining with respect to the dead
   Porticani, so that the goods of Porticani dwellers dying without heirs
   are not to be dispersed against the wishes of those dying. This,
   however, is to the extent that the Porticani remain obedient and
   faithful to the Roman church and to us and our successors. {37 }

Canon 12.

   {38 } In accordance with the canons of the holy fathers, we absolutely
   forbid and prohibit the laity, under the penalty of anathema, to remove
   the offerings from the most sacred and revered altars of blessed Peter
   and of the Saviour and of St Mary Rotunda and of St Nicholas of Bari,
   of St Giles {39 } , or from the altars or crosses of all the other
   churches. By {40 } apostolic authority we forbid the fortification or
   taking hold of churches by {41 } lay persons {42 } . {43 }

Canon 13.

   {44 } Whoever knowingly makes or intentionally spends counterfeit money
   shall be separated from the communion of the faithful as one accursed,
   an oppressor of the poor and a disturber of the state.

Canon 14.

   {45 } If anyone tries to attack pilgrims to Rome and foreigners {46 }
   visiting the shrines of the apostles and the oratories of other saints,
   or to rob them of the things they bring, or to trouble merchants {47 }
   with new exactions of tolls and fees, let him be deprived of christian
   communion until he makes reparation.

Canon 15.

   {48 } We confirm, with the authority of the holy Spirit, whatever has
   been determined by the Roman pontiffs our predecessors concerning the
   peace and truce of God or arson or the public highways.
   Msi (as canon 14) and B (as canon 13) have a different text namely
   If anyone should violate a truce, he is to be admonished up to three
   times by the bishop to make reparation. If he acts in contempt of the
   third admonition to make reparation, the bishop, either with the
   counsel of the metropolitan {49 } or with two or one of the
   neighbouring bishops, shall declare the sentence of anathema on the
   rebel, and denounce him in writing to the bishops all around

Canon 16.

   {50 } Following in the footsteps of the holy fathers, we order by
   general decree, that monks be subject to their own bishops {51 } with
   all humility, and show due obedience and devoted submission to them in
   all things, as if to masters and shepherds of the church of God. They
   may not celebrate masses in public anywhere. Moreover, let them
   completely abstain from public visitations of the sick, from anointings
   and even from hearing confessions, for these things in no way pertain
   to their calling. Indeed, in the churches where their ministry is
   recognized, they may only have priests who were ordained by their own
   bishop, to whom they will answer for the care of souls which they have
   assumed.
   In Pertz there is only "We absolutely forbid anointings and visits to
   the sick and public masses by monks" and then : "The examples of Leo to
   Dioscorus, that on the day of the resurrection there may be a levitical
   and a sacerdotal ordination, ch 19. That on Sunday mnorning, continuing
   the fast of Saturday, there can be an ordination, ch 20".
   Msi (as canon 18) and B (as canon 17) have a different text, namely :
   We forbid abbots and monks to give public penances, to visit the sick,
   to perform anointings and to chant public masses. They shall receive
   chrism, holy oil, consecrations of altars and ordinations of clerics
   from the bishops in whose dioceses they reside.

Canon 17.

   {52 } In our desire to preserve in peace, by the grace of God, the
   possessions of the holy Roman church, we strictly forbid, under pain of
   anathema, any military {53 } person to presume to seize or hold by
   force Benevento, the city of blessed Peter. If anyone should dare
   otherwise, he shall be bound by the chain of anathema.
   _______________________________________________________________________

   The remaining canons are missing in alpha, and Msi has canons 18-19
   together with canon 16. The first part of this canon (Priests ...
   pertain to the bishop) may belong to canon 16 (B).

Canon 18.

   Priests are to be appointed to parish churches by the bishops, to whom
   they shall answer for the care of souls and for those matters which
   pertain to the bishop. They may not receive tithes or churches from lay
   persons without the consent and wish of the bishops; and if they
   presume to do otherwise, they shall be subject to the canonical
   penalty. {54 }

Canon 19.

   We allow the service which monasteries and their churches have paid
   from the time of {55 } pope Gregory VII until now. We altogether forbid
   abbots and monks to have the possessions of churches and bishops by a
   thirty {56 } years provision. {57 }

Canon 20.

   Having in mind the examples in the traditions of the fathers, and
   discharging the duty of our pastoral office, we decree that churches
   and what belongs to them, both persons and possessions, namely clerics,
   monks and their lay brothers, as well as those who come to pray and
   what they bring with them, are to be under protection and not be
   harmed. If anyone dares to act contrary to this and after recognizing
   his villainy, has not properly made amends within the space of thirty
   days, let him be banished from the bounds of the church and be smitten
   with the sword of anathema.

Canon 21.

   We absolutely forbid priests, deacons, subdeacons and monks to have
   concubines or to contract marriages. We adjudge, as the sacred canons
   have laid down, that marriage contracts between such persons should be
   made void and the persons ought to undergo penance.

Canon 22.

   We condemn the alienations which have been made everywhere, especially
   by Otto {58 } , Jeremias, and perhaps Philip {59 } , of the property of
   the exarchate of Ravenna. Moreover, we declare in general to be invalid
   the alienations made in whatever fashion by all persons, whether they
   were intruded or were canonically elected in the name of a bishop or an
   abbot, who should be consecrated in accordance with the usage of his
   own church, and the ordinations conferred by them without the consent
   of the clergy of the church or through simony. We also forbid
   absolutely that any cleric should presume to alienate in any way his
   prebend or any ecclesiastical benefice. Any such action in the past or
   the future shall be invalid and subject to canonical penalty."
