   "Men should often renew their good resolutions, and not lose heart
   because they are tempted against them."
   St Philip Neri

   "Obedience is a short cut to perfection."
   St Philip Neri

   * * *

   "Shun too great a desire for knowledge, for in it there is much
   fretting and delusion. Intellectuals like to appear learned and to be
   called wise. Yet there are many things the knowledge of which does
   little or no good to the soul, and he who concerns himself about other
   things than those which lead to salvation is very unwise. "
   Thomas á Kempis

   happy with Him forever in the next.


                                 [more.gif]
   3. To whose image and likeness did God make you?
     [arrow.gif]

   God made me to his own image and likeness.
                 [more.gif]
   4. Is this likeness to God in your body, or in your soul?
     [arrow.gif]

   6. What do you mean when you say that your soul is immortal?
     [arrow.gif]

   When I say my soul is immortal, I mean that my soul can never die.

   7. Of which must you take most care, of your body or of your soul?What

   10. Why must you believe whatever God has revealed?
     [arrow.gif]

   and can neither deceive nor be deceived.

     [arrow.gif]

   authority of the Catholic Church.
                 [more.gif]
   12. Who gave the Catholic Church divine authority to teach?
     [arrow.gif]

   "There is nothing which gives greater security to our actions, or more
   effectually cuts the snares the devil lays for us, than to follow
   another person's will, rather than our own, in doing good."
   St Philip Neri

   * * *

   "Try to turn your heart from the love of things visible and bring
   yourself to things invisible. For they who follow their own evil
   passions stain their consciences and lose the grace of God. "
   Thomas á Kempis

   * * *

   "The supreme perfection of man in this life is to be so united to God
   that all his soul with all its faculties and powers are so gathered
   into the Lord God that he becomes one spirit with him, and remembers
   nothing except God, is aware of and recognises nothing but God, but
   with all his desires unified by the joy of love, he rests contentedly
   in the enjoyment of his Maker alone."
   St Albert the Great

   "God commands not impossibilities, but by commanding he suggests to you
   to do what you can, to ask for what is beyond your strength; and he
   helps you, that you may be able."
   St Augustine

   * * *

   "Let persons in the world sanctify themselves in their own houses, for
   neither the court, professions, or labour, are any hindrance to the
   service of God."
   St Philip Neri

   * * *

   "The essence of perfection is to embrace the will of God in all things,
   prosperous or adverse. In prosperity, even sinners find it easy to
   unite themselves to the divine will; but it takes saints to unite
   themselves to God's will when things go wrong and are painful to
   self-love. Our conduct in such instances is the measure of our love of
   God."
   St Alphonsus de Liguori

   Church; and from the doctrine of Holy Scripture, which declares that
   God will render to every man according to his works; that nothing
   defiled shall enter heaven; and that some will be saved, "as one who
   has gone through fires". Matt. 16:27, Apoc. 21:27.1, Cor. 3:15

   to do what you can, to ask for what is beyond your strength; and he
   helps you, that you may be able."
   St Augustine

   "The Lord has always revealed to mortals the treasures of his wisdom
   and his spirit, but now that the face of evil bares itself more and
   more, so does the Lord bare his treasures more."
   St John of the Cross, OCD - Doctor of the Church

   * * *

   "Shun too great a desire for knowledge, for in it there is much
   fretting and delusion. Intellectuals like to appear learned and to be
   called wise. Yet there are many things the knowledge of which does
   little or no good to the soul, and he who concerns himself about other
   things than those which lead to salvation is very unwise. "
   Thomas á Kempis

   St Augustine

   "O Lord, my God, who will seek you with simple and pure love, and not
   find that you are all one can desire, for you show yourself first and
   go out to meet those who seek you? "
   St John of the Cross, OCD - Doctor of the Church

   * * *

   "Shun too great a desire for knowledge, for in it there is much
   fretting and delusion. Intellectuals like to appear learned and to be
   called wise. Yet there are many things the knowledge of which does
   little or no good to the soul, and he who concerns himself about other
   things than those which lead to salvation is very unwise. "
   Thomas á Kempis

   "God gives us some things, as the beginning of faith, even when we do
   not pray. Other things, such as perseverance, he has only provided for
   those who pray."
   St Augustine

   * * *

   "Every man naturally desires knowledge; but what good is knowledge
   without fear of God? Indeed a humble rustic who serves God is better
   than a proud intellectual who neglects his soul to study the course of
   the stars."
   Thomas á Kempis

   * * *

   "The supreme perfection of man in this life is to be so united to God
   that all his soul with all its faculties and powers are so gathered
   into the Lord God that he becomes one spirit with him, and remembers
   nothing except God, is aware of and recognises nothing but God, but
   with all his desires unified by the joy of love, he rests contentedly
   in the enjoyment of his Maker alone."
   St Albert the Great

   "It is better to be burdened and in company with the strong than to be
   unburdened and with the weak. When you are burdened you are close to
   God, your strength, who abides with the afflicted. When you are
   relieved of the burden you are close to yourself, your own weakness;
   for virtue and strength of soul grow and are confirmed in the trials of
   patience."
   St John of the Cross, OCD - Doctor of the Church

   "What good does it do to speak learnedly about the Trinity if, lacking
   humility, you displease the Trinity? Indeed it is not learning that
   makes a man holy and just, but a virtuous life makes him pleasing to
   God. "
   Thomas á Kempis

   * * *

   "To think of oneself as nothing, and always to think well and highly of
   others is the best and most perfect wisdom. Wherefore, if you see
   another sin openly or commit a serious crime, do not consider yourself
   better, for you do not know how long you can remain in good estate. All
   men are frail, but you must admit that none is more frail than
   yourself. "

     291. What other consideration concerning our Saviour will lead us to
   sorrow for our sins?

     [arrow.gif]

   grievously 'crucify again to themselves the Son of God, making him a
   mockery'. Heb. 6:6
                 [more.gif]
     292. Is sorrow for our sins, because by them we have lost heaven and
   deserved hell, sufficient when we go to confession?

   satisfaction for our sins?

     [arrow.gif]

   The penance given by the priest does not always make full satisfaction
   for our sins. We should therefore add to it other good works and
   penances, and try to gain Indulgences.
                 [more.gif]
     300. What is an Indulgence?

     [arrow.gif]

   An Indulgence is a remission, granted by the Church, of the temporal

   "It is not God's will that we should abound in spiritual delights, but
   that in all things we should submit to his holy will."
   Blessed Henry Suso

   * * *

   "Though the path is plain and smooth for people of good will, those who
   walk it will not travel far, and will do so only with difficulty if
   they do not have good feet, courage, and tenacity of spirit. "
   St John of the Cross, OCD - Doctor of the Church

   * * *

   "Every man naturally desires knowledge; but what good is knowledge
   without fear of God? Indeed a humble rustic who serves God is better
   than a proud intellectual who neglects his soul to study the course of
   the stars."

   "It is vanity to love what passes quickly and not to look ahead where
   eternal joy abides. "
   Thomas á Kempis

   * * *

   "It is better to be burdened and in company with the strong than to be
   unburdened and with the weak. When you are burdened you are close to
   God, your strength, who abides with the afflicted. When you are
   relieved of the burden you are close to yourself, your own weakness;
   for virtue and strength of soul grow and are confirmed in the trials of
   patience."
   St John of the Cross, OCD - Doctor of the Church

   * * *

   "Whom do you seek, friend, if you seek not God? Seek him, find him,
   cleave to him; bind your will to his with bands of steel and you will
   live always at peace in this life and in the next."
   St Alphonsus de Liguori
