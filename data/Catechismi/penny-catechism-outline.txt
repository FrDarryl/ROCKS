   "It is vanity to love what passes quickly and not to look ahead where
   eternal joy abides. "
   Thomas á Kempis

   * * *

   "A person who rails at God in adversity, suffers without merit;
   moreover by his lack of resignation he adds to his punishment in the
   next life and experiences greater disquietude of mind in this life."
   St Alphonsus de Liguori

   * * *

   "If you wish to learn and appreciate something worth while, then love
   to be unknown and considered as nothing. Truly to know and despise self
   is the best and most perfect counsel."
   Thomas á Kempis
