Psalms.
Chapter 110.
A Psalm of David. The LORD saith unto my lord: 'Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.' 
The rod of Thy strength the LORD will send out of Zion: 'Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.' 
Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy warfare; in adornments of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, thine is the dew of thy youth. 
The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent: 'Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek.' 
The Lord at thy right hand doth crush kings in the day of His wrath. 
He will judge among the nations; He filleth it with dead bodies, He crusheth the head over a wide land. 
He will drink of the brook in the way; therefore will he lift up the head.
