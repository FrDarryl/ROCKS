Psalms.
Chapter 113.
Hallelujah. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 
Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for ever. 
From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof the LORD'S name is to be praised. 
The LORD is high above all nations, His glory is above the heavens. 
Who is like unto the LORD our God, that is enthroned on high, 
That looketh down low upon heaven and upon the earth? 
Who raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill; 
That He may set him with princes, even with the princes of His people. 
Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in her house as a joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.
