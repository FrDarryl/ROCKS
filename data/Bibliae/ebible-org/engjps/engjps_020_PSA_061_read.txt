Psalms.
Chapter 61.
(61-1) For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David. (61-2) Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 
(61-3) From the end of the earth will I call unto Thee, when my heart fainteth; lead me to a rock that is too high for me. 
(61-4) For Thou hast been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy. 
(61-5) I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of Thy wings. Selah 
(61-6) For Thou, O God, hast heard my vows; Thou hast granted the heritage of those that fear Thy name. 
(61-7) Mayest Thou add days unto the king's days! May his years be as many generations! 
(61-8) May he be enthroned before God for ever! Appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him. 
(61-9) So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
