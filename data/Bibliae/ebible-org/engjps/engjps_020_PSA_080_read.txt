Psalms.
Chapter 80.
(80-1) For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A testimony. A Psalm of Asaph. (80-2) Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. 
(80-3) Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy might, and come to save us. 
(80-4) O God, restore us; and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 
(80-5) O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy people? 
(80-6) Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure. 
(80-7) Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours; and our enemies mock as they please. 
(80-8) O God of hosts, restore us; and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. 
(80-9) Thou didst pluck up a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it. 
(80-10) Thou didst clear a place before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land. 
(80-11) The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the mighty cedars with the boughs thereof. 
(80-12) She sent out her branches unto the sea, and her shoots unto the River. 
(80-13) Why hast Thou broken down her fences, so that all they that pass by the way do pluck her? 
(80-14) The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, that which moveth in the field feedeth on it. 
(80-15) O God of hosts, return, we beseech Thee; look from heaven, and behold, and be mindful of this vine, 
(80-16) And of the stock which Thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself. 
(80-17) It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance. 
(80-18) Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself. 
(80-19) So shall we not turn back from Thee; quicken Thou us, and we will call upon Thy name. 
(80-20) O LORD God of hosts, restore us; cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
