Psalms.
Chapter 148.
Hallelujah. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the heights. 
Praise ye Him, all His angels; praise ye Him, all His hosts. 
Praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars of light. 
Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens. 
Let them praise the name of the LORD; for He commanded, and they were created. 
He hath also established them for ever and ever; He hath made a decree which shall not be transgressed. 
Praise the LORD from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; 
Fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind, fulfilling His word; 
Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars; 
Beasts and all cattle, creeping things and winged fowl; 
Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth; 
Both young men and maidens, old men and children; 
Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and heaven. 
And He hath lifted up a horn for His people, a praise for all His saints, even for the children of Israel, a people near unto Him. Hallelujah.
