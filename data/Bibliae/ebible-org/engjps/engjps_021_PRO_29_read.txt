Proverbs.
Chapter 29.
He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be broken, and that without remedy. 
When the righteous are increased, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people sigh. 
Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father; but he that keepeth company with harlots wasteth his substance. 
The king by justice establisheth the land; but he that exacteth gifts overthroweth it. 
A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his steps. 
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare; but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 
The righteous taketh knowledge of the cause of the poor; the wicked understandeth not knowledge. 
Scornful men set a city in a blaze; but wise men turn away wrath. 
If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he be angry or laugh, there will be no rest. 
The men of blood hate him that is sincere; and as for the upright, they seek his life. 
A fool spendeth all his spirit; but a wise man stilleth it within him. 
If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, all his servants are wicked. 
The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the LORD giveth light to the eyes of them both. 
The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. 
The rod and reproof give wisdom; but a child left to himself causeth shame to his mother. 
When the wicked are increased, transgression increaseth; but the righteous shall gaze upon their fall. 
Correct thy son, and he will give thee rest; yea, he will give delight unto thy soul. 
Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint; but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. 
A servant will not be corrected by words; for though he understand, there will be no response. 
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope for a fool than for him. 
He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become master at the last. 
An angry man stirreth up strife, and a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression. 
A man's pride shall bring him low; but he that is of a lowly spirit shall attain to honour. 
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth the adjuration and uttereth nothing. 
The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be set up on high. 
Many seek the ruler's favour; but a man's judgment cometh from the LORD. 
An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; and he that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.
