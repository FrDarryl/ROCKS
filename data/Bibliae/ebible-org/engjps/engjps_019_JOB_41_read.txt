Job.
Chapter 41.
(40-25) Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook? or press down his tongue with a cord? 
(40-26) Canst thou put a ring into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a hook? 
(40-27) Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak soft words unto thee? 
(40-28) Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever? 
(40-29) Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
(40-30) Will the bands of fishermen make a banquet of him? Will they part him among the merchants? 
(40-31) Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? 
(40-32) Lay thy hand upon him; think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more. 
(41-1) Behold, the hope of him is in vain; shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 
(41-2) None is so fierce that dare stir him up; who then is able to stand before Me? 
(41-3) Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine. 
(41-4) Would I keep silence concerning his boastings, or his proud talk, or his fair array of words? 
(41-5) Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who shall come within his double bridle? 
(41-6) Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror. 
(41-7) His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 
(41-8) One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 
(41-9) They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 
(41-10) His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
(41-11) Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth. 
(41-12) Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot and burning rushes. 
(41-13) His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
(41-14) In his neck abideth strength, and dismay danceth before him. 
(41-15) The flakes of his flesh are joined together; they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved. 
(41-16) His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone. 
(41-17) When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid; by reason of despair they are beside themselves. 
(41-18) If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. 
(41-19) He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 
(41-20) The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 
(41-21) Clubs are accounted as stubble; he laugheth at the rattling of the javelin. 
(41-22) Sharpest potsherds are under him; he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire. 
(41-23) He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a seething mixture. 
(41-24) He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 
(41-25) Upon earth there is not his like, who is made to be fearless. 
(41-26) He looketh at all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts.
