Psalms.
Chapter 112.
Hallelujah. Happy is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in His commandments. 
His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 
Wealth and riches are in his house; and his merit endureth for ever. 
Unto the upright He shineth as a light in the darkness, gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 
Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth, that ordereth his affairs rightfully. 
For he shall never be moved; the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. 
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is stedfast, trusting in the LORD. 
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he gaze upon his adversaries. 
He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted in honour. 
The wicked shall see it, and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.
