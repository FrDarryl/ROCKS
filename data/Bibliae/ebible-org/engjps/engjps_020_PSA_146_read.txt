Psalms.
Chapter 146.
Hallelujah. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 
I will praise the LORD while I live; I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being. 
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust; in that very day his thoughts perish. 
Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, 
Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is; who keepeth truth for ever; 
Who executeth justice for the oppressed; who giveth bread to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners; 
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind; the LORD raiseth up them that are bowed down; the LORD loveth the righteous; 
The LORD preserveth the strangers; He upholdeth the fatherless and the widow; but the way of the wicked He maketh crooked. 
The LORD will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah.
