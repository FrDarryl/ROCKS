Psalms.
Chapter 32.
A Psalm of David. Maschil. Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned. 
Happy is the man unto whom the LORD counteth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
When I kept silence, my bones wore away through my groaning all the day long. 
For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; my sap was turned as in the droughts of summer. Selah 
I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD' — and Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah 
For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him. 
Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary; with songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about. Selah 
'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.' 
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, that they come not near unto thee. 
Many are the sorrows of the wicked; but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy compasseth him about. 
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
