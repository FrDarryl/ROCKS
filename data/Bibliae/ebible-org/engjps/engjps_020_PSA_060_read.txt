Psalms.
Chapter 60.
(60-1) For the Leader; upon Shushan Eduth; Michtam of David, to teach; (60-2) when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. (60-3) O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; O restore us. 
(60-4) Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it; heal the breaches thereof; for it tottereth. 
(60-5) Thou hast made Thy people to see hard things; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering. 
(60-6) Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah 
(60-7) That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me. 
(60-8) God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
(60-9) Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre. 
(60-10) Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Philistia, cry aloud because of me! 
(60-11) Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom? 
(60-12) Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. 
(60-13) Give us help against the adversary; for vain is the help of man. 
(60-14) Through God we shall do valiantly; for He it is that will tread down our adversaries.
