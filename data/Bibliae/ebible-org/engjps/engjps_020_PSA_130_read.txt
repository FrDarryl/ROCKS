Psalms.
Chapter 130.
A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths have I called Thee, O LORD. 
Lord, hearken unto my voice; let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
If Thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 
For with Thee there is forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared. 
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope. 
My soul waiteth for the Lord, more than watchmen for the morning; yea, more than watchmen for the morning. 
O Israel, hope in the LORD; for with the LORD there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption. 
And He will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
