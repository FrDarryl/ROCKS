Psalms.
Chapter 27.
A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. 
Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise up against me, even then will I be confident. 
One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the graciousness of the LORD, and to visit early in His temple. 
For He concealeth me in His pavilion in the day of evil; He hideth me in the covert of His tent; He lifteth me up upon a rock. 
And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices with trumpet-sound; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. 
Hear, O LORD, when I call with my voice, and be gracious unto me, and answer me. 
In Thy behalf my heart hath said: 'Seek ye My face'; Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 
Hide not Thy face from me; put not Thy servant away in anger; Thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
For though my father and my mother have forsaken me, the LORD will take me up. 
Teach me Thy way, O LORD; and lead me in an even path, because of them that lie in wait for me. 
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries; for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence. 
If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living! — 
Wait on the LORD; be strong, and let thy heart take courage; yea, wait thou for the LORD.
