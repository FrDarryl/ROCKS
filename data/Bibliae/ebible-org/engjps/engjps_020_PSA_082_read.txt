Psalms.
Chapter 82.
A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judgeth: 
'How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah 
Judge the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute. 
Rescue the poor and needy; deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. 
They know not, neither do they understand; they go about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are moved. 
I said: Ye are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High. 
Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.' 
Arise, O God, judge the earth; for Thou shalt possess all nations.
