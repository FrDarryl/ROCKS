Job.
Chapter 25.
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said: 
Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places. 
Is there any number of His armies? And upon whom doth not His light arise? 
How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are not pure in His sight; 
How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, that is a maggot!
