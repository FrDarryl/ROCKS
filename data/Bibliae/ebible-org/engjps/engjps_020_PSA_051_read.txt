Psalms.
Chapter 51.
(51-1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David; (51-2) When Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. (51-3) Be gracious unto me, O God, according to Thy mercy; according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions. 
(51-4) Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
(51-5) For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me. 
(51-6) Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest, and be in the right when Thou judgest. 
(51-7) Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
(51-8) Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts; make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart. 
(51-9) Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
(51-10) Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice. 
(51-11) Hide Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities. 
(51-12) Create me a clean heart, O God; and renew a stedfast spirit within me. 
(51-13) Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not Thy holy spirit from me. 
(51-14) Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; and let a willing spirit uphold me. 
(51-15) Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; and sinners shall return unto Thee. 
(51-16) Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; so shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness. 
(51-17) O Lord, open Thou my lips; and my mouth shall declare Thy praise. 
(51-18) For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering. 
(51-19) The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise. 
(51-20) Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; build Thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
(51-21) Then wilt Thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering; then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.
