Psalms.
Chapter 76.
(76-1) For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. (76-2) In Judah is God known; His name is great in Israel. 
(76-3) In Salem also is set His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion. 
(76-4) There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow; the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah 
(76-5) Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey. 
(76-6) The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands. 
(76-7) At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses. 
(76-8) Thou, even Thou, art terrible; and who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry? 
(76-9) Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, 
(76-10) When God arose to judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah 
(76-11) Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee; the residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee. 
(76-12) Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God; let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared; 
(76-13) He minisheth the spirit of princes; He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
