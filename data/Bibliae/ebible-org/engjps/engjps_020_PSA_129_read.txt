Psalms.
Chapter 129.
A Song of Ascents. 'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up', let Israel now say; 
'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up; but they have not prevailed against me. 
The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows. 
The LORD is righteous; He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.' 
Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all they that hate Zion. 
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it springeth up; 
Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 
Neither do they that go by say: 'The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.'
