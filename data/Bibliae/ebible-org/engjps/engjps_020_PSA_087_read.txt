Psalms.
Chapter 87.
A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains. 
The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
Glorious things are spoken of Thee, O city of God. Selah 
'I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know Me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this one was born there.' 
But of Zion it shall be said: 'This man and that was born in her; and the Most High Himself doth establish her.' 
The LORD shall count in the register of the peoples: 'This one was born there.' Selah 
And whether they sing or dance, all my thoughts are in Thee.
