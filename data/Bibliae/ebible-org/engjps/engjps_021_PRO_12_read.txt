Proverbs.
Chapter 12.
Whoso loveth knowledge loveth correction; but he that is brutish hateth reproof. 
A good man shall obtain favour of the LORD; but a man of wicked devices will He condemn. 
A man shall not be established by wickedness; but the root of the righteous shall never be moved. 
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband; but she that doeth shamefully is as rottenness in his bones. 
The thoughts of the righteous are right; but the counsels of the wicked are deceit. 
The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood; but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. 
The wicked are overthrown, and are not; but the house of the righteous shall stand. 
A man shall be commended according to his intelligence; but he that is of a distorted understanding shall be despised. 
Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant, than he that playeth the man of rank, and lacketh bread. 
A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast; but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. 
He that tilleth his ground shall have plenty of bread; but he that followeth after vain things is void of understanding. 
The wicked desireth the prey of evil men; but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. 
In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man; but the righteous cometh out of trouble. 
A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth, and the doings of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. 
The way of a fool is straight in his own eyes; but he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel. 
A fool's vexation is presently known; but a prudent man concealeth shame. 
He that breatheth forth truth uttereth righteousness; but a false witness deceit. 
There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword; but the tongue of the wise is health. 
The lip of truth shall be established for ever; but a lying tongue is but for a moment. 
Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil; but to the counsellors of peace is joy. 
There shall no mischief befall the righteous; but the wicked are filled with evil. 
Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD; but they that deal truly are His delight. 
A prudent man concealeth knowledge; but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. 
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule; but the slothful shall be under tribute. 
Care in the heart of a man boweth it down; but a good word maketh it glad. 
The righteous is guided by his friend; but the way of the wicked leadeth them astray. 
The slothful man shall not hunt his prey; but the precious substance of men is to be diligent. 
In the way of righteousness is life, and in the pathway thereof there is no death.
