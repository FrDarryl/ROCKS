Psalms.
Chapter 96.
O sing unto the LORD a new song; sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 
Sing unto the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation from day to day. 
Declare His glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. 
For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. 
For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but the LORD made the heavens. 
Honour and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. 
Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength. 
Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; bring an offering, and come into His courts. 
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth. 
Say among the nations: 'The LORD reigneth.' The world also is established that it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity. 
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 
Let the field exult; and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy; 
Before the LORD, for He is come; for He is come to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples in His faithfulness.
