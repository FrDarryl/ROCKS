Psalms.
Chapter 120.
A Song of Ascents. In my distress I called unto the LORD, and He answered me. 
O LORD, deliver my soul from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue. 
What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, thou deceitful tongue? 
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom. 
Woe is me, that I sojourn with Meshech, that I dwell beside the tents of Kedar! 
My soul hath full long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace. 
I am all peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
