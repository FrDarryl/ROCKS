Psalms.
Chapter 7.
(7-1) Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning Cush a Benjamite. (7-2) O LORD my God, in Thee have I taken refuge; save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me; 
(7-3) Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 
(7-4) O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 
(7-5) If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness; 
(7-6) Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, and tread my life down to the earth; yea, let him lay my glory in the dust. Selah 
(7-7) Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger, lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries; yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded. 
(7-8) And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about, and over them return Thou on high. 
(7-9) O LORD, who ministerest judgment to the peoples, judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. 
(7-10) Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked, and that Thou wouldest establish the righteous; for the righteous God trieth the heart and reins. 
(7-11) My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart. 
(7-12) God is a righteous judge, yea, a God that hath indignation every day: 
(7-13) If a man turn not, He will whet His sword, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready; 
(7-14) He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death, yea, His arrows which He made sharp. 
(7-15) Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood. 
(7-16) He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. 
(7-17) His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate. 
(7-18) I will give thanks unto the LORD according to His righteousness; and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
