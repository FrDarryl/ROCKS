Psalms.
Chapter 25.
A Psalm of David. Unto Thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 
O my God, in Thee have I trusted, let me not be ashamed; let not mine enemies triumph over me. 
Yea, none that wait for Thee shall be ashamed; they shall be ashamed that deal treacherously without cause. 
Show me Thy ways, O LORD; teach me Thy paths. 
Guide me in Thy truth, and teach me; for Thou art the God of my salvation; for Thee do I wait all the day. 
Remember, O LORD, Thy compassions and Thy mercies; for they have been from of old. 
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to Thy mercy remember Thou me, for Thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 
Good and upright is the LORD; therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way. 
He guideth The humble in justice; and He teacheth the humble His way. 
All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and His testimonies. 
For Thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great. 
What man is he that feareth the LORD? him will He instruct in the way that He should choose. 
His soul shall abide in prosperity; and his seed shall inherit the land. 
The counsel of the LORD is with them that fear Him; and His covenant, to make them know it. 
Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for He will bring forth my feet out of the net. 
Turn Thee unto me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary and afflicted. 
The troubles of my heart are enlarged; O bring Thou me out of my distresses. 
See mine affliction and my travail; and forgive all my sins. 
Consider how many are mine enemies, and the cruel hatred wherewith they hate me. 
O keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in Thee. 
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for Thee. 
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
