Psalms.
Chapter 69.
(69-1) For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A Psalm of David. (69-2) Save me, O God; for the waters are come in even unto the soul. 
(69-3) I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep waters, and the flood overwhelmeth me. 
(69-4) I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
(69-5) They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many; should I restore that which I took not away? 
(69-6) O God, Thou knowest my folly; and my trespasses are not hid from Thee. 
(69-7) Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel. 
(69-8) Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face. 
(69-9) I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. 
(69-10) Because zeal for Thy house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me. 
(69-11) And I wept with my soul fasting, and that became unto me a reproach. 
(69-12) I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a byword unto them. 
(69-13) They that sit in the gate talk of me; and I am the song of the drunkards. 
(69-14) But as for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O God, in the abundance of Thy mercy, answer me with the truth of Thy salvation. 
(69-15) Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 
(69-16) Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. 
(69-17) Answer me, O LORD, for Thy mercy is good; according to the multitude of Thy compassions turn Thou unto me. 
(69-18) And hide not Thy face from Thy servant; for I am in distress; answer me speedily. 
(69-19) Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; ransom me because of mine enemies. 
(69-20) Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion; mine adversaries are all before Thee. 
(69-21) Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick; and I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. 
(69-22) Yea, they put poison into my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
(69-23) Let their table before them become a snare; and when they are in peace, let it become a trap. 
(69-24) Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to totter. 
(69-25) Pour out Thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of Thine anger overtake them. 
(69-26) Let their encampment be desolate; let none dwell in their tents. 
(69-27) For they persecute him whom Thou hast smitten; and they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded. 
(69-28) Add iniquity unto their iniquity; and let them not come into Thy righteousness. 
(69-29) Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. 
(69-30) But I am afflicted and in pain; let Thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
(69-31) I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with thanksgiving. 
(69-32) And it shall please the LORD better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 
(69-33) The humble shall see it, and be glad; ye that seek after God, let your heart revive. 
(69-34) For the LORD hearkeneth unto the needy, and despiseth not His prisoners. 
(69-35) Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. 
(69-36) For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; and they shall abide there, and have it in possession. 
(69-37) The seed also of His servants shall inherit it; and they that love His name shall dwell therein.
