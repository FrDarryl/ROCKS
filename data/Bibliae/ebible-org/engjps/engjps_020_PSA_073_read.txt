Psalms.
Chapter 73.
BOOK III A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart. 
But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. 
For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
For there are no pangs at their death, and their body is sound. 
In the trouble of man they are not; neither are they plagued like men. 
Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment. 
Their eyes stand forth from fatness; they are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart. 
They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; they speak as if there were none on high. 
They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. 
Therefore His people return hither; and waters of fullness are drained out by them. 
And they say: 'How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?' 
Behold, such are the wicked; and they that are always at ease increase riches. 
Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency; 
For all the day have I been plagued, and my chastisement came every morning. 
If I had said: 'I will speak thus', behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children. 
And when I pondered how I might know this, it was wearisome in mine eyes; 
Until I entered into the sanctuary of God, and considered their end. 
Surely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin. 
How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors. 
As a dream when one awaketh, so, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance. 
For my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins. 
But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee. 
Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand. 
Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me with glory. 
Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth. 
My flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever. 
For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee. 
But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all Thy works.
