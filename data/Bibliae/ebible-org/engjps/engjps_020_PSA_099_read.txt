Psalms.
Chapter 99.
The LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble; He is enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake. 
The LORD is great in Zion; and He is high above all the peoples. 
Let them praise Thy name as great and awful; Holy is He. 
The strength also of the king who loveth justice — Thou hast established equity, Thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 
Exalt ye the LORD our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool; Holy is He. 
Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name, did call upon the LORD, and He answered them. 
He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud; they kept His testimonies, and the statute that He gave them. 
O LORD our God, Thou didst answer them; a forgiving God wast Thou unto them, though Thou tookest vengeance of their misdeeds. 
Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at His holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
