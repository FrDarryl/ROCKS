Hosea.
Chapter 5.
Hear this, O ye priests, and attend, ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter; and I am rejected of them all. 
I, even I, know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry, Israel is defiled. 
Their doings will not suffer them to return unto their God; for the spirit of harlotry is within them, and they know not the LORD. 
But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity, Judah also shall stumble with them. 
With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them. 
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, for they have begotten strange children; now shall the new moon devour them with their portions. 
Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah; sound an alarm at Beth-aven: 'Behind thee, O Benjamin!' 
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; among the tribes of Israel do I make known that which shall surely be. 
The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water. 
Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right; because he willingly walked after filth. 
Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness. 
And when Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Contentious; but he is not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound. 
For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go away, I will take away, and there shall be none to deliver. 
I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; in their trouble they will seek Me earnestly:
