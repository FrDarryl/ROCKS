Psalms.
Chapter 132.
A Song of Ascents. LORD, remember unto David all his affliction; 
How he swore unto the LORD, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: 
'Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up into the bed that is spread for me; 
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids; 
Until I find out a place for the LORD, a dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.' 
Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood. 
Let us go into His dwelling-place; let us worship at His footstool. 
Arise, O LORD, unto Thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of Thy strength. 
Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let Thy saints shout for joy. 
For Thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of Thine anointed. 
The LORD swore unto David in truth; He will not turn back from it: 'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 
If thy children keep My covenant and My testimony that I shall teach them, their children also for ever shall sit upon thy throne.' 
For the LORD hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation: 
'This is My resting-place for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will give her needy bread in plenty. 
Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 
There will I make a horn to shoot up unto David, there have I ordered a lamp for Mine anointed. 
His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown shine.'
