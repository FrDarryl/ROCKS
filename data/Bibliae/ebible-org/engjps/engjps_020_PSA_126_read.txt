Psalms.
Chapter 126.
A Song of Ascents. When the LORD brought back those that returned to Zion, we were like unto them that dream. 
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing; then said they among the nations: 'The LORD hath done great things with these.' 
The LORD hath done great things with us; we are rejoiced. 
Turn our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the dry land. 
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 
Though he goeth on his way weeping that beareth the measure of seed, he shall come home with joy, bearing his sheaves.
