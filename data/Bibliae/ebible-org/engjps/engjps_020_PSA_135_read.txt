Psalms.
Chapter 135.
Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the LORD; give praise, O ye servants of the LORD, 
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 
Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant. 
For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His own treasure. 
For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that hath He done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps; 
Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries. 
Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 
Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings: 
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan; 
And gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto Israel His people. 
O LORD, Thy name endureth for ever; thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 
For the LORD will judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants. 
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 
They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. 
O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD; 
O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD; ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD. 
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
