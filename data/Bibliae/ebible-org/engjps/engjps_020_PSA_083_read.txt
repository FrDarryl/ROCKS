Psalms.
Chapter 83.
(83-1) A Song, a Psalm of Asaph. (83-2) O God, keep not Thou silence; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God. 
(83-3) For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. 
(83-4) They hold crafty converse against Thy people, and take counsel against Thy treasured ones. 
(83-5) They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.' 
(83-6) For they have consulted together with one consent; against Thee do they make a covenant; 
(83-7) The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites; 
(83-8) Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
(83-9) Assyria also is joined with them; they have been an arm to the children of Lot. Selah 
(83-10) Do Thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon; 
(83-11) Who were destroyed at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth. 
(83-12) Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes; 
(83-13) Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God.' 
(83-14) O my God, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind. 
(83-15) As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains ablaze; 
(83-16) So pursue them with Thy tempest, and affright them with Thy storm. 
(83-17) Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek Thy name, O LORD. 
(83-18) Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever; yea, let them be abashed and perish; 
(83-19) That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the LORD, the Most High over all the earth.
