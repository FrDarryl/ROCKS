"1" = '''
:sup:`1` I made a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For what would be the portion of God from above, and the heritage of the Almighty from on high? 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity? 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Doth not He see my ways, and count all my steps? 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` If I have walked with vanity, and my foot hath hasted to deceit — 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Let me be weighed in a just balance, that God may know mine integrity — 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after mine eyes, and if any spot hath cleaved to my hands; 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` If my heart have been enticed unto a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbour's door; 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For that were a heinous crime; yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` If I did despise the cause of my man-servant, or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me — 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when He remembereth, what shall I answer Him? 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Did not He that made me in the womb make him? And did not One fashion us in the womb? 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` If I have withheld aught that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof — 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have been her guide from my mother's womb. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` If I have seen any wanderer in want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering; 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate; 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of His majesty I could do nothing. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold: 'Thou art my confidence'; 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much; 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand; 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have lied to God that is above. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or exulted when evil found him — 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` If the men of my tent said not: 'Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his meat?' 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` The stranger did not lodge in the street; my doors I opened to the roadside. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` If after the manner of men I covered my transgressions, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom — 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Because I feared the great multitude, and the most contemptible among families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` Oh that I had one to hear me! — Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me — and that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written! 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` If my land cry out against me, and the furrows thereof weep together; 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the tillers thereof to be disappointed — 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and noisome weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
