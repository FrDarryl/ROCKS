Chapter 119.
ALEPH. Happy are they that are upright in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. 
Happy are they that keep His testimonies, that seek Him with the whole heart. 
Yea, they do no unrighteousness; they walk in His ways. 
Thou hast ordained Thy precepts, that we should observe them diligently. 
Oh that my ways were directed to observe Thy statutes! 
Then should I not be ashamed, when I have regard unto all Thy commandments. 
I will give thanks unto Thee with uprightness of heart, when I learn Thy righteous ordinances. 
I will observe Thy statutes; O forsake me not utterly. 
BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed thereto according to Thy word. 
With my whole heart have I sought Thee; O let me not err from Thy commandments. 
Thy word have I laid up in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee. 
Blessed art Thou, O LORD; teach me Thy statutes. 
With my lips have I told all the ordinances of Thy mouth. 
I have rejoiced in the way of Thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. 
I will meditate in Thy precepts, and have respect unto Thy ways. 
I will delight myself in Thy statutes; I will not forget Thy word. 
GIMEL. Deal bountifully with Thy servant that I may live, and I will observe Thy word. 
Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law. 
I am a sojourner in the earth; hide not Thy commandments from me. 
My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto Thine ordinances at all times. 
Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, that do err from Thy commandments. 
Take away from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept Thy testimonies. 
Even though princes sit and talk against me, thy servant doth meditate in Thy statutes. 
Yea, Thy testimonies are my delight, they are my counsellors. 
DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust; quicken Thou me according to Thy word. 
I told of my ways, and Thou didst answer me; teach me Thy statutes. 
Make me to understand the way of Thy precepts, that I may talk of Thy wondrous works. 
My soul melteth away for heaviness; sustain me according unto Thy word. 
Remove from me the way of falsehood; and grant me Thy law graciously. 
I have chosen the way of faithfulness; Thine ordinances have I set before me. 
I cleave unto Thy testimonies; O LORD, put me not to shame. 
I will run the way of Thy commandments, for Thou dost enlarge my heart. 
HE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of Thy statutes; and I will keep it at every step. 
Give me understanding, that I keep Thy law and observe it with my whole heart. 
Make me to tread in the path of Thy commandments; for therein do I delight. 
Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. 
Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken me in Thy ways. 
Confirm Thy word unto Thy servant, which pertaineth unto the fear of Thee. 
Turn away my reproach which I dread; for Thine ordinances are good. 
Behold, I have longed after Thy precepts; quicken me in Thy righteousness. 
VAV. Let Thy mercies also come unto me, O LORD, even Thy salvation, according to Thy word; 
That I may have an answer for him that taunteth me; for I trust in Thy word. 
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I hope in Thine ordinances; 
So shall I observe Thy law continually for ever and ever; 
And I will walk at ease, for I have sought Thy precepts; 
I will also speak of Thy testimonies before kings, and will not be ashamed. 
And I will delight myself in Thy commandments, which I have loved. 
I will lift up my hands also unto Thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in Thy statutes. 
ZAIN. Remember the word unto Thy servant, because Thou hast made me to hope. 
This is my comfort in my affliction, that Thy word hath quickened me. 
The proud have had me greatly in derision; yet have I not turned aside from Thy law. 
I have remembered Thine ordinances which are of old, O LORD, and have comforted myself. 
Burning indignation hath taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that forsake Thy law. 
Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 
I have remembered Thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have observed Thy law. 
This I have had, that I have kept Thy precepts. 
HETH. My portion is the LORD, I have said that I would observe Thy words. 
I have entreated Thy favour with my whole heart; be gracious unto me according to Thy word. 
I considered my ways, and turned my feet unto Thy testimonies. 
I made haste, and delayed not, to observe Thy commandments. 
The bands of the wicked have enclosed me; but I have not forgotten Thy law. 
At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee because of Thy righteous ordinances. 
I am a companion of all them that fear Thee, and of them that observe Thy precepts. 
The earth, O LORD, is full of Thy mercy; teach me Thy statutes. 
TETH. Thou hast dealt well with Thy servant, O LORD, according unto Thy word. 
Teach me good discernment and knowledge; for I have believed Thy commandments. 
Before I was afflicted, I did err; but now I observe Thy word. 
Thou art good, and doest good; teach me Thy statutes. 
The proud have forged a lie against me; but I with my whole heart will keep Thy precepts.

The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. 
JOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me; give me understanding, that I may learn Thy commandments. 
They that fear Thee shall see me and be glad, because I have hope in Thy word.

CAPH. My soul pineth for Thy salvation; in Thy word do I hope. 
Mine eyes fail for Thy word, saying: 'When wilt Thou comfort me?' 
For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke; yet do I not forget Thy statutes. 
How many are the days of Thy servant? When wilt Thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 
The proud have digged pits for me, which is not according to Thy law. 
All Thy commandments are faithful; they persecute me for nought; help Thou me. 
They had almost consumed me upon earth; but as for me, I forsook not Thy precepts. 
Quicken me after Thy lovingkindness, and I will observe the testimony of Thy mouth. 
LAMED. For ever, O LORD, Thy word standeth fast in heaven. 
Thy faithfulness is unto all generations; Thou hast established the earth, and it standeth. 
They stand this day according to Thine ordinances; for all things are Thy servants. 
Unless Thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine affliction. 
I will never forget Thy precepts; for with them Thou hast quickened me.

From Thy precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way. 
NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. 
I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Thy righteous ordinances.

I am Thy servant, give me understanding, that I may know Thy testimonies. 
It is time for the LORD to work; they have made void Thy law. 
Therefore I love Thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold. 
Therefore I esteem all Thy precepts concerning all things to be right; every false way I hate. 
PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore doth my soul keep them. 
The opening of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. 
I opened wide my mouth, and panted; for I longed for Thy commandments. 
Turn Thee towards me, and be gracious unto me, as is Thy wont to do unto those that love Thy name. 
Order my footsteps by Thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.

Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; and teach me Thy statutes. 
Mine eyes run down with rivers of water, because they observe not Thy law.

Of old have I known from Thy testimonies that Thou hast founded them for ever.
