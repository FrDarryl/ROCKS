Psalms.
Chapter 24.
A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 
For He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 
Who shall ascend into the mountain of the LORD? and who shall stand in His holy place? 
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not taken My name in vain, and hath not sworn deceitfully. 
He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
Such is the generation of them that seek after Him, that seek Thy face, even Jacob. Selah 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; that the King of glory may come in. 
'Who is the King of glory?' 'The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.' 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates, yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors; that the King of glory may come in. 
'Who then is the King of glory?' 'The LORD of hosts; He is the King of glory.' Selah
