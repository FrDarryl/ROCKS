Psalms.
Chapter 116.
I love that the LORD should hear my voice and my supplications. 
Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him all my days. 
The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the nether-world got hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow. 
But I called upon the name of the LORD: 'I beseech thee, O LORD, deliver my soul.' 
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is compassionate. 
The LORD preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me. 
Return, O my soul, unto Thy rest; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling. 
I shall walk before the LORD in the lands of the living. 
I trusted even when I spoke: 'I am greatly afflicted.' 
I said in my haste: 'All men are liars.' 
How can I repay unto the LORD all His bountiful dealings toward me? 
I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 
My vows will I pay unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all His people. 
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints. 
I beseech Thee, O LORD, for I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bands. 
I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 
I will pay my vows unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all His people; 
In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
