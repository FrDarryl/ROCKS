Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A Song of Ascents. Happy is every one that feareth the LORD, that walketh in His ways. 
When thou eatest the labour of thy hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house; thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. 
Behold, surely thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 
The LORD bless thee out of Zion; and see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life; 
And see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
