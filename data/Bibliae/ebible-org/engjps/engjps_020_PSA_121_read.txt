Psalms.
Chapter 121.
A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: from whence shall my help come? 
My help cometh from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; He that keepeth thee will not slumber. 
Behold, He that keepeth Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep. 
The LORD is thy keeper; the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 
The LORD shall keep thee from all evil; He shall keep thy soul. 
The LORD shall guard thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth and for ever.
