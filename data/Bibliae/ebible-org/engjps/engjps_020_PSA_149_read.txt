Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Hallelujah. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and His praise in the assembly of the saints. 
Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
Let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp. 
For the LORD taketh pleasure in His people; He adorneth the humble with salvation. 
Let the saints exult in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds. 
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 
To execute vengeance upon the nations, and chastisements upon the peoples; 
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
To execute upon them the judgment written; He is the glory of all His saints. Hallelujah.
