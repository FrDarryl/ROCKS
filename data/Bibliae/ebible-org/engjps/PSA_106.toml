'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` They soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel;

'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Thus they provoked Him with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.

"31" = '''
:sup:`31` And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for ever. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them;

"33" = '''
:sup:`33` For they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them; 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works; 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` And they served their idols, which became a snare unto them; 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons, 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.

"42" = '''
