Psalms.
Chapter 150.
Hallelujah. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the firmament of His power. 
Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to His abundant greatness. 
Praise Him with the blast of the horn; praise Him with the psaltery and harp. 
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and the pipe. 
Praise Him with the loud-sounding cymbals; praise Him with the clanging cymbals. 
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Hallelujah.
