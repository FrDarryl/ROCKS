Psalms.
Chapter 33.
Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous, praise is comely for the upright. 
Give thanks unto the LORD with harp, sing praises unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings. 
Sing unto Him a new song; play skilfully amid shouts of joy. 
For the word of the LORD is upright; and all His work is done in faithfulness. 
He loveth righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD. 
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth. 
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap; He layeth up the deeps in storehouses. 
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. 
For He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood. 
The LORD bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect. 
The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations. 
Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD; the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance. 
The LORD looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men; 
From the place of His habitation He looketh intently upon all the inhabitants of the earth; 
He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that considereth all their doings. 
A king is not saved by the multitude of a host; a mighty man is not delivered by great strength. 
A horse is a vain thing for safety; neither doth it afford escape by its great strength. 
Behold, the eye of the LORD is toward them that fear Him, toward them that wait for His mercy; 
To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. 
Our soul hath waited for the LORD; He is our help and our shield. 
For in Him doth our heart rejoice, because we have trusted in His holy name. 
Let Thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we have waited for Thee.
