Psalms.
Chapter 47.
(47-1) For the Leader; a Psalm for the sons of Korah. (47-2) O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
(47-3) For the LORD is most high, awful; a great King over all the earth. 
(47-4) He subdueth peoples under us, and nations under our feet. 
(47-5) He chooseth our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob whom He loveth. Selah 
(47-6) God is gone up amidst shouting, the LORD amidst the sound of the horn. 
(47-7) Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 
(47-8) For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises in a skilful song. 
(47-9) God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon His holy throne. 
(47-10) The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; for unto God belong the shields of the earth; He is greatly exalted.
