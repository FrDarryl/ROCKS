Job.
Chapter 16.
Then Job answered and said: 
I have heard many such things; sorry comforters are ye all. 
Shall windy words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest? 
I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you. 
I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips would assuage your grief. 
Though I speak, my pain is not assuaged; and though I forbear, what am I eased? 
But now He hath made me weary; Thou hast made desolate all my company. 
And Thou hast shrivelled me up, which is a witness against me; and my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face. 
He hath torn me in His wrath, and hated me; He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth; mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek scornfully; they gather themselves together against me. 
God delivereth me to the ungodly, and casteth me into the hands of the wicked. 
I was at ease, and He broke me asunder; yea, He hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces; He hath also set me up for His mark. 
His archers compass me round about, He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant. 
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust. 
My face is reddened with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 
Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. 
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting-place. 
Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, and He that testifieth of me is on high. 
Mine inward thoughts are my intercessors, mine eye poureth out tears unto God; 
That He would set aright a man contending with God, as a son of man setteth aright his neighbour! 
For the years that are few are coming on, and I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
