Psalms.
Chapter 34.
(34-1) A Psalm of David; when he changed his demeanour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. (34-2) I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. 
(34-3) My soul shall glory in the LORD; the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. 
(34-4) O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt His name together. 
(34-5) I sought the LORD, and He answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 
(34-6) They looked unto Him, and were radiant; and their faces shall never be abashed. 
(34-7) This poor man cried, and the LORD heard, and saved him out of all his troubles. 
(34-8) The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them. 
(34-9) O consider and see that the LORD is good; happy is the man that taketh refuge in Him. 
(34-10) O fear the LORD, ye His holy ones; for there is no want to them that fear Him. 
(34-11) The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the LORD want not any good thing. 
(34-12) Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 
(34-13) Who is the man that desireth life, and loveth days, that he may see good therein? 
(34-14) Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 
(34-15) Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 
(34-16) The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry. 
(34-17) The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 
(34-18) They cried, and the LORD heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles. 
(34-19) The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit. 
(34-20) Many are the ills of the righteous, but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. 
(34-21) He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken. 
(34-22) Evil shall kill the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be held guilty. 
(34-23) The LORD redeemeth the soul of His servants; and none of them that take refuge in Him shall be desolate.
