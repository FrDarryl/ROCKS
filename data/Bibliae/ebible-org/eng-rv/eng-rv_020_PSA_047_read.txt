Psalms.
Chapter 47.
For the Chief Musician; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
For the LORD Most High is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 
He shall subdue the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet. 
He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah 
God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 
Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 
For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 
God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne. 
The princes of the peoples are gathered together to be the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God; he is greatly exalted.
