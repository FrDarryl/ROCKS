Psalms.
Chapter 127.
A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 
It is vain for you that ye rise up early, and so late take rest, and eat the bread of toil: for so he giveth unto his beloved sleep. 
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. 
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
