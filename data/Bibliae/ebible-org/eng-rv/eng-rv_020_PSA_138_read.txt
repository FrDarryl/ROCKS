Psalms.
Chapter 138.
A Psalm of David. I will give thee thanks with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praises unto thee. 
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 
In the day that I called thou answeredst me, thou didst encourage me with strength in my soul. 
All the kings of the earth shall give thee thanks, O LORD, for they have heard the words of thy mouth. 
Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD; for great is the glory of the LORD. 
For though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the haughty he knoweth from afar. 
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. 
The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; forsake not the works of thine own hands.
