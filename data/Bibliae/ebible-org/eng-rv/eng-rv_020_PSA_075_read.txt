Psalms.
Chapter 75.
For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. We give thanks unto thee, O God; we give thanks, for thy name is near: men tell of thy wondrous works. 
When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly. 
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah 
I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 
Lift not up your horn on high; speak not with a stiff neck. 
For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up. 
But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and lifteth up another. 
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine foameth; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. 
But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
