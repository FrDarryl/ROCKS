Psalms.
Chapter 46.
For the Chief Musician: a Psalm of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, and though the mountains be moved in the heart of the seas; 
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah 
There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. 
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. 
The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah 
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariots in the fire. 
Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. 
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
