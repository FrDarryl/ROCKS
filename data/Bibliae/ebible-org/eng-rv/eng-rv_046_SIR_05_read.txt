SIRACH.
Chapter 5.
Set not thy heart upon thy goods; And say not, They are sufficient for me. 
Follow not thine own mind and thy strength, To walk in the desires of thy heart; 
And say not, Who shall have dominion over me? For the Lord will surely take vengeance on thee. 
Say not, I sinned, and what happened unto me? For the Lord is longsuffering. 
Concerning atonement, be not without fear, To add sin upon sins: 
And say not, His compassion is great; He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: For mercy and wrath are with him, And his indignation will rest upon sinners. 
Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord; And put not off from day to day: For suddenly shall the wrath of the Lord come forth; And thou shalt perish in the time of vengeance. 
Set not thine heart upon unrighteous gains: For thou shalt profit nothing in the day of calamity. 
Winnow not with every wind, And walk not in every path: Thus doeth the sinner that hath a double tongue. 
Be stedfast in thy understanding; And let thy word be one. 
Be swift to hear; And with patience make thine answer. 
If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbour; And if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth. 
Glory and dishonour is in talk: And the tongue of a man is his fall. 
Be not called a whisperer; And lie not in wait with thy tongue: For upon the thief there is shame, And an evil condemnation upon him that hath a double tongue. 
In a great matter and in a small, be not ignorant;
