:sup:`2` After that I became lord over many nations, and had dominion over the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of my authority, but carrying myself alway with equity and mildness, I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life, and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to the utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men.

:sup:`3` Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and stedfast fidelity, and had the honour of the second place in the kingdom,

"4" = '''
:sup:`4` declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain malignant people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually set aside the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms, honourably intended by us, cannot go forward. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Seeing then we understand that this nation is alone continually in opposition unto all men, following perversely a life which is strange to our  laws, and evil affected to our state, working all the mischief they can, that our kingdom may not be firmly stablished: 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` therefore have we commanded, that they that are signified in writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs, and is a second father unto us, shall all, with their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year:

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` and said, O Lord, Lord, thou King Almighty: for the whole world is in thy power, and if it be thy will to save Israel, there is no man that can gainsay thee: 
'''
"10" = '''

"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Aman. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For I could have been content with good will for the salvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of man above the glory of God: neither will I bow down unto any but to thee, which art my Lord, neither will I do it in pride.

:sup:`18` And all Israel cried out mightily, because their death was before their eyes.
