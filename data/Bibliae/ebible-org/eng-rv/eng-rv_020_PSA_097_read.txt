Psalms.
Chapter 97.
The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad. 
Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the foundation of his throne. 
A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his adversaries round about. 
His lightnings lightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 
The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth; 
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples have seen his glory. 
Ashamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 
Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced; because of thy judgments, O LORD. 
For thou, LORD, art most high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 
O ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
Be glad in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks to his holy name.
