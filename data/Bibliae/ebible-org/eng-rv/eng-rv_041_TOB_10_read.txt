Tobit.
Chapter 10.
And Tobit his father made his count every day: and when the days of the journey were expired, and they came not, 
he said, Is he perchance detained? or is Gabael perchance dead, and there is no man to give him the money? 
And he was sorely grieved. 
But his wife said unto him, The child hath perished, seeing he tarrieth long; and she began to bewail him, and said, 
I care for nothing, my child, since I have let thee go, the light of mine eyes. 
And Tobit saith unto her, Hold thy peace, take no care; he is in good health. 
And she said unto him, Hold thy peace, deceive me not; my child hath perished. And she went out every day into the way by which they went, and did eat no bread in the day-time, and ceased not whole nights to bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there. But Tobias said unto Raguel, Send me away, for my father and my mother look no more to see me. 
But his father in law said unto him, Abide with me, and I will send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him how things go with thee. 
And Tobias saith, No; but send me away to my father. 
But Raguel arose, and gave him Sarah his wife, and half his goods, servants and cattle and money; 
and he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God of heaven shall prosper you, my children, before I die. 
And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thy mother in law; they are now thy parents; let me hear a good report of thee. And he kissed her. And Edna said to Tobias, The Lord of heaven restore thee, dear brother, and grant to me that I may see thy children of my daughter Sarah, that I may rejoice before the Lord: and, behold, I commit my daughter unto thee in special trust: vex her not.
