Psalms.
Chapter 98.
A Psalm. Sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him. 
The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations. 
He hath remembered his mercy and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. 
Sing praises unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody: 
With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the King, the LORD. 
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein; 
Let the floods clap their hands; let the hills sing for joy together; 
Before the LORD, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
