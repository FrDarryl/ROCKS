Psalms.
Chapter 92.
A Psalm, a Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: 
To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, 
With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; with a solemn sound upon the harp. 
For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 
How great are thy works, O LORD! thy thoughts are very deep. 
A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this: 
When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: 
But thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore. 
For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. 
Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me. 
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
They that are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: 
To shew that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
