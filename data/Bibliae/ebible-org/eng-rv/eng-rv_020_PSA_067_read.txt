Psalms.
Chapter 67.
For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm, a Song. God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah 
That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. 
Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee. 
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah 
Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee. 
The earth hath yielded her increase: God, even our own God, shall bless us. 
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
