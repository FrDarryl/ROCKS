Psalms.
Chapter 20.
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The LORD answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; 
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; 
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah 
Grant thee thy heart’s desire, and fulfill all thy counsel. 
We will triumph in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfill all thy petitions. 
Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he wilt answer him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will make mention of the name of the LORD our God. 
They are bowed down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. 
Save, LORD: let the King answer us when we call.
