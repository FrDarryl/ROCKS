Psalms.
Chapter 120.
A Song of Ascents. In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he answered me. 
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 
What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, thou deceitful tongue? 
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 
My soul hath long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace. 
I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
