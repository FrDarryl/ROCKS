Baruch.
Chapter 5.
Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of thy mourning and affliction, and put on the comeliness of the glory that cometh  from God for ever. 
Cast about thee the robe of the righteousness which cometh  from God; set a diadem on thine head of the glory of the Everlasting. 
For God will shew thy brightness unto every region  under heaven. 
For thy name shall be called of God for ever The peace of righteousness, and The glory of godliness. 
Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand upon the height, and look about thee toward the east, and behold thy children gathered from the going down of the sun unto the rising thereof at the word of the Holy One, rejoicing that God hath remembered them. 
For they went from thee on foot, being led away of their enemies: but God bringeth them in unto thee borne on high with glory, as on  a royal throne. 
For God hath appointed that every high mountain, and the everlasting hills, should be made low, and the valleys filled up, to make plain the ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God. 
Moreover the woods and every sweet-smelling tree have overshadowed Israel by the commandment of God. 
For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that cometh from him.
