Psalms.
Chapter 99.
The LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble: he sitteth upon the cherubim; let the earth be moved. 
The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the peoples. 
Let them praise thy great and terrible name: holy is he. 
The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 
Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool: holy is he. 
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call on his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 
He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud: they kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them. 
Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their doings. 
Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
