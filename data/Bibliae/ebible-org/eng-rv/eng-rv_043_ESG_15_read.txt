ESTHER (GREEK).
Chapter 15.
And upon the third day, when she had ended her prayer, she laid away her garments of service, and put on her glorious apparel. 
And being majestically adorned, after she had called upon the all-seeing God and saviour, she took her two maids with her: 
and upon the one she leaned, as carrying herself delicately; 
and the other followed, bearing up her train. 
And she was ruddy through the perfection of her beauty, and her countenance was cheerful and  right amiable: but her heart was in anguish for fear. 
Then having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed with all his robes of majesty, all glittering  with gold and precious stones; and he was very dreadful. 
Then lifting up his countenance that was flushed with glory, he looked upon her  in fierce anger: and the queen fell down, and turned pale, and fainted, and she bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before. 
Then God changed the spirit of the king into mildness, who in an agony leaped from his throne, and took her in his arms, till she came to herself again, and comforted her with soothing words, and said unto her, 
Esther, what is the matter? I am thy brother, be of good cheer: 
thou shalt not die, for our commandment is for our subjects: come near. 
So he held up his golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck, 
and embraced her, and said, Speak unto me. 
Then said she unto him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy glory. 
For wonderful art thou, my lord, and thy countenance is full of grace. 
And as she was speaking, she fell down for faintness. 
Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.
