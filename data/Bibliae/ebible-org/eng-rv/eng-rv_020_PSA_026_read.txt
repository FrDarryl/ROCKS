Psalms.
Chapter 26.
A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD without wavering. 
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; and I have walked in thy truth. 
I have not sat with vain persons; neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
I hate the congregation of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked. 
I will wash mine hands in innocency; so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: 
That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 
LORD, I love the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth. 
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood: 
In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 
My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
