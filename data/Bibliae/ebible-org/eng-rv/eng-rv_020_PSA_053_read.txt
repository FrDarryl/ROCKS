Psalms.
Chapter 53.
For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth good. 
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek after God. 
Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon God. 
There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee; thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them. 
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
