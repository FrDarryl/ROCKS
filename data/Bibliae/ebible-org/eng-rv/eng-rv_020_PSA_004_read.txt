Psalms.
Chapter 4.
For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonour? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah 
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him. 
Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah 
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 
Many there be that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 
Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than they have when their corn and their wine are increased. 
In peace will I both lay me down and sleep: for thou, LORD, alone makest me dwell in safety.
