Psalms.
Chapter 140.
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man: 
Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually do they gather themselves together for war. 
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips. Selah 
Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps. 
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the way side; they have set gins for me. Selah 
I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah 
As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 
An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the needy. 
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
