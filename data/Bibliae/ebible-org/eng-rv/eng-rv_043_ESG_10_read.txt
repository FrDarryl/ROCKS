ESTHER (GREEK).
Chapter 10.
Then Mardocheus said, These things are of God. 
For I remember the dream which I saw concerning these matters, and nothing thereof hath failed. 
As for the little fountain that became a river, and there was light, and the sun, and much water, the river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen: 
and the two dragons are I and Aman: 
and the nations are those  that were assembled to destroy the name of the Jews: 
and my nation, this is Israel, which cried to God, and were saved: for the Lord hath saved his people, and the Lord hath delivered us from all these evils, and God hath wrought signs and great wonders, which have not been done among the nations. 
Therefore hath he made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the nations. 
And these two lots came at the hour, and time, and day of judgement, before God among all the nations. 
So God remembered his people, and justified his inheritance. 
Therefore these days shall be unto them in the month Adar, the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month, with an assembly, and joy, and with gladness before God, throughout the generations for ever among his people Israel.
