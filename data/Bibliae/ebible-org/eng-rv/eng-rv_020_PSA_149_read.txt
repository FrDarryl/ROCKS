Psalms.
Chapter 149.
Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the assembly of the saints. 
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. 
Let the saints exult in glory: let them sing for joy upon their beds. 
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 
To execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples; 
To bind their king’s with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
