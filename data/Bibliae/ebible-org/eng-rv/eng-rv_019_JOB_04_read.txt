Job.
Chapter 4.
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 
Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 
Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast confirmed the feeble knees. 
But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 
Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, and thy hope the integrity of thy ways? 
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the upright cut off? 
According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow trouble, reap the same. 
By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger are they consumed. 
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. 
Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a whisper thereof. 
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, 
Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. 
It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; a form was before mine eyes: there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, 
Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 
Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; and his angels he chargeth with folly: 
How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth! 
Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: they perish for ever without any regarding it. 
Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? they die, and that without wisdom.
