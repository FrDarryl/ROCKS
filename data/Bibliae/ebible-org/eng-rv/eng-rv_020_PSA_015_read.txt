Psalms.
Chapter 15.
A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart. 
He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his friend, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 
In whose eyes a reprobate is despised; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 
He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
