Psalms.
Chapter 121.
A Song of Ascents. I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: from whence shall my help come? 
My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 
The LORD shall keep thee from all evil; he shall keep thy soul. 
The LORD shall keep thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth and for evermore.
