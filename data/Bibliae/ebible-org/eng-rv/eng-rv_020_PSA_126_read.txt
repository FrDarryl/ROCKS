Psalms.
Chapter 126.
A Song of Ascents. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like unto them that dream. 
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, The LORD hath done great things for them. 
The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 
Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the South. 
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 
Though he goeth on his way weeping, bearing forth the seed; he shall come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
