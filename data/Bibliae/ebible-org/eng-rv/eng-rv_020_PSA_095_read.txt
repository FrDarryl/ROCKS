Psalms.
Chapter 95.
O COME, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 
For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 
In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. 
The sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land. 
O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker: 
For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, Oh that ye would hear his voice! 
Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness: 
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 
Forty years long was I grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 
Wherefore I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.
