Psalms.
Chapter 128.
A Song of Ascents. Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD, that walketh in his ways. 
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thine house: thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. 
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 
Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children. Peace be upon Israel.
