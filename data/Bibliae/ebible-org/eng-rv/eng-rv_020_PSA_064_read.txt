Psalms.
Chapter 64.
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers; from the tumult of the workers of iniquity: 
Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrows, even bitter words: 
That they may shoot in secret places at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 
They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, say they, a diligent search: and the inward thought of every one, and the heart, is deep. 
But God shall shoot at them; with an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded. 
So they shall be made to stumble, their own tongue being against them: all that see them shall wag the head. 
And all men shall fear; and they shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely consider of his doing. 
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
