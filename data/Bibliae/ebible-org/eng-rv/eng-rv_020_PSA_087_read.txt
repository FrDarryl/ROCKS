Psalms.
Chapter 87.
A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains. 
The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah 
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this one was born there. 
Yea, of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish her. 
The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the peoples, this one was born there. Selah 
They that sing as well as they that dance shall say, All my fountains are in thee.
