"1" = '''
:sup:`1` In three things I was beautified, And stood up beautiful before the Lord and men: The concord of brethren, and friendship of neighbours, And a woman and her husband that walk together in agreement. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` But three sorts of men  my soul hateth, And I am greatly offended at their life: A poor man that is haughty, and a rich man that is a liar, And  an old man that is an adulterer lacking understanding. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` In thy  youth thou hast not gathered, And how shouldest thou find in thine old age? 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` How beautiful a thing is judgement for gray hairs, And for elders to know counsel! 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` How beautiful is the wisdom of old men, And thought and counsel to men that are in honour! 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Much experience is the crown of old men; And their glorying is the fear of the Lord. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` There be nine things that I have thought of, and in mine heart counted happy; And the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; A man that liveth and looketh upon the fall of his enemies: 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Happy is he that dwelleth with a wife of understanding; And he that hath not slipped with his tongue; And he that hath not served a man that is unworthy of him: 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Happy is he that hath found prudence; And he that discourseth in the ears of them that listen. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` How great is he that hath found wisdom! Yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` The fear of the Lord passeth all things: He that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Give me  any plague but the plague of the heart; And any wickedness but the wickedness of a woman; 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Any calamity, but a calamity from them that hate me; And any vengeance, but the vengeance of enemies. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` There is no head above the head of a serpent; And there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` I will rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, Than keep house with a wicked woman. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` The wickedness of a woman changeth her look, And darkeneth her countenance as a bear doth. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Her husband shall sit at meat among his neighbours, And when he heareth it he sigheth bitterly. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` All malice is but little to the malice of a woman: Let the portion of a sinner fall on her. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` As  the going up a sandy way is  to the feet of the aged, So is a wife full of words to a quiet man. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Throw not thyself upon the beauty of a woman; And desire not a woman for her beauty. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` There is anger, and impudence, and great reproach, If a woman maintain her husband. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` A wicked woman is abasement of heart, And sadness of countenance, and a wounded heart: A woman that will not make her husband happy Is as  hands that hang down, and palsied knees. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` From a woman was  the beginning of sin; And because of her we all die. 
'''

'''
