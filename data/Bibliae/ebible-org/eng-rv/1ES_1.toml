'''
"30" = '''

'''
"32" = '''

'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

:sup:`39` Five and twenty years old was Joakim when he began to reign in Judaea and Jerusalem; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. 
'''
"40" = '''

:sup:`41` Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them up in his own temple at Babylon.

:sup:`42` But those things that are reported of him, and of his uncleanness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` And Joakim his son reigned in his stead: for when he was made king he was eighteen years old; 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did that which was evil before the Lord. 
'''
"45" = '''

:sup:`47` and he also did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken by Jeremy the prophet from the mouth of the Lord. 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, and his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord, the God of Israel. 
'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` Moreover the governors of the people and of the priests did many things wickedly, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem. 
'''
"50" = '''
:sup:`50` And the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he had compassion on them and on his dwelling place. 
'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` But they mocked his messengers; and in the day when the Lord spake unto them, they scoffed at his prophets: 
'''
"52" = '''
:sup:`52` so far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded to bring up the kings of the Chaldeans against them; 
'''
"53" = '''

'''
"55" = '''

"56" = '''
:sup:`56` and as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had brought them all to nought: and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon: 
'''
"57" = '''
