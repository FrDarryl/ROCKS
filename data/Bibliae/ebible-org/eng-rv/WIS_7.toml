"1" = '''
:sup:`1` I myself also am mortal, like to all, And am sprung from one born of the earth, the man  first formed, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And in the womb of a mother was I moulded into flesh in the time of ten months, Being compacted in blood of the seed of man and pleasure that came with sleep. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And I also, when I was born, drew in the common air, And fell upon the kindred earth, Uttering, like all, for my first voice, the selfsame wail: 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` In swaddling clothes was I nursed, and with watchful  cares. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For no king had any other first beginning; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` But all men have one entrance into life, and a like departure. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For this cause I prayed, and understanding was given me: I called upon God,  and there came to me a spirit of wisdom. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, And riches I esteemed nothing in comparison of her. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem, Because all the gold of the earth  in her presence is a little sand, And silver shall be accounted as clay before her. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Above health and comeliness I loved her, And I chose to have her rather than light, Because her bright shining is never laid to sleep. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` But with her there came to me all good things together, And in her hands innumerable riches: 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And I rejoiced over them  all because wisdom leadeth them; Though I knew not that she was the mother of them. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` As I learned without guile, I impart without grudging; I do not hide her riches. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For she is unto men a treasure that faileth not, And they that use it obtain friendship with God, Commended to him  by the gifts which they through discipline present to him.  
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But to me may God give to speak with judgement, And to conceive thoughts worthy of what hath been given me;  Because himself is one that guideth even wisdom and that correcteth the wise. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For in his hand are both we and our words; All understanding, and all  acquaintance with divers crafts. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For himself gave me an unerring knowledge of the things that are, To know the constitution of the world, and the operation of the elements; 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` The beginning and end and middle of times, The alternations of the solstices and the changes of seasons, 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` The circuits of years and the positions of stars; 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` The natures of living creatures and the ragings of wild beasts, The violences of winds and the thoughts of men, The diversities of plants and the virtues of roots: 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` All things that are either secret or manifest I learned, 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For she that is the artificer of all things taught me, even  wisdom. For there is in her a spirit quick of understanding, holy, Alone in kind, manifold, Subtil, freely moving, Clear in utterance, unpolluted, Distinct, unharmed, Loving what is good, keen, unhindered, 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Beneficent, loving toward man, Stedfast, sure, free from care, All-powerful, all-surveying, And penetrating through all spirits That are quick of understanding, pure, most subtil: 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For wisdom is more mobile than any motion; Yea, she pervadeth and penetrateth all things by reason of her pureness. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` For she is a breath of the power of God, And a clear effluence of the glory of the Almighty; Therefore can nothing defiled find entrance into her. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` For she is an effulgence from everlasting light, And an unspotted mirror of the working of God, And an image of his goodness. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And she, being one, hath power to do all things; And remaining in herself, reneweth all things: And from generation to generation passing into holy souls She maketh men  friends of God and prophets. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` For nothing doth God love save him that dwelleth with wisdom. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` For she is fairer than the sun, And above all the constellations of the stars: Being compared with light, she is found to be  before it; 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` For to the light of day  succeedeth night, But against wisdom evil doth not prevail;
