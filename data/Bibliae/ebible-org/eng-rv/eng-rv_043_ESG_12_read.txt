ESTHER (GREEK).
Chapter 12.
And Mardocheus took his rest in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, that were keepers of the court. 
And he heard their communings, and searched out their purposes, and learned that they were about to lay hands upon Artaxerxes the king; and he certified the king of them. 
Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and after that they had confessed it, they were led to execution. 
And the king wrote these things for a memorial; Mardocheus also wrote concerning these things. 
So the king commanded Mardocheus to serve in the court, and for this he gave him gifts. 
Howbeit Aman the son of Amadathus, a Bugean, who was in great honour with the king, sought to molest Mardocheus and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.
