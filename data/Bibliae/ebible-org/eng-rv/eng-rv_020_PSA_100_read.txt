Psalms.
Chapter 100.
A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 
Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 
Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: give thanks unto him, and bless his name. 
For the LORD is good; his mercy endureth for ever; and his faithfulness unto all generations.
