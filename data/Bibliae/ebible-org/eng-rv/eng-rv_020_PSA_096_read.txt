Psalms.
Chapter 96.
O SING unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 
Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 
Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples. 
For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 
For all the gods of the peoples are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: tremble before him, all the earth. 
Say among the nations, The LORD reigneth: the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved: he shall judge the peoples with equity. 
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 
Let the field exult, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy; 
Before the LORD, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.
