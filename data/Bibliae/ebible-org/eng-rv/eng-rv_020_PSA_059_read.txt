Psalms.
Chapter 59.
For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David: Michtam: when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: set me on high from them that rise up against me. 
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the bloodthirsty men. 
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty gather themselves together against me: not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. 
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake thou to help me, and behold. 
Even thou, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah 
They return at evening, they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear? 
But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. 
O my strength, I will wait upon thee: for God is my high tower. 
The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies. 
Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak. 
Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth. Selah 
And at evening let them return, let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
They shall wander up and down for meat and tarry all night if they be not satisfied. 
But I will sing of thy strength; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress. 
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises: for God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
