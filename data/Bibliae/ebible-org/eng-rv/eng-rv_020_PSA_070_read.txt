Psalms.
Chapter 70.
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David; to bring to remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour that delight in my hurt. 
Let them be turned back by reason of their shame that say, Aha, Aha. 
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 
But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
