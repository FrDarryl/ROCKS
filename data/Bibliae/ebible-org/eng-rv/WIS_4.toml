"3" = '''
:sup:`3` But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall be of no profit, And with bastard slips they shall not strike deep root, Nor shall they establish a sure hold.

"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Their  branches shall be broken off before they come to maturity, and their fruit shall be  useless, Never ripe to eat, and fit for nothing.

"12" = '''
:sup:`12` (For the bewitching of naughtiness bedimmeth the things which are good, And the giddy whirl of desire perverteth an innocent mind.)

:sup:`15` But as for the peoples, seeing and understanding not, Neither laying this to heart, That grace and mercy are with his chosen, And that he visiteth his holy ones:- 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` But a righteous man that is dead shall condemn the ungodly that are living, And youth that is quickly perfected the many years of an unrighteous man’s old age; 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For the ungodly  shall see a wise man’s end, And shall not understand what the Lord purposed concerning him, And for what he safely kept him:- 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` They shall see, and they shall despise; But them the Lord shall laugh to scorn. And after this they shall become a dishonoured carcase, And a reproach among the dead for ever:

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` They shall come, when their sins are reckoned up, with coward fear; And their lawless deeds shall convict them to their face.
