Psalms.
Chapter 122.
A Song of Ascents; of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of the LORD. 
Our feet are standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem; 
Jerusalem, that art builded as a city that is compact together: 
Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD for a testimony unto Israel, to give thanks into the name of the LORD. 
For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 
Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 
For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 
For the sake of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
