"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Blessed art thou, O Lord, thou God of our fathers, and worthy to be praised; and thy name is glorified for evermore:

'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even  Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgements: for according to truth and justice hast thou brought all these things upon us because of our sins.

"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Nevertheless in a contrite heart and a humble spirit let us be accepted; 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs; so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant  that we may wholly go after thee, for they shall not be ashamed that put their trust in thee.
