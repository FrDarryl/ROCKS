"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth, Think ye of the Lord with a good mind, And in singleness of heart seek ye him; 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Because he is found of them that tempt him not, And is manifested to them that do not distrust him. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For crooked thoughts separate from God; And the supreme  Power, when it is brought to the proof, putteth to confusion the foolish: 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Because wisdom will not enter into a soul that deviseth evil, Nor dwell in a body that is held in pledge by sin. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For a holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit. And will start away from thoughts that are without understanding, And will be put to confusion when unrighteousness hath come in. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For wisdom is a spirit that loveth man, And she will not hold a blasphemer guiltless for his lips; Because God beareth witness of his reins, And is a true overseer of his heart, And a hearer of his tongue: 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Because the spirit of the Lord hath filled the world, And that which holdeth all things together hath knowledge of every  voice. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Therefore no man that uttereth unrighteous things shall be unseen; Neither shall Justice, when it convicteth, pass him by. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For in the midst of  his counsels the ungodly shall be searched out; And the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord To bring to conviction his lawless deeds: 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Because there is  an ear of jealousy that  listeneth to all things, And the noise of murmurings is not hid. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Beware then of unprofitable murmuring, And refrain your tongue from backbiting; Because no secret utterance shall go on its way void, And a mouth that belieth destroyeth a soul. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Court not death in the error of your life; Neither draw upon yourselves destruction by the works of your hands: 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Because God made not death; Neither delighteth he when the living perish: 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For he created all things that they might have being: And the generative powers of the world are  healthsome, And there is no poison of destruction in them: Nor hath Hades royal dominion upon earth, 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` For righteousness is immortal: 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` But ungodly men by their hands and their words called death unto them: Deeming him a friend they consumed away, And they made a covenant with him, Because they are worthy to be of his portion.
