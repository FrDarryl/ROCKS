Psalms.
Chapter 133.
A Song of Ascents; of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 
It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard; that came down upon the skirt of his garments; 
Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
