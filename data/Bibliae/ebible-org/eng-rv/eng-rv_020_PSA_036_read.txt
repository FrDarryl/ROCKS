Psalms.
Chapter 36.
For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes. 
For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, that his iniquity shall not be found out and be hated. 
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise and to do good. 
He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. 
Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies. 
Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 
How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. 
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 
For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light. 
O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
