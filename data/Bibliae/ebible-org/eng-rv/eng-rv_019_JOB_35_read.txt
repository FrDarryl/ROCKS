Job.
Chapter 35.
Moreover Elihu answered and said, 
Thinkest thou this to be thy right, or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s, 
That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned? 
I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 
Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the skies, which are higher than thou. 
If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him. 
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 
Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit a son of man. 
By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night; 
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 
There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 
How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, the cause is before him, and thou waitest for him! 
But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, neither doth he greatly regard arrogance; 
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
