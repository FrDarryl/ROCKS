:sup:`1` O Lord, Father and Master of my life, Abandon me not to their counsel: Suffer me not to fall by them. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Who will set scourges over my thought, And a discipline of wisdom over mine heart? That they spare me not for mine ignorances, And my heart  pass not by their sins: 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` That mine ignorances be not multiplied, And my sins abound not; And I shall fall before mine adversaries, And mine enemy rejoice over me. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` O Lord, Father and God of my life, Give me not a proud look, 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And turn away concupiscense from me. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Let not greediness and chambering overtake me; And give me not over to a shameless mind. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Hear ye, my children, the discipline of the mouth; And he that keepeth it shall not be taken. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` The sinner shall be overtaken in his lips; And the reviler and the proud man shall stumble therein. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Accustom not thy mouth to an oath; And be not accustomed to the naming of the Holy One. 
'''

'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` A man of many oaths shall be filled with iniquity; And the scourge shall not depart from his house: If he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him; And if he disregard it, he hath sinned doubly; And if he hath sworn in vain, he shall not be justified; For his house shall be filled with calamities. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` There is a manner of speech that is clothed about with death: Let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob; For all these things shall be far from the godly, And they shall not wallow in sins. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Accustom not thy mouth to gross rudeness, For therein is the word of sin. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Remember thy father and thy mother, For thou sittest in the midst of great men; That thou be not forgetful before them, And become a fool by thy custom; So shalt thou wish that thou hadst not been born, And curse the day of thy nativity.

"15" = '''
:sup:`15` A man that is accustomed to words of reproach Will not be corrected all the days of his life. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Two sorts of men  multiply sins, And the third will bring wrath: A hot mind, as a burning fire, will not be quenched till it be consumed: A fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease till he hath burned out the fire. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` All bread is sweet to a fornicator: He will not leave off till he die. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` A man that goeth astray from his own bed, Saying in his heart, Who seeth me? Darkness is round about me, and the walls hide me, And no man seeth me; of whom am I afraid? The Most High will not remember my sins; 
'''

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` All things were known unto him or ever they were created; And in like manner also after they were perfected. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` This man shall be punished in the streets of the city; And where he suspected not he shall be taken. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` So also a wife that leaveth her husband, And bringeth in an heir by a stranger. 
'''
"23" = '''
