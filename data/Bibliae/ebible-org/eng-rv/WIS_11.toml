"3" = '''
:sup:`3` They withstood enemies, and repelled foes.

"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They thirsted, and they called upon thee, And there was given them water out of the flinty rock, And healing of their thirst out of the hard stone. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For by what things their foes were punished, By these they in their need were benefited. 
'''

:sup:`6` When the enemy  were troubled with clotted blood instead of a river’s ever-flowing fountain,

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Having shewn them  by the thirst which they had suffered how thou didst punish the adversaries. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For when they were tried, albeit but in mercy chastened, They learned how the ungodly were tormented, being judged with wrath: 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For these, as a father, admonishing them, thou didst prove; But those, as a stern king, condemning them, thou didst search out. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Yea and whether they were far off from the righteous  or near them,  they were alike distressed; 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For a double grief took hold on them, And a groaning at the remembrance of things past. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For when they heard that through their own punishments the others had been benefited, They felt the presence of  the Lord; 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For him who long before was cast forth and exposed they left off mocking: In the last issue of what came to pass they marvelled, Having thirsted in another manner than the righteous. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But in requital of the senseless imaginings of their unrighteousness, Wherein they were led astray to worship irrational reptiles and wretched vermin, Thou didst send upon them a multitude of irrational creatures for vengeance; 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` That they might learn, that by what things a man sinneth, by these he is punished. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For thine all-powerful hand, That created the world out of formless matter, Lacked not means to send upon them a multitude of bears, or fierce lions, 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Or new-created wild beasts, full of rage, of  unknown kind,  Either breathing out a blast of fiery breath, Or blowing forth from their nostrils  noisome smoke, Or flashing dreadful sparkles from their eyes; 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Which had power not only to consume them by their violence, But to destroy them even by the terror of their sight. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Yea and without these might they have fallen by a single breath, Being pursued by Justice, and scattered abroad by the breath of thy power. But by measure and number and weight thou didst order all things. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For to be greatly strong is thine at all times; And the might of thine arm who shall withstand?

"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Because the whole world before thee is as a grain in a balance, And as a drop of dew that at morning cometh down upon the earth.

'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For thou lovest all things that are, And abhorrest none of the things which thou didst make; For never wouldest thou have formed anything if thou didst hate it. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And how would anything have endured, except thou hadst willed it? Or that which was not called by thee, how would  it have been preserved? 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` But thou sparest all things, because they are thine, O Soverign Lord, thou lover of men’s  lives;
