SIRACH.
Chapter 8.
Contend not with a mighty man, Lest haply thou fall into his hands. 
Strive not with a rich man, lest haply he overweigh thee: For gold hath destroyed many, And turned aside the hearts of kings. 
Contend not with a man that is full of tongue, And heap not wood upon his fire. 
Jest not with a rude man, Lest thine ancestors be dishonoured. 
Reproach not a man when he turneth from sin: Remember that we are all worthy of punishment. 
Dishonour not a man in his old age; For some of us also are waxing old. 
Rejoice not over one that is dead: Remember that we die all. 
Neglect not the discourse of the wise, And be conversant with their proverbs; For of them thou shalt learn instruction, And how to minister to great men. 
Miss not the discourse of the aged; For they also learned of their fathers: Because from them thou shalt learn understanding, And to give answer in time of need. 
Kindle not the coals of a sinner, Lest thou be burned with the flame of his fire. 
Rise not up from the presence of an insolent man, Lest he lie in wait as an ambush for thy mouth. 
Lend not to a man that is mightier than thyself; And if thou lend, be as one that hath lost. 
Be not surety above thy power: And if thou be surety, take thought as one that will have to pay. 
Go not to law with a judge; For according to his honour will they give judgement for him. 
Go not in the way with a rash man, Lest he be aggrieved with thee; For he will do according to his own will, And thou shalt perish with his folly. 
Fight not with a wrathful man, And travel not with him through the desert: For blood is as nothing in his sight; And where there is no help, he will overthrow thee. 
Take not counsel with a fool; For he will not be able to conceal the matter. 
Do no secret thing before a stranger; For thou knowest not what he will bring forth. 
Open not thine heart to every man; And let him not return thee a favour.
