Psalms.
Chapter 93.
The LORD reigneth; he is apparelled with majesty; the LORD is apparelled, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 
Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty. 
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for evermore.
