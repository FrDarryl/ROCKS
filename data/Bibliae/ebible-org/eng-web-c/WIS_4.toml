"2" = '''
:sup:`2` When it is present, people imitate it. They long after it when it has departed. Throughout all time it marches, crowned in triumph, victorious in the competition for the prizes that are undefiled.

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For honorable old age is not that which stands in length of time, nor is its measure given by number of years,

"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But the peoples saw and didn’t understand, not considering this, that grace and mercy are with his chosen, and that he visits his holy ones;

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` They will come with coward fear when their sins are counted. Their lawless deeds will convict them to their face.
