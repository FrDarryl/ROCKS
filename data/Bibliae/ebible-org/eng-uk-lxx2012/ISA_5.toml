"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Now I will sing to my beloved a song of my beloved concerning my vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a high hill in a fertile place. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And I made a hedge round it, and dug a trench, and planted a choice vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and dug a place for the wine-vat in it: and I waited for it to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth thorns. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And now, you⌃ dwellers in Jerusalem, and every man of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` What shall I do any more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Whereas I expected it to bring forth grapes, but it has brought forth thorns. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will pull down its walls, and it shall be left to be trodden down. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Juda his beloved plant: I expected it to bring forth judgement, and it brought forth iniquity; and not righteousness, but a cry. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Woe to them that join house to house, and add field to field, that they may take away something of their neighbour's: will you⌃ dwell alone upon the land? 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For these things have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For where ten yoke of oxen plough the land shall yield one , and he that sows six homers shall produce three measures. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Woe to them that rise up in the morning, and follow strong drink; who wait at it till evening: for the wine shall inflame them. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For they drink wine with harp, and lute, and drums, and pipes: but they regard not the works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Therefore my people have been taken captive, because they know not the Lord: and there has been a multitude of dead bodies, because of hunger and of thirst for water. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Therefore hell has enlarged its desire and opened its mouth without ceasing: and her glorious and great, and her rich and her pestilent men shall go down into it. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the mean man shall be brought low, and the great man shall be disgraced, and the lofty eyes shall be brought low. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgement, and the holy God shall be glorified in righteousness. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And they that were spoiled shall be fed as bulls, and lambs shall feed on the waste places of them that are taken away. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Woe to them that draw sins to them as with a long rope, and iniquities as with a thong of the heifer's yoke: 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` who say, Let him speedily hasten what he will do, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; who make darkness light, and light darkness; who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Woe to them that are wise in their own conceit, and knowing in their own sight. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Woe to the strong ones of you that drink wine, and the mighty ones that mingle strong drink: 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` who justify the ungodly for rewards, and take away the righteousness of the righteous. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Therefore as stubble shall be burnt by a coal of fire, and shall be consumed by a violent flame, their root shall be as chaff, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and insulted the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Therefore the Lord of hosts was greatly angered against his people, and he reached forth his hand upon them, and struck them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses were as dung in the midst of the way: yet for all this his anger has not been turned away, but his hand is yet raised. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Therefore shall he lift up a signal to the nations that are afar, and shall hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they are coming very quickly. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` They shall not hunger nor be weary, neither shall they slumber nor sleep; neither shall they loose their girdles from their loins, neither shall their shoe-latchets be broken. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Whose arrows are sharp, and their bows bent; their horses' hoofs are counted as solid rock: their chariot-wheels are as a storm. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` They rage as lions, and draw near as a lion's whelps: and he shall seize, and roar as a wild beast, and he shall cast them forth, and there shall be none to deliver them. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And he shall roar on account of them in that day, as the sound of the swelling sea; and they shall look to the land, and, behold, there shall be thick darkness in their perplexity.
