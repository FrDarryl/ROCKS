:sup:`9` For know you⌃, that should we conceive any evil design, or in any way aggrieve them, we shall ever have as our opposite, not man, but the highest God, the ruler of all might. From Him there will be no escape, as the avenger of such deeds. Fare you⌃ well.

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` These they registered as sacred upon a pillar, when they had dedicated the place of their festivity to be one of prayer. They departed unharmed, free, abundant in joy, preserved by the king's command, by land, by sea, and by river, each to his own home. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` They had more weight than before amongst their enemies; and were honoured and feared, and no one in any way robbed them of their goods. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Every man received back his own, according to inventory; those who had obtained their goods, giving them up with the greatest terror. For the greatest God wrought with perfectness wonders for their salvation.
