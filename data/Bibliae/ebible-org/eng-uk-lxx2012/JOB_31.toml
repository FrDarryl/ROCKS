[31]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` I made a covenant with my eyes, and I will not think upon a virgin. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Now what portion has God given from above? and is there an inheritance given of the Mighty One from the highest? 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Alas! destruction to the unrighteous, and rejection to them that do iniquity. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Will he not see my way, and number all my steps? 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` But if I had gone with scorners, and if too my foot has hasted to deceit: 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` (for I am weighed in a just balance, and the Lord knows my innocence:) 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` if my foot has turned aside out of the way, or if my heart has followed my eye, and if too I have touched gifts with my hands; 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` then let me sow, and let others eat; and let me be uprooted on the earth. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` If my heart has gone forth after another man's wife, and if I laid wait at her doors; 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` then let my wife also please another, and let my children be brought low. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For the rage of anger is not to be controlled, in the case of defiling another man's wife. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For it is a fire burning on every side, and whoever it attacks, it utterly destroys. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And if too I despised the judgement of my servant or my handmaid, when they pleaded with me; 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` what then shall I do if the Lord should try me? and if also he should at all visit me, can I make an answer? 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Were not they too formed as I also was formed in the womb? yes, we were formed in the same womb. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` But the helpless missed not whatever need they had, and I did not cause the eye of the widow to fail. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And if too I ate my morsel alone, and did not impart of it to the orphan; 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` (for I nourished them as a father from my youth and guided them from my mother's womb.) 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And if too I overlooked the naked as he was perishing, and did not clothe him; 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` and if the poor did not bless me, and their shoulders were not warmed with the fleece of my lambs; 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` if I lifted my hand against an orphan, trusting that my strength was far superior to his: 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` let them my shoulder start from the blade-bone, and my arm be crushed off from the elbow. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For the fear of the Lord constrained me, and I canâ€™t bear up by reason of his burden. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` If I made gold my treasure, and if too I trusted the precious stone; 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` and if too I rejoiced when my wealth was abundant, and if too I laid my hand on innumerable treasures: 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` (do we not see the shining sun eclipsed, and the moon waning? for they have not power to continue:) 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` and if my heart was secretly deceived, and if I have laid my hand upon my mouth and kissed it: 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` let this also then be reckoned to me as the greatest iniquity: for I should have lied against the Lord Most High. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And if too I was glad at the fall of my enemies, and my heart said, Aha! 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` let then my ear hear my curse, and let me be a byword amongst my people in my affliction. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` And if too my handmaids have often said, Oh that we might be satisfied with his flesh; (whereas I was very kind: 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` for the stranger did not lodge without, and my door was opened to every one that came:) 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` or if too having sinned unintentionally, I hid my sin; 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` (for I did not stand in awe of a great multitude, so as not to declare boldly before them:) and if too I permitted a poor man to go out of my door with an empty bosom: 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` (Oh that I had a hearer,) and if I had not feared the hand of the Lord; and as to the written charge which I had against any one, 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` I would place it as a chaplet on my shoulders, and read it. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` And if I did not read it and return it, having taken nothing from the debtor: 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` If at any time the land groaned against me, and if its furrows mourned together; 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` and if I ate its strength alone without price, and if I too grieved the heart of the owner of the soil, by taking anything from him: 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` then let the nettle come up to me instead of wheat, and a bramble instead of barley. And Job ceased speaking.
