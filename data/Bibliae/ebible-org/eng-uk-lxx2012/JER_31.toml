[31]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Thus has the Lord said concerning MOAB, Woe to Nabau! for it has perished: Cariathaim is taken: Amath and Agath are put to shame. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` There is no longer any healing for Moab, nor glorying in Esebon: he has devised evils against her: we have cut her off from being a nation, and she shall be completely still: after you shall go a sword; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` for there is a voice of men crying out of Oronaim, destruction and great ruin. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Moab is ruined, proclaim it to Zogora: 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` for Aloth is filled with weeping: one shall go up weeping by the way of Oronaim; you⌃ have heard a cry of destruction. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Flee you⌃, and save your lives, and you⌃ shall be as a wild ass in the desert. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Since you have trusted in your strong-hold, therefore you shall be taken: and Chamos shall go forth into captivity, and his priests, and his princes together. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And destruction shall come upon every city, it shall by no means escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain country shall be completely destroyed, as the Lord has said. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Set marks upon Moab, for she shall be touched with a plague-spot, and all her cities shall become desolate; whence shall there be an inhabitant for her? 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Cursed is the man that does the works of the Lord carelessly, keeping back his sword from blood. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Moab has been at ease from a child, and trusted in his glory; he has not poured out his liquor from vessel to vessel, and has not gone into banishment, therefore his taste remained in him, and his smell departed not. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Therefore, behold, his days come, says the Lord, when I shall send upon him bad leaders, and they shall lead him astray, and they shall utterly break in pieces his possessions, and shall cut his horns asunder. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Baethel their hope, having trusted in them. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` How will you⌃ say, We are strong, and men strong for war? 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Moab is ruined, even his city, and his choice young men have gone down to slaughter. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` The day of Moab is near at hand, and his iniquity moves swiftly to vengeance. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Shake the head at him, all you⌃ that are round about him; all of you utter his name; say you⌃, How is the glorious staff broken to pieces, the rod of magnificence! 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Come down from your glory, and sit down in a damp place: Daebon shall be broken, because Moab is destroyed: there has gone up against you one to ravage your strong-hold. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Stand by the way, and look, you that dwell in Arer; and ask him that is fleeing, and him that escapes, and say, What has happened? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Moab is put to shame, because he is broken: howl and cry; proclaim in Arnon, that Moab has perished. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And judgement is coming against the land of Misor, upon Chelon, and Rephas, and Mophas, 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` and upon Daebon, and upon Nabau, and upon the house of Daethlathaim, 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` and upon Cariathaim, and upon the house of Gaemol, and upon the house of Maon, 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` and upon Carioth, and upon Bosor, and upon all the cities of Moab, far and near. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` The horn of Moab is broken, and his arm is crushed. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Make you⌃ him drunk; for he has magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall clap with his hand, and shall be also himself a laughing stock. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` For surely Israel was to you a laughing stock, and was found amongst your thefts, because you did fight against him. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` The inhabitants of Moab have left the cities, and lived in rocks; they have become as doves nestling in rocks, at the mouth of a cave. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And I have heard of the pride of Moab, he has greatly heightened his pride and his haughtiness, and his heart has been lifted up. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` But I know his works: is it not enough for him? has he not done thus? 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Therefore howl you⌃ for Moab on all sides; cry out against the shorn men in a gloomy place. I will weep for you, 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` O vine of Aserema, as with the weeping of Jazer: your branches are gone over the sea, they reached the cities of Jazer: destruction has come upon your fruits, and upon your grape gatherers. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Joy and gladness have been utterly swept off the land of Moab: and though there was wine in your presses, in the morning they trod it not, neither in the evening did they raise the cry of joy. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` From the cry of Esebon even to Aetam their cities uttered their voice, from Zogor to Oronaim, and their tidings as a heifer of three years old, for the water also of Nebrin shall be dried up. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` And I will destroy Moab, says the Lord, as he comes up to the altar, and burns incense to his gods. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Therefore the heart of Moab shall sound as pipes, my heart shall sound as a pipe for the shorn men; forasmuch as what every man has gained has perished from him. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` They shall all have their heads shaved in every place, and every beard shall be shaved; and all hands shall beat the breasts, and on all loins shall be sackcloth. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` And on all the housetops of Moab, and in his streets shall be mourning: for I have broken him, says the Lord, as a vessel, which is useless. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` How has he changed! how has Moab turned his back! Moab is put to shame, and become a laughing stock, and an object of anger to all that are round about him. 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` For thus said the Lord; 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` Carioth is taken, and the strongholds have been taken together. 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` And Moab shall perish from being a multitude, because he has magnified himself against the Lord. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` A snare, and fear, and the pit, are upon you, O inhabitant of Moab. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` He that flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he that comes up out of the pit shall even be taken in the snare: for I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their visitation.
