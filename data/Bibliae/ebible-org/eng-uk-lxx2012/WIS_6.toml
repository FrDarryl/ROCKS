"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Hear therefore, O you⌃ kings, and understand; learn, you⌃ that be judges of the ends of the earth. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Give ear, you⌃ that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Because, being ministers of his kingdom, you⌃ have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God; 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgement shall be to them that be in high places. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for he has made the small and great, and careth for all alike. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` To you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that you⌃ may learn wisdom, and not fall away. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learnt such things shall find what to answer. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Therefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and you⌃ shall be instructed. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Wisdom is glorious, and never fades away: yes, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` She prevents them that desire her, in making herself first known to them. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Whoso seeks her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watches for her shall quickly be without care. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For she goes about seeking such as are worthy of her, shows herself favourably to them in the ways, and meets them in every thought. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love; 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed to her laws is the assurance of incorruption; 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And incorruption makes us near to God: 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Therefore the desire of wisdom brings to a kingdom. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O you⌃ kings of the people, honour wisdom, that you⌃ may reign for evermore. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good.
