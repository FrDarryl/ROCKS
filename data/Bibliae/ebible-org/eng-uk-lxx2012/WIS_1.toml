"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Love righteousness, you⌃ that be judges of the earth: think of the Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seek him. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and shows himself to such as do not distrust him. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproves the unwise. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwell in the body that is subject to sin. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness comes in. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and a true beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For the Spirit of the Lord fills the world: and that which contains all things has knowledge of the voice. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Therefore he that speaks unrighteous things can’t be hid: neither shall vengeance, when it punishes, pass by him. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly: and the sound of his words shall come to the Lord for the manifestation of his wicked deeds. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For the ear of jealousy hears all things: and the noise of murmurings is not hid. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word so secret, that shall go for nothing: and the mouth that belies slays the soul. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For God made not death: neither has he pleasure in the destruction of the living. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For he created all things, that they might have their being: and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth: 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` (For righteousness is immortal:) 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them: for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nothing, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy to take part with it.
