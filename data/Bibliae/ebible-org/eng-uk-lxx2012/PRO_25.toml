"1" = '''
:sup:`1` These are the miscellaneous instructions of Solomon, which the friends of Ezekias king of Judea copied out. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` The glory of God conceals a matter: but the glory of a king honours business. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Heaven is high, and earth is deep, and a king's heart is unsearchable. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Beat the drossy silver, and it shall be made entirely pure. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Slay the ungodly from before the king, and his throne shall prosper in righteousness. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Be not boastful in the presence of the king, and remain not in the places of princes; 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` for it is better for you that it should be said, Come up to me, than that one should humble you in the presence of the prince; speak of that which your eyes have seen. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Get not suddenly into a quarrel, lest you repent at last. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Whenever your friend shall reproach you, retreat backward, despise him not; 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` lest your friend continue to reproach you, so your quarrel and enmity shall not depart, but shall be to you like death. Favour and friendship set a man free, which do you keep for yourself, lest you be made liable to reproach; but take heed to your ways peaceably. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` As a golden apple in a necklace of sardius, so is it to speak a wise word. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` In an ear-ring of gold a precious sardius is also set; so is a wise word to an obedient ear. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` As a fall of snow in the time of harvest is good against heat, so a faithful messenger refreshes those that send him; for he helps the souls of his employers. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` As winds and clouds and rains are most evident objects, so is he that boasts of a false gift. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` In longsuffering is prosperity to kings, and a soft tongue breaks the bones. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Having found honey, eat only what is enough, lest haply you be filled, and vomit it up. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Enter sparingly into your friend's house, lest he be satiated with your company, and hate you. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` As a club, and a dagger, and a pointed arrow, so also is a man who bears false witness against his friend. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` The way of the wicked and the foot of the transgressor shall perish in an evil day. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` As vinegar is bad for a sore, so trouble befalling the body afflicts the heart. As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the grief of a man hurts the heart. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` If your enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` for so doing you shall heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward you with good. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` The north wind raises clouds; so an impudent face provokes the tongue. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` It is better to dwell on a corner of the roof, than with a railing woman in an open house. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` As cold water is agreeable to a thirsting soul, so is a good message from a land far off. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` As if one should stop a well, and corrupt a spring of water, so is it unseemly for a righteous man to fall before an ungodly man. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` It is not good to eat much honey; but it is right to honour venerable sayings. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` As a city whose walls are broken down, and which is unfortified, so is a man who does anything without counsel.
