:sup:`1` And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Sin, in the first month, and the people abode in Cades; and Mariam died there, and was buried there. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And the people reviled Moses, saying, Would we had died in the destruction of our brethren before the Lord! 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And therefore have you⌃ brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to kill us and our cattle? 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And therefore is this? You⌃ have brought us up out of Egypt, that we should come into this evil place; a place where there is no sowing, neither figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there water to drink. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Moses and Aaron went from before the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of witness, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the Lord appeared to them. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Take your rod, and call the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak you⌃ to the rock before them, and it shall give forth its waters; and you⌃ shall bring forth for them water out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.

'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and much water came forth, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you⌃ have not believed me to sanctify me before the children of Israel, therefore you⌃ shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` This is the water of Strife, because the children of Israel spoke insolently before the Lord, and he was sanctified in them. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of Edom, saying, Thus says your brother Israel; You know all the distress that has come upon us. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we sojourned in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And we cried to the Lord, and the Lord heard our voice, and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt; and now we are in the city of Cades, at the extremity of your coasts. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` We will pass through your land: we will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards, nor will we drink water out of your cistern: we will go by the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, until we have passed your borders. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, and if otherwise, I will go forth to meet you in war. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And the children of Israel say to him, We will pass by the mountain; and if I and my cattle drink of your water, I will pay you: but it is no matter of importance, we will go by the mountain. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And he said, You shall not pass through me; and Edom went forth to meet him with a great host, and a mighty hand. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Israel turned away from him. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And they departed from Cades; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Or. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Or, on the borders of the land of Edom, saying, 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Let Aaron be added to his people; for you⌃ shall certainly not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because you⌃ provoked me at the water of strife. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Take Aaron, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to the mount Or before all the congregation;
