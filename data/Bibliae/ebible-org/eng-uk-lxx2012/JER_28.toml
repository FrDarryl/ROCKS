'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` He has devoured me, he has torn me asunder, airy darkness has come upon me; Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon has swallowed me up, as a dragon has he filled his belly with my delicacies. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` My troubles and my distresses have driven me out into Babylon, shall she that dwells in Sion say; and my blood shall be upon the Chaldeans dwelling there, shall Jerusalem say.

"45" = '''
:sup:`45` and in Babylon the slain men of all the earth shall fall.

'''
"47" = '''
