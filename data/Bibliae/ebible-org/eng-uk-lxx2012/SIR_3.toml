"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that youâŒƒ may be safe. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For the Lord has given the father honour over the children, and has confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Whoso honours his father makes an atonement for his sins: 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And he that honours his mother is as one that lays up treasure. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Whoso honours his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he makes his prayer, he shall be heard. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` He that honours his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient to the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` He that fears the Lord will honour his father, and will do service to his parents, as to his masters. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Honour your father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon you from them. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children; but the curse of the mother roots out foundations. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Glory not in the dishonour of your father; for your father's dishonour is no glory to you. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` My son, help your father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he lives. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when you are in your full strength. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For the relieving of your father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build you up. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` In the day of your affliction it shall be remembered; your sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` He that forsakes his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angers his mother is cursed: of God. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` My son, go on with your business in meekness; so shall you be beloved of him that is approved. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` The greater you are, the more humble yourself, and you shall find favour before the Lord. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed to the meek. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Seek not out things that are too hard for you, neither search the things that are above your strength. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` But what is commanded you, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for you to see with your eyes the things that are in secret. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are showed to you than men understand. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion has overthrown their judgement. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Without eyes you shall lack light: profess not the knowledge therefore that you have not. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loves danger shall perish therein. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness has taken root in him. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms makes an atonement for sins. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` And he that requites good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falls, he shall find a stay.
