"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And I allowed my wrath to come to full, yet I kept it in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days.

'''
"15" = '''

"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Thus says the Lord, Stand you⌃ in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord; and see what is the good way, and walk in it, and you⌃ shall find purification for your souls. But they said, We will not walk in them.
