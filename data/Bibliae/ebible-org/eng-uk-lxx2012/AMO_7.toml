:sup:`3` Repent, O Lord, for this. And this shall not be, says the Lord.

"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Thus has the Lord showed me; and, behold, the Lord called for judgement by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and devoured the Lord's portion.

"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Then I said, O Lord, cease, I pray you: who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small in number. Repent, O Lord, for this.

"6" = '''
:sup:`6` This also shall not be, says the Lord.

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And the joyful altars shall be abolished, and the sacrifices of Israel shall be set aside; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Then Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos is forming conspiracies against you in the midst of the house of Israel: the land will be utterly unable to bear all his words.

'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And Amos answered, and said to Amasias, I was not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruits.

"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the Lord took me from the sheep, and the Lord said to me, Go, and prophesy to my people Israel.

"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Therefore thus says the Lord; Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be measured with the line; and you shall die in an unclean land; and Israel shall be led captive out of his land. Thus has the Lord God showed me.
