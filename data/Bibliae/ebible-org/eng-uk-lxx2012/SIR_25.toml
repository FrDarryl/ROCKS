"1" = '''
:sup:`1` In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Three sorts of men my soul hates, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doats. 
'''

'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` There be nine things which I have judged in my heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that has joy of his children; and he that lives to see the fall of his enemy: 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Well is him that dwells with a wife of understanding, and that has not slipped with his tongue, and that has not served a man more unworthy than himself: 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Well is him that has found prudence, and he that speaks in the ears of them that will hear: 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` O how great is he that finds wisdom! yet is there none above him that fears the Lord. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` But the love of the Lord passes all things for illumination: he that holds it, whereto shall he be likened? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving to him. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Give me any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman: 
'''

:sup:`14` And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies. 
'''

"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Her husband shall sit amongst his neighbours; and when he hears it shall sigh bitterly. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.

'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` A wicked woman abates the courage, makes an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress makes weak hands and feeble knees. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die. 
'''
"25" = '''
