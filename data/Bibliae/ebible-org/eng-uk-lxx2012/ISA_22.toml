"1" = '''
:sup:`1` THE WORD OF THE VALLEY OF SION. What has happened to you, that now you⌃ are all gone up to the housetops which help you not? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` The city is filled with shouting men: your slain are not slain with swords, nor are your dead those who have died in battle. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` All your princes have fled, and your captives are tightly bound, and the mighty men in you have fled far away. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Therefore I said, Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me for the breach of the daughter of my people. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For it is a day of trouble, and of destruction, and of treading down, and there is perplexity sent from the Lord of hosts: they wander in the valley of Sion; they wander from the least to the greatest on the mountains. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And the Elamites took their quivers, and there were men mounted on horses, and there was a gathering for battle. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And it shall be that your choice valleys shall be filled with chariots, and horsemen shall block up your gates. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And they shall uncover the gates of Juda, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And they shall uncover the secret places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were many, and that one had turned the water of the old pool into the city; 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` and that they had pulled down the houses of Jerusalem, to fortify the wall of the city. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And you⌃ procured to yourselves water between the two walls within the ancient pool: but you⌃ looked not to him that made it from the beginning, and regarded not him that created it. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And the Lord, the Lord of hosts, called in that day for weeping, and lamentation, and baldness, and for girding with sackcloth: 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` but they engaged in joy and gladness, slaying calves, and killing sheep, so as to eat flesh, and drink wine; saying, Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of hosts: for this sin shall not be forgiven you, until you⌃ die. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Thus says the Lord of hosts, Go into the chamber, to Somnas the treasurer, and say to him, Why are you here? 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` and what have you to do here, that you have here hewn yourself a sepulchre, and made yourself a sepulchre on high, and have graven for yourself a dwelling in the rock? 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Behold now, the Lord of hosts casts forth and will utterly destroy such a man, and will take away your robe and your glorious crown, 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` and will cast you into a great and unmeasured land, and there you shall die: and he will bring your fair chariot to shame, and the house of your prince to be trodden down. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And you shall be removed from your stewardship, and from your place. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Chelcias: 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` and I will put on him your robe, and I will grant him your crown with power, and I will give your stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Juda. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him the key of the house of David upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and there shall be none to shut; and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his father's house. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And every one that is glorious in the house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and they shall depend upon him in that day. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Thus says the Lord of hosts, The man that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord has spoken it.
