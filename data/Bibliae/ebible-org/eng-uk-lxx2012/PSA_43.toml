"1" = '''
:sup:`1` (44) For the end, a Psalm for instruction, for the sons of Core. O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, the work which you wrought in their days, in the days of old. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Your hand utterly destroyed the heathen, and you did plant them: you did afflict the nations, and cast them out. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For they inherited not the land by their own sword, and their own arm did not deliver them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you were well pleased in them. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` You are indeed my King and my God, who command deliverances for Jacob. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` In you will we push down our enemies, and in your name will we bring to nothing them that rise up against us. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For you have saved us from them that afflicted us, and have put to shame them that hated us. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` In God will we make our boast all the day, and to your name will we give thanks for ever. Pause. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` But now you have cast off, and put us to shame; and you will not go forth with our hosts. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` You have turned us back before our enemies; and they that hated us spoiled for themselves. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` You made us as sheep for meat; and you scattered us amongst the nations. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` You have sold your people without price, and there was no profit by their exchange. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` You have made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision them that are round about us. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` You have made us a proverb amongst the Gentiles, a shaking of the head amongst the nations. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` All the day my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face has covered me, 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` because of the voice of the slanderer and reviler; because of the enemy and avenger. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` All these things are come upon us: but we have not forgotten you, neither have we dealt unrighteously in your covenant. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And our heart has not gone back; but you have turned aside our paths from your way. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For you have laid us low in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these things out? 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` for he knows the secrets of the heart. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For, for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for slaughter. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Awake, therefore sleep you, O Lord? arise, and do not cast us off for ever. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Therefore turn you your face away, and forget our poverty and our affliction? 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` For our soul has been brought down to the dust; our belly has cleaved to the earth. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for your name's sake.
