[9]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Then Job answered and said, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` I know of a truth that it is so: for how shall a mortal man be just before the Lord? 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For if he would enter into judgement with him, God would not listen to him, so that he should answer to one of his charges of a thousand. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For he is wise in mind, and mighty, and great: who has hardened himself against him and endured? 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Who wears out the mountains, and men know it not: who overturns them in anger. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Who shakes the earth under heaven from its foundations, and its pillars totter. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Who commands the sun, and it rises not; and he seals up the stars. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Who alone has stretched out the heavens, and walks on the sea as on firm ground. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Who makes Pleias, and Hesperus, and Arcturus, and the chambers of the south. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Who does great and unsearchable things; glorious also and excellent things, innumerable. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` If ever he should go beyond me, I shall not see him: if he should pass by me, neither thus have I known it. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` If he would take away, who shall turn him back? or who shall say to him, What have you done? 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For if he has turned away his anger, the whales under heaven have stooped under him. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Oh then that he would listen to me, or judge my cause. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` For though I be righteous, he will not listen to me: I will entreat his judgement. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And if I should call and he should not listen, I canâ€™t believe that he has listened to my voice. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Let him not crush me with a dark storm: but he has made by bruises many without cause. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` For he suffers me not to take breath, but he has filled me with bitterness. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For indeed he is strong in power: who then shall resist his judgement? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` For though I should seem righteous, my mouth will be profane: and though I should seem blameless, I shall be proved perverse. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For even if I have sinned, I know it not in my soul: but my life is taken away. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Therefore I said, Wrath slays the great and mighty man. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For the worthless die, but the righteous are laughed to scorn. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For they are delivered into the hands of the unrighteous man: he covers the faces of the judges of the earth: but if it be not he, who is it? 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But my life is swifter than a post: my days have fled away, and they knew it not. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Or again, is there a trace of their path left by ships? or is there one of the flying eagle as it seeks its prey? 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And if I should say, I will forget to speak, I will bow down my face and groan; 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` I quake in all my limbs, for I know that you will not leave me alone as innocent. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` But since I am ungodly, why have I not died? 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` For if I should wash myself with snow, and purge myself with pure hands, 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` you had thoroughly plunged me in filth, and my garment had abhorred me. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` For you are not man like me, with whom I could contend, that we might come together to judgement. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Would that he our mediator were present, and a reprover, and one who should hear the cause between both. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Let him remove his rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` so shall I not be afraid, but I will speak: for I am not thus conscious of guilt. 
'''
