Psalms.
Chapter 131.
(132) A Song of Degrees. Lord, remember David, and all his meekness: 
how he swore to the Lord, and vowed to the God of Jacob, saying, 
I will not go into the tabernacle of my house; I will not go up to the couch of my bed; 
I will not give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids, nor rest to my temples, 
until I find a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 
Behold, we heard of it in Ephratha; we found it in the fields of the wood. 
Let us enter into his tabernacles: let us worship at the place where his feet stood. 
Arise, O Lord, into your rest; you, and the ark of your holiness. 
Your priests shall clothe themselves with righteousness; and your saints shall exult. 
For the sake of your servant David turn not away the face of your anointed. 
The Lord swore in truth to David, and he will not annul it, saying, Of the fruit of your body will I set a king upon your throne. 
If your children will keep my covenant, and these my testimonies which I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon your throne for ever. 
For the Lord has elected Sion, he has chosen her for a habitation for himself, saying, 
This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have chosen it. 
I will surely bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 
I will clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall greatly exult. 
There will I cause to spring up a horn to David: I have prepared a lamp for my anointed. 
His enemies will I clothe with a shame; but upon himself shall my holiness flourish.
