"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And David said to the whole congregation of Israel, If it seem good to you, and it should be prospered by the Lord our God, let us send to our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, and let the priests the Levites who are with them in the cities of their possession come, and let them be gathered to us. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And let us bring over to us the ark of our God; for men have not enquired at it since the days of Saul.

"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And all the congregation said that they would do thus; for the saying was right in the eyes of all the people.

"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God in to myself?

'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And the ark of God abode in the house of Abeddara three months: and God blessed Abeddara and all that he had.
