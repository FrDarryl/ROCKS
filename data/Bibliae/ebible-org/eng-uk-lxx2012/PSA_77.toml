'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They were not hid from their children to a second generations; the fathers declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children: 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments.

:sup:`12` the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes. 
'''
"13" = '''

'''
"16" = '''

:sup:`17` And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for the desire of their souls. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Forasmuch as he struck the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people? 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. 
'''
"23" = '''

"24" = '''
:sup:`24` and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven.

"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` They were not disappointed of their desire: but when their food was yet in their mouth, 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` then the indignation of God rose up against them, and killed the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles. 
'''
"33" = '''

'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Yet they loved him only with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` But he is compassionate, and will forgive their sins, and will not destroy them: yes, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not. 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and anger him in a dry land! 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` Yes, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes: 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` and had changed their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they should not drink. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them. 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust. 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.

"49" = '''
:sup:`49` He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels. 
'''
"50" = '''
:sup:`50` He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death; 
'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` and struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt; the first fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham. 
'''
"52" = '''
:sup:`52` And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness. 
'''
"53" = '''
:sup:`53` And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies. 
'''
"54" = '''
:sup:`54` And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased. 
'''
"55" = '''
:sup:`55` And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
'''
"56" = '''
:sup:`56` Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies. 
'''
"57" = '''
:sup:`57` And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow. 
'''
"58" = '''
:sup:`58` And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
'''
"59" = '''
:sup:`59` God heard and lightly regarded them, and greatly despised Israel. 
'''
"60" = '''
:sup:`60` And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he lived amongst men. 
'''
"61" = '''
:sup:`61` And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand. 
'''
"62" = '''
:sup:`62` And he gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance. 
'''
"63" = '''
:sup:`63` Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not. 
'''
"64" = '''
:sup:`64` Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for. 
'''
"65" = '''
:sup:`65` So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and as a mighty man who has been heated with wine. 
'''
"66" = '''
:sup:`66` And he struck his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach. 
'''
"67" = '''
:sup:`67` And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; 
'''
"68" = '''
:sup:`68` but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved. 
'''
"69" = '''
:sup:`69` And he built his sanctuary as the place of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth.
