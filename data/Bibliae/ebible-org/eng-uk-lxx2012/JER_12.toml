"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Righteous are you, O Lord, that I may make my defence to you, yes, I will speak to you of judgements. Why is it that the way of ungodly men prospers? that all that deal very treacherously are flourishing? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` You have planted them, and they have taken root; they have begotten children, and become fruitful; you are near to their mouth, and far from their reins. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` But you, Lord, know me; you have proved my heart before you; purify them for the day of their slaughter. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` How long shall the land mourn, and the grass of the field wither, for the wickedness of them, that dwell in it? the beasts and birds are utterly destroyed; because the people said, God shall not see our ways. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Your feet run, and they cause you to faint; how will you prepare to ride upon horses? and you have been confident in the land of your peace? how will you do in the roaring of Jordan? 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For even your brethren and the house of your father, even these have dealt treacherously with you; and they have cried out, they are gathered together in pursuit of you; trust not you in them, though they shall speak fair words to you. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given my beloved one into the hands of her enemies. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` My inheritance has become to me as a lion in a forest; she has uttered her voice against me; therefore have I hated her. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Is not my inheritance to me a hyaena's cave, or a cave round about her? Go youâŒƒ, gather together all the wild beasts of the field, and let them come to devour her. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my desirable portion a trackless wilderness; 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` it is made a complete ruin: for my sake the whole land has been utterly ruined, because there is none that lays the matter to heart. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` The ravagers are come to every passage in the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other: no flesh has any peace. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Sow wheat, and reap thorns; their portions shall not profit them: be ashamed of your boasting, because of reproach before the Lord. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For thus says the Lord, concerning all the evil neighbours that touch my inheritance, which I have divided to my people Israel; Behold, I will draw them away from their land, and I will cast out Juda from the midst of them. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And it shall come to pass, after I have cast them out, that I will return, and have mercy upon them, and will cause them to dwell every one in his inheritance, and every one in his land. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And it shall be, if they will indeed learn the way of my people, to swear by my name, saying, The Lord lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall that nation be built in the midst of my people. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` But if they will not return, then will I cut off that nation with utter ruin and destruction.
