"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And I set before them a jar of wine, and cups, and I said, Drink you⌃ wine. 
'''
"6" = '''

'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` nor shall you⌃ at all build houses, nor sow any seed, nor shall you⌃ have a vineyard: for you⌃ shall dwell in tents all your days; that you⌃ may live many days upon the land, in which you⌃ sojourn.

'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the word which he commanded his children, that they should drink no wine; and they have not drunk it: but I spoke to you early, and you⌃ listened not.

"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And I sent to you my servants the prophets, saying, Turn you⌃ every one from his evil way, and amend your practices, and go not after other gods to serve them, and you⌃ shall dwell upon the land which I gave to you and to your fathers: but you⌃ inclined not your ears, and listened not.
