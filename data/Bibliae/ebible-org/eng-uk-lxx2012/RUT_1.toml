:sup:`1` And it came to pass when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land: and a man went from Bethleem Juda to sojourn in the land of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And the man's name was Elimelech, and his wife's name Noemin, and the names of his two sons Maalon and Chelaion, Ephrathites of Bethleem of Juda: and they came to the land of Moab, and remained there.

'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And both Maalon and Chelaion died also; and the woman was left of her husband and her two sons. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And she rose up and her two daughters-in-law, and they returned out of the country of Moab, for she heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited his people to give them bread. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her: and they went by the way to return to the land of Juda. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Go now, return each to the house of her mother: the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you⌃ have dealt with the dead, and with me. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` The Lord grant you that you⌃ may find rest each of you in the house of her husband: and she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And they said to her, We will return with you to your people. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And Noemin said, Return now, my daughters; and why do you⌃ go with me? have I yet sons in my womb to be your husbands? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Turn now, my daughters, for I am too old to be married: for I said, Suppose I were married, and should bear sons; 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` would you⌃ wait for them till they should be grown? or would you⌃ refrain from being married for their sakes? Not so, my daughters; for I am grieved for you, that the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her.

'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave you, or to return from following you; for wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And wherever you die, I will die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if I leave you, for death only shall divide between me and you.

"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And Noemin seeing that she was determined to go with her, ceased to speak to her any more.

"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And they went both of them until they came to Bethleem: and it came to pass, when they arrived at Bethleem, that all the city rang with them, and they said, Is this Noemin? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And she said to them, Nay, do not call me Noemin; call me 'Bitter,' for the Mighty One has dealt very bitterly with me. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` I went out full, and the Lord has brought me back empty: and why call you⌃ me Noemin, whereas the Lord has humbled me and the Mighty One has afflicted me? 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` So Noemin and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, returned from the country of Moab; and they came to Bethleem in the beginning of barley harvest.
