"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Better is a morsel with pleasure in peace, than a house full of many good things and unjust sacrifices, with strife. 
'''

'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` He that laughs at the poor provokes him that made him; and he that rejoices at the destruction of another shall not be held guiltless: but he that has compassion shall find mercy. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Children's children are the crown of old men; and their fathers are the glory of children. The faithful has the whole world full of wealth; but the faithless not even a farthing. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Faithful lips will not suit a fool; nor lying lips a just man.

:sup:`15` He that pronounces the unjust just, and the just unjust, is unclean and abominable with God. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Why has the fool wealth? for a senseless man will not be able to purchase wisdom. He that exalts his own house seeks ruin; and he that turns aside from instruction shall fall into mischief. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Have you a friend for every time, and let brethren be useful in distress; for on this account are they born.

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` A lover of sin rejoices in strifes; 
'''

:sup:`20` and the hard-hearted man comes not in for good. A man of a changeful tongue will fall into mischiefs; 
'''
"21" = '''

'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Wisdom shall be imputed to a fool who asks after wisdom: and he who holds his peace shall seem to be sensible.
