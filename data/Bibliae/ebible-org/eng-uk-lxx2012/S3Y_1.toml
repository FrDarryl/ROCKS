:sup:`1` Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Blessed are you, O Lord God of our fathers: your name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore: 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For you are righteous in all the things that you have done to us: yes, true are all your works, your ways are right, and all your judgements truth. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` In all the things that you have brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, you have executed true judgement: for according to truth and judgement did you bring all these things upon us because of our sins. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from you. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed your commandments, nor kept them, neither done as you have commanded us, that it might go well with us. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Therefore all that you have brought upon us, and every thing that you have done to us, you have done in true judgement. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And you did deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And now we can’t open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to your servants; and to them that worship you. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Yet deliver us not up wholly, for your name's sake, neither disannul you your covenant: 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And cause not your mercy to depart from us, for your beloved Abraham's sake, for your servant Isaac's sake, and for your holy Israel's sake; 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` To whom you have spoken and promised, that you would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lies upon the seashore. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before you, and to find mercy. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in your sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after you: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in you. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And now we follow you with all our heart, we fear you, and seek your face. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Put us not to shame: but deal with us after your lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of your mercies. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Deliver us also according to your marvellous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord: and let all them that do your servants hurt be ashamed; 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken; 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And let them know that you are God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood; 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And it passed through, and burnt those Chaldeans it found about the furnace. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and struck the flame of the fire out of the oven; 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.
