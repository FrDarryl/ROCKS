:sup:`1` Say if you know the time of the bringing forth of the wild goats of the rock, and if you have marked the calving of the hinds: 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` and if you have have numbered the full months of their being with young, and if you have relieved their pangs: 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` and have reared their young without fear; and will you loosen their pangs? 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Their young will break forth; they will be multiplied with offspring: their young will go forth, and will not return to them. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And who is he that sent forth the wild ass free? and who loosed his bands? 
'''
"6" = '''

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` He will survey the mountains as his pasture, and he seeks after every green thing. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And will the unicorn be willing to serve you, or to lie down at your manger? 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And will you bind his yoke with thongs, or will he plough furrows for you in the plain? 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And do you trust him, because his strength is great? and will you commit your works to him? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And will you believe that he will return to you your seed, and bring it in to your threshing floor? 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` The peacock has a beautiful wing: if the stork and the ostrich conceive, it is worthy of notice, 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` for the ostrich will leave her eggs in the ground, and warm them on the dust, 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` and has forgotten that the foot will scatter them, and the wild beasts of the field trample them. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` She has hardened herself against her young ones, as though she bereaved not herself: she labours in vain without fear.

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Have you invested the horse with strength, and clothed his neck with terror?

"21" = '''
:sup:`21` He paws exulting in the plain, and goes forth in strength into the plain. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` He laughs to scorn a king as he meets him, and will by no means turn back from the sword. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` The bow and sword resound against him; and his rage will swallow up the ground: 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` and he will not believe until the trumpet sounds. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And when the trumpet sounds, he says, Aha! and afar off he smells the war with prancing and neighing. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And does the hawk remain steady by your wisdom, having spread out her wings unmoved, looking towards the region of the south? 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And does the eagle rise at your command, and the vulture remain sitting over his nest,

"33" = '''
:sup:`33` And Job answered and said to the Lord, 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Why do I yet plead? being rebuked even while reproving the Lord: hearing such things, whereas I am nothing: and what shall I answer to these arguments? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. 
'''
