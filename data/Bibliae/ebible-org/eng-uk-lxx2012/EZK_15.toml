:sup:`2` And you, son of man—of all the wood, of the branches that are amongst the trees of the forest, what shall be made of the wood of the vine? 
'''

:sup:`3` Will they take wood of it to make it fit for work? will they take of it a peg to hang any vessel upon it?

'''

:sup:`6` Therefore say, Thus says the Lord, As the vine tree amongst the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire to be consumed, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth of the fire, and yet fire shall devour them; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set my face against them. 
'''
