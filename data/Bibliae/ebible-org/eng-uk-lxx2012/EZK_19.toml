:sup:`2` and say, Why is your mother become a whelp in the midst of lions? in the midst of lions she has multiplied her whelps. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And one of her whelps sprang forth; he became a lion, and learnt to take prey, he devoured men. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And the nations heard a report of him; he was caught in their pit, and they brought him into the land of Egypt in chains. 
'''
"5" = '''

'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And he went up and down in the midst of lions, he became a lion, and learnt to take prey, he devoured men. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And he prowled in his boldness and laid waste their cities, and made the land desolate, and the fullness of it, by the voice of his roaring. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Then the nations set upon him from the countries round about, and they spread their nets upon him: he was taken in their pit.

"11" = '''

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` But she was broken down in wrath, she was cast upon the ground, and the east wind dried up her choice branches: vengeance came upon them, and the rod of her strength was withered; fire consumed it. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And now they have planted her in the wilderness, in a dry land. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And fire is gone out of a rod of her choice boughs, and has devoured her; and there was no rod of strength in her. Her race is become a parable of lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.
