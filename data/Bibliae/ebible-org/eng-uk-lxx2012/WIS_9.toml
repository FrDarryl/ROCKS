"1" = '''
:sup:`1` O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who have made all things with your word, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And ordained man through your wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which you have made, 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgement with an upright heart: 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Give me wisdom, that sits by your throne; and reject me not from amongst your children: 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For I your servant and son of your handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgement and laws. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For though a man be never so perfect amongst the children of men, yet if your wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` You have chosen me to be a king of your people, and a judge of your sons and daughters: 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` You have commanded me to build a temple upon your holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein you dwell, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which you have prepared from the beginning. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And wisdom was with you: which knows your works, and was present when you made the world, and knew what was acceptable in your sight, and right in your commandments. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` O send her out of your holy heavens, and from the throne of your glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing to you. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For she knows and understands all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge your people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is? 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` For the corruptible body presses down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weighs down the mind that muses upon many things. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who has searched out? 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And your counsel who has known, except you give wisdom, and send your Holy Spirit from above? 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing to you, and were saved through wisdom.
