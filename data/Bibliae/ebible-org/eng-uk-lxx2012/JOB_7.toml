:sup:`1` Is not the life of man upon earth a state of trial? and his existence as that of a hireling by the day? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Or as a servant that fears his master, and one who has grasped a shadow? or as a hireling waiting for his pay? 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` So have I also endured months of vanity, and nights of pain have been appointed me. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Whenever I lie down, I say, When will it be day? and whenever I rise up, again I say when will it be evening? and I am full of pains from evening to morning. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And my body is covered with loathsome worms; and I waste away, scraping off clods of dust from my eruption. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And my life is lighter than a word, and has perished in vain hope. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Remember then that my life is breath, and my eye shall not yet again see good. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` The eye of him that sees me shall not see me again: your eyes are upon me, and I am no more. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` I am as a cloud that is cleared away from the sky: for if a man go down to the grave, he shall not come up again: 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` and he shall surely not return to his own house, neither shall his place know him any more. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Then neither will I refrain my mouth: I will speak being in distress; being in anguish I will disclose the bitterness of my soul. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Am I a sea, or a serpent, that you have set a watch over me? 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` I said that my bed should comfort me, and I would privately counsel with myself on my couch. 
'''
"14" = '''

"15" = '''
:sup:`15` You will separate life from my spirit; and yet keep my bones from death.

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For what is man, that you have magnified him? or that you give heed to him? 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Will you visit him till the morning, and judge him till the time of rest? 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` How long do you not let me alone, nor let me go, until I shall swallow down my spittle? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` If I have sinned, what shall I be able to do, O you that understand the mind of men? why have you made me as your accuser, and why am I a burden to you? 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Why have you not forgotten my iniquity, and purged my sin? but now I shall depart to the earth; and in the morning I am no more.
