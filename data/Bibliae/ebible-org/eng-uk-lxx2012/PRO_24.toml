:sup:`3` A house is built by wisdom, and is set up by understanding.

'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` War is carried on with generalship, and aid is supplied to the heart of a counsellor. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Wisdom and good understanding are in the gates of the wise: the wise turn not aside from the mouth of the Lord, 
'''

:sup:`8` but deliberate in council. Death befalls uninstructed men. 
'''

'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For a righteous man will fall seven times, and rise again: but the ungodly shall be without strength in troubles. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` If your enemy should fall, rejoice not over him, neither be elated at his overthrow. 
'''

:sup:`21` My son, fear God and the king; and do not disobey either of them. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For they will suddenly punish the ungodly, and who can know the vengeance inflicted by both? A son that keeps the commandment shall escape destruction; for such an one has fully received it. Let no falsehood be spoken by the king from the tongue; yes, let no falsehood proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not one of flesh; and whoever shall be given up to it shall be destroyed: for if his wrath should be provoked, he destroys men with cords, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not even fit to be eaten by the young eagles. My son, reverence my words, and receive them, and repent. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And this thing I say to you that are wise for you to learn: It is not good to have respect of persons in judgement. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` He that says of the ungodly, He is righteous, shall be cursed by peoples, and hateful amongst the nations. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But they that reprove him shall appear more excellent, and blessing shall come upon them; 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` and men will kiss lips that answer well. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Prepare your works for your going forth, and prepare yourself for the field; and come after me, and you shall rebuild your house. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Be not a false witness against your fellow citizen, neither exaggerate with your lips. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Say not, As he has treated me, so will I treat him, and I will avenge myself on him for that wherein he has injured me. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` A foolish man is like a farm, and a senseless man is like a vineyard. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` If you let him alone, he will altogether remain barren and covered with weeds; and he becomes destitute, and his stone walls are broken down. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` Afterwards I reflected, I looked that I might receive instruction. 
'''
