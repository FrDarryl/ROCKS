"6" = '''

"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And he said to me, You have seen, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do, each one of them in their secret chamber: because they have said, The Lord see not; The Lord has forsaken the earth.

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And he said to me, Son of man, you have seen this. Is it a little thing to the house of Juda to practise the iniquities which they have practised here? for they have filled the land with iniquity: and, behold, these are as scorners. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Therefore will I deal with them in wrath: my eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy.
