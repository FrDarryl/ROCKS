"1" = '''
:sup:`1` My son, attend to my wisdom, and apply your ear to my words; 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` that you may keep good understanding, and the discretion of my lips gives you a charge. Give no heed to a worthless woman; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` for honey drops from the lips of a harlot, who for a season pleases your palate: 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` but afterwards you will find her more bitter than gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For the feet of folly lead those who deal with her down to the grave with death; and her steps are not established. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For she goes not upon the paths of life; but her ways are slippery, and not easily known. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Now then, my son, hear me, and make not my words of none effect. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Remove your way far from her; draw not near to the doors of her house: 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` lest you give away your life to others, and your substance to the merciless: 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your labours come into the houses of strangers; 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And you repent at last, when the flesh of your body is consumed, 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` and you shall say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart avoided reproofs! 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` I heard not the voice of him that instructed me, and taught me, neither did I apply my ear. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Drink waters out of your own vessels, and out of your own springing wells. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Let not waters out of your fountain be spilled by you, but let your waters go into your streets. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Let them be only your own, and let no stranger partake with you. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Let your fountain of water be truly your own; and rejoice with the wife of your youth. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Let your loving hart and your graceful colt company with you, and let her be considered your own, and be with you at all times; for ravished with her love you shall be greatly increased. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Be not intimate with a strange woman, neither fold yourself in the arms of a woman not your own. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For the ways of a man are before the eyes of God, and he looks on all his paths. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Iniquities ensnare a man, and every one is bound in the chains of his own sins. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Such a man dies with the uninstructed; and he is cast forth from the abundance of his own substance, and has perished through folly.
