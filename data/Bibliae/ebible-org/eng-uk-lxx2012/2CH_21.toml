'''
"2" = '''

'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And their father gave them many gifts, silver, and gold, and arms, together with fortified cities in Juda: but he gave the kingdom to Joram, for he was the firstborn.

'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for a daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` nevertheless the Lord would not utterly destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which he made with David, and as he said to him that he would give a light to him and his sons for ever.

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` In those days Edom revolted from Juda, and they made a king over themselves.

"9" = '''

'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And Edom revolted from Juda until this day. Then Lomna at that time revolted from under his hand, because he forsook the Lord God of his fathers. 
'''
"11" = '''

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And there came to him a message in writing from Eliu the prophet, saying, Thus says the Lord God of your father David, Because you have not walked in the way of your father Josaphat, nor in the ways of Asa king of Juda, 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have caused Juda and the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, as the house of Achaab caused Israel to go a-whoring, and you have slain your brethren, the sons of your father, who were better than yourself; 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` behold, the Lord shall strike you with a great plague amongst your people, and your sons, and your wives, and all your store:

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And it continued from day to day: and when the time of the days came to two years, his bowels fell out with the disease, and he died by a grievous distemper: and his people performed no funeral, like the funeral of his fathers. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed without honour, and was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
