:sup:`3` And king Sedekias sent Joachal son of Selemias and Sophonias the priest son of Maasaeas to Jeremias, saying, Pray now for us to the Lord.

"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Thus said the Lord; Thus shall you say to the king of Juda who sent to you, to seek me; Behold, the army of Pharao which is come forth to help you: they shall return to the land of Egypt:

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` and the Chaldeans themselves shall turn again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For thus says the Lord; Suppose not in your hearts, saying, The Chaldeans will certainly depart from us: for they shall not depart.

"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And though youâŒƒ should strike the whole host of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left a few wounded men, these should rise up each in his place, and burn this city with fire.

"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And it came to pass, when the host of the Chaldeans had gone up from Jerusalem for fear of the host of Pharao, 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` that Jeremias went forth from Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to buy thence a property in the midst of the people. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And he was in the gate of Benjamin, and there was there a man with whom he lodged, Saruia the son of Selemias, the son of Ananias; and he caught Jeremias, saying, You are fleeing to the Chaldeans. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And he said, It is false; I do not flee to the Chaldeans. But he listened not to him; and Saruia caught Jeremias, and brought him to the princes. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the princes were very angry with Jeremias, and struck him, and sent him into the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made this a prison.

"16" = '''
:sup:`16` So Jeremias came into the dungeon, and into the cells, and he remained there many days.

"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And Jeremias said to the king, Wherein have I wronged you, or your servants, or this people, that you put me in prison?

"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And where are your prophets who prophesied to you saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against this land? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Now therefore, my lord the king, let my supplication come before your face: and why do you send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe? and let me not on any account die there. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Then the king commanded, and they cast him into the prison, and gave him a loaf a day out of the place where they bake, until the bread failed out of the city. So Jeremias continued in the court of the prison.
