"1" = '''
:sup:`1` He shall come into their midst as the land, as an eagle against the house of the Lord, because they have transgressed my covenant, and have sinned against my law. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` They shall soon cry out to me, saying, O God, we know you. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For Israel has turned away from good things; they have pursued an enemy. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They have made kings for themselves, but not by me: they have ruled, but they did not make it known to me: of their silver and their gold they have made images to themselves, that they might be destroyed. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Cast off your calf, O Samaria; my anger is kindled against them: how long will they be unable to purge themselves in Israel? 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Whereas the workman made it, and it is not God; therefore your calf, Samaria, was a deceiver: 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` for they sowed blighted seed, and their destruction shall await them, a sheaf of corn that avails not to make meal; and even if it should produce it, strangers shall devour it. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Israel is swallowed up: now is he become amongst the nations as a worthless vessel. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For they have gone up to the Assyrians: Ephraim has been strengthened against himself; they loved gifts. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore shall they be delivered to the nations: now I will receive them, and they shall cease a little to anoint a king and princes. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Because Ephraim has multiplied altars, his beloved altars are become sins to him. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` I will write down a multitude of commands for him; but his statutes are accounted strange things, even the beloved altars. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For if they should offer a sacrifice, and eat flesh, the lord will not accept them: now will he remember their iniquities, and will take vengeance on their sins: they have returned to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things amongst the Assyrians. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And Israel has forgotten him that made him, and they have built fanes, and Juda has multiplied walled cities: but I will send fire on his cities, and it shall devour their foundations.
