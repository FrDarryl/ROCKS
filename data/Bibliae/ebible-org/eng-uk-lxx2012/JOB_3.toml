'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Let the day perish in which I was born, and that night in which they said, Behold a boy! 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Let that night be darkness, and let not the Lord regard it from above, neither let light come upon it. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` But let darkness and the shadow of death seize it; let blackness come upon it; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` let that day and night be cursed, let darkness carry them away; let it not come into the days of the year, neither let it be numbered with the days of the months. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` But let that night be pain, and let not mirth come upon it, nor joy. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But let him that curses that day curse it, even he that is ready to attack the great whale. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Let the stars of that night be darkened; let it remain dark, and not come into light; and let it not see the morning star arise: 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` because it shut not up the gates of my mother's womb, for so it would have removed sorrow from my eyes. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For why died I not in the belly? and why did I not come forth from the womb and die immediately? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` and why did the knees support me? and why did I suck the breasts? 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Now I should have lain down and been quiet, I should have slept and been at rest, 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` with kings and councillors of the earth, who gloried in their swords; 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` or with rulers, whose gold was abundant, who filled their houses with silver: 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` or I should have been as an untimely birth proceeding from his mother's womb, or as infants who never saw light. 
'''
"17" = '''

"19" = '''
:sup:`19` The small and great are there, and the servant that feared his lord. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` For why is light given to those who are in bitterness, and life to those souls which are in griefs? 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` who desire death, and obtain it not, digging for it as for treasures; 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` and would be very joyful if they should gain it? 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Death is rest to such a man, for God has hedged him in. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For my groaning comes before my food, and I weep being beset with terror. 
'''
"25" = '''

'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` I was not at peace, nor quiet, nor had I rest; yet wrath came upon me.
