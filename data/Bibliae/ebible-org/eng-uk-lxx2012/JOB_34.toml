"1" = '''
:sup:`1` And Elius continued, and said, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Hear me, you⌃ wise men; listen, you⌃ that have knowledge. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For the ear tries words, and the mouth tastes meat. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Let us choose judgement to ourselves: let us know amount ourselves what is right. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For Job has said, I am righteous: the Lord has removed my judgement. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And he has erred in my judgement: my wound is severe without unrighteousness of mine. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` What man is as Job, drinking scorning like water? 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` saying, I have not sinned, nor committed ungodliness, nor had fellowship with workers of iniquity, to go with the ungodly. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For you should not say, There shall be no visitation of a man, whereas there is a visitation on him from the Lord. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore hear me, you⌃ that are wise in heart: far be it from me to sin before the Lord, and to pervert righteousness before the almighty. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Yes, he renders to a man accordingly as each of them does, and in a man's path he will find him. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And think you that the Lord will do wrong, or will the Almighty who made the earth wrest judgement? 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And who is he that made the whole world under heaven, and all things therein? 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For if he would confine, and restrain his spirit with himself; 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` all flesh would die together, and every mortal would return to the earth, whence also he was formed. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Take heed lest he rebuke you: hear this, listen to the voice of words. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Behold then the one that hates iniquities, and that destroys the wicked, who is for ever just. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` He is ungodly that says to a king, You are a transgressor, that says to princes, O most ungodly one. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Such a one as would not reverence the face of an honourable man, neither knows how to give honour to the great, so as that their persons should be respected. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` But it shall turn out vanity to them, to cry and beseech a man; for they dealt unlawfully, the poor being turned aside from their right. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For he surveys the works of men, and nothing of what they do has escaped him. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Neither shall there be a place for the workers of iniquity to hide themselves. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For he will not lay upon a man more than right. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For the Lord looks down upon all men, who comprehends unsearchable things, glorious also and excellent things without number. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Who discovers their works, and will bring night about upon them, and they shall be brought low. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And he quite destroys the ungodly, for they are seen before him. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Because they turned aside from the law of God, and did not regard his ordinances, 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` so as to bring before him the cry of the needy; for he will hear the cry of the poor. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And he will give quiet, and who will condemn? and he will hide his face, and who shall see him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man also: 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` causing a hypocrite to be king, because of the waywardness of the people. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` For there is one that says to the Mighty One, I have received blessings; I will not take a pledge: 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` I will see apart from myself: do you show me if I have done unrighteousness; I will not do so any more. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Will he take vengeance for it on you, whereas you will put it far from you? for you shall choose, and not I; and what you know, speak you. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Because the wise in heart shall say this, and a wise man listens to my word. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` But Job has not spoken with understanding, his words are not uttered with knowledge. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Howbeit do you learn, Job: no longer make answer as the foolish: 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` that we add not to our sins: for iniquity will be reckoned against us, if we speak many words before the Lord.
