'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And her father spoke, saying, I said that you did surely hate her, and I gave her to one of your friends: is not her younger sister better than she? let her be to you instead of her. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And Sampson said to them, Even for once am I guiltless with regard to the Philistines, in that I do mischief amongst them.

"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And the Philistines said, Who has done these things? and they said, Sampson the son-in-law of the Thamnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to one of his friends; and the Philistines went up, and burnt her and her father's house with fire.

"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And the men of Juda said, Why are you⌃ come up against us? and the Philistines said, We are come up to bind Sampson, and to do to him as he has done to us. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And the three thousand men of Juda went down to the hole of the rock Etam, and they said to Sampson, Know you not that the Philistines rule over us? and what is this that you have done to us? and Sampson said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And they said to him, We are come down to bind you to deliver you into the hand of the Philistines: and Sampson said to them, Swear to me that you⌃ will not fall upon me yourselves. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And they spoke to him, saying, Nay, but we will only bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand, and will by no means kill you: and they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him from that rock. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And they came to Lechi: and the Philistines shouted, and ran to meet him: and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as tow which is burnt with fire; and his bonds were consumed from off his hands.

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And God broke open a hollow place in the jaw, and there came thence water, and he drank; and his spirit returned and he revived: therefore the name of the fountain was called 'The well of the invoker,' which is in Lechi, until this day.
