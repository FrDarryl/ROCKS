"1" = '''
:sup:`1` THUS SAITH THE LORD AGAINST THE PHILISTINES; 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Behold, waters come up from the north, and shall become a sweeping torrent, and it shall sweep away the land, and its fulness; the city, and them that dwell in it: and men shall cry and all that dwell in the land shall howl, 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` at the sound of his rushing, at the sound of his hoofs, and at the rattling of his chariots, at the noise of his wheels: the fathers turned not to their children because of the weakness of their hands, 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` in the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines: and I will utterly destroy Tyre and Sidon and all the rest of their allies: for the Lord will destroy the remaining inhabitants of the islands. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ascalon is cast away, and the remnant of the Enakim. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` How long will you strike, O sword of the Lord? how long will it be ere you are quiet? return into your sheath, rest, and be removed. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` How shall it be quiet, whereas the Lord has given it a commission against Ascalon, and against the regions on the sea-coast, to awake against the remaining countries! CONCERNING IDUMEA, thus says the Lord; There is no longer wisdom in Thaeman, counsel has perished from the wise ones, their wisdom is gone, 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` their place has been deceived. Dig deep for a dwelling, you⌃ that inhabit Daedam, for he has wrought grievously: I brought trouble upon him in the time at which I visited him. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For grape gatherers are come, who shall not leave you a remnant; as thieves by night, they shall lay their hand upon your possessions. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For I have stripped Esau, I have uncovered their secret places; they shall have no power to hide themselves, they have perished each by the hand of his brother, my neighbour, and it is impossible 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` for your fatherless one to be left to live, but I shall live, and the widows trust in me. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For thus says the Lord; They who were not appointed to drink the cup have drunk it; and you shall by no means be cleared: 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` for by myself I have sworn, says the Lord, that you shall be in the midst of her an impassable land, and a reproach, and a curse; and all her cities shall be desert for ever. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` I have heard a report from the Lord, and he has sent messengers to the nations, saying, Assemble yourselves, and come against her; rise you⌃ up to war. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` I have made you small amongst the nations, utterly contemptible amongst men. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Your insolence has risen up against you, the fierceness of your heart has burst the holes of the rocks, it has seized upon the strength of a lofty hill; for as an eagle he set his nest on high: thence will I bring you down. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And Idumea shall be a desert: every one that passes by shall hiss at it. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha and they that sojourned in her, says the Lord Almighty, no man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man inhabit there. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Behold, he shall come up as a lion out of the midst of Jordan to the place of Aetham: for I will speedily drive them from it, and do you⌃ set the young men against her: for who is like me? and who will withstand me? and who is this shepherd, who shall confront me? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Therefore hear you⌃ the counsel of the Lord, which he has framed against Idumea; and his device, which he has devised against the inhabitants of Thaeman: surely the least of the sheep shall be swept off; surely their dwelling shall be made desolate for them. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For at the sound of their fall the earth was scared, and the cry of the sea was not heard. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Behold, he shall look upon her as an eagle, and spread forth his wings over her strongholds; and the heart of the mighty men of Idumea shall be in that day as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
