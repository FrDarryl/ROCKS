"1" = '''
:sup:`1` And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And you, son of man, will you judge the bloody city? yes, declare you to her all her iniquities. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And you shall say, Thus says the Lord God: O city that sheds blood in the midst of her, so that her time should come, and that forms devices against herself, to defile herself; 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` in their blood which you have shed, you have transgressed; and in your devices which you have formed, you have polluted yourself; and you have brought near your days, and have brought on the time of your years: therefore have I made you a reproach to the Gentiles, and a mockery to all the countries, 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` to those near you, and to those far distant from you; and they shall mock you, you that are notoriously unclean, and abundant in iniquities. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Behold, the princes of the house of Israel have conspired in you each one with his kindred, that they might shed blood. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` In you they have reviled father and mother; and in you they have behaved unjustly towards the stranger: they have oppressed the orphan and widow. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And they have set at nothing my holy things, and in you they have profaned my sabbaths. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` There are robbers in you, to shed blood in you; and in you they have eaten upon the mountains: they have wrought ungodliness in the midst of you. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` In you they have uncovered the father's shame; and in you they have humbled her that was set apart for uncleanness. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` They have dealt unlawfully each one with his neighbour's wife; and each one in ungodliness has defiled his daughter-in-law: and in you they have humbled each one his sister, the daughter of his father. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` In you they have received gifts to shed blood; they have received in you interest and usurious increase; and by oppression you have brought your wickedness to the full, and have forgotten me, says the Lord. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And if I shall strike my hand at your iniquities which you have accomplished, which you have wrought, and at your blood that has been shed in the midst of you, 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` shall your heart endure? shall your hands be strong in the days which I bring upon you? I the Lord have spoken, and will do it. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And I will scatter you amongst the nations, and disperse you in the countries, and your uncleanness shall be removed out of you. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And I will give heritages in you in the sight of the nations, and you⌃ shall know that I am the Lord. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Son of man, behold, the house of Israel are all become to me as it were mixed with brass, and iron, and tin, and lead; they are mixed up in the midst of the silver. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God; Because you⌃ have become one mixture, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` As silver, and brass, and iron, and tin, and lead, are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire into it, that they may be melted: so will I take you in my wrath, and I will gather and melt you. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And I will blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and you⌃ shall be melted in the midst thereof. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall you⌃ be melted in the midst thereof; and you⌃ shall know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath upon you. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Son of man, say to her, You are the land that is not rained upon, neither has rain come upon you in the day of wrath; 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` whose princes in the midst of her are as roaring lions seizing prey, devouring souls by oppression, and taking bribes; and your widows are multiplied in the midst of you. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Her priests also have set at nothing my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished between the holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in the midst of them. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Her princes in the midst of her are as wolves ravening to shed blood, that they may get dishonest gain. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And her prophets that daub them shall fall, that see vanities, that prophesy falsehoods, saying, Thus says the Lord, when the Lord has not spoken. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` That sorely oppress the people of the land with injustice, and commit robbery; oppressing the poor and needy, and not dealing justly with the stranger. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And I sought from amongst them a man behaving uprightly, and standing before me perfectly in the time of wrath, so that I should not utterly destroy her: but I found him not. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` So I have poured out my wrath upon her in the fury of my anger, to accomplish it. I have recompensed their ways on their own heads, says the Lord God.
