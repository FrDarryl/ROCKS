'''
"5" = '''

"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Therefore pride has possessed them; they have clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness: they have fulfilled their intention. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered unrighteousness loftily. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has gone through upon the earth. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore shall my people return hither: and full days shall be found with them. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And they said, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Behold, these are the sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed wealth. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And I said, Verily in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof was every morning. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` If I said, I will speak thus; behold, I should have broken covenant with the generation of your children. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And I undertook to understand this, but it is too hard for me, 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` until I go into the sanctuary of God; and so understand the latter end. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Surely you have appointed judgements to them because of their crafty dealings: you have cast them down when they were lifted up. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` How have they become desolate! suddenly they have failed: they have perished because of their iniquity. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, in your city you will despise their image. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For my heart has rejoiced, and my reins have been gladdened. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` But I was vile and knew not: I became brutish before you. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Yet I am continually with you: you have holden my right hand. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` You have guided me by your counsel, and you have taken me to yourself with glory. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` For what have I in heaven but you? and what have I desired upon the earth beside you? 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` My heart and my flesh have failed: but God is the strength of my heart, and God is my portion for ever. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` For, behold, they that remove themselves far from you shall perish: you have destroyed every one that goes a whoring from you. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` But it is good for me to cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may proclaim all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.
