"1" = '''
:sup:`1` But Job answered and said, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Oh that one would indeed weigh the wrath that is upon me, and take up my griefs in a balance together! 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And verily they would be heavier than the sand by the seashore: but, as it seems, my words are vain. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For the arrows of the Lord are in my body, whose violence drinks up my blood: whenever I am going to speak, they pierce me. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` What then? will the wild ass bray for nothing, if he is not seeking food? or again, will the ox low at the manger, when he has a fodder? 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Shall bread be eaten without salt? or again, is there taste in empty words? 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For my wrath can’t cease; for I perceive my food as the smell of a lion to be loathsome. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For oh that he would grant my desire, and my petition might come, and the Lord would grant my hope! 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Let the Lord begin and wound me, but let him not utterly destroy me. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Let the grave be my city, upon the walls of which I have leapt: I will not shrink from it; for I have not denied the holy words of my God. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For what is my strength, that I continue? what is my time, that my soul endures? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Or have I not trusted in him? but help is far from me. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Mercy has rejected me; and the visitation of the Lord has disregarded me. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` My nearest relations have not regarded me; they have passed me by like a failing brook, or like a wave. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` They who used to reverence me, now have come against me like snow or congealed ice. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` When it has melted at the approach of heat, it is not known what it was. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Thus I also have been deserted of all; and I am ruined, and become an outcast. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Behold the ways of the Thaemanites, you⌃ that mark the paths of the Sabaeans. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` They too that trust in cities and riches shall come to shame. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` But you⌃ also have come to me without pity; so that beholding my wound you⌃ are afraid. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` What? have I made any demand of you? or do I ask for strength from you, 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` to deliver me from enemies, or to rescue me from the hand of the mighty ones? 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Teach you⌃ me, and I will be silent: if in anything I have erred, tell me. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But as it seems, the words of a true man are vain, because I do not ask strength of you. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Neither will your reproof cause me to cease my words, for neither will I endure the sound of your speech. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Even because you⌃ attack the fatherless, and insult your friend. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` But now, having looked upon your countenances, I will not lie. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Sit down now, and let there not be unrighteousness; and unite again with the just. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` For there is no injustice in my tongue; and does not my throat meditate understanding?
