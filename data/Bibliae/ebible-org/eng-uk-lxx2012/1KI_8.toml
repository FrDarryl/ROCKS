'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` From the day that I brought out my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any one tribe of Israel to build a house, so that my name should be there: but I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there, and I chose David to be over my people Israel. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And it was in the heart of my father to build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.

'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and heaven of heavens will not suffice you, how much less even this house which I have built to your name? 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Yet, O Lord God of Israel, you shall look upon my petition, to hear the prayer which your servant prays to you in your presence this day, 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` that your eyes may be open towards this house day and night, even towards the place which you said, My name shall be there, to hear the prayer which your servant prays at this place day and night.

'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Whatsoever trespasses any one shall commit against his neighbour,—and if he shall take upon him an oath so that he should swear, and he shall come and make confession before your altar in this house, 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` then shall you hear from heaven, and do, and you shall judge your people Israel, that the wicked should be condemned, to recompense his way upon his head; and to justify the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness. 
'''

'''
"37" = '''

'''
"39" = '''

"41" = '''
:sup:`41` then shall you hear them from heaven, out of your established dwelling-place, and you shall do according to all that the stranger shall call upon you for, that all the nations may know your name, and fear you, as do your people Israel, and may know that your name has been called on this house which I have builded. 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` If it be that your people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way by which you shall turn them, and pray in the name of the Lord towards the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built to your name,

"43" = '''
:sup:`43` then shall you hear from heaven their supplication and their prayer, and shall execute judgement for them. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` If it be that they shall sin against you, (for there is not a man who will not sin,) and you shall bring them and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry them to a land far or near,

"45" = '''
:sup:`45` and they shall turn their hearts in the land whither they have been carried captives, and turn in the land of their sojourning, and supplicate you, saying, We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have transgressed, 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` and they shall turn to you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies whither you have carried them captives, and shall pray to you towards their land which you have given to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built to your name: 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` then shall you hear from heaven your established dwelling-place, 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` and you shall be merciful to their unrighteousness wherein they have trespassed against you, and according to all their transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against you, and you shall cause them to be pitied before them that carried them captives, and they shall have compassion on them: 
'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron.

'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` Because you have set them apart for an inheritance to yourself out of all the nations of the earth, as you spoke by the hand of your servant Moses, when you brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord God.—Then spoke Solomon concerning the house, when he had finished building it—He manifested the sun in the heaven: the Lord said he would dwell in darkness: build you my house, a beautiful house for yourself to dwell in anew. Behold, is not this written in the book of the song? 
'''
"52" = '''
:sup:`52` And it came to pass when Solomon had finished praying to the Lord all this prayer and supplication, that he rose up from before the altar of the Lord, after having knelt upon his knees, and his hands were spread out towards heaven.

"56" = '''
:sup:`56` that he may turn our hearts towards him to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments, and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers. 
'''
"57" = '''

'''
"58" = '''
:sup:`58` that all the nations of the earth may know that the Lord God, he is God, and there is none beside.

'''
"61" = '''
:sup:`61` And king Solomon offered for the sacrifices of peace-offering which he sacrificed to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, one hundred and twenty thousand sheep: and the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. 
'''
"62" = '''
:sup:`62` In that day the king consecrated the middle of the court in the front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered the whole burnt offering, and the sacrifices, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which was before the Lord was too little to bear the whole burnt offering and the sacrifices of peace-offerings. 
'''
"63" = '''
:sup:`63` And Solomon kept the feast in that day, and all Israel with him, even a great assembly from the entering in of Hemath to the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God in the house which he built, eating and drinking, and rejoicing before the Lord our God seven days. 
'''
"64" = '''
:sup:`64` And on the eighth day he sent away the people: and they blessed the king, and each departed to his tabernacle rejoicing, and their heart was glad because of the good things which the Lord had done to his servant David, and to Israel his people.
