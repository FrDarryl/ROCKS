'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And they said, You shall not go out: for if we should indeed flee, they will not care for us; and if half of us should die, they will not mind us; for you are as ten thousand of us: and now it is well that you shall be to us an aid to help us in the city. 
'''

'''
"27" = '''

'''
"28" = '''
