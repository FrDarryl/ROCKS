"2" = '''
:sup:`2` I have stretched forth my hands all day to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to them that walked in a way that was not good, but after their sins. 
'''
"3" = '''

'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They lie down to sleep in the tombs and in the caves for the sake of dreams, even they that eat swine's flesh, and the broth of their sacrifices: all their vessels are defiled: 
'''
"5" = '''

'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` But you⌃ are they that have left me, and forget my holy mountain, and prepare a table for the devil, and fill up the drink-offering to Fortune. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` I will deliver you up to the sword, you⌃ shall all fall by slaughter: for I called you, and you⌃ listened not; I spoke, and you⌃ refused to hear; and you⌃ did evil in my sight, and chose the things wherein I delighted not. 
'''
"13" = '''

'''
"15" = '''

'''
"16" = '''

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Neither shall there be there any more a child that dies untimely, or an old man who shall not complete his time: for the youth shall be one hundred years old, and the sinner who dies at one hundred years shall also be accursed: 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` and they shall build houses, and themselves shall dwell in them; and they shall plant vineyards, and themselves shall eat the fruit thereof. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` They shall by no means build, and others inhabit; and they shall by no means plant, and others eat: for as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people, they shall long enjoy the fruits of their labours. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` My chosen shall not toil in vain, neither shall they beget children to be cursed; for they are a seed blessed of God, and their offspring with them. 
'''
"24" = '''
