"1" = '''
:sup:`1` And what wonder? if the lusts of the soul, after participation with what is beautiful, are frustrated, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` on this ground, therefore, the temperate Joseph is praised in that by reasoning, he subdued, on reflection, the indulgence of sense. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For, although young, and ripe for sexual intercourse, he abrogated by reasoning the stimulus of his passions. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And it is not merely the stimulus of sensual indulgence, but that of every desire, that reasoning is able to master. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For instance, the law says, You shall not covet your neighbour's wife, nor anything that belongs to your neighbour. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Now, then, since it is the law which has forbidden us to desire, I shall much the more easily persuade you, that reasoning is able to govern our lusts, just as it does the affections which are impediments to justice. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Since in what way is a solitary eater, and a glutton, and a drunkard reclaimed, unless it be clear that reasoning is lord of the passions? 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` A man, therefore, who regulates his course by the law, even if he be a lover of money, straightway puts force upon his own disposition; lending to the needy without interest, and cancelling the debt of the incoming sabbath. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And should a man be parsimonious, he is ruled by the law acting through reasoning; so that he does not glean his harvest crops, nor vintage: and in reference to other points we may perceive that it is reasoning that conquers his passions. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For the law conquers even affection towards parents, not surrendering virtue on their account. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And it prevails over marriage love, condemning it when transgressing law. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And it lords it over the love of parents towards their children, for they punish them for vice; and it domineers over the intimacy of friends, reproving them when wicked. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And think it not a strange assertion that reasoning can in behalf of the law conquer even enmity. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` It allows not to cut down the cultivated herbage of an enemy, but preserves it from the destroyers, and collects their fallen ruins. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And reason appears to be master of the more violent passions, as love of empire and empty boasting, and slander. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For the temperate understanding repels all these malignant passions, as it does wrath: for it masters even this. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Thus Moses, when angered against Dathan and Abiram, did nothing to them in wrath, but regulated his anger by reasoning. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` For the temperate mind is able, as I said, to be superior to the passions, and to transfer some, and destroy others. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For why, else, does our most wise father Jacob blame Simeon and Levi for having irrationally slain the whole race of the Shechemites, saying, Cursed be their anger. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` For if reasoning did not possess the power of subduing angry affections, he would not have spoken thus. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For at the time when God created man, He implanted within him his passions and moral nature. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And at that time He enthroned above all the holy leader mind, through the medium of the senses. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And He gave a law to this mind, by living according to which it will maintain a temperate, and just, and good, and manly reign. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` How, then, a man may say, if reasoning be master of the passions, has it no control over forgetfulness and ignorance?
