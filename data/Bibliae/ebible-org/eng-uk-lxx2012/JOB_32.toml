"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Elius the Buzite the son of Barachiel answered and said, I am younger in age, and you⌃ are elder, therefore I kept silence, fearing to declare to you my own knowledge.

"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And I said, It is not time that speaks, though in many years men know wisdom:

"20" = '''
:sup:`20` I will speak, that I may open my lips and relieve myself.
