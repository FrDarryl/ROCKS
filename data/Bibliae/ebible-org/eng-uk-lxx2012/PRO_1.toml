"14" = '''

:sup:`15` go not in the way with them, but turn aside your foot from their paths: 
'''
"16" = '''

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` for nets are not without cause spread for birds.

'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` So long as the simple cleave to justice, they shall not be ashamed: but the foolish being lovers of haughtiness, having become ungodly have hated knowledge, and are become subject to reproofs.

"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Behold, I will bring forth to you the utterance of my breath, and I will instruct you in my speech.

:sup:`27` yes when dismay suddenly comes upon you, and your overthrow shall arrive like a tempest; and when tribulation and distress shall come upon you, or when ruin shall come upon you. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` For it shall be that when you⌃ call upon me, I will not listen to you: wicked men shall seek me, but shall not find me. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` For they hated wisdom, and did not choose the word of the Lord: 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` neither would they attend to my counsels, but derided my reproofs.
