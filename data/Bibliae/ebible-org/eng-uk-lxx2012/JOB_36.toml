"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Having fetched my knowledge from afar, and according to my works, 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` I will speak just things truly, and you shall not unjustly receive unjust words. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` But know that the Lord will not cast off an innocent man: being mighty in strength of wisdom, 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` he will not by any means save alive the ungodly: and he will grant the judgement of the poor. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` He will not turn away his eyes from the righteous, but they shall be with kings on the throne: and he will establish them in triumph, and they shall be exalted. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But they that are bound in fetters shall be holden in cords of poverty. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And he shall recount to them their works, and their transgressions, for such will act with violence. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` But he will listen to the righteous: and he has said that they shall turn from unrighteousness. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` If they should hear and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in honour. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` But he preserves not the ungodly; because they are not willing to know the Lord, and because when reproved they were disobedient. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And the hypocrites in heart will array wrath against themselves; they will not cry, because he has bound them. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Therefore let their soul die in youth, and their life be wounded by messengers of death. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Because they afflicted the weak and helpless: and he will vindicate the judgement of the meek. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And he has also enticed you out of the mouth of the enemy: 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` there is a deep gulf and a rushing stream beneath it, and your table came down full of fatness. Judgement shall not fail from the righteous; 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` but there shall be wrath upon the ungodly, by reason of the ungodliness of the bribes which they received for iniquities. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Let not your mind willingly turn you aside from the petition of the feeble that are in distress. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And draw not forth all the mighty men by night, so that the people should go up instead of them. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` But take heed lest you do that which is wrong: for of this you have made choice because of poverty. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Behold, the Mighty One shall prevail by his strength: for who is powerful as he is? 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And who is he that examines his works? or who can say, he has wrought injustice? 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Remember that his works are great beyond those which men have attempted. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Every man has seen in himself, how many mortals are wounded. 
'''
"26" = '''

'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And the drops of rain are numbered by him, and shall be poured out in rain to form a cloud. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` The ancient heavens shall flow, and the clouds overshadow innumerable mortals: he has fixed a time to cattle, and they know the order of rest. Yet by all these things your understanding is not astonished, neither is your mind disturbed in your body. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And though one should understand the outspreadings of the clouds, or the measure of his tabernacle; 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` behold he will stretch his bow against him, and he covers the bottom of the sea. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` For by them he will judge the nations: he will give food to him that has strength. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` He has hidden the light in his hands, and given charge concerning it to the interposing cloud. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` The Lord will declare concerning this to his friend: but there is a portion also for unrighteousness.
