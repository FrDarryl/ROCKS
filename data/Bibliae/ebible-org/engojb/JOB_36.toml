"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Bear with me a little, and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on behalf of Eloah. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` I will get my da'as from afar, and will ascribe tzedek to my Maker. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For truly my words shall not be sheker; one that is tamim (complete) in da'as is among thee. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` See, El is kabir (mighty), and despiseth not any; He is kabir in ko'ach lev (strength of understanding). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` He preserveth not the life of the rasha, but giveth mishpat to the aniyim. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` He withdraweth not His eyes from the tzaddik, but with melachim are they on the kisse; yea, He doth establish them lanetzach (forever), and they are exalted. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And if they be bound in chains, and be held fast in chevlei oni (cords of affliction), 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Then He showeth them their work, and their peysha'im that they have done arrogantly. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` He openeth also their ozen to musar (discipline), and commandeth that they make teshuvah and turn from evil. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their yamim in tov (prosperity), and their shanim in contentment. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without da'as. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` But the chanefei lev (irreligious in heart, hypocrites) incur wrath; they do not cry for help when He bindeth them. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` They die in youth, their nefesh among the kedeshim (cult male prostitutes, youthful lusts). 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` He delivereth the oni in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Even so would He have removed thee out of the tzar (distress) into a rachav (broad place), free from restriction, to the comfort of thy shulchan, full of choice food. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` But thou hast been fixated on the din of the rasha; din and mishpat take hold on thee. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Because there is chemah, beware lest He take thee away with His stroke; then a rav kopher (great ransom) cannot deliver thee. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Will He esteem thy riches? No, not zahav, nor all the forces of ko'ach. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Desire not halailah (the night), when people are cut off in their place. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Take heed, regard not iniquity; for this hast thou chosen rather than oni. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` See, El exalted by His ko'ach. Who is a moreh (teacher) like Him? 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Who hath enjoined Him His derech? Or who can say, Thou hast done wrong? 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Remember that thou must extol His work, of which anashim have sung praises. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Kol adam has seen it; enosh beholds it afar off. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` See, El is great, and we know Him not, neither can the mispar of His shanim be searched out. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` For He draws up the drops of mayim; He distills His mist as matar; 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Which the clouds do drop and distill upon adam abundantly. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the thunderings of His sukkah?

:sup:`30` See, He spreadeth His ohr upon it, and covereth the depths of the yam. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` For by them governeth He the amim (nations); He giveth okhel in abundance. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` His hands He covers with the ohr (lightning), and commandeth it to strike the mark. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` His noise announceth Him, the cattle even that He is approaching.
