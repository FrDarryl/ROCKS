TEHILLIM.
Chapter 85.
(For the one directing. Of the Bnei Korach. Mizmor) 
Hashem, Thou hast been favorable unto Thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Ya'akov. 
Thou hast forgiven the avon (iniquity) of Amecha (Thy people); Thou hast covered all their chattat (sin). Selah 
Thou hast withdrawn all Thy wrath; Thou hast turned from Thine charon af. 
Turn us, O Elohei Yisheinu (G-d of our salvation), and put away Thine ka'as (anger) toward us. 
Wilt Thou be angry with us l'olam? Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger l'dor vador? 
Wilt Thou not revive us again; that Amecha (Thy people) may rejoice in Thee? 
Show us chasdecha (Thy chesed, kindness, steadfast love), Hashem, and grant us Thy salvation. 
I will hear what HaEl Hashem will say; for He will speak shalom unto His people, and to His Chasidim; but let them not turn again to folly. 
Surely His salvation is karov (near) them that fear Him; that kavod may dwell in Artzeinu (our land). 
Chesed and emes will meet together; tzedek and shalom will kiss each other. 
Emes shall titzmach (sprout forth) out of ha'aretz; and tzedek shall look down from Shomayim. 
Yes, Hashem shall give that which is tov; and Artzeinu (our land) shall yield her yevul (increase, produce). 
Tzedek shall go before Him; and shall set us in the Derech of His steps.
