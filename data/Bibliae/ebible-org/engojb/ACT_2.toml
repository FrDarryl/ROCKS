'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And leshonot appeared to them, being divided as eish resting on each one of them,

'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` For these ones are not, as you assume, in their schnaps, for it is only the third hour of the day (nine o'clock in the morning).

'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` This one, delivered up by the determined cheshbon (plan) and yedi'ah mukdemet (foreknowledge) of Hashem, and by the hand of lawless Bnei Adam you made him talui al HaEtz(being hanged on the Tree) and put him to death. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` But in fact Hashem made Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to stand up alive again, having destroyed the Chevlei HaMavet, because it was impossible for Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach to be held by Deathʼs ko'ach. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` For Dovid Hamelech says of him, SHIVVITI HASHEM L'NEGDI TAMID, KI MIMINI BAL EMMOT (I set Adonoi before me always, because he is at my right hand I will not be shaken.)

"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Therefore my heart was cheered up and my tongue exulted and in addition also my flesh, my body, will live in secure hope.

'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Therefore, being a Navi and having da'as that with a shevu'ah (an oath) HASHEM swore to him that from his loins his zera would sit upon his KISSE… 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Foreseeing this, Dovid Hamelech spoke about the Techiyas HaMoshiach: neither was he “abandoned to destruction nor did his BASAR see corruption.”

'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` Until I make OYVECHA (your enemies) your footstool.

"36" = '''
