TEHILLIM.
Chapter 39.
(For the one directing, even to Yedutun. Mizmor Dovid) 
I said, I will be shomer over my ways, that I sin not with my leshon; I will be shomer over my mouth with a muzzle, while the rashah is before me. 
I was dumb with silence, I held my peace for the sake of tov; and my distress grew severe. 
My lev became hot within me; while I was musing the eish burned; then I spoke with my leshon: 
Hashem, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my yamim, what it is; that I may have da'as of how chadel (fleeting, frail) I am. 
Hinei, Thou hast made my yamim as a handbreadth, and mine lifespan is as nothing before Thee; verily kol adam stand as kol hevel (altogether vanity). Selah 
Surely every ish walketh in a tzel (shadow); surely they are in turmoil in vain; he heapeth up riches, and hath no da'as of who shall gather them. 
And now, Adonoi, what do I wait for? My hope is in Thee. 
Save me from all my peysha'im; make me not the reproach of the foolish. 
I was silent, I opened not my mouth; because Atah (Thou) did it. 
Remove Thy nega (stroke, scourge) away from me; I am consumed by the blow of Thine yad. 
When Thou with rebukes dost correct man for avon (iniquity), Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely kol adam are hevel (vanity). Selah 
Hear my tefillah, Hashem, and give ear unto my cry; hold not Thy peace at my weeping; for I am a ger with Thee, and a sojourner, as were all my Avot. 
O spare me from Thy frown, that I may recover strength, before I depart, v'eineni (and I be no more).
