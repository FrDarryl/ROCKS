'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` This day came ye out in the month Aviv. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And it shall be when Hashem shall bring thee into the land of the Kena'ani, and the Chitti, and the Emori, and the Chivi, and the Yevusi, which He swore unto thy Avot to give thee, an eretz flowing with cholov and devash, that thou shalt observe this avodah (service) in this month. 
'''

'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And thou shalt show thy ben in that day, saying, This is because of what Hashem did for me when I came forth out of Mitzrayim. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And it shall be for an ot (sign) unto thee upon thine yad, and for a zikaron (reminder) between thine eyes, in order that the torat Hashem may be in thy mouth; because with a yad chazakah hath Hashem brought thee out of Mitzrayim. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Thou shalt therefore be shomer over this chukkah in its mo'ed (season, fixed time) perpetually.

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` That thou shalt set apart unto Hashem all that openeth the rechem (womb), and every firstling that is born of a behemah which thou hast; hazecharim (the males) shall be Hashem ºs. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And every firstling of a he-donkey thou shalt redeem with a seh; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck; and kol bechor adam among thy banim shalt thou redeem.

"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And it shall be when thy ben asketh thee in time to come, saying, Mah zot? (What is this?) that thou shalt say unto him, By chozek yad Hashem brought us out from Mitzrayim, from the bais avadim; 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And it came to pass, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, that Hashem killed kol bechor of Eretz Mitzrayim, both the bechor adam, and the bechor behemah; therefore Ani zovei'ach laHashem(I sacrifice to Hashem) kol that openeth the rechem (womb), being hazecharim (the males); but kol bechor of my banim I redeem.

"16" = '''

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that Elohim led them not through the derech of the eretz of the Pelishtim (Philistines), although that was near; for Elohim said, Lest perhaps the people change their mind when they see milchamah, and they return to Mitzrayim; 
'''
"18" = '''

'''
"19" = '''
