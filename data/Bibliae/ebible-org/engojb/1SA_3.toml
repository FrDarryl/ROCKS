:sup:`1` And the na'ar Shmuel ministered unto Hashem before Eli. And the Devar Hashem was yakar (precious, dear, rare) in those days; there was no chazon nifratz prophetic vision open, spread out, common.

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Therefore Eli said unto Shmuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Hashem; for Thy eved (servant) shomei'a (is listening). So Shmuel went and lay down in his makom.

'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For I have told him that I will judge his Bais ad olam for the avon (iniquity) which he knoweth; because his banim brought klalot (curses) upon themselves, and he restrained them not.
