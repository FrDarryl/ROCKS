TEHILLIM.
Chapter 124.
(Shir HaMa'alot Song of Ascents, of Dovid) 1 If it had not been Hashem Who was lanu (for us, on our side), now may Yisroel say; 
If it had not been Hashem Who was lanu, when adam (man) rose up against us; 
Then they had swallowed us up chayyim (alive); when their wrath was kindled against us; 
Then the mayim would have overwhelmed us, the torrent would have swept over nafsheinu (our nefesh); 
Then the mayim hazedonim (treacherous waters) would have swept over nafsheinu (our nefesh). 
Baruch Hashem, Who hath not given us up as a prey to their shinayim (teeth). 
Nafsheinu (our nefesh) is escaped as a tzippor (bird) out of the pach (snare of the fowlers); the pach is broken, and we are escaped. 
Ezreinu (our help) B'Shem Hashem Oseh Shomayim vaAretz.
