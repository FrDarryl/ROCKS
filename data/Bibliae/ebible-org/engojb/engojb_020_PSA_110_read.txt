TEHILLIM.
Chapter 110.
(Of Dovid. Mizmor) 1Hashem said unto Adoni, Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies a footstool for thy feet. 
Hashem shall stretch forth the rod of thy might out of Tziyon; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 
Thy people, willing in the Day of thy Army, will be arrayed in the splendor of kodesh (holiness); from the womb of the dawn, cometh to thee thy young men as the tal (dew). 
Hashem hath sworn, and will not relent, Thou art a kohen l'olam al divrati Malki-Tzedek (kohen forever in respect to the order of Malki-Tzedek). 
Adonoi at thy right hand shall dash melachim (kings) in pieces in the Yom Afo (Day of His Wrath). 
He shall judge among the Goyim, He shall heap up geviyyot (corpses); He shall dash in pieces Rosh (Head); al Eretz Rabbah (over Great, Whole Earth). 
Of the brook in the Derech shall he drink; therefore shall he lift up as victor the Rosh.
