"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Hear the Devar Hashem, ye Bnei Yisroel: for Hashem hath a controversy with the yoshvei ha'aretz, because there is no emes, nor chesed, nor da'as Elohim in ha'aretz. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` By aloh (false swearing, perjury), and kachash (lying), and ratzo'ach (murder), and ganov (stealing), and na'of (committing adultery) they break away, and damim b'damim they follow (bloodshed follows bloodshed). 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Therefore shall ha'aretz mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall waste away languishing, with the wild beasts of the sadeh, and with the fowls of Shomayim; yea, the dagim of the yam also shall disappear. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Yet let no ish bring a point of contention, nor reprove another; for thy people are as they that strive with the kohen. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Therefore shalt thou stumble and fall in the yom, and the navi also shall stumble and fall with thee in the lailah, and I will destroy thy em. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Ami are destroyed for lack of da'as (knowledge); because thou hast rejected da'as, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no kohen to Me; seeing thou hast forgotten the torat Eloheicha, I will also forget thy banim. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` The more they increased, the more they sinned against Me; therefore will I change their kavod into kalon (ignominy, shame). 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` They feed on the chattat (sin) of Ami, and they relish their avon (iniquity). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And there shall be, like Am (People), like kohen; and I will visit them with punishment for their ways, and repay them for their doings. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase; because they have abandoned being shomer to heed Hashem. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Zenut (prostitution, whoredom) and yayin and tirosh take away the lev (understanding). 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Ami (My people) consult a piece of wood, and their staff declareth unto them; for the ruach zenunim hath caused them to err, and they have played the zonah, forsaking Eloheihem. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oak and poplar and terebinth, because the shade thereof is tov; therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law shall commit ni'uf (adultery). 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` I will not visit punishment upon your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit ni'uf (adultery); because the men consort with zonot, and they sacrifice with kedeshot (temple prostitutes); thus the Am without binah (understanding) shall come to ruin. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Though thou, Yisroel, play the zonah, yet let not Yehudah become guilty; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beit-Aven (House of Iniquity), nor swear, Chai Hashem(As the L-rd lives). 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For Yisroel slideth back like a backsliding parah (stubborn, rebellious cow); can Hashem now feed them like a lamb in a wide field? 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Ephrayim is joined to atzabim (idols); leave him alone. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` When their drink is sour, they have committed whoredom; her mogenim (shields, rulers) deeply love kalon (ignominy, shame). 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and their zevakhot (sacrifices) shall bring them bushah (shame).
