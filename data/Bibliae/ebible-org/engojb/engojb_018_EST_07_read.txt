ESTHER.
Chapter 7.
So HaMelech and Haman came to banquet with Ester HaMalkah. 
And HaMelech said again unto Ester on the yom hasheni (second day) at the mishteh hayayin (feast), What is thy she'elah (petition), Ester HaMalkah? And it shall be granted thee; and what is thy bakash (request)? And it shall be performed, even to chatzi HaMalchut. 
Then Ester HaMalkah answered and said, If I have found chen (favor) in thy sight, O HaMelech, and if it is tov to HaMelech, let nafshi (my life) be given me at my she'elah (petition), and my Am at my bakash (request); 
For we are sold, Ani (I) and Ami (my People), to be made shmad, to be slain, and to be annihilated. But if we had been sold for avadim and shfakhot, I would have held my tongue, since then the tzoros would not have been such as to injure the interests of HaMelech. 
Then HaMelech Achashverosh answered and said unto Ester HaMalkah, Who is he, and where is he, who dares to presume in his lev to do such? 
And Ester said, HaTzar (the foe) and the oyev (enemy) is this Haman HaRah (Vile Haman). Then Haman was terrified before HaMelech and HaMalkah. 
And HaMelech, arising in his wrath from the mishteh hayayin, went into the palace garden; and Haman stood up to make bakash (request) for his nefesh (life) to Ester HaMalkah; for he saw that harm was determined against him by HaMelech. 
Then HaMelech returned out of the palace garden into the Bais Mishteh HaYayin, and Haman was fallen upon the mittah (couch), whereon Ester was. Then said HaMelech, Will he ravish HaMalkah also before me in the bais? As the davar (word) went out of the mouth of HaMelech, they covered Hamanʼs face. 
And Charvona, one of the sarisim, said before HaMelech, Hinei, also, HaEtz fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordechai, who has spoken tov for HaMelech, standeth in the Bais Haman. Then HaMelech said, Hang him thereon. 
So they hanged Haman on HaEtz that he had prepared for Mordechai. Then was the wrath of HaMelech pacified.
