YIRMEYAH.
Chapter 45.
The Davar that Yirmeyah HaNavi spoke unto Baruch ben Neriyah, when he had written these words in a sefer at the mouth of Yirmeyah, in the fourth year of Y'hoyakim ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah, saying: 
Thus saith Hashem, Elohei Yisroel, unto thee, O Baruch: 
Thou didst say, Oy to me now! For Hashem hath added sorrow to my machovim (sorrows); I am worn out in my groaning, and I find no menuchah. 
Thus shalt thou say unto him, Hashem saith thus: Hinei, that which I have built will I tear down, and that which I have planted I will uproot, even this kol haAretz. 
And seekest thou gedolot (great things) for thyself? Seek them not; for, hineni, I will bring ra'ah upon kol basar, saith Hashem; but thy nefesh will I give unto thee for plunder in kol mekomot (all places) whither thou goest.
