'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` When you are invited by someone to a Chasunoh (wedding), you should not recline at tish in the rashei hamoshavot (chief seats), lest a more distinguished person than you may have been invited by him,

:sup:`11` For everyone exalting himself shall be humbled, and the one humbling himself shall be exalted. 
'''

'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` But when you prepare a seudah (feast), invite the aniyim (the poor), the baalei hamum (the maimed), the pisechim (the lame), the ivrim (blind), 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And Birkat Shomayim (the Blessing of Heaven) will befall you, because they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid in the Yom Tekumat HaTzadikkim(Day of the Resurrection of the Righteous).

"15" = '''

'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` But Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, A certain man was preparing a big seudah, and he invited many; 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And at the dinner hour, he sent his eved to say to the seudah invitees, Come, because everything is ready now. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` But each began to come up with a teretz (excuse). The rishon (first) said to him, I bought a sadeh (field) and I am compelled to go out and look at it. Please be mekabel (receive, accept) my teretz. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And another said, I have bought chamesh pair of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please be mekabel my teretz (excuse). 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And another said, I took a wife and therefore I am not able to come. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And the eved returned and reported this to his Adon. Then the Baal Bayit became angry and said to his eved, Go out quickly into the rekhovot (streets) and lanes of the shtetl and bring in here the aniyim (the poor) and the baalei hamum (the maimed) and the ivrim (blind) and the pisechim (the lame). 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And the eved said, Adoni, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And the Adon said to the eved, Go out to the rekhovot and along the boundaries and urge them to come in, in order that My Beis may be filled. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For I say to you that no one of those Bnei Adam who were invited will taste my seudah. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And large multitudes were accompanying him, and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach turned and said to them, 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` If someone comes to me, and does not hate his own Abba and Em (mother) and isha and yeladim and achim and achayot and in addition also his own life, he is not able to be my talmid. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Whoever does not carry his own etz shel mesiros nefesh following Me is not able to be my talmid. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` For who among you, wanting to build a migdal (tower), will not first sit down and rechen (calculate) the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it? 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Otherwise, having laid his yesod (foundation) and not being able to finish it, everyone seeing it may begin to make leitzonus (fun, mockery) of him, 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Or what melech, going out to make milchamah (war) against another melech, will not first sit down and consider if he is able with aseret alafim (ten thousand) to meet the one with esrim elef (twenty thousand) coming against him? 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` Or else, while the other is noch (yet) far away, he sends an embassy delegation and seeks terms for shalom. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` So, then, none of you can become my talmid if you do not renounce all your idolatrous holdings. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Therefore, melach (salt) is tov; but if even melach should become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned? 
'''
"35" = '''
