TEHILLIM.
Chapter 28.
(Of Dovid) 1 Unto Thee will I cry, Hashem my Tzur; do not turn a deaf ear to me: lest, if Thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. 
Shema (hear) kol (voice) of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee, when I lift up my hands toward Thy Devir Kodesh (Innermost Sanctuary, Kodesh HaKodashim). 
Draw me not away with the resha'im, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak shalom to their neighbors, but malice is in their hearts. 
Give to them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors; give them after the work of their hands; render to them their gemul (deserts). 
Because they regard not the Pe'ulot Hashem, nor the Ma'aseh of His hands, He shall tear them down, and not build them up. 
Baruch Hashem, because He hath heard the kol (voice) of my supplications. 
Hashem is my strength and my mogen; my lev trusts in Him, and I am helped; therefore my lev greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I thank Him. 
Hashem is their oz (strength), and He is the Ma'oz Yeshu'ot (saving refuge) of His Moshiach. 
Save Thy people, and bless Thine nachalah; shepherd them also, and carry them ad olam.
