TEHILLIM.
Chapter 150.
Hallelu El (Praise G-d), Hallelu El in His Kodesh; Hallelu Him in the raki'a of His might. 
Hallelu Him for His gevurot (mighty acts); hallelu Him according to His surpassing greatness. 
Hallelu Him with the sound of the shofar; hallelu Him with the nevel (harp) and kinnor (lyre). 
Hallelu Him with the tambourine and dance; hallelu Him with stringed instruments and flute. 
Hallelu Him upon the clashing cymbals; hallelu Him upon the resounding cymbals. 
Let every thing that hath neshamah praise Hashem. Praise Hashem!
