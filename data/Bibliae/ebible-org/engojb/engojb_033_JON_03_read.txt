YONAH.
Chapter 3.
And the Devar Hashem came unto Yonah the second time, saying, 
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that ir hagedolah, and preach unto it the preaching that I give thee. 
So Yonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the Devar Hashem. Now Nineveh was an exceeding ir gedolah of a journey of shloshet yamim. 
And Yonah began to enter into the city one dayʼs journey, and he cried out and preached, and said, Yet arba'im yamim (40 days), and Nineveh shall be overthrown. 
So the people of Nineveh had emunah in Elohim, and proclaimed a tzom, and put on sackcloth, from their gedolim even to their ketanim. 
For word came unto HaMelech of Nineveh, and he arose from his kisse, and he laid aside his royal robe, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
And he caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of HaMelech and his gedolim, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not eat, nor drink mayim; 
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto Elohim; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the chamas that is in their hands. 
Who can tell if HaElohim will turn and relent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not? 
And HaElohim saw their ma'asim, that they shavu (turned) from their derech hara'ah; and HaElohim relented of hara'ah, that He had said that He would do unto them; and He did it not.
