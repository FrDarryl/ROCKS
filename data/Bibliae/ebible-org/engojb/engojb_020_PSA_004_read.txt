TEHILLIM.
Chapter 4.
(For the one directing. With stringed instruments. Mizmor Dovid) 
Hear me when I call, Elohei tzidki (O G-d of my righteousness); Thou hast relieved me when I was in distress; channeini, and hear my tefillah. 
O ye Bnei Ish, how long will ye turn my kavod into shame? How long will ye love delusion, and seek kazav (lie, falsehood)? Selah 
But know that Hashem hath set apart the chasid for Himself; Hashem will hear when I call unto Him. 
Be angry, yet sin not; commune with your own levav upon your mishkav, and be still. Selah 
Offer the zivkhei-tzedek, and put your trust in Hashem. 
There be many that say, Who will show us any tov? Hashem, lift Thou up the ohr of Thy countenance upon us. 
Thou hast put simcha in my lev, more than in the time that their dagan and their tirosh increased. 
In shalom I will both lay me down, and sleep, for Thou alone, Hashem, makest me dwell in safety.
