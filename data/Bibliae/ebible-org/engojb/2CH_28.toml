:sup:`1` Achaz was 20 when he began to reign, and he reigned 16 years in Yerushalayim; but he did not that which was yashar in the eyes of Hashem, like Dovid Aviv, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For he walked in the ways of the melachim of Yisroel, and made also massekhot for Ba'alim. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Moreover he burned ketoret in the Gey Ben Hinnom, and burned his banim in the eish, after the to'avot of the Goyim whom Hashem had driven out before the Bnei Yisroel. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` He also sacrificed and burned ketoret on the high places, and on the hilltops, and under every green tree. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Therefore Hashem Elohav delivered him into the yad Melech Aram; and they defeated him, and carried off a great multitude of prisoners, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the yad Melech Yisroel, who inflicted on him makkah gedolah. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For Pekach ben Remalyahu slaughtered in Yehudah 120 elef in yom echad, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken Hashem Elohei Avotam. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And Zichri, a gibbor of Ephrayim, slaughtered Ma'aseiyahu ben HaMelech, and Azrikam the Nagid HaBais, and Elkanah Mishneh HaMelech.

:sup:`8` And the Bnei Yisroel carried away captive of their achim 200 elef nashim, banim, and banot, and took also away much plunder from them, and carried back the plunder to Shomron. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` But a navi of Hashem was there shmo Oded, and he went out before the faces of the tzava returning to Shomron, and said unto them, Hinei, because Hashem Elohei Avoteichem was angry with Yehudah, He hath delivered them into your yad, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto Shomayim. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And now ye intend to keep under the Bnei Yehudah and Yerushalayim for avadim and shefachot unto you, but are there not with you, even with you, sins against Hashem Eloheichem? 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Now hear me therefore, and send back the prisoners, which ye have taken captive of your achim, for the Charon Af Hashem is upon you. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then certain anashim of the Rashei Bnei Ephrayim, Azaryahu ben Yehochanan, Berechyahu ben Meshillemot, Yechizkiyahu ben Shallum, and Amasa ben Chadlai, stood up against them that came from the tzava, 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the prisoners here; for whereas we have offended against Hashem already, ye intend to add more to chattotenu and to ashmatenu, for our guilt is great, and there is Charon Af against Yisroel. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` So the soldiers released the prisoners and the plunder before the sarim and kol HaKahal. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the men which were designated by shemot rose up, and took the prisoners, and with the plunder clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and put balm on them, and carried all the weak of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Yericho, the Ir Temarim, to their achim. Then they returned to Shomron. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` At that time did HaMelech Achaz send unto the melachim of Assyria to help him.

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For Hashem brought Yehudah low because of Achaz Melech Yisroel, for he brought disgrace to Yehudah, and acted treacherously against Hashem. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And Tilgat Pilneser Melech Ashur came unto him, and oppressed him, but helped him not. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For Achaz took away a portion out of the Beis Hashem, and out of the Bais HaMelech, and of the sarim, and gave it unto Melech Ashur, but he helped him not. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And in the time of his distress he did act even more unfaithfully against Hashem. This is that Melech Achaz. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For he sacrificed unto the elohei Damascus, which defeated him, and he said, Because the elohim of the melachim of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of kol Yisroel. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And Achaz gathered together the vessels of the Beis HaElohim, and cut up the vessels of the Beis HaElohim and shut up the daletot Beis Hashem, and he set up for him mizbechot in every corner of Yerushalayim. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And in every town in Yehudah he made high places to burn ketoret unto elohim acherim, and provoked to anger Hashem Elohei Avotav.
