"1" = '''
:sup:`1` And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying: 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Ben adam, how is the etz hagefen (wood of the grapevine) better than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? Or will men take a yated (peg) of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Hinei, it is cast into the eish for fuel; the eish devoureth both the ends of it, and the middle of it is charred. Is it fit for any melachah (work)? 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Hinei, when it was tamim (whole), it was fit for no work; how much less shall it be fit yet for any work, when the eish hath devoured it, and it is charred? 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: As the etz hagefen among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the eish for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from one eish, and another eish shall devour them; and ye shall have da'as that I am Hashem, when I set My face against them. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And I will make ha'aretz desolate, because they have committed ma'al (unfaithfulness, betrayal of a trust), saith Adonoi Hashem.
