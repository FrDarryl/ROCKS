:sup:`1` And after chamash yamim, the Kohen Gadol Chananyah came down with some Zekenim and an orator, a certain Tertullus, who explained to the Moshel the charges keneged (against) Rav Sha'ul. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And when Rav Sha'ul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Your Excellency, much shalom has been attained through you, and reforms have come to this nation by your foresight. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` This in every way and everywhere, we acknowledge, most excellent Felix, with todah rabbah. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` But in order that I may not detain you any longer, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For having found this man a troublemaker and an inciter of riots among all the Yehudim throughout kol ha'aretz, a manhig of the kat, the Natzrati Kat. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` He even tried to desecrate the Beis Hamikdash! And so we apprehended him, and would have tried him according to our own law; 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` But the sar haelef Lysias came, and with great ko'ach took him away out of our hands, and ordered his adversaries to come unto you. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` When you examine him, you will be able to find out yourself regarding all these things of which we accuse him. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And the rest of the Judeans joined in the attack, saying that these things were so. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And when the Moshel nodded to him to speak, Rav Sha'ul answered, Knowing that for many years you have been a shofet (judge) to this nation, I cheerfully make my hitstaddekut. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` You will be able to learn that not more than twelve days have elapsed since I made an aliyah to worship in Yerushalayim. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And neither in the Beis Hamikdash did they find me conversing with anyone nor did they find me stirring up the multitude either in the shuls or anywhere in Yerushalayim. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Nor are they able to prove to you concerning the things of which now they are accusing me. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For Ani modeh (I confess) this to you, that according to the Derech Hashem, which they call a “kat”, I serve the Elohei Avoteinu, having emunah in everything written according to the Torah and the Nevi'im. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` I have a tikvah (hope) in Hashem, which also these ones themselves anticipate, the coming Techiyas HaMesim of both the Tzaddikim and the Resha'im. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` In view of this, I always do my best to keep a matzpun naki (clear conscience) before Hashem and before anashim. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Now after many years, I came bringing nedavot (donations) to my people and also to make korbanot (sacrifices). 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And this is how they found me, having undergone purification in the Beis Hamikdash, not with rioters nor with any disturbance. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` But there were some Yehudim from the Province of Asia who ought to be present before you to make accusation, if they might have something against me. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Or let these themselves say what crime they found in me when they stood me before the Sanhedrin, 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` unless it is about this one statement, which I stood and cried out among them, and that statement was concerning the Techiyas HaMesim, and it is for this that I am being judged today by you. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` But Felix, who was already rather well informed about the Derech Hashem, adjourned the meeting, saying, When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Then Felix gave orders to the centurion to guard Rav Sha'ul, but to grant him considerable liberty and not to prevent his chaverim from ministering to his needs. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And after some yamim, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was Jewish. He summoned Rav Sha'ul and listened to him concerning his emunah (faith) in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And as Rav Sha'ul was conversing about tzedek and kibush hayetzer (self-control) and about the Yom HaDin coming, Felix suddenly became afraid, and said, That will do for the moment. Go now. When I find time, I'll send for you. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` At the same time Felix was also hoping that bribe money would be given to him by Rav Sha'ul. Therefore, Felix used to frequently send for Rav Sha'ul to converse with him. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` When two years passed, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus, and, wanting to grant a favor to the Judeans, Felix left Rav Sha'ul in custody.
