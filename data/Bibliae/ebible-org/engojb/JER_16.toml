"1" = '''
:sup:`1` The Davar Hashem came also unto me, saying: 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Thou shalt not take thee an isha, neither shalt thou have banim or banot in makom hazeh (this place). 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For thus saith Hashem concerning the banim and concerning the banot that are born in makom hazeh, and concerning their immahot (mothers) that bore them, and concerning their avot that fathered them in ha'aretz hazot (this land); 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` The mot (death) they die will be of deadly diseases; they shall not be mourned; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as refuse upon the face of ha'adamah; and they shall be consumed by the cherev, and by ra'av (famine); and their nevelot (dead bodies) shall be food for the oph haShomayim, and for the behemat ha'aretz. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For thus saith Hashem, Enter not into the bais marzeach (house of mourning), neither go to lament nor mourn them; for I have withdrawn away My shalom from HaAm Hazeh, saith Hashem, even chesed and rachamim. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Both the gedolim and the ketanim shall die in ha'aretz hazot; they shall not be buried, neither shall men mourn for them, nor make pagan cuttings on themselves, nor make themselves like pagan mourners bald for them: 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Neither shall men break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the kos tanechumim (cup of consolation) to drink for their av or for their em. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Thou shalt not go into the bais mishteh (house of feasting), to sit with them to eat and to drink. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of hamakom hazeh before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of sasson, and the voice of simcha, the voice of the choson, and the voice of the kallah. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt tell this people all these Devarim, and they shall say unto thee, Why hath Hashem pronounced all this ra'ah hagedolah against us? Or what is avoneinu (our iniquity)? Or what is chattateinu (our sin) that we have committed against Hashem Eloheinu? 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Then shalt thou say unto them, Because avoteichem have forsaken Me, saith Hashem, and have walked after acharei elohim, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken Me, and have not been shomer over My torah; 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And ye have done more wickedly than avoteichem; for, behold, ye walk every one after the sherirut (stubbornness) of his lev harah, that they may not pay heed unto Me: 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Therefore will I cast you out of ha'aretz hazot into ha'aretz that ye know not, neither ye nor avoteichem; and there shall ye serve elohim acherim yomam valailah; for I will not show you chaninah (favor). 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Therefore, hinei, the days come, saith Hashem, that it shall no more be said, Hashem liveth, that brought up the Bnei Yisroel out of Eretz Mitzrayim; 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But, Hashem liveth, that brought up the Bnei Yisroel from the eretz tzaphon, and from kol ha'aratz where He had dispersed them; and I will bring them again into their adamah that I gave unto their avot. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Behold, I will send for many dayagim (fisherman), saith Hashem, and they shall fish them out; and after that will I send for many tzayadim (hunters), and they shall hunt them from every har (mountain), and from every givah (hill), and out of the crevices of the sela'im (rocks). 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For Mine eyes are upon all their drakhim; they are not hid from My face, neither is their avon (iniquity) hid from Mine eyes. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And first I will recompense their avon (iniquity) and their sin mishneh (double); because they have defiled My Eretz (land), they have filled Mine nachalah with the nevelot (lifeless forms, carcasses) of their detestable and abominable idols. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Hashem, my strength, and my ma'oz (fortress), and my refuge in the yom tzarah, the Goyim shall come unto Thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say: Surely Avoteinu have inherited sheker, hevel, and things wherein there is no profit. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Shall man make elohim unto himself and they are not Elohim? 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Therefore, behold, I will this time cause them to know, I will cause them to know Mine yad and My gevurah; and they shall know that My Shem is Hashem.
