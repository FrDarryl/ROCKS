TEHILLIM.
Chapter 20.
(For the one directing. Mizmor Dovid) 
Hashem hear thee in the Yom Tzarah (day of trouble); the Shem Elohei Ya'akov set thee up on high; 
Send thee help from the Kodesh (Holy Sanctuary), and strengthen thee out of Tziyon; 
Remember all thy minchot, and accept thy olat; Selah. 
Grant thee according to thine own levav, and fulfil kol etzah (plan, counsel) of thine. 
We will shout for joy at thy Yeshu'ah (salvation), and in the Shem of Eloheinu we will lift up our banners; Hashem grant all thy requests. 
Now I have da'as that Hashem hoshi'a (He saves) His Moshiach; He will answer him from His Sh'mei Kodesh (Holy Heaven) with the saving strength of His right hand. 
Some trust in chariots, and some susim: but we will trust in the Shem Hashem Eloheinu. 
They are brought down and fallen, but we are risen up, and stand firm. 
Hoshi'ah, Hashem, HaMelech! May He hear us on the day when we call.
