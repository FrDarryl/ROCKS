TEHILLIM.
Chapter 27.
(Of Dovid) 1Hashem is my ohr and Yishi (my Salvation); whom shall I fear? Hashem is the ma'oz (stronghold) of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
When the resha'im, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to devour my basar, they stumbled and fell. 
Though an army should encamp against me, my lev shall not fear; though milchamah should break out against me, in this will I be confident. 
One thing have I asked of Hashem, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the Bais Hashem all the days of my life, to behold the gracefulness of Hashem, and to inquire in His Heikhal. 
For in the Yom Ra'ah (day of evil) He shall keep me safe in His Sukkah; in the shelter of His Ohel shall He conceal me; He shall set me up upon a Tzur (rock). 
And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies around about me; therefore will I offer in His Ohel sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, yea, I will make music unto Hashem. 
Shema, Hashem, when I call with my voice; chaneini also upon me, and answer me. 
When my lev said of Thee, Seek ye My face, my lev said unto Thee, Thy face, Hashem, will I seek. 
Hide not Thy face far from me; turn not Thy eved away in anger; Thou hast been my ezer; leave me not, neither forsake me, Elohei Yishi (G-d of my Salvation). 
When avi and immi forsake me, then Hashem will take me up. 
Teach me Thy Derech, Hashem, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. 
Deliver me not over unto the desire of mine enemies; for edei sheker are risen up against me, and such as breathe out chamas. 
Did I not believe to see Hashemʼs goodness in the Eretz Chayyim! 
Wait for Hashem: Chazak! And strengthen thine lev. Wait, I say, for Hashem.
