'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Nevertheless l'ma'an Dovid (for the sake of Dovid) did Hashem Elohav give him a ner (lamp) in Yerushalayim, to raise up Bno after him, and to establish Yerushalayim; 
'''
"5" = '''

'''

:sup:`6` And there was milchamah between Rechav'am and Yarov'am all the days of his life.

'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And also Ma'achah immo, even her he deposed from being Gevirah (Queen Mother), because she had made a mifletzet (idol) to Asherah; and Asa cut down her mifletzet, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` There is a brit between me and thee, and between Avi and Avicha; hinei, I send unto thee a shochad (incentive kind of gift) of kesef and zahav; come, break thy brit with Ba'asha Melech Yisroel, that he may withdraw from me. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` So Ben-Hadad paid heed unto HaMelech Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Yisroel, and struck Iyon, and Dan, and Abel Beit-Ma'achah, and kol Kinnerot, with Kol Eretz Naphtali. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And it came to pass, when Ba'asha heard this, he stopped building Ramah, and stayed in Tirtzah.

'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And Ba'asha Ben Achiyah, of the Bais of Yissakhar, plotted a keshar against him; and Ba'asha struck him down at Gibeton, which belonged to the Pelishtim; for Nadav and kol Yisroel were laying siege to Gibeton. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Even in the third year of Asa Melech Yehudah did Ba'asha slay him, and reigned in his place. 
'''
