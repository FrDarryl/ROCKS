TEHILLIM.
Chapter 144.
(Mizmor of Dovid) 1 Baruch Hashem my Tzur (rock) which teacheth my hands for war, and my fingers for milchamah (battle); 
My Chesed, and my Metzudah (Fortress); my Stronghold, and my Deliverer; my Mogen, and He in Whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me. 
Hashem, what is adam, that Thou takest knowledge of him! Or the ben enosh, that Thou takest account of him! 
Adam is like hevel; his days are as a tzel that passeth away. 
Part Thy heavens, Hashem, and come down; touch the harim, and they shall smoke. 
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; shoot Thine khitzim (arrows), and destroy them. 
Send Thine Yad from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of mayim rabbim, from the yad Bnei Nekhar; 
Whose mouth speaketh shav (lies), and their right hand is a right hand of sheker. 
I will sing a shir chadash unto Thee, O Elohim; upon a nevel of ten strings will I make music unto Thee. 
It is He that giveth Teshu'ah (deliverance, salvation) unto melachim; Who delivereth Dovid His eved from the cherev ra'ah. 
Rescue me, and save me from the yad Bnei Nekhar, whose mouth speaketh shav (lies) and their right hand is a right yad of sheker. 
In their youth, may baneinu (our sons) be like plants full grown; may benoteinu (our daughters) be like cornerstones, columns wrought for the Heikhal; 
That our barns may be full, affording all manner of provision; that our tzon may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our meadows; 
That our oxen may be strong to labor; that there be no peretz (breach) nor golus; that there be no cry of anquish in our streets. 
Ashrei are such people; Ashrei is the people that Hashem is Elohav.
