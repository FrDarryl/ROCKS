TEHILLIM.
Chapter 46.
(For the one directing. Of the Bnei Korach. Al-alamot. Shir) 
Elohim is our refuge and strength, a very present help in tzoros. 
Therefore we will not fear, though eretz be shaken, and though the harim (mountains) fall into the lev yamim (heart of the seas); 
Though the mayim thereof roar and be troubled, though the harim shake with the surging thereof. Selah 
There is a nahar (river), the streams whereof shall make glad the Ir Elohim, the Kedosh Mishkenei Elyon (the holy dwelling of the Most High). 
Elohim is in the midst of it; it shall not be moved; Elohim shall help it at early boker. 
The Goyim raged, the kingdoms totter; He uttered His voice, eretz melted. 
Hashem Tzva'os is with us; Elohei Ya'akov is our stronghold. Selah 
Come, behold the works of Hashem, what desolations He hath made in ha'aretz. 
He maketh milchamot to cease unto the end of ha'aretz; He breaketh the keshet (bow), and cutteth the khanit (spear); He burneth the chariots in the eish. 
Be still, and know that I am Elohim: I will be exalted among the Goyim, I will be exalted in ha'aretz. 
Hashem Tzva'os is with us; Elohei Ya'akov is our stronghold. Selah
