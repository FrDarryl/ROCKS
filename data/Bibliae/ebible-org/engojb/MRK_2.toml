'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And, ofen ort (immediately), having had daas in his ruach that in this way they were thinking, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Why are you considering such things in your levavot? 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Which is easier? To say to the paralytic, Your averos are granted selicha, or to say, Stand and pick up your mat and walk?

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And having heard this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Itʼs not the strong ones that have need of a rofeh (physician) but rather the cholim (sick persons). I did not come to call the tzaddikim (righteous ones) but the chote'im (sinners) to teshuva. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And the talmidim of Yochanan and the Perushim came with tzomot (fasts). And they come and say to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, Why do the talmidim of the Perushim and the talmidim of Yochanan come with tzomot, but your talmidim do not? 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, said to them, Surely the Bnei HaChuppah of the Choson (Bridegroom) are not able to undergo tzomot as long as they have the Choson with them, nu? As long as they have the Choson with them, they are not able to undergo tzomot. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` But yamim (days) will come when the Choson is taken away from them, and then they will undergo tzomot HaYom HaHu. 
'''
