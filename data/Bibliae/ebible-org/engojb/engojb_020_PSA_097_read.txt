TEHILLIM.
Chapter 97.
Hashem reigneth; let ha'aretz rejoice; let the multitude of isles thereof be glad. 
Anan and darkness are round about Him; tzedek and mishpat are the foundation of His kisse. 
Eish goeth before Him, and burneth up His enemies on every side. 
His lightnings light up the tevel; ha'aretz saw, and trembled. 
The harim melted like wax at the presence of Hashem, at the presence of Adon kol HaAretz. 
HaShomayim declare His tzedek, and kol ha'amim see His kavod. 
Shamed be all they that serve pesel, that boast themselves of elilim; worship Him, kol elohim. 
Tziyon heard, and was glad; and the banot Yehudah rejoiced because of Thy mishpatim, Hashem. 
For Thou, Hashem, art Elyon above kol ha'aretz; Thou art exalted far above kol elohim. 
Ye that love Hashem, hate rah; He preserveth the nefashot of His chasidim; He delivereth them out of the yad resha'im. 
Ohr dawns for the tzaddik, and simchah for the yishrei lev (upright in heart). 
Rejoice in Hashem, ye tzaddikim; and give thanks at the remembrance of His kodesh (holiness).
