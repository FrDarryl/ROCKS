YESHAYAH.
Chapter 12.
And in Yom Hahu thou shalt say, Hashem, I will praise Thee; though Thou wast angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortedst me. 
Hinei, El is my Yeshu'ah (Salvation); I will trust, and not be afraid; for Hashem G-d is my strength and my zemirah; He also has become my Yeshu'ah (Salvation). 
Therefore with sasson shall ye draw mayim out of the wells of Yeshu'ah (Salvation). 
And in Yom Hahu shall ye say: Hodu LaHashem, call upon Shmo, declare His deeds among the peoples, proclaim that Shmo is exalted. 
Sing unto Hashem; for He hath done glorious things; let this be known b'chol ha'aretz. 
Cry out and shout for joy, thou inhabitant of Tziyon; for gadol is Kadosh Yisroel in the midst of thee.
