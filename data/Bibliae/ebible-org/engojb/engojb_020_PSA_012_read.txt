TEHILLIM.
Chapter 12.
(For the one directing. According to the Sheminit. Mizmor Dovid) 
Help, Hashem; for the chasid is no more; for the emunim (faithful ones) vanish from among Bnei Adam. 
They speak vanity every one with his re'a (neighbor); with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. 
Hashem shall cut off all flattering lips, and the leshon that speaketh gedolot; 
Who have said, With leshoneinu (our tongue) will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is Adon over us? 
For the oppression of the aniyim, for the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith Hashem; I will set him in safety from him that sneers at him. 
The words of Hashem are amarot tehorot (pure words); as kesef refined in the furnace on the earth, purified seven times. 
Thou shalt be shomer over them, Hashem, Thou shalt preserve him from this generation forever. 
The resha'im strut on every side, when the vilest among the Bnei Adam are exalted.
