TEHILLIM.
Chapter 42.
(For the one directing, Maskil, for the Bnei Korach) 
As the deer panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my nefesh after Thee, O Elohim. 
My nefesh thirsteth for Elohim, for El Chai. When shall I come and appear before Elohim? 
My tears have been my lechem yomam valailah, while they continually say unto me, Where is Eloheicha? 
When I remember these things, I pour out my nefesh within me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the Beis Elohim with the voice of rinnah and todah, with the multitude keeping Chag (holy day, pilgrim feast). 
Why art thou cast down, O my nefesh? And why groanest thou within me? Hope thou in Elohim; for I shall yet give Him thanks, for He is the yeshu'ah (salvation) of my countenance and Elohai. 
My nefesh is cast down within me; therefore will I remember Thee from Eretz Yarden, and from Chermonʼs peaks, from Har Mitzar. 
Tehom el Tehom (oceanic deep unto oceanic deep) calleth at the noise of Thy waterfalls; all Thy breakers and Thy billows are passed over me. 
Yet Hashem will command His chesed by day, and in the night His shir (song) shall be with me, my tefillah (prayer) unto the El Chayyai (G-d of my life). 
I will say unto El Sali (G-d my Rock), Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the oyev (enemy)? 
As with the crushing of my atzamot (bones), mine tzorer (vexers, harassers) reproach me; while they say all day long unto me, Where is Eloheicha? 
Why art thou cast down, O my nefesh? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in (wait for) Elohim; for I shall yet give Him thanks, for He is the yeshu'ah (salvation) of my countenance and Elohai.
