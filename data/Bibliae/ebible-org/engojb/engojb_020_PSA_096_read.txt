TEHILLIM.
Chapter 96.
O sing unto Hashem a shir chadash; sing unto Hashem, kol ha'aretz. 
Sing unto Hashem, barakhu Shmo, show forth His Yeshu'ah (salvation) from day to day. 
Declare His kavod among the Goyim, His nifle'ot (marvelous deeds) among all peoples. 
For Hashem is gadol, and me'od to be praised; He is to be feared above all elohim. 
For kol elohei HaAmim are elilim (idols); but Hashem made Shomayim. 
Hod and hadar are before Him; oz and tiferet are in His Mikdash. 
Render unto Hashem, O ye mishpekhot of the nations, render unto Hashem kavod and oz. 
Render unto Hashem the kavod due unto Shmo; bring a minchah, and come into His khatzerot (courtyards). 
O worship Hashem in the hadrat Kodesh; fear before Him, kol ha'aretz. 
Say among the Goyim that Hashem reigneth; the tevel also is established that it shall not be moved; He shall judge the Amim bemeysharim (in equity, in uprightness). 
Let Shomayim rejoice, and let ha'aretz be glad; let the yam roar, and the fullness thereof. 
Let the sadeh be jubilant, and all that is therein; then shall kol atzei ya'ar (all the trees of the forest) sing for joy 
Before Hashem; for He cometh, for He cometh to judge ha'aretz; He shall judge tevel betzedek (world in righteousness), and Amim with His emunah (truth).
