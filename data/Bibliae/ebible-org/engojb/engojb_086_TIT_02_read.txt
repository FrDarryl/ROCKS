Chapter 2.
But you, speak the things which are suitable to Moshiachʼs orthodox Jewish doctrine. 
Zekenim need to be temperate, respectable, men of seichel, being orthodox in the emunah, in ahavah, in savlanut (longsuffering). 
Similarly the senior women, the Zekanot, in hitnahagut (conduct) as befits kedushah, not yentas of lashon hora nor slaves of wine, but melamedot es haTov (teachers of the Good), 
That they may encourage the young nashim to have ahavah for their ba'alim and their banim, 
To have seichel, tehorot in tznius, managers of the Bayit, being tovot, being submissive to their ba'alim, lest Chillul Hashem come to the Dvar HaElohim. 
The bochrim, similarly, you exhort to have seichel 
About all things, showing yourself a mofet of ma'asim tovim. In the hora'ah, show integrity, seriousness, 
Along with dibur (speech) that is orthodox and beyond reproach, that the mitnagged may be brought to bushah (shame), having no lashon hora to say against you. 
Avadim (slaves) need to be submissive to their own adonim in everything, to be acceptable, not talking back, 
Not pilfering, but showing all good reliability, that they may adorn the hora'ah (teaching) of Hashem Moshieinu in all things. 
For the Chen v'Chesed of Hashem has appeared, bringing Yeshu'at Eloheynu to kol Bnei Adam, 
Instructing us to deny all that is frai (irreligious) and not of chasidus and all that is ta'avanut, and to live with seichel and tzidkat Hashem and yirat Shomayim in the Olam Hazeh, 
Awaiting the tikvah hameashsheret (the blessed hope), the appearing of the kavod HaEloheinu HaGadol and Moshieinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, 
Who gave his nefesh on behalf of us, that for us he might bring in the Geulah, redeeming us MI KOL AVONOTAV (from all Israelʼs sins), making tahor AM LI SEGULAH (a people for My possession), zealous for ma'asim tovim. 
Preach these things, with words that give chizzuk (strengthening) and reprove with all authority. Let no one “write you off.”
