"1" = '''
:sup:`1` The chazon (vision) of Yeshayah ben Amotz, which he saw concerning Yehudah and Yerushalayim in the yamim of Uziyahu, Yotam, Achaz, and Yechizkiyahu, melachim of Yehudah. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Hear, O Shomayim, and give ear, O Eretz, for Hashem hath spoken; I have nourished and brought up banim, and they have rebelled against Me. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` The ox knoweth his owner, and the donkey his masterʼs evus; but Yisroel doth not know, My people doth not consider. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Ah, goy choteh (sinful nation), a people weighed down with avon (guilt, iniquity), zera of evildoers, banim of corruption; they forsook Hashem, they have spurned the Kadosh Yisroel (the Holy One of Yisroel), they have turned their back on Him. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Why, seeing that ye will be stricken again, will ye rebel stubbornly again? The kol rosh is sick, and the kol levav faint. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` From the sole of the regel even unto the rosh there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores; they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither soothed with shemen. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with eish; your land, zarim devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by zarim. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And the Bat Tziyon (i.e., Yerushalayim) is left as a sukkah in a kerem (vineyard), as a shack in a cucumber field, as an ir (city) under siege. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Except Hashem Tzva'os had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Amora (Gomorrah). 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Hear the Devar Hashem, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the Torat Eloheinu, ye people of Amora (Gomorrah). 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` To what purpose is the multitude of your zevakhim unto Me? saith Hashem; I am fed up of the olot (burnt offerings) of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the dahm of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` When ye come to appear before Me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample khatzerai (My courts)? 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Bring no more futile minchot; ketoret is an abomination unto Me; Rosh Chodesh (New Moon) and Shabbos, the calling of assemblies — I cannot endure aven (wickedness) and atzarah (solemn convocation). 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Your Rosh Chodesh and your Mo'adim My Nefesh hateth; they are a burden unto Me; I am weary to bear them. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many tefillah, I will not hear; your hands are full of damim. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do evil; 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Learn to do good; seek mishpat, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the almanah. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Come now, and let us reason together, saith Hashem; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of ha'aretz; 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the cherev; for the mouth of Hashem hath spoken. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` How is the Kiryah Ne'emanah (Faithful City, i.e., Yerushalayim) become a zonah (harlot)! It was full of mishpat; tzedek lodged in it; but now murderers. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Thy kesef is become dross, thy wine mixed with mayim: 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Thy sarim (princes) are rebellious, and companions of ganavim: every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they give no justice to the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the almanah come unto them. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Therefore saith HaAdon, Hashem Tzva'os, Avir Yisroel (the Mighty One of Yisroel), Ah, I will relieve Myself of Mine adversaries, and avenge Me of Mine enemies: 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And I will turn My hand upon thee, and refine away thy impurities, and take away all thy alloy: 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And I will restore thy shofetim as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The Ir HaTzedek, the Kiryah Ne'emanah. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Tziyon shall be redeemed with mishpat, and those in her who make teshuvah with tzedakah. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And the destruction of the poshe'im and of the chote'im shall be together, and they that forsake Hashem shall be consumed. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` For they shall be ashamed of the sacred oaks which ye have delighted in, and ye shall blush for the gannot (gardens) that ye have chosen. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no mayim. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` And the strong shall be as tinder, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
