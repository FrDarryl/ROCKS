TEHILLIM.
Chapter 83.
(Shir. Mizmor of Asaph) 
Keep not Thou silent, O Elohim; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O El (G-d). 
For, hinei, Thine oyevim are in tumult; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the rosh. 
They lay out a crafty conspiracy against Amecha (Thy people), and plot against Tzefunecha (Thy sheltered, protected, hidden ones). 
They have said: Come, and let us cut them off from being a goy (nation); that the shem Yisroel may be no more remembered. 
For they have plotted together with one lev; they cut a brit against Thee; 
The ohalim Edom, and the Yishm'elim; of Moav, and the Hagerim; 
Geval, and Ammon, and Amalek; Peleshet (Philistia) with the inhabitants of Tzor; 
Assyria also is joined with them; they are the zero'a (strong arm) of the Bnei Lot. Selah 
Do unto them as unto Midyan; as to Sisra, as to Yavin, at the Wadi Kishon; 
Which became shmad at Ein-Dor; they became like domen (dung, fertilizer) for ha'adamah. 
Make their nobles like Orev, and like Ze'ev; yes, all their princes like Zevach, and like Tzalmunna; 
Who said, Let us take possession for ourselves of the pasturelands of Elohim. 
O Elohai, make them like galgal (tumbleweed); like chaff before the ruach (wind). 
As the eish consumeth the forest, and as the flame setteth ablaze harim; 
So pursue them with Thy sa'ar (tempest, storm), and make them afraid with Thy storm. 
Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek Shimcha, Hashem. 
Let them be put to shame and dismayed adei ad (forever); yes, let them perish in disgrace; 
Let them have da'as that Thou alone, Shimcha Hashem, art Elyon al kol HaAretz.
