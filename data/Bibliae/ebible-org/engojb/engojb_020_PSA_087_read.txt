TEHILLIM.
Chapter 87.
(Of the Bnei Korach. A mizmor. A shir) 1 On the Harei Kodesh (Holy Mountain) stands His foundation. 
Hashem loveth the sha'arei Tziyon more than all the mishkenot Ya'akov. 
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O Ir HaElohim. Selah 
To them that know me, I will make mention of Rachav and Babylon; hinei, Philistia, and Tzor, with Ethiopia: this man was born there. 
But of Tziyon it shall be said, This one and that one were born in her; and Elyon Himself shall establish it. 
Hashem shall register, when He writeth up the people, that this one was born there. Selah 
The sharim (ones singing) as well as the cholelim (players on instruments) shall be there; all my fountains are in thee.
