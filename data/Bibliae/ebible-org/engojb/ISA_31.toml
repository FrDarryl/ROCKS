:sup:`1` Woe to them that go down to Mitzrayim for ezrah (help); and rely on susim, and trust in merkavot, because they are many; and in parashim, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Kadosh Yisroel, neither seek Hashem! 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Yet He also is chacham (wise), and will bring rah (disaster), and will not call back His devarim; but will arise against the Bais Mere'im (house of evildoers), and against the ezrat po'alei aven (the help of them that work iniquity). 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Now the Mitzrayim are adam, and not El (G-d); and their susim basar, and not ruach. When Hashem shall stretch out His yad, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is helped shall stumble, and they all shall come to an end together. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For thus saith Hashem unto me, Just as the aryeh (lion) and the young lion roars over his prey, when a multitude of ro'im (shepherds) is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their clamor, nor disturb himself because of the noise of them; so shall Hashem Tzva'os come down to fight for Mount Tziyon, and for the givah (hill) thereof. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` As tzipporim (birds) flying, so will Hashem Tzva'os defend Yerushalayim; defending also He will deliver it; and paso'ach (passing over) He will preserve it. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Shuvu (turn ye, return) unto Him from Whom the Bnei Yisroel have deeply revolted. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For in that day every ish shall cast away his elilim of kesef, and his elilim of zahav, which your own hands have made unto you as a chet. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Then shall the Assyrian fall by a cherev, not of an ish (man); and a cherev not of adam (of mortals) shall devour him; so he shall flee from before the cherev, and his bochrim shall become forced laborers. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And his rock shall pass away in magor (terror), and his sarim shall desert the nes (battle flag) in panic, saith Hashem, Whose fire is in Tziyon, and His furnace in Yerushalayim.
