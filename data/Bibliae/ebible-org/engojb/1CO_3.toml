"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Achim b'Moshiach, I was not able to speak to you as to men of hitkhadshut and ruchaniyut; I had to speak to you as bnei basar, as olalim b'Moshiach. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Cholov I gave you to drink, not solid okhel (food), for you were not yet able to receive it, but neither yet are you able now. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For still you are bnei basar (carnally-minded believers). For als (since) there is still kinah and merivah (strife) among you, are you not bnei basar, by the standards of Bnei Adam? 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For, whenever anyone says, “I am of Sha'ul,” but another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not as anshei shechichim (ordinary men)? 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` What then is Apollos? And what is Sha'ul? Klei kodesh ministers of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, through whom you came to emunah, even as to each one a task was given by Adoneinu. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` I planted, Apollos watered, but Hashem gave the increase. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Therefore, neither is the one planting anything nor the one watering, but it is the One giving the increase — Hashem! 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Now the one planting and the one watering are be'ichud (united), and, each one will receive his own sachar (reward) according to his own amal (toil). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For we are fellow po'alim (workers) of Hashem, you are the sadeh Hashem(field of G-d), you are Hashemʼs binyan (building). 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` According to the Chen v'Chesed Hashem having been given to me as a bannai chacham (wise builder), I laid a yesod (foundation), and another builds on it. But, let each one beware how he builds on it. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For no other yesod other than the one that has been laid can be laid: Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Now if anyone builds on the yesod with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` The ma'aseh (work) of each bannai will become evident, for, haYom will make it have its hisgalus, because by Eish (Fire) it is revealed; and the Eish (Fire) itself will test the quality of each oneʼs ma'aseh. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` If anyoneʼs ma'aseh he built on the yesod will survive, a sachar (reward) he will receive; 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` If anyoneʼs ma'aseh will be consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through Eish (fire). 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Do you not have da'as that you are a Heikhal Hashem and the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem dwells in you? 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` If anyone attempts to cause churban to the Heikhal Hashem, G-d will destroy this man, for the Heikhal Hashem is kadosh, and you plural are that Heikhal. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Let no one deceive himself: if anyone presumes to be chacham among you in the Olam Hazeh, let him become a kesil (fool), that he may become chacham. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For the chochmah (wisdom) of Olam Hazeh is narrishkait (foolishness) with Hashem. For it has been written, LOCHED CHACHAMIM BE'ARMAM (He catches the wise in their own craftiness). 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And again, HASHEM YODE'A MACHSH'VOT ADAM KI HEMAH HEVEL (The L-rd knows the thoughts of the wise that they are empty vanity). 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` So let no one boast in Bnei Adam, for all things belong to you, 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Whether Sha'ul or Apollos or Kefa or HaOlam (the world) or Chayyim (Life) or Mavet (Death) or things present or things to come; all things are yours, 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And you are Moshiachʼs and Moshiach is Hashemʼs.
