IYOV.
Chapter 35.
Elihu spoke moreover, and said: 
Thinkest thou this to be mishpat (right, just), that thou saidst: Tzidki meEl (I am cleared, in the right, justified before G-d)? 
Ki (yet) thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned? 
I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 
Look unto Shomayim, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. 
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against Him? Or if thy peysha'im be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him? 
If thou be tzaddik (righteous), what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thine yad? 
Thy resha (wickedness) may hurt an ish as thou art; and thy tzedek may profit the ben adam. 
They cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the zero'a of the rabbim. 
But none saith, Where is Eloah Osai (G-d my Maker), Who giveth zemirot balailah (songs in the night); 
Who teacheth us more than the behamot eretz, and maketh us wiser than the oph HaShomayim? 
There they cry out, but none giveth answer, because of the ga'on (pride, arrogance) of ra'im (wicked men). 
Surely El will not hear shav (vanity), neither will Shaddai regard it. 
Although thou sayest thou cannot see Him, yet Din (the court case) is before Him; therefore trust thou, waiting for Him, 
though ye say His anger does not pakad (visit, punish) anything and that He does not regard wickedness much; 
Therefore doth Iyov open his mouth hevel (in vain); he multiplieth words without da'as.
