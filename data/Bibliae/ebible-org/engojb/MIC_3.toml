:sup:`1` And I said: Hear, O Rashei Ya'akov, and ye Ketzinim of Bais Yisroel. Is it not for you to have da'as of Mishpat (Justice)? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Who hate the tov, and love the rah; who tear off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their atzamot (bones); 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Who also eat the flesh of Ami, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their atzamot, and chop them in pieces, like for the pot, and like the basar within the caldron. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Then shall they cry unto Hashem, but He will not hear them; He will even hide His face from them at that time, because of the evil way they behaved themselves in their doings. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Thus saith Hashem concerning the nevi'im that make Ami err, leading them astray, the nevi'im that bite with their teeth, and preach: Shalom! And whoever putteth nothing into their mouths, v'kiddeshu milchamah (they sanctify war) against him. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Therefore lailah shall be unto you, because of the chazon; and choshech shall come upon you because of the soothsaying, the divination; and the shemesh shall go down over the nevi'im, and hayom shall be dark over them. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Then shall the chozim (seers) be ashamed, and the kosemim (diviners) blush in bushah; yea, they shall all cover their safam (mustache); ki ein ma'aneh Elohim (for there is no answer of G-d). 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But truly I am full of ko'ach by the Ruach of Hashem, and of mishpat, and of gevurah (might), to preach unto Ya'akov his peysha, and to Yisroel his chattat. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Hear this, I pray you, ye Rashei Bais Ya'akov, and Ketzinim of Bais Yisroel, that abhor mishpat, and twist kol haYesharah (all the right, the straight). 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Boneh Tziyon b'damim (they build up Tziyon with blood), and Yerushalayim with avlah (iniquity). 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Her Rashim judge for a bribe, and her kohanim play the hireling moreh (teacher), and her nevi'im are fortune-tellers for kesef; yet will they lean upon Hashem? And say: Is not Hashem among us? No ra'ah will come upon us. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Therefore because of you, Tziyon shall be plowed as a sadeh, and Yerushalayim shall become a rubble heap, and the Har HaBeis shall become a mound of scrubs.
