DIVREY HAYAMIM BAIS.
Chapter 19.
And Yehoshaphat Melech Yehudah returned to his Bais (Palace) in shalom in Yerushalayim. 
And Yehu ben Chanani HaChozer (the Seer) went out to meet him, and said to HaMelech Yehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the rasha, and love them that hate Hashem? Therefore ketzef (wrath) is upon thee from before Hashem. 
Nevertheless there are devarim tovim (good things) found in thee, in that thou hast removed HaAsherot from HaAretz, and hast prepared thine lev to seek HaElohim. 
And Yehoshaphat dwelt in Yerushalayim; and he went out again among HaAm from Be'er-Sheva to Mt Ephrayim, and he turned them back unto Hashem Elohei Avoteihem. 
And he appointed Shofetim in HaAretz throughout all the fortified cities of Yehudah, city by city, 
And said to the Shofetim, Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for adam, but for Hashem, Who is with you in the devar mishpat (verdict). 
Wherefore now let the Pachad Hashem be upon you; be shomer and do it, for there is no avlah (injustice) with Hashem Eloheinu, nor massa panim (respect of persons), nor mikkach shochad (taking of bribes). 
Moreover in Yerushalayim did Yehoshaphat station Levi'im, and Kohanim, and Rashei HaAvot Yisroel, for the Mishpat Hashem, and for riv (disputes), and they returned to Yerushalayim. 
And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the yirat Hashem, be'emunah and with a levav shalem. 
And what riv soever shall come before you of your achim that dwell in your cities, between dahm and dahm, between torah and mitzvah, chukkot and mishpatim, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against Hashem, and so ketzef (wrath) come upon you, and upon your achim; this do, and ye shall not trespass. 
And, hinei, Amaryahu Kohen HaRosh is over you in all matters of Hashem; and Zevadyahu ben Yishmael, the Nagid of the Bais Yehudah, for all the matters of HaMelech; also the Levi'im shall be shoterim (officers) before you. Deal courageously, and Hashem be with hatov.
