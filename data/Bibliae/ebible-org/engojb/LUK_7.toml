"1" = '''
:sup:`1` When he completed all his divrei torah in the oznei haAm (ears of the people), Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach entered into K'far-Nachum. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Now a certain eved of a centurion, an eved dear to him, was having a machla (illness) and was near mavet. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And having had daas of Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, the centurion sent to him Zekenim (Elders) of the Yehudim, asking him to come and to give refuah to his eved. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And when they had come to Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach, they were earnestly entreating him, saying, He is a worthy man that you grant this for him. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For he is one of the chasidei ummot haOlam who loves our Jewish people and he built for us our shul. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was starting out on his derech with them; and when he was already not far from the bais, the centurion sent beloved re'im (friends), saying to him, Adoni, do not trouble yourself further, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof; 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you. But just say the dvar, and my eved will receive refuah. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For I too am a man placed under the yad memshalah (the governing authority), having chaiyalim (soldiers) under myself, and I say to this one, Go, and he goes, and to another, Come, and he comes, and to my eved, Do this, and he does it. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And having heard these things, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was mispoyel (deeply impressed) at him, and, having turned to the multitude following him, he said, I say to you, nowhere even in Yisroel have I found such great emunah. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And when the ones having been sent returned to the bais, they found the eved being shalem bguf (healthy). 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And it came about on the next day that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach proceeded to a shtetl called Naim, and his talmidim were traveling along with him as well as a great company of people. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Now as Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach approached the shaar of the shtetl, hinei, an ish met (dead man) was being carried out for kevurah (burial); he was the ben yachid (only son) of his Em, and she was an almanah (widow), and a considerable crowd from the shtetl was with her. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu saw her, he had rachmei shomayim (heavenly compassion) on her and said, Do not weep. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And having approached, he touched the aron met (coffin); and the bearers stood still, and he said, Bocher, to you I say, get up. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the niftar (deceased person) sat up and he began to speak, and Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach gave him to his Em (mother). 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And everyone was filled with yirat Shomayim and they were shouting, Baruch Hashem! And they were saying, A navi gadol (great prophet) is among us, and Hashem has visited His people. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And this report about him went out into all Yehudah and into all the surrounding countryside. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And Yochananʼs talmidim reported to him about all these things. And when he had summoned a certain two of his talmidim, Yochanan 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Sent them to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu, saying, Are you Hu HaBah or should we be looking for another? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And when the men had come to him, they said, Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva sent us to you, saying, Are you Hu HaBah or should we be looking for another? 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Genoi at that time Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach gave refuah to many with machlot and afflictions and ruchot raot and to many ivverim he granted sight. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And in reply he said to them, Go and tell Yochanan what you have seen. IVRIM TIRENAH, pisechim (lame persons) walk, the metzorim are cleansed, and chereshim hear, the mesim are restored to life, ANIYIM have the Besuras HaGeulah preached to them. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And ashrey is whoever does not find a michshol (stumbling block, obstacle) in me. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And when the messengers of Yochanan had departed, he began to say to the multitudes about Yochanan, What did you go out bamidbar to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in a dandyʼs soft clothing? The ones with glorious apparel are living in luxury as courtiers in the palaces. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` But what did you go out to see? A navi? Ken, I say to you, and one more than a navi. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` This one is he about whom it has been written, HINENI SHOLEIACH MALAKHI (Behold, I send my messenger) before Your face, who will prepare Your derech in front of You. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` I say to you, among those born of isha there is no one greater than Yochanan, yet he who is least in the Malchut Hashem is greater than he. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` (And when kol haAm (all the People) and the mochesim heard this, they acknowledged the Tzidkat HashemRighteousness of G-d, having been submitted to the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` But the Perushim and the Baalei HaTorah rejected the tachlis (purpose, aim) of Hashem for their lives, refusing the tevilah of teshuva of Yochanan.) 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Therefore, to what will I compare the people of hador hazeh (this generation) and what are they like? 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` They are like yeladim sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another; and they say, We played the chalil (flute) for you and you did not dance; we sang a kina (lament, funeral dirge) and you did not weep. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` For Yochanan of the tevilah of teshuva has come not eating lechem nor drinking yayin, and you say, He has a shed (demon)! 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` The Bar Enosh has come eating and drinking, and you say, Hinei, a man who is a zolel (glutton) and a shikkor (drunkard), a re'a (friend) of mochesim and chote'im. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` Yet chochmah is justified by all of her yeladim. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Now a certain one of the Perushim was requesting Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach at tish, and, he, having entered into the bais of the Parush, reclined to eat. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` And an isha (woman) was in the shtetl, an isha chotet (a woman of sin), and, when she had daas that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach reclines at tish in the bais of the Parush, she brought an alabaster flask of costly perfume. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` She stood behind him, and then she began weeping at his feet, and with her tears she began to wash the feet of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach and she was drying them with her hair, and she was kissing his feet and was anointing them with perfume. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` But when the Parush who had invited Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach saw this, he said to himself, If this one were a navi, he would have had daas who and what sort of isha is touching him, because she is an isha chotet (woman of sin). 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` And in reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Shim'on, I have something to say to you. And the Parush said, Speak, Rabbi. 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` Two persons were debtors to a certain creditor; the one owed a choiv (debt) of chamesh meot (five hundred) denarii and the other a choiv (debt) of chamishim (fifty). 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` Not being able to repay, the creditor graciously forgave both debts. Therefore which of them will have more ahavah for him? 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` In reply, Shim'on said, I suppose the one whom the creditor forgave more. And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Your judgment is gantze nachon. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` And having turned to the isha, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to Shim'on, Do you see this isha? I entered your bais, you did not give me mayim for my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her rosh. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` You did not give me neshikah (kiss), but she, from the time I entered, did not stop kissing my feet. 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` With oil my rosh (head) you did not anoint. But she with perfume anointed my feet. 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` Oib azoi (consequently), I say to you, her chatta'im, which are many, have been granted selicha (forgiven), for with rabbah ahavah she loved. But he who is mekabel selicha (accepting forgiveness) only a little, has ahavah only a little. 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` And he said to her, Your averos have been granted selicha. 
'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` And the ones reclining at tish with Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach began to say to themselves, Who is this who even grants selicha to averos? 
'''
"50" = '''
:sup:`50` And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to the isha, Your emunah has gained you Yeshu'at Eloheinu. L'chi l'shalom (Go in shalom!).
