'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Hashem hath appeared of old unto me, saying: Yes, I have loved thee with an ahavat olam; therefore with chesed have I drawn thee. 
'''
"3" = '''

'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Thou shalt yet plant keramim upon the hills of Shomron; the planters shall plant, and shall put the fruit to ordinary use.

:sup:`6` For thus saith Hashem: Sing with simcha for Ya'akov, and shout among the Rosh HaGoyim; publish ye, hallelu (praise ye), and say: Hashem, save Thy people, the She'erit Yisroel (the Remnant of Israel). 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Hineni, I will bring them from the eretz tzafon (land of the north), and gather them from the ends of ha'aretz, and with them the ivver (blind) and the pise'ach (lame), the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together; a Kahal Gadol shall return here. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` They shall come with weeping, and with techinnunim will I lead them back; I will cause them to walk by the nachalei mayim (streams of water) in a derech yashar (straight road), wherein they shall not stumble; for I am an Av to Yisroel, and Ephrayim is My bechor. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Hear the Devar Hashem, O ye Goyim, and preach it in the farthest shores, and say: He that scattered Yisroel will gather Yisroel, and He shall be shomer over Yisroel, like a Ro'eh over the Eder thereof.

'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Therefore they shall come and sing on the height of Tziyon, and shall stream to the Tuv Hashem(Bounty, Goodness of Hashem), for dagan (grain), and for tirosh (new wine) and for yitzhar (pure olive oil) and for the young of the tzon and of the herd; and their nefesh shall be like a well-watered gan (garden); and they shall not sorrow any more at all. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then shall the betulah rejoice in the machol (dance), both bocherim (young men) and zekenim together; for I will turn their evel (mourning) into sasson (joy), and will comfort them, and make them have simcha from their sorrow.

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Surely after I turned away, I made teshuva; and after I was instructed, I beat upon my yarech (thigh); I was ashamed, yes, even humiliated, because nasati cherpat neurai (I did bear, carry the reproach, disgrace of my youth). 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Is Ephrayim My ben yakir (dear son)? Is he a yeled in whom I delight? For though I spoke rebuke of him, I do earnestly remember him still; therefore My heart yearns for him; I will surely have rachamim (mercy) upon him, 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Set thee up tziyyunim (roadmarks, road signs), make thee tamurim (guideposts); set thine lev upon the highway, even the derech thou art now walking; turn back, O Betulat Yisroel, turn back to these thy towns. 
'''

'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Yisroel: Once again they shall use this saying in Eretz Yehudah and in the towns thereof, when I shall turn them back from their captivity; Yevarechecha Adonoi, neveh tzedek, har hakodesh (may Hashem bless thee, O Righteous Abode, O Har HaKodesh)! 
'''

'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And it shall come to pass, that just as I watched over them, to uproot, and to tear down, and to overthrow, and to destroy, and to bring catastrophe; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith Hashem. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` In those days they shall say no more: The Avot have eaten the sour grape, and the shinayim (teeth) of the Banim are set on edge. 
'''
"29" = '''

'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` But this shall be the Brit that I will cut with Bais Yisroel; After those days, saith Hashem, I will set My Torah in them inwardly, and I will write ketuvim on their hearts; and I will be their Elohim, and they shall be My People. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` And they shall teach no more every ish his re'a (neighbor), and every ish his brother, saying, Know Hashem; for they shall all have da'as of Me, from the katon of them unto the gadol of them, saith Hashem; for I will forgive their avon, and I will remember their chattat no more. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Thus saith Hashem, which giveth the shemesh for an ohr by day, and the chukkot yarei'ach and chukkot kokhavim for an ohr by night, which stirreth up the sea when the waves thereof roar; Hashem Tzva'os is Shmo: 
'''
"35" = '''

'''
"36" = '''
