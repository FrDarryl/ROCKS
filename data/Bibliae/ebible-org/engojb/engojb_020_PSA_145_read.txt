TEHILLIM.
Chapter 145.
(Tehillah of Dovid) 1Alef I will extol Thee, Elohai HaMelech; and I will bless Thy Shem l'olam va'ed. 
Beis Kol yom will I bless Thee; and I will praise Thy Shem l'olam va'ed. 
Gimel Gadol is Hashem, and me'od to be praised; and His greatness is not cheker (searchable). 
Dalet Dor l'dor (generation to generation) shall praise Thy ma'asim, and shall declare Thy gevurot (mighty acts). 
Heh I will speak of the hadar kavod of Thy hod, and of Thy nifle'ot (wonderful works). 
Vav And men shall speak of the power of Thy norot; and I will declare Thy greatness. 
Zayin They shall utter the zekher (memory, recollection) of Thy rav tov and shall sing of Thy tzedakah. 
Chet Channun (gracious) is Hashem, and full of compassion; erech apayim (slow to anger), and of great chesed. 
Tet Tov is Hashem to all; and His rachamim is over all His ma'asim. 
Yod All Thy ma'asim shall praise Thee, Hashem; and Thy chasidim shall bless Thee. 
Khaf They shall speak of the kavod of Thy Malchus, and tell of Thy gevurah; 
Lamed To make known to the Bnei HaAdam His gevurah, and the kavod hadar of His Malchus. 
Mem Thy Malchus is a Malchus kol olamim, and Thy Memshelet for kol dor vador. 
SamekhHashem upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down. 
Ayin The eyes of all look to Thee; and Thou givest them their okhel (food) in its season. 
Peh Thou openest Thine Yad, and satisfiest the ratzon of kol chai. 
Tzadi Tzaddik is Hashem in all His drakhim, and chasid in all His ma'asim, 
Koph Karov (near) is Hashem unto all them that call upon Him, to all that call upon Him in emes. 
Resh He will fulfil the ratzon of them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and will save them. 
Shin Shomer is Hashem over all them that love Him; but kol haresha'im will He destroy. 
Tav My mouth shall speak the tehillat Hashem; and let kol basar bless His Shem Kodesh l'olam va'ed. Praise Hashem.
