TEHILLIM.
Chapter 143.
(Mizmor of Dovid) 1 Hear my tefillah, Hashem, give ear to my techinot (supplications); in Thy emunah answer me, and in Thy tzedakah. 
And enter not into mishpat with Thy eved; for in Thy sight shall no man living be yitzadak (justified). 
For the oyev (enemy) hath persecuted my nefesh; he hath struck down my life to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in places of choshech (darkness), like metei olam (those long dead). 
Therefore is my ruach become faint within me; my lev within me is desolate. 
I remember yamim mikedem (days of old), I meditate on all Thy works; I muse on the ma'aseh (work) of Thy hands. 
I stretch forth my hands unto Thee; my nefesh thirsteth after Thee, like an eretz ayefah (a parched, thirsty land). Selah 
Hear me speedily, Hashem; my ruach faileth; hide not Thy face from me, lest I be like those that go down into the bor (pit). 
Cause me to hear Thy chesed in the boker; for in Thee do I trust; cause me to know the Derech wherein I should walk; for I lift up my nefesh unto Thee. 
Save me, Hashem, from mine oyevim (enemies); I flee unto Thee to hide me. 
Teach me to do Retzonecha (Thy will); for Thou art Elohai; may Thy Ruach Tov lead me on level ground. 
Revive me, Hashem, l'ma'an (for the sake of) Thy Shem (Name); in Thy tzedakah bring my nefesh out of tzoros. 
And in Thy chesed silence mine enemies, and destroy all them that oppress my nefesh; for I am Thy eved.
