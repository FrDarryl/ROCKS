TEHILLIM.
Chapter 137.
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yes, we wept, when we remembered Tziyon. 
We hung up our kinnorot (lyres) upon the willows in the midst thereof. 
For there they that carried us away captive required of us a shir (song); and they that tormented us required of us simchah, saying, Sing us one of the Shir Tziyon. 
How shall we sing Shir Hashem in an admat nekhar (foreign land). 
If I forget thee, O Yerushalayim, let my yamin (right hand) forget. 
If I do not remember thee, let my leshon cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Yerushalayim above my rosh simchah (chief joy). 
Remember, Hashem, the Bnei Edom in the Yom Yerushalayim; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the yesod (foundation) thereof. 
O Bat Bavel, who art to be destroyed, ashrei shall he be, that repayeth thee the gemul thou hast done to us. 
Ashrei shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy olalim against the sela.
