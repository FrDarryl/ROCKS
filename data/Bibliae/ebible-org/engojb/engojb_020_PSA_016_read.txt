TEHILLIM.
Chapter 16.
(A mikhtam of Dovid) 1 Be shomer over me, O El: for in Thee do I hide myself. 
I said unto Hashem, Thou art Adonoi of me; besides Thee I have no good. 
But to the Kedoshim that are in ha'aretz, they are the glorious ones, in whom is all my delight. 
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after other g-ds; their nesakhim (drink offerings) of dahm will I not offer, nor take up their shmot (names) on my lips. 
Hashem is the chelek (allotted share) of mine inheritance and of my kos (cup); Thou maintainest my goral (lot, allotment by the divine will). 
The boundary lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly nachalah (inheritance). 
I will bless Hashem, Who hath given me counsel; my mind also instructs me in the night seasons. 
I have set Hashem always before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken. 
Therefore my lev is glad, and my kavod rejoiceth; my basar also shall dwell securely. 
For Thou wilt not abandon my nefesh in Sheol; neither wilt Thou allow Thine Chasid to see shachat (corruption, the pit, the grave, the abyss of corruption). 
Thou wilt show me the Orach Chayyim (the path of life); in Thy presence is fulness of joy, at Thy right hand there are pleasures netzach (for evermore).
