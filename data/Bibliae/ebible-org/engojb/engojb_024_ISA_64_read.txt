YESHAYAH.
Chapter 64.
As eish burneth brushwood, eish causeth the mayim to boil, O, that Thou wouldst come down to make Thy Shem known to Thine adversaries, that the Goyim might tremble at Thy presence! 
When Thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, Thou camest down, the harim shook at Thy presence. 
For me'olam (since ancient times) no one hath heard, nor perceived by the ozen, neither hath the ayin seen any Elohim besides Thee, Who acts on behalf of him that waiteth for Him. 
Thou meetest with him that rejoiceth to work tzedek, those that remember Thee in Thy drakhim; see, Thou art in wrath; for we have been in sins; in them a long time, and shall we be saved? 
But we are all as the tameh (unclean thing), and kol tzidkoteinu (all our righteousness, our righteous deeds, works) are like beged iddim (filthy rags, a garment of menstruation); and we all do fade like the aleh (leaf); and avoneinu (our iniquities), like the ruach, have taken us away. 
And there is none that calleth upon Thy Shem, that stirreth up himself to take hold of Thee; for Thou hast hid Thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of avoneinu. 
But now, Hashem, Thou art Avinu (Our Father); we are the chomer (clay), and Thou, Yotzreinu (our Potter, Maker, Creator); and we all are the ma'aseh (work) of Thy yad. 
Be not in wrath ad me'od, Hashem, neither remember avon forever; behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all Thy people. 
Arei Kadsheicha (Thy holy cities) are a midbar, Tziyon is a midbar, Yerushalayim, a desolation. 
Beis Kadsheinu v'Tifarteinu, where Avoteinu praised Thee, is burned up with eish; and kol machamadeinu (all our desiring) is in ruins. 
Wilt Thou refrain Thyself after these things, Hashem? Wilt Thou hold Thy peace, and afflict us ad me'od?
