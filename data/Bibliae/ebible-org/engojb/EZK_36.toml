:sup:`1` Also, thou Ben Adam, prophesy unto the harim of Yisroel, and say, Ye harim of Yisroel hear the Devar Hashem. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Because the oyev hath said against you, Aha, even the bamot olam (ancient heights) are ours in possession, 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Because they have made you desolate, and crushed you on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the she'erit HaGoyim, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are slandered by the people: 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Therefore, ye harim of Yisroel, hear the Devar Adonoi Hashem: Thus saith Adonoi Hashem to the harim, and to the geva'ot, to the ravines, and to the ge'ayot, to desolate ruins, to towns deserted which became a plunder and mockery to the she'erit HaGoyim that are all around; 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Surely in the eish of My kina have I spoken against the she'erit HaGoyim, and against all Edom, which have given My land into their possession with simchat kol levav, with she'at nefesh (scorn of soul, contempt), as her migrash for plunder. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Prophesy therefore concerning Admat Yisroel, and say unto the harim, and to the geva'ot (hills), to the ravines, and to the ge'ayot (valleys), Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Hineni, I have spoken in My kina (jealousy) and in My chemah (fury), because ye have borne the scorn of the Goyim; 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem; I have lifted up Mine yad in oath-taking, Surely the Goyim that are around you, they shall bear their own scorn. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But ye, O harim of Yisroel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your p'ri to My people Yisroel; for their return home is at hand. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For, hineni, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be plowed and sown; 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And I will multiply adam upon you, kol Bais Yisroel, even all of it; and the towns shall be inhabited, and the ruins shall be rebuilt; 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And I will multiply upon you adam and behemah; and they shall increase and become numerous; and I will make you inhabited as in former times, and I will make you more prosperous than before; and ye shall know that I am Hashem. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Indeed, I will cause adam to walk upon you, even My people Yisroel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their nachalah, and thou shalt no more again bereave them of their children. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Because they say unto you, Thou art a land which devourest adam, and hast bereaved thy nation of children; 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Therefore thou shalt devour adam no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the taunts of the Goyim any more, neither shalt thou bear the cherpah of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying, 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Ben adam, when Bais Yisroel dwelt in their own land, they made it tameh by their own derech and by their doings; their derech was before Me as the tumat haniddah (contamination of a woman during her menstrual period). 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Therefore I poured My chemah upon them for their shefach dahm upon ha'aretz, for their gillulim wherewith they had made it tameh; 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And I scattered them among the Goyim, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their derech and according to their doings I judged them. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And when they entered unto the Goyim, to where they went, they profaned Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name), when they said to them, These are the Am Hashem, and are gone forth out of His land. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` But I had concern for Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name), which Bais Yisroel had profaned among the Goyim, where they went. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Therefore say unto Bais Yisroel, thus saith Adonoi Hashem: I do not this for your sakes, O Bais Yisroel, but for the sake of Shem Kodshi, which ye have profaned among Goyim where ye went. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And I will show as kodesh My Shem HaGadol, which was profaned among the Goyim, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the Goyim shall know that I am Hashem, saith Adonoi Hashem, when I shall be set apart as kodesh in you before their eynayim. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For I will take you from among the Goyim, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own adamah (land). 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Then will I sprinkle mayim tehorim upon you, and ye shall be tahor; from all your tum'a, and from all your gillulim (idols), will I make you tahor. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` A lev chadash also will I give you, and a ruach chadashah will I put within you; and I will take away the lev haeven (stony heart) out of your basar, and I will give you a lev basar. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And I will put My Ruach within you, and cause you to walk in My chukkot, and ye shall be shomer over My mishpatim, and do them. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And ye shall dwell in ha'aretz that I gave to avoteichem; and ye shall be My people, and I will be your Elohim. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` I will also save you from all your tumot (unclean-nesses); and I will call for the dagan (grain), and will increase it, and lay no ra'av (famine) upon you. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And I will multiply the p'ri ha'etz, and the increase of the sadeh, that ye shall receive no more cherpah of ra'av (famine) among the Goyim. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Then shall ye remember your own drakhim ra'im, and your doings that were not tovim, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your avonot and for your to'avot. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` Not for your sakes do I this, saith Adonoi Hashem, be it known unto you; be ashamed and humiliated for your own drakhim, O Bais Yisroel. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Thus saith Adonoi Hashem; In the day that I shall have made you tahor from all your avonot, I will also cause you to resettle the towns, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay shemamah (desolate) in the sight of all that passed by. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like Gan Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined towns are become fortified, and are inhabited. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Then the Goyim that are left all around you shall know that I Hashem rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that that was desolate; I Hashem have spoken it, and I will do it. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Also I will be inquired of by Bais Yisroel, to act in behalf of them; I will increase them adam as numberous as tzon. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` As the tzon kadashim, as the tzon Yerushalayim in her mo'adim, so shall the ruined cities be filled with tzon adam; and they shall know that I am Hashem.
