TEHILLIM.
Chapter 141.
(Mizmor of Dovid) 1Hashem, I cry unto Thee; make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto Thee. 
Let my tefillah be set forth before Thee like ketoret; and the lifting up of my hands as the minchat erev. 
Be shomer, Hashem, over my mouth; guard the door of my lips. 
Let not my lev incline to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties. 
Let the tzaddik strike me; it shall be chesed; and let him reprove me; it shall be shemen, which my rosh shall not refuse; for still shall my tefillah be against their evil deeds. 
Their shofetim are overthrown in stony places; they hear my words; for they are pleasant. 
Atzameinu (our bones) are scattered at the mouth of Sheol, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon ha'aretz. 
But mine eyes are unto Thee, Hashem Adonoi; in Thee do I take refuge; leave not my nefesh defenseless. 
Keep me from the pach (snare, trap) which they have laid for me, and the traps of the workers of iniquity. 
Let the resha'im fall into their own nets, while I escape safely.
