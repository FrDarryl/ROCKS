:sup:`2` Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the aphar (dust), and made thee nagid over My people Yisroel; and thou hast walked in the derech Yarov'am, and hast caused My people Yisroel to sin, to provoke Me to anger with their chattot; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Hineni, I will sweep away after Ba'asha, and after his Bais; and I will make thy Bais like the Bais Yarov'am Ben Nevat.

'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` So Ba'asha slept with his avot, and was buried in Tirtzah: and Elah Bno reigned as Melech in his place. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And also by the yad HaNavi Yehu Ben Chanani came the Devar Hashem against Ba'asha, and against his Bais, even for all ra'ah that he did in the eyes of Hashem, in provoking Him to anger by the ma'aseh (work) of his hands, in becoming like the Bais Yarov'am; and because he struck it.

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his kesher that he plotted, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei HaYamim L'Malkhei Yisroel?

'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But Omri wrought rah in the eyes of Hashem, and did sin more than all that were before him. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` For he walked in all the derech Yarov'am Ben Nevat, and in his chattat wherewith he made Yisroel to sin, to provoke Hashem Elohei Yisroel to anger with their havalim (vanities, nothingnesses), 
'''
"27" = '''
