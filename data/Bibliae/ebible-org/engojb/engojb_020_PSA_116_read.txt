TEHILLIM.
Chapter 116.
I love Hashem, because He hath heard my kol (voice), even my techinnah. 
Because He hath inclined His ozen (ear) unto me, therefore will I call upon Him while I have days. 
Chevlei mavet (pangs of death) encompassed me, and the metzarei She'ol (confines, straitnesses of She'ol)  have caught up with me and found me; tzoros and yagon (sorrow) I found. 
Then called I b'Shem Hashem: O Hashem, save my nefesh! 
Channun (gracious) is Hashem, and tzaddik; yes, Eloheinu is merciful. 
Hashem is shomer over the petayim (simple-hearted, helpless); I was in need and li yehoshia (me He saved). 
Return, my nefesh, to thy menuchah (rest, resting place); for Hashem hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
For Thou hast saved my nefesh from mavet (death), mine eye from dimah (tears), and mine regel (foot) from stumbling. 
I will walk before Hashem in the Artzot HaChayim (the Land of the Living). 
He'emaneti (I believed); therefore have I spoken; I was greatly afflicted. 
I said in my chafaz (haste, alarm, consternation), Kol HaAdam Kozev (all men are liars). 
How shall I repay Hashem for all His benefits to me? 
I will raise the Kos Yeshu'ot (the Cup of Salvation), and call upon Hashem b'Shem (by Name). 
I will fulfill my nederim (vows) unto Hashem now in the presence of all His people. 
Precious in the eyes of Hashem is the mavet of His Chasidim. 
O Hashem, truly I am Thy eved; I am Thy eved, ben amatecha (the son of Thy maid servant); Thou hast removed my chains. 
I will sacrifice to Thee the zevach todah (the thanksgiving offering) and will call on the Shem Hashem. 
I will fulfill my nederim to Hashem now in the presence of all His people. 
In the khatzerot Beis Hashem, in the midst of thee, O Yerushalayim. Praise ye Hashem.
