TEHILLIM.
Chapter 82.
(Mizmor of Asaph) 1 Elohim standeth in the Adat El; He judgeth among the elohim. 
Ad mosai (How long) will ye judge unjustly, and show partiality to the resha'im? Selah 
Defend the poor and yatom (fatherless); do justice to the oni (afflicted) and needy. 
Deliver the poor and needy; rid them out of the yad resha'im. 
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in choshech; all the foundations of ha'aretz are shaken. 
I have said, elohim ye are; and all of you are Bnei HaElyon. 
But ye shall die like adam, and fall like one of the sarim (princes). 
Arise, Elohim, judge ha'aretz; for Thou shalt inherit kol HaGoyim.
