ESTHER.
Chapter 10.
And HaMelech Achashverosh laid a tribute upon the land, even to its distant shores. 
And all the acts of his authority and of his might, and the parashat gedulat Mordechai (full account of the greatness of Mordechai), whereunto HaMelech advanced him, are they not written in the sefer of the divrei hayamim of the kings of Media and Persia? 
For Mordechai HaYehudi was next unto HaMelech Achashverosh, and gadol among the Yehudim, and esteemed of the multitude of his achim, seeking the tov of his people, and speaking shalom to all their zera.
