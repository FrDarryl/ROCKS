"6" = '''

"9" = '''

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And he said, Chalilah! (be it far from me), Hashem, that I should do this! Is not this the dahm of the anashim that went in jeopardy of their nafshot? Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three gibborim,

"18" = '''

'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And he slaughtered an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a khanit (spear) in his yad; but he went down to him with a shevet (club), and plucked the khanit out of the Egyptian ºs yad, and slaughtered him with his own khanit.
