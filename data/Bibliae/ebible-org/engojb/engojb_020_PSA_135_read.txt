TEHILLIM.
Chapter 135.
Praise Hashem. 1 Halelu Shem Hashem; Halelu, O ye avadim of Hashem. 
Ye that stand ministering in the Beis Hashem, in the khatzerot Beis Eloheinu. 
Praise Hashem; for Hashem is tov; sing praise unto Shmo; for it is na'im (lovely, pleasing). 
For Hashem hath chosen Ya'akov unto Himself, and Yisroel for His segullah (peculiar treasure). 
For I know that Hashem is gadol, and that Adoneinu is above kol elohim. 
Whatsoever Hashem pleases, that He does in Shomayim, and in HaAretz, in HaYam, and kol tehomot. 
He causeth the clouds to ascend at the end of HaAretz; He maketh lightning for the matar (rain); He bringeth the ruach out of His otzarot. 
Who struck down the Bechorei Mitzrayim, both of adam and behemah. 
Who sent otot and mofetim into the midst of thee, O Mitzrayim, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his avadim. 
Who struck down Goyim rabbim, and slaughtered melachim atzumim (powerful kings); 
Sichon Melech HaEmori, and Og Melech HaBashan, and all the mamlechot Kena'an; 
And gave their land for a nachalah, an inheritance unto Yisroel Amo (His people). 
Thy Shem, Hashem, endureth l'olam; and Thy remembrance, Hashem, l'dor vador. 
For Hashem will vindicate His people; He will have compassion on His avadim. 
The idols of the Goyim are kesef and zahav, the ma'aseh yedei adam. 
They have mouths, but they speak not; einayim have they, but they see not; 
They have oznayim, but they hear not; neither is there any ruach in their mouths. 
They that oseihem (make them) will be like them; so is every one that trusteth in them. 
Barakhu Hashem, O Bais Yisroel; barakhu Hashem, O Bais Aharon; 
Barakhu Hashem, O Bais HaLevi; ye that fear Hashem, barakhu Hashem. 
Baruch Hashem out of Tziyon, which dwelleth at Yerushalayim. Praise Hashem.
