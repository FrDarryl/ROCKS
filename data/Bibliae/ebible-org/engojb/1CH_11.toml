:sup:`1` Then kol Yisroel gathered themselves to Dovid unto Chevron, saying, Hinei, we are thy etzem (bone) and thy basar. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And moreover in time past, even when Sha'ul was melech, thou wast he that hamotzi (led out) and brought in Yisroel; and Hashem Eloheicha said unto thee, Thou shalt shepherd My people Yisroel, and thou shalt be Nagid over My people Yisroel. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Therefore came all the Ziknei Yisroel to HaMelech to Chevron; and Dovid cut a Brit with them in Chevron before Hashem; and vayimeshechu (they anointed) Dovid Melech over Yisroel, according to the Devar Hashem by Shmuel.

'''
"5" = '''

'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Dovid said, Whosoever attacketh the Yevusi barishonah shall be Rosh and Sar. So Yoav Ben Tzeruyah went up first, and became Rosh.

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And he built the Ir around it, even from the Millo to the surrounding area, and Yoav repaired the rest of the Ir.

"12" = '''

'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` He was with Dovid at Pas Dammim, and there the Pelishtim (Philistines) were gathered together to battle, where was chelekat hasadeh (a parcel of ground) full of se'orim (barley); and HaAm (the people, troops, army) fled from before the Pelishtim (Philistines). 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And they set themselves in the midst of that chelekah (parcel), and delivered it, and slaughtered the Pelishtim (Philistines); vayosha Hashem(and Hashemsaved) them by a teshu'ah gedolah (great deliverance). 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Now three of the sheloshim rosh went down to the Tzur to Dovid, into the me'arah (cave) of Adullam; and the machaneh of the Pelishtim (Philistines) encamped in the Emek Repha'im.

"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And Dovid was then in the Metzudah, and the garrison of the Pelishtim was then at Beit-Lechem. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And Dovid had a thirsty longing, and said, Oh that one would draw for me drink of the mayim from the bor (well) of Beit-Lechem, that is at the sha'ar (gate). 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And the Shlosha broke through the machaneh Pelishtim (Philistines), and drew mayim out of the bor Beit-Lechem, that was by the sha'ar, and took it, and brought it to Dovid; but Dovid would not drink of it, but poured it out to Hashem. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And said, Chalilah li meElohai (Elohai forbid it me), that I should do this thing. Shall I drink the dahm of these anashim at their nafshot? For at jeopardy of their nafshot they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these Shloshet HaGibborim. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And Avishai the brother of Yoav, he was Rosh HaSheloshah; for lifting up his khanit against Shlosh Me'ot, he slaughtered them, and had a shem among the Shloshah. 
'''
"21" = '''

'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And he slaughtered the ish HaMitzri, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the yad HaMitzri was a khanit like a rod of an oreg (weaver); and he went down to him with a shevet (club), and plucked the khanit out of the yad HaMitzri, and slaughtered him with his own khanit.
