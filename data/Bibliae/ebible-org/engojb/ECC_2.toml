"1" = '''
:sup:`1` I said in mine lev, Come now, I will test thee with simchah, therefore enjoy tov; and, hinei, this also is hevel. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` I said of laughter, It is mad; and of simchah, What doeth it accomplish? 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` I searched in mine lev to draw my basar on with yayin, my mind guiding me with chochmah; and to lay hold on sichlut (folly), till I might see what was tov for bnei haAdam, which they should do under Shomayim all the few days of their life. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` I undertook me great works; I built me batim (houses); I planted me kramim (vineyards); 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` I made me ganot (gardens) and parks, and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` I made me reservoirs of mayim, to water therewith the forest of trees tzomeiach (sprouting up); 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` I bought me avadim and shfakhot, and had bnei bayit (avadim born in my bais); also I had great possessions of herds and tzon more than all that were in Yerushalayim before me; 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` I amassed for me also kesef and zahav, and the treasure of melachim and of the provinces; I acquired for me men singers and women singers, and the delights of bnei haAdam, musical instruments of all kinds. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` So I was great, and excelled more than all that were before me in Yerushalayim; also my chochmah remained with me. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my lev from any simchah; for my lev rejoiced in all my amal (labor); and this was my chelek (portion) for all my amal. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Then I looked on kol ma'asim that my hands had wrought, and on the amal that I had labored to do; and, hinei, all was hevel and chasing after ruach, and there was no profit under the shemesh. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And I turned myself to consider chochmah, and holelot, and sichlut; for what can the adam do who cometh after HaMelech? Even that which hath been done already. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Then I saw that chochmah excelleth sichlut, as far as ohr excelleth choshech. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` The chacham (wise man) hath eyes in his rosh; but the kesil (fool) walketh in choshech; but I myself perceived also that the same mikreh (fortune) happeneth to them all. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Then said I in my lev, As the mikreh befalls the kesil, so also will the same mikreh befall me; and wherein have I then been of more chochmah? Then I said in my lev, This also is hevel. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For no zichron (remembrance) of the chacham — no less the kesil — remains l'olam; seeing that in hayamim haba'im (the days to come) all shall be forgotten. How can the chacham die just like the kesil? 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Therefore I hated HaChayyim (Life); because the ma'aseh that is wrought under the shemesh is grievous unto me; for all is hevel and chasing after ruach. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Yea, I hated all my amal for which I had toiled under the shemesh; because I must leave it unto the adam that shall occupy my place after me. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And who hath da'as whether he shall be a chacham or a kesil? Nevertheless shall he have shlitah (control, authority) over all my amal for which I have toiled, and have poured out my chochmah under the shemesh. This also is hevel. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Therefore I turned aside to give up my lev to despair over all the wearisome amal with which I toiled under the shemesh. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For there is an adam whose amal is with chochmah, and da'as, and kishron (skill); yet to an adam that hath not worked for it he must leave it for his chelek. This also is hevel and a ra'ah rabbah. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For what hath adam for all his amal, and for all the striving of his lev, wherein he hath labored under the shemesh? 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For all his yamim are machovim (sorrows), and his travail ka'as (grief, vexation); yea, his lev taketh not rest balailah. This also is hevel. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` There is nothing better for adam, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his nefesh find satisfaction in his amal. Also this I saw; even this was from the Yad HaElohim. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` For who can eat, or who can find enjoyment without Hashem? 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` For to the adam that is pleasing in His sight, Hashem gives chochmah, and da'as, and simchah; but to the choteh (sinner)Hashem giveth travail; Hashem giveth the work of gathering and storing up, that Hashem may give to him that pleases HaElohim. This also is hevel and chasing after ruach.
