TEHILLIM.
Chapter 17.
(Tefillah of Dovid) 1 Hear the tzedek (righteous plea of a just cause), Hashem, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my tefillah, that goeth not out of lips of mirmah (deceit). 
Let my mishpat (right) come forth from Thy presence; let Thine eyes behold the things that are right. 
Thou hast probed mine lev; Thou hast visited me in the lailah; Thou hast tested me and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 
Concerning the works of men, by the Devar of Thy lips I have kept myself from the paths of the cruel. 
Uphold my goings in Thy paths, that my footsteps stumble not. 
I have called upon Thee, for Thou wilt hear me, O El; incline Thine ear unto me, and hear my prayer. 
Show Thy marvellous chesed, O Thou Moshi'a Who saves by Thy right hand them which put their trust in Thee from those that rise up against them. 
Be shomer over me as the apple of Thy eye; hide me in the shadow of Thy wings, 
From the resha'im that oppress me, from my deadly enemies threatening my nefesh, who surround me. 
They have closed up callously and mercilessly against me; with their mouth they speak with ge'ut (pride). 
At every step they have surrounded me; their purpose is to strike down to ha'aretz; 
Like aryeh eager to tear his prey, and like a young lion lurking in ambush. 
Arise, Hashem, confront him, cast him down; deliver my nefesh from the resha with Thy cherev; 
From men with Thy yad, Hashem, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and with Thy treasures Thou fillest their belly; they are satisfied with children, and leave their abundance to their babes. 
As for me, in tzedek I will behold Thy face; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy temunah (form).
