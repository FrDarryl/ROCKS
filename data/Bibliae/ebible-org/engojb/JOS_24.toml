"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And Yehoshua said unto Kol HaAm, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Avoteichem dwelt on the other side of the River long ago, even Terach, Avi Avraham, and Avi Nachor: and they served elohim acherim.

'''
"4" = '''

'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And when they cried unto Hashem, He put darkness between you and the Mitzrayim, and brought the yam upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Mitzrayim; and ye dwelt in the midbar yamim rabbim. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And I brought you into the Eretz HaEmori, the ones dwelling on the other side of the Yarden; they fought against you; I gave them into your yad, that ye might possess their land; I destroyed them from before you.

:sup:`9` Then Balak ben Tzippor Melech Moav arose and warred against Yisroel, and sent and summoned Balaam ben Be'or to curse you;

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And I sent the tzirah (hornet) before you, which drove them out ahead of you, even the two melachim of the Emori; but not with thy cherev, nor with thy keshet.

'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And if it seem rah unto you to serve Hashem, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the elohim which Avoteichem served that were on the other side of the River, or the elohei HaEmori, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my bais, we will serve Hashem.

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And Hashem drove out from before us Kol HaAmim, even HaEmori which dwelt in HaAretz; therefore will we also serve Hashem; for He is Eloheinu. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And Yehoshua said unto HaAm, Ye are not able to serve Hashem; for He is an Elohim Kedoshim; He is an El Kanno (jealous G-d); He will not forgive your paysha'im nor your chattot.

'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And Yehoshua said unto kol HaAm, Hinei, this Even (Stone) shall be as an edah (witness) unto us; for it hath heard all the words of Hashem which He spoke unto us; it shall be therefore as an edah (witness) unto you, lest ye are untrue to Eloheichem.
