"1" = '''
:sup:`1` In that day shall this shir (song) be sung in Eretz Yehudah: We have an Ir Oz (a city of strength); Yeshu'ah (salvation) is that which He makes its chomot (walls) and outer wall. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Open ye the She'arim, that the Goy Tzaddik (right-with-G-d people) which is shomer emunim (keeping faith) may enter in. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Thou wilt keep him in shalom shalom, whose yetzer (mind-set) is stayed on Thee; because he trusteth in Thee. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Trust ye in Hashem forever; for in G-d Hashem is Tzur Olamin; 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For He bringeth down them that dwell on marom (high); the lofty city, He layeth it low; He layeth it low, even ad eretz; He bringeth it even to aphar (dust). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` The regel (foot) shall trample it down, even the feet of the oni (oppressed), and the footsteps of the dalim (poor, downtrodden, needy). 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` The Orakh Latzaddik (way of the just) is meiysharim (altogether level, upright, direct ones); Thou, O Yashar (Upright One, Straight One), straighten the ma'agal (circuit) of the tzaddik. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Indeed, in the orakh of Thy mishpatim, Hashem, have we waited for Thee; our ta'avat nefesh (yearning of soul) is for Thy Shem, and for the zekher (memory, remembrance) of Thee. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` With my nefesh have I desired thee in the lailah; yes, with my ruach within me will I seek Thee; for when Thy mishpatim are upon ha'aretz, the inhabitants of the tevel will learn tzedek. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Let grace be shown to the rasha, yet he will not learn tzedek; in the Eretz Nekhochot (Land of Straightforwardness) he will deal unjustly, and will not regard the ge'ut Hashem(majesty, exaltedness of Hashem). 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Hashem, when Thy Yad (hand, power) is lifted up, they will not see; but let them see and be ashamed of their kinat Am (envy of G-d ºs people); indeed, the eish of Thine enemies shall devour them. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Hashem, Thou wilt ordain shalom for us; for Thou also hast wrought all our ma'asim (works, deeds) in us. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Hashem Eloheinu, other adonim besides Thee have had dominion over us; but by Thee only do we keep Thy Shem in remembrance. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` They are mesim (dead ones), they shall not live; they are refa'im (dead ones), they shall not rise; therefore Thou hast visited and destroyed them, and made all their zekher (memory) to perish. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Thou hast increased the Goy (nation, people), Hashem, Thou hast increased the Goy; Thou hast gained glory; Thou hadst extended all the borders of the Eretz. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Hashem, in tzoros have they visited Thee, they davened a lachash (whisper) when Thy musar (chastening) was upon them. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Like a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, in travail, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in Thy sight, Hashem. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth ruach (wind); we have not wrought yeshu'ot (salvation of any kind) in Eretz; neither have inhabitants of the tevel (world) been born. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Thy mesim(dead men) shall live, together with my nevelah (dead bodies, corpses) shall they arise. Awake and sing for joy, ye that dwell in aphar (dust); for Thy tal (dew) is like the orot tal (morning dew), and Eretz shall give birth to repha'im (dead ones). 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Come, My people, enter thou into thy chederim, and shut thy delatot behind thee; hide thyself for a little rega (moment, while), until the za'am (wrath, indignation of G-d) has passed. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For, hinei, Hashem goeth forth from His Makom (place, home) to punish the avon (iniquity) of inhabitants of ha'aretz; ha'aretz also shall disclose her dahm, and shall no more cover over her slain.
