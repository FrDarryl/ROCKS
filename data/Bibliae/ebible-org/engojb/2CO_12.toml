"1" = '''
:sup:`1` It is necessary for me to boast, nothing gained by it, yet I now come to marot (visions) and chazonot (revelations) of Adoneinu. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` I have da'as of a man in Moshiach arba esreh shanah (fourteen years) before, whether in or out of the basar I do not have da'as, Hashem knows — such a man was snatched up and raptured to the raki'a haShlishi of Shomayim. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And I have da'as that such a man, whether in or out of the basar I do not have da'as, Hashem knows, 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` That he was caught away into Gan-Eden and heard inexpressible devarim which to utter such words Bnei Adam have no heter (permit). 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` But if I desire to boast, I will not be a yold (fool) for I will speak HaEmes; but I spare you, lest anyone gives me credit beyond what he sees in me or hears in me. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Therefore, lest I should be too exalted especially by the excess of my chazonot, there was given to me a kotz (thorn, splinter) in my basar, a malach of HaSatan, for the purpose of using his fists on me, lest I should be too exalted. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` I davened shalosh pe'amim, calling upon Adoneinu that it might depart from me. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And HaAdon said to me, “My Chesed is ad kahn (sufficient for the purpose, enough) for you, for My ko'ach (power) is perfected in weakness.” With lev samei'ach therefore will I boast in my weaknesses that the gevurah of Moshiach might be a shelter over me. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore, I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in tzoros on behalf of Moshiach; for whenever I am weak, then the gibbor (strong man) am I! 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` I have been a yold! You forced me. For I ought to be commended by you, for in nothing I was behind the most groise (eminent) Shlichim, even if I am nothing. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Indeed the otot (signs) of the Shliach of Moshiach were brought about among you in all savlanut (patience), both by otot and moftim and gevurot. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For in what have you been short-changed compared to the rest of Moshiachʼs Kehillot, except that I myself was not a burden on you? Do pardon me this slight! 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Hinei, this is the pa'am shlishit I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden; for I seek not yours but you, for yeladim ought not to lay up for their horim (parents), but horim for their yeladim. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But with simcha I will expend and be utterly expended for the nefashot (souls) of you. If more abundantly I have ahavah for you, are you to have less ahavah for me? 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` But let the matter of my being a burden on you be as it may, some say, “Crafty jack that I am, I took you by ormah (cunning).” 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Now I didn't take advantage of any of you through anyone I sent to you, did I? 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` I urged Titos to go, and I sent with him the Ach b'Moshiach; Titos didn't take advantage of you, did he? Did we not walk our derech by the same Ruach Hakodesh? We did not march out of step, did Titos and I? 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` All along have you been thinking that we are making a hitstaddekut (defense, apology) before you? No, before Hashem in Moshiach we speak! Everything we do, Chaverim, is for the sake of your chozek (strength) and edification! 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` For I fear lest efsher (perhaps) when I come I may not find you as I wish and that you may not find me as you wish; I fear lest efsher there be merivah (strife), kinah (jealousy), ka'as (anger), machalokot (divisions), lashon hora (evil speech), ga'avah (conceit), commotions; 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Lest when I come again Hashem Elohai may make me anav (humble) before you, and I should have agmat nefesh over many of the ones who committed averos before, and have not made teshuva from the tumah (uncleanness) and zenut (fornication) and debauchery which they practiced.
