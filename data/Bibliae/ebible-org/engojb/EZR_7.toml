"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And to carry the kesef and zahav, which the Melech and his counselors have freely offered unto the Elohei Yisroel, Whose habitation is in Yerushalayim, 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And all the kesef and zahav that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the Kohanim, offering willingly for the Beis Eloheihem which is in Yerushalayim;

'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And hath extended chesed unto me before HaMelech, and his counselors, and before all the mighty officials of the Melech. And I was strengthened because the Yad Hashem Elohai was upon me, and I gathered together out of Yisroel chief men to go up with me.
