"1" = '''
:sup:`1` when I would have healed Yisroel, then the avon (iniquity) of Ephrayim was exposed, and the ra'ot (crimes) of Shomron; for they practice sheker; and the ganav intrudes, and the bandit robs bachutz (in the street). 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And they consider not in their levavot that I remember all their ra'ah; now their own evil doings surround them; they are before My face. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` They make the Melech glad with their ra'ah, and the sarim (princes) with their lies. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They are all no'afim (adulterers), as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth stirring from the kneading of the batzek (dough), until its chametz leavening rises. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` In the Yom Malkeinu the sarim (princes) have made him sick with the heat of yayin; he has stretched out his hand with the letzim (mockers). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For they have made ready their lev like an oven, while they lie in wait; their anger smolders kol halailah; in the boker it burneth like an eish of flame. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their shofetim; all their melachim are fallen; there is none among them that calleth unto Me. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Ephrayim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephrayim is a flat cake not turned over. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Zarim have devoured his ko'ach, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are sprinkled upon him, yet he hath no da'as. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And the ga'on Yisroel testifieth to his face; and they do not return to Hashem Eloheihem, nor seek Him for all this. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Ephrayim also is like an easily deceived yonah without sense; they call to Mitzrayim, they turn to Assyria. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` When they shall go, I will spread My reshet (net) upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of Shomayim; I will chastise them, when I hear them congregating. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Woe unto them! For they have strayed from Me. Sod (destruction) unto them because they have committed pesha against Me! Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken kazav (lies) against Me. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And they have not cried unto Me with their levavot, when they wailed upon their beds; they congregate themselves for dagan and tirosh, and they depart from Me. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Though I have trained and strengthened their zero'ot (arms), yet do they plot rah against Me. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` They return, but not to Most High; they are like a faulty keshet; their sarim (princes) shall fall by the cherev for the insolence of their leshon; this shall be their derision in Eretz Mitzrayim.
