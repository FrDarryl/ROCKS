TEHILLIM.
Chapter 114.
When Yisroel went out of Mitzrayim, Bais Ya'akov from a people of foreign tongue, 
Yehudah was His kodesh (sanctuary), and Yisroel His dominion. 
The yam saw it, and fled; Yarden was driven back. 
The harim skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. 
What ailed thee, O thou yam, that thou didst flee? Thou Yarden, that thou wast driven back? 
Ye harim, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? 
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of Hashem, at the presence of Elohei Ya'akov; 
Which turned the rock into a pool of mayim, the flint into a spring of mayim.
