:sup:`1` Thus saith Hashem unto me, Go and buy thee a linen ezor (belt) and put it around thy waist, and put it not in mayim.

'''

'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Then I went to Parah, and dug, and took the ezor from the makom where I had hid it; and, hinei, the ezor was marred, it was profitable for nothing. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Then the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying, 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Thus saith Hashem, After this manner will I mar the ga'on Yehudah (pride of Judah), and the great ga'on of Yerushalayim. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` This evil people, which refuse to listen to My words, which walk in the sherirut (stubbornness) of their lev, and walk after elohim acharim, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this ezor, which is good for nothing. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For as the ezor has deveykus with the waist of an ish, so have I caused to have deveykus unto Me kol Bais Yisroel and kol Bais Yehudah, saith Hashem; that they might be unto Me for a People, and for Shem, and for Tehillah, and for Teferet: but they would not hear. 
'''

'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And I will dash them one against another, even the avot and the banim together, saith Hashem; I will not pity, nor spare, nor have rachamim, but destroy them. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Hear ye, and give ozen (ear); be not proud: for Hashem hath spoken. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Give kavod to Hashem Eloheichem, before He cause darkness, and before your raglayim stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for ohr, He turn it into the tzalmavet (shadow of death), and make it gross darkness. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` But if ye will not listen, my nefesh shall weep in secret places for your ga'avah (pride); and mine eye shall weep profusely, and run down with tears, because the Eder Hashem(Flock of Hashem) is carried away captive. 
'''

'''
"19" = '''

'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` What wilt thou say when He appoints over thy leaders those whom thou thyself has taught, to be thy rosh? Shall not chavalim (pangs) seize thee, as a woman in travail?

'''
"25" = '''

'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Therefore will I uncover thy skirts over thy panim, that thy shame may appear. 
'''
"27" = '''
