IYOV.
Chapter 18.
Then answered Bildad the Shuchi, and said, 
Ad anah (Until when, how long) will it be ere ye make an end of words? Gain binah, and afterwards we will speak. 
Why are we counted as behemah (cattle), and reputed stupid in your sight? 
Thou art he who teareth his nefesh in his anger; shall eretz (earth) be forsaken for thee? And shall the tzur be removed out of its place? 
Yea, the ohr of the resha'im shall be put out, and the flame of his eish shall not burn. 
The ohr shall be choshech in his ohel, and his ner (lamp) above him is extinguished. 
The steps of his vigor shall be shortened, and his own etzah (counsel, scheme) shall cast him down. 
For he is cast into a reshet by his own raglayim, and he walketh into a pitfall. 
The pach (trap) shall take him by the akev (heel), and the snare shall prevail against him. 
The noose is laid for him ba'aretz (on the ground), and a trap for him in the path. 
Ballahot (terrors, terrible thoughts) shall make him afraid on every side, and shall dog him behind his feet. 
Calamity is ra'ev (hungry) for him, and destruction shall be ready for his fall. 
It shall devour the limbs of his ohr (skin); even the bechor mavet (plague) shall devour his members. 
That in which he trusted is rooted out of his ohel, and it shall march him to Melech Ballahot (King of Terrors). 
In his ohel nothing dwells; gofrit (brimstone) is scattered upon his habitation. 
His shorashim shall be dried up beneath, and above his branch shall wither. 
His memory shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no shem in the land. 
He shall be driven from ohr into choshech, and chased out of the tevel. 
He shall neither have offspring nor descendant among his am (people), nor is there a sarid in his dwellings. 
The acharonim shall be astonished at his yom, as the kadmonim were affrighted. 
Surely such are the mishkenot (dwellings) of the resha'im, and this is the place of him that has no da'as of El.
