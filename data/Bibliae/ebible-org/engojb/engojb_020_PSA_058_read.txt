TEHILLIM.
Chapter 58.
(For the one directing. Set to Do Not Destroy. Mikhtam Dovid) 
Do ye indeed decree tzedek, O elim (g-ds, g-dlike judges)? Do ye judge uprightly the Bnei Adam? 
No, in lev (heart) ye work wickedness; ye weigh out the chamas (violence) of your hands in Ha'Aretz. 
The resha'im are perverted from the rekhem (womb); gone astray from birth are they, speaking kazav (lie, falsehood). 
Their venom is like the venom of a nachash; they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth its ear; 
That it may not pay heed to the voice of charmers, casting spells ever so cunningly. 
Break their teeth, O Elohim, in their mouth; tear out the fangs of the young lions, Hashem. 
Let them melt away like draining mayim; when he bendeth his bow to shoot his khitzim (arrows), let them be crumbled to pieces. 
As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away; like the stillborn child of an isha, that they may not see the shemesh. 
Before your sirot (pots) can feel the burning thorns, may He with a whirlwind blow them away, both green and dry alike. 
The tzaddik shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash feet in the dahm harasha. 
So that adam shall say, Verily there is a reward for the tzaddik; verily yesh Elohim Shofetim ba'aretz (there is a G-d that judgeth in the earth).
