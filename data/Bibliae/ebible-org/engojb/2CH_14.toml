:sup:`1` And Asa did that which was hatov and yashar in the eyes of Hashem Elohav; 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For he took away the mizbechot hanekhar (foreign altars), and the high places, and smashed the matzevot, and cut down the Asherim; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And commanded Yehudah to seek Hashem Elohei Avoteihem, and to observe the Torah and the Mitzvah. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Also he took away out of all the towns of Yehudah the high places and the chammanim (sun-pillar idols); and the mamlachah was at peace under him. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And he built arei metzurah in Yehudah; for HaAretz was at peace, and he had no milchamah in those years, because Hashem had given him rest. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Therefore he said unto Yehudah, Let us build up these cities, and make about them chomah, and migdalim, gates, and bars. HaAretz is yet before us, because we have sought Hashem Eloheinu, we have sought Him, and He hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And Asa had an army of men that bore shields and spears, out of Yehudah three hundred thousand; and out of Binyamin, that bore mogen and drew keshet (bow), two hundred and fourscore elef; all these were gibborei chayil. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And there came out against them Zerach HaCushi with a host of elef alafim, and three hundred merkavot; and came as far as Mareshah. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Then Asa went out against him, and they took up position for the milchamah in the valley of Tzephatah at Mareshah. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And Asa cried unto Hashem Elohav, and said, Hashem, there is none besides Thee to help, whether with rav, or with them that have no ko'ach. Help us, Hashem Eloheinu, for we rely on Thee; in Shimecha we go against this multitude. Hashem Thou art Eloheinu; let no enosh prevail against Thee. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` So Hashem struck down HaCushim before Asa, and before Yehudah, and HaCushim fled. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And Asa and HaAm that were with him pursued them as far as Gerar, and HaCushim fell, until they could not survive, for they were crushed before Hashem, and before His Machaneh. They carried off very much plunder. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And they destroyed all the towns around Gerar; for the Pachad Hashem fell upon them, and they plundered all the towns, for there was exceeding much booty in them. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` They attacked also the ohalim of herdsmen, and carried off tzon and gemalim in abundance, and returned to Yerushalayim.
