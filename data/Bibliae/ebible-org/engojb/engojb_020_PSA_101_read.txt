TEHILLIM.
Chapter 101.
(Of Dovid. Mizmor) 1 I will sing of chesed and mishpat; unto Thee, Hashem, will I sing. 
I will study the derech tamim. O when wilt Thou come unto me? I will walk within my bais with tam levav. 
I will set no devar beliyya'al before mine eyes; I hate the work of them that fall away; it shall not cleave to me. 
A lev ikkesh (perverse heart) shall be far from me; I will not tolerate rah. 
The one who slandereth ba'seter (in secret) his neighbor, him will I destroy; him that hath haughty einayim (eyes) and a proud levav will I not endure. 
Mine eyes shall be upon the ne'emenei eretz (faithful of the land), that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a derech tamim, he shall minister to me. 
He that worketh remiyyah (deceit) shall not dwell within my bais; he that speaketh shekarim (falsehoods, lies) shall not continue in my presence. 
In the bokerim I will destroy all rishei eretz (wicked ones of the land); that I may cut off all doers of evil from the Ir Hashem.
