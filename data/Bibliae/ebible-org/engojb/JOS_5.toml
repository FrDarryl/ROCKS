:sup:`1` And it came to pass, when all the melachim of the HaEmori, which were beyond the Yarden westward, and all the melachim of the Kena'ani, which were by the Yam, heard that Hashem had dried up the waters of the Yarden from before the Bnei Yisroel, until they had passed over, their levav sank, neither was there ruach in them any more, because of the Bnei Yisroel. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` At that time Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Make thee knives of flint, and do a second time the Bris Milah to the Bnei Yisroel. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And Yehoshua made him flint knives, and did Bris Milah to the Bnei Yisroel at Givat HaAralot. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And this is the reason why Yehoshua did the Bris Milah: Kol HaAm that came out of Mitzrayim, that were zekharim (males), even Kol Anshei HaMilchamah, died in the midbar baderech, after they came out of Mitzrayim. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Now Kol HaAm that came out were Mulim (circumcised); but Kol HaAm that were born in the midbar baderech when they came forth out of Mitzrayim, them they had not given Bris Milah. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For the Bnei Yisroel walked arba'im shanah in the midbar, until Kol HaGoy that were Anshei HaMilchamah, which came out of Mitzrayim, were consumed, because they obeyed not the Kol Hashem(voice of Hashem); unto whom Hashem swore that He would not show them HaAretz, which Hashem swore unto their Avot that He would give us, Eretz zavat cholov u'devash. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And their banim, whom He raised up in their place, them Yehoshua gave Bris Milah; for they were arelim (uncircumcised), because they had not given them Bris Milah baderech. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And it came to pass, when they had done giving Bris Milah to Kol HaGoy, that they abode in their places in the machaneh, until they were chayyah (healed, whole, restored alive). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And Hashem said unto Yehoshua, This day galloti (have I rolled away) the reproach of Mitzrayim from off you. Therefore the shem of the place is called Gilgal unto this day. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And the Bnei Yisroel encamped at Gilgal, and observed the Pesach on the fourteenth day of the month at erev in the plains of Yericho. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And they did eat of the produce of HaAretz on the day after the Pesach, on that very day, matzot, and roasted grain. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And the manna ceased on the following day after they had eaten of the produce of HaAretz; neither had the Bnei Yisroel manna any more; but they did eat of the increase of Eretz Kena'an that year. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And it came to pass, when Yehoshua was there by Yericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, hinei, there stood an ish in front of him with his cherev drawn in his yad; and Yehoshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And he said, Lo (no); but as Sar Tze'va Hashem am I now come. And Yehoshua fell on his face to the ground, and did prostrate himself, and said unto him, What saith Adoni unto his eved? 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the Sar Tze'va Hashem said unto Yehoshua, Take off thy sandals from off thy feet; for the makom whereon thou standest is kodesh. And Yehoshua did so.
