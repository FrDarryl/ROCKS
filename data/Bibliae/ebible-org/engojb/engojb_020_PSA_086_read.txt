TEHILLIM.
Chapter 86.
(A tefillah of Dovid) 1 Incline Thine ear, Hashem; hear me; for I am ani (poor) and evyon (needy). 
Be shomer over my nefesh; for I am chasid; O Thou Elohai, save Thy eved that trusteth in Thee. 
Channeni (be merciful) unto me, Adonoi; for I cry unto Thee kol hayom. 
Samei'ach (rejoice) the nefesh of Thy eved; for unto Thee, Adonoi, do I lift up my nefesh. 
For Thou, Adonoi, art tov, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in chesed unto all them that call upon Thee. 
Give ear, Hashem, unto my tefillah (prayer); and attend to the voice of my techinnot (supplications). 
In my yom tzoros I will call upon Thee; for Thou wilt answer me. 
Ein kamocha vaelohim (there is none like Thee among the g-ds), Adonoi; nor are there any ma'asim like Thine. 
Kol Goyim whom Thou hast made shall come and worship before Thee, Adonoi; and shall glorify Shimcha. 
For Thou art gadol, and doest nifla'ot (wondrous things); Thou alone art Elohim. 
Teach me Thy Derech, Hashem; I will walk in Thy emes; Yachad (make undivided) levavi (my heart) to fear Thy Shem. 
I will praise Thee, Adonoi Elohai, with all my lev; and I will glorify Shimecha l'olam. 
For gadol is Thy chesed toward me; and Thou hast saved my nefesh from the lowermost Sheol. 
O Elohim, the zedim (arrogant ones, proud, insolent ones) are risen up against me, and the adat aritzim (band of violent men) seek my nefesh; and have not set Thee before them. 
But Thou, Adonoi, art El Rachum and Channun, slow to anger, and plenteous in chesed and emes. 
O turn unto me, and be gracious upon me; give Thy oz (strength) unto Thy eved, and save the ben amatecha (the son of Thy handmaid). 
Show me an ot (sign) for tovah; that they which hate me may see it, and be put to shame; because Thou, Hashem, hast helped me, and comforted me.
