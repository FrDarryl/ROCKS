"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Now the Brit HaRishonah farshteit zich (of course) had regulations for avodas kodesh in an earthly Mikdash. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For the Mishkan was furnished, that is, hachitzon (the outer one) in which were both the Menorah and the Shulchan and the setting out of the Lechem HaPanim. This part is the Kodesh, the Holy Place. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And behind the Parokhet HaSheynit was the part of the Mishkan being called the Kodesh HaKodashim, 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Having a golden Mizbe'ach of ketoret (incense) and the Aron HaBrit having been covered on all sides with gold, and in which was a golden jar holding the manna and the rod of Aharon which budded, and the Luchot haBrit (the tablets of the Covenant, the Decalogue, Aseret HaDibrot). 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And above the Aron HaBrit the keruvim of kavod overshadowing the kapporet, about which things it is not possible to speak now in praht (detail). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Now these things having been prepared, the kohanim go continually into the Mishkan, the hachitzon (the outer one), performing the avodas kodesh sherut. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` But into the Kodesh HaKodashim only the Kohen Gadol goes, and only once a year, and not without DAHM (blood) which he offers for himself and for the shiggot haAm (unintentional sins of the people). 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` By this the Ruach Hakodesh signifies that the Derech into the Kodesh HaKodashim has not yet been revealed while the Mishkan, the hachitzon (the outer one), is still standing, 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Which is a mashal for the present time. Accordingly both minchot and zevakhim are being offered which cannot fulfill with respect to the matzpun (conscience) of the worshiper, 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Als (since) they deal only with okhel and mashkeh (drink) and different tevilot, external regulations being imposed until the time of the Tikkun (Restoration). 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` But when Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach came as the Kohen Gadol of the coming tovot (good things), he entered through the Mishkan Gadol, the greater and more perfect Mishkan, not made with hands, that is, not of this B'ri'ah (Creation); 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Not through the dahm of se'irim (goats) and of agalim (bulls) but through his own dahm he entered the Kodesh HaKodashim once and for all, having secured for us the Geulah Olamim. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For if the dahm of se'irim (goats) and parim (young bulls) and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have become tum'a (uncleanness), if this dahm sets apart for kedushah for the tohorah (purification) of the basar, 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` By how much more will the dahm of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach who through the eternal Ruach Hakodesh offered himself without MUM(defect) to G-d, by how much more will his DAHM purify our matzpun (conscience) from ma'asim metim (dead works) in order to serve the Elohim Chayyim. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And for this reason Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is the Metavekh of a Brit Chadasha in order that those who are HaKeru'im (the Called ones) may receive the nachalat olam (eternal inheritance) of the Havtachah (Promise), because a mavet, a kapparat hapeysha'im has taken place that gives them pedut (ransom for redemption, Geulah) from peysha'im(transgressions) that were committed under HaBrit HaRishonah. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For where there is a brit or a tzavva'a (will), it is aizen (well founded, incontrovertible) that the histalkus (passing) of the one who made it must be established. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For a Brit, a tzavv'a (covenant, will) is valid only when Bnei Adam have died, for it is never validly executed as long as the ba'al tzavva'a (testator, person who makes the will) lives. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Hence the Brit HaRishonah was not cut without DAHM. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For when every mitzvah had been spoken by Moshe Rabbeinu to all the Am Brit according to the Torah, he took the dahm of se'irim and of agalim with mayim and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the sefer itself and all the people, 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Saying, HINEI DAHM HABRIT(This is the blood of the Covenant) which Hashem commanded you. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And in the same way he sprinkled both the Mishkan and also all the k'lei haSherut (vessels of service in the Mishkan) with dahm. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Indeed, according to the Torah, almost everything is metohar (purified) by dahm, and without a kapporah by means of shefach dahm (the shedding of blood) there is no selicha (forgiveness). 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Therefore, it was necessary for the tavnit(pattern, copy) of the things in Shomayim be metohar (purified) with these, but the things of Shomayim themselves with better zevakhim than these. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` For Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not enter into a Kodesh HaKodashim made by human hands, a mere TAVNIT(pattern, copy) of the true Kodesh HaKodashim, but Moshiach entered into Shomayim itself, now to appear before the face of Hashem for us. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Nor was it so that he may offer himself again and again, as the Kohen Gadol enters the Kodesh HaKodashim yearly with dahm not his own; 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` For then it would have been necessary for him to suffer often from the hivvased tevel (foundation of the world); but now, once at the Ketz HaOlamim, he has appeared to put away averos (sins) by the korban of himself. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And in as much as it is appointed for men to die once and after this HaMishpat, 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` So he, having been offered up once in order that HU NASA CHET RABBIM(he bore away the sin of many) and shall appear sheynit (a second time) for Yeshu'at Eloheinu without reference to chet for those who expectantly khakeh levo'o shel (await the arrival of) Moshiach.
