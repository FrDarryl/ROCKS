YONAH.
Chapter 2.
Now Hashem had prepared a dag gadol (great fish) to swallow up Yonah. And Yonah was in the belly of the dag shloshah yamim and shloshah leilot (three days and three nights). 
Then Yonah davened unto Hashem Elohav from out of the dagʼs belly, 
And said, I cried by reason of mine tzoros unto Hashem, He heard me; out of the belly of Sheol cried I, and Thou heardest my voice. 
For Thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the yamim (seas); and the current swirled about me; all Thy billows and Thy waves passed over me. 
Then I said: I am cast out of Thy sight; yet I will look again toward Thy Heikhal Kodesh. 
The mayim compassed me about, even to the nefesh; the depth closed me round about, the seaweed were wrapped about my head. 
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; ha'aretz with her bars closed behind me l'olam; yet hast Thou brought up my life from shachat (corruption), Hashem Elohai. 
When my nefesh fainted within me, I remembered Hashem; and my tefillah came unto Thee, into Thine Heikhal Kodesh. 
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own chesed. 
But I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of todah; I will pay that which I have vowed. Yeshu'ah (Salvation) is from Hashem. 
And Hashem spoke unto HaDag (The Fish), and it vomited out Yonah upon the yabashah (dry land).
