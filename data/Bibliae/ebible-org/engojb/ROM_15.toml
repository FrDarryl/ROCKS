"1" = '''
:sup:`1` We, the strong, ought to support the weaknesses of those without chizzuk, and not to please ourselves. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Let each of us please his re'a with a view to what is beneficial, for upbuilding. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For even Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach did not please himself; but, as it is written, V'CHERPOT CHORPECHA NAF'LU ALAI (The reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me). 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For as much as was written beforehand was written for our limudei kodesh, in order that through savlanut and through the nechamah of the Kitvei Hakodesh we might hold fast tikvah (hope). 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` May the G-d of savlanut and of nechamah give you to live in harmony among yourselves in accordance with Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` In order that with achdus of mind and voice you might give kavod to the Elohim and Avi of Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Therefore, treat each other as orchim ratzuy (welcome guests), as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach welcomed you, to the kavod of Hashem(glory of G-d). 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For I declare that Moshiach has become Mesharet Bnei HaMilah (Servant, Minister of the Circumcised) for the sake of the Emes Hashem(the truth of G-d), to confirm the havtachot given to the Avot, 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And in order that the Goyim might give praise to Hashem for His chaninah (mercy). As it is written, For this reason I will confess You among the Goyim and sing praises unto Your Name. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Furthermore it says, HARNINU GOYIM AMMO (Rejoice, Goyim with His people). 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And again, HALELU ES ADONOI KOL GOYIM SHABBECHUHU KOL HAUMMIM (Baruch Hashem, Praise the L-rd, all you Goyim, and let all the peoples praise Him). 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And again Yeshayah says, The SHORESH OF YISHAI (the Root of Jesse), shall come forth, even the one who arises to rule the GOYIM; in him (the Gentiles, the nations) shall put their TIKVAH (hope). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` May the Elohei HaTikvah (the G-d of hope) fill you with simcha and shalom in believing, that you may overflow in tikvah (hope), in the ko'ach (power) of the Ruach Hakodesh. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Achim b'Moshiach of mine, I myself am convinced concerning you, that you yourselves too are full of yosher (rectitude), full of da'as, able also to admonish one another. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But I wrote to you rather bluntly in this iggeret hakodesh in part as a way of reminding you, by virtue of the chesed (unmerited favor, gift of grace) given me from Hashem, 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` To be a mesharet (minister, servant) of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua to the Goyim, serving the Besuras HaGeulah of Hashem, administering with a kohenʼs avodas kodesh service the minchah offering to Hashem of the Goyim, that this offering might be acceptable, mekudash (set apart as holy) in the Ruach Hakodesh. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Therefore I have this glorying in Moshiach Yehoshua in reference to what concerns G-d. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` For I will not presume to say anything, except of what Moshiach has accomplished through me for the mishma'at of the peoples, by word and deed, 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` By the ko'ach of otot u'moftim (signs and wonders), by the power of the Ruach Hakodesh; so that from Yerushalayim in a sweep round to Illyricum, I have preached the Besuras HaGeulah Hashem, 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Thus making it my hasagos (aspiration) to preach the Besuras HaGeulah where Moshiach has not been named, lest I build on anotherʼs yesod (foundation). 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` But, as it is written, “Those who had not been told about Him will see, and those who had not heard shall understand.” 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For this reason I have also regularly been prevented from coming to you. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` But now, als (since) I no longer have scope in these regions and have had a tshuka (longing) to come to you for many years, 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` When I travel to Spain…For I hope to see you as I pass through and to be sent on my way there by you, once I have had the full pleasure of being with you for a time. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But now I am traveling to Yerushalayim in avodas kodesh service to the Kedoshim (Messianic Jews in Jerusalem). 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` For the kehillot of Moshiach (Messianic congregations) in Macedonia and Achaia (Greece) chose to make some tzedakah (contribution) for the aniyim (poor) among the Kedoshim in Yerushalayim. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` For they chose to do so and owe them a choiv (debt), for if the non-Jews have received a share in their spiritual affairs, they ought to minister to the Messianic Jews in material affairs. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` When, therefore, I have completed this (collection journey avodas kodesh service) and sealed this p'ri (fruit) to them, I will go by way of you to Spain. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And I have da'as that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the Birkat HaMoshiach. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` I appeal to you, Achim b'Moshiach, through Adoneinu Moshiach Yehoshua and the ahavas HaRuach Hakodesh, to contend with me in your tefillos to Hashem on my behalf, 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` that I might be delivered from those without mishma'at in Yehudah and my avodas kodesh service to Yerushalayim might be acceptable to the Kedoshim, 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` That I might come to you in simcha (joy) birtzon Hashem(in the will of G-d) and be mutually refreshed by your hitkhabrut (fellowship) in the Messianic Chavurah. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` V'Elohei HaShalom im kulechem. Omein. (May the G-d of peace be with you all. Amen.)
