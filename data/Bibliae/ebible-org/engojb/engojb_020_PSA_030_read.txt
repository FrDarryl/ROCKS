TEHILLIM.
Chapter 30.
(Mizmor. Shir Chanukat HaBeis. Of Dovid) 
I will exalt Thee, Hashem, for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to gloat over me. 
Hashem Elohai, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me. 
Hashem, Thou hast brought up my nefesh from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 
Sing unto Hashem, O ye chasidim of His, and give thanks to His Zekher Kodesh. 
For His anger endureth but a rega; in His favor is Chayyim; weeping may endure for an erev, but joy cometh in the boker. 
And in my shalvah (security) I said, I shall never be moved. 
Hashem, by Thy favor Thou hast made my mountain to stand firm; Thou didst hide Thy face, and I was troubled. 
I cried to Thee, Hashem; and unto Adonoi I made supplication. 
What profit is there in my dahm, in my going down into the pit? Shall the aphar (dust) praise Thee? Shall it declare Thy emes? 
Shema, Hashem, and channeini; Hashem, be Thou my helper. 
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with simcha; 
That kavod (my glory, my soul) may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent. Hashem Elohai, I will give thanks unto Thee l'olam.
