:sup:`1` Awake, awake; clothe thyself with thy strength, O Tziyon; put on thy garments of splendor, O Yerushalayim, Ir HaKodesh; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the arel (uncircumcised) and the tameh (unclean).

"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For thus saith Adonoi Hashem: My people went down at first into Mitzrayim to sojourn there; and lately the Assyrian oppressed them. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Now therefore, what have I here, saith Hashem, that My people is taken away for nothing? They that rule over them mock them, saith Hashem; and all day long Shemi (My Name) is continually blasphemed. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Therefore My people shall know Shemi; therefore they shall know in Yom Hahu that I am He that doth speak; hineni, (behold, it is I).

"7" = '''
:sup:`7` How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the Mevaser (bringer of Good Tidings, the Evangelist), that publisheth shalom; that bringeth good tidings of tov, that publisheth Yeshu'ah (Salvation); that saith unto Tziyon: Thy G-d reigneth! 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Thy tzofim (watchmen) shall lift up the kol (voice); with the kol together shall they shout for joy; for they shall see it with their own eyes, when Hashem returns to Tziyon. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Break forth into joy, sing together, ye ruins of Yerushalayim; for Hashem hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Yerushalayim.

"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Depart ye, depart ye; come ye out from there; touch not tameh (unclean thing); come ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that carry the k'lei Hashem. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for Hashem will go before you; and Elohei Yisroel will be your rearguard. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Hinei, Avdi shall act wisely, he shall be raised and be lifted up, and be highly exalted. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` As rabbim (many) were appalled at thee; his appearance was so disfigured more than any man, and his form more than the bnei adam; 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` So yazzeh Goyim rabbim (he Moshiach will sprinkle many nations); the melachim (kings) shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them shall they see; and of that which they had not heard shall they have binah (understanding).
