Chapter 6.
Come, and let us return unto Hashem; for He hath torn, and He will heal us; He hath struck, and He will bind us up. 
After two days He will revive us; in the Yom HaShelishi He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight.

Also, O Yehudah, he hath set a katzir (harvest) of punishment for thee, When I turn the Shevut Ami (Captivity of My people),
