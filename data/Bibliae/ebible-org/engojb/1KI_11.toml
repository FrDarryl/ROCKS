"1" = '''
:sup:`1` But Sh'lomo Hamelech loved nashim nokhriyyot rabbot (many foreign women), besides Bat Pharaoh: Moaviyyot, Ammoniyyot, Adomiyyot, Tzedeniyyot, Chittiyyot, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Of the Goyim concerning which Hashem said unto the Bnei Yisroel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you; for surely they will turn away your levav after their elohim; Sh'lomo made his deveykus unto these in love. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And he had nashim sarot sheva me'ot (seven hundred royal wives), and three hundred pilagshim; and his nashim inclined libo (his heart). 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For it came to pass, when Sh'lomo was old, that his nashim inclined libo (his heart) after elohim acherim and levavo (his heart) was not shalem (undivided, fully devoted, complete) with Hashem Elohav, as was the levav Dovid Aviv. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For Sh'lomo went after Ashtoret elohei Tzidonim, and after Milkom shikkutz (the abomination of) Ammonim. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Sh'lomo did the rah in the sight of Hashem, and went not fully after Hashem, as did Dovid Aviv. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Then did Sh'lomo build a high place for Kemosh, the shikkutz (abomination of) Moav, on the har (hill), that is facing Yerushalayim, and for Molech, the shikkutz (abomination of) the Bnei Ammon. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And likewise did he for all his nashim nokhriyyot, which burned ketoret and offered zevakhim unto their elohim. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And Hashem was angry with Sh'lomo, because levavo was turned from Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Who had appeared unto him twice, 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after elohim acherim; but he was not shomer over that which Hashem commanded. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Wherefore Hashem said unto Sh'lomo, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not been shomer over My Brit (Covenant, Sinai Covenant) and My chukkot, which I have commanded thee, I will surely tear away the Mamlachah from thee, and will give it to thy eved (servant). 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Notwithstanding in thy yamim I will not do it lema'an (for the sake of) Dovid Avicha; but I will tear it out of the yad binecha (power of thy son). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Howbeit I will not tear away kol hamamlachah; but will give shevet echad (one tribe) to binecha le'ma'an Dovid Avdi and lema'an Yerushalayim which I have chosen. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And Hashem raised up satan (adversary) unto Sh'lomo, Hadad HaAdomi; he was from the zera HaMelech in Edom. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` For it came to pass, when Dovid was in Edom, and Yoav Sar HaTzava was gone up to bury the slain, after he had struck down every zachar in Edom; 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` (For six months did Yoav remain there with kol Yisroel, until he had cut off every zachar in Edom); 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` That Hadad fled, he and anashim Adomiyyim (certain men of Edom) of his father ºs avadim with him, to go into Mitzrayim; Hadad being yet a na'ar katan (small child). 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And they arose out of Midyan, and came to Paran; and they took anashim with them out of Paran, and they came to Mitzrayim, unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim; who gave him a bais, and assigned him lechem, and gave him eretz. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And Hadad found chen me'od in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for an isha the achot of his own isha, the achot Tachpeneis the gevirah (royal lady, queen). 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And the achot of Tachpeneis bore him Genuvat bno, whom Tachpeneis weaned in Bais Pharaoh; and Genuvat was in Bais Pharaoh among the Bnei Pharaoh. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And when Hadad heard in Mitzrayim that Dovid slept with Avotav, and that Yoav Sar HaTzava was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own eretz. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, hinei, thou seekest to go to thine own eretz? And he answered, Nothing; howbeit let me go anyway. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And Elohim raised up against him another satan, Rezon ben Elyada, which fled from adonav Hadadezer Melech Tzovah; 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And he gathered anashim unto him, and became sar gedood (leader of a band of marauders), when Dovid slaughtered them of Tzovah; they went to Damascus, dwelt therein, and reigned he there as king. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And he was a satan to Yisroel all the days of Sh'lomo, in addition to ra'ah that Hadad did; and he despised Yisroel, and he ruled in Aram. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Also the eved Sh'lomo Yarov'am ben Nevat, an Ephrati of the Tzeredah (Zeredah), whose shem immo was Tzeru'ah, an almanah, even he lifted up his yad against HaMelech. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And this is the account of his lifting up his yad against HaMelech; Sh'lomo built the Millo, and closed up the peretz of Ir Dovid Aviv. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And the ish Yarov'am was a gibbor chayil; and Sh'lomo seeing the na'ar that he was industrious, he put him over all the sevel (load, burden, enforced labor) of Bais Yosef. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And it came to pass at that time when Yarov'am went out of Yerushalayim, that HaNavi Achiyah the Shiloni found him on the derech; and he had clothed himself with a salmah chadasha (new garment, cloak); and they two were alone in the sadeh; 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And Achiyah took hold of the salmah chadasha that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces; 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` And he said to Yarov'am, Take for thee ten pieces; for thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Hineni, I will tear the mamlachah out of the yad Sh'lomo, and will give to thee asarah hashevatim. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` (But he shall have hashevet haechad l'ma'an Dovid Avdi, and l'ma'an Yerushalayim, the Ir which I have chosen out of kol shivtei Yisroel;) 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoret elohei Tzidonim, Kemosh elohei Moav, and Milkom elohei Bnei Ammon, and have not walked in My ways, to do that which is yashar in Mine eyes, and My chukkot and My mishpatim, as did Dovid Aviv. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Howbeit I will not take the whole mamlachah out of his yad; but I will make him nasi all the days of his life l'ma'an Dovid Avdi, whom I chose, because he was shomer over My mitzvot and My chukkot; 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` But I will take the mamlachah out of yad beno, and will give it unto thee, even aseret hashevatim (ten tribes). 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` And unto bno will I give shevet echad (one tribe), l'ma'an Dovid Avdi may have a ner (lamp) always before Me in Yerushalayim, the Ir which I have chosen for Me to put My Shem there. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy nefesh desireth, and shalt be Melech over Yisroel. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` And it shall be, if thou wilt pay heed unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in My ways, and do that is yashar in My sight, to be shomer over My chukkot and My mitzvot, as Dovid Avdi did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a bais ne'eman (enduring dynasty) as I built for Dovid, and will give Yisroel unto thee. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` And I will for this afflict the zera Dovid, but not forever. 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` Sh'lomo sought therefore to kill Yarov'am. And Yarov'am arose, and fled into Mitzrayim, unto Shishak Melech Mitzrayim, and was in Mitzrayim until the Mot Sh'lomo. 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` And the rest of the acts of Sh'lomo, and all that he did, and his chochmah, are they not written in the Sefer Divrei Sh'lomo? 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` And the time that Sh'lomo reigned in Yerushalayim over kol Yisroel was arba'im shanah. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` And Sh'lomo slept with Avotav, and was buried in the Ir Dovid Aviv: and Rechav'am bno reigned in his place.
