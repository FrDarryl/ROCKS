:sup:`1` The Davar Hashem came again unto me, saying, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Ben adam, say unto the Nagid Tzor, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Because thine lev is lifted up in pride, and thou hast said, El ani (I am a g-d), and I sit on a moshav elohim (seat of g-ds), in the midst of the yamim (seas); yet thou art adam, and not El, though thou set thine mind as the lev elohim; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Hinei, thou art more chacham than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee; 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` With thy chochmah and with thine tevunah (understanding) thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten zahav and kesef into thy otzarot; 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` By thy great chochmah in thy trade hast thou increased thy riches, and thine lev is lifted up in pride because of thy riches; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Because thou hast set thine mind as the lev elohim; 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Hineni, therefore I will bring zarim upon thee, the most terrible of the Goyim; and they shall draw their charavot (swords) against the beauty of thy chochmah, and they shall defile thy splendor. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` They shall bring thee down to the shachat (pit), and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the yamim (seas). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, Elohim ani? But thou art adam, and no El, in the yad of him that slayeth thee. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Thou shalt die the deaths of the arelim (uncircumcised) by the yad of zarim; for I have spoken it, 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Moreover the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying: 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Ben adam, take up a kinah (lamentation) upon HaMelech Tzor (Tyre), and say unto him, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Thou wast the chotam (seal) of perfection, full of chochmah, and perfect in beauty. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Thou hast been in Eden, Gan Elohim; every even yekarah (precious stone) was thy covering, the ruby, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the turquoise, and the emerald, and zahav; the workmanship of thy hand drums and of thy wind instruments was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Thou art the keruv mimshach (anointed cherub) that guardeth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon the Har Kodesh Elohim; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of eish. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Thou wast tamim in thy drakhim from the day that thou wast created, until wickedness was found in thee. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` By the multitude of thy trading they have filled the midst of thee with chamas, and thou hast sinned; therefore I will banish thee as profane out of the Har Elohim; and I will destroy thee, O guardian keruv, from the midst of the stones of eish. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Thine lev was lifted up in pride because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy chochmah by reason of thy splendor; I will cast thee to eretz (earth), I will lay thee before melachim, that they may gaze upon thee. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Thou hast defiled thy mikdashim by the multitude of thine avonot, by the avon of thy trading; therefore will I bring forth an eish from the midst of thee; it shall devour thee, and I will reduce thee to ashes upon ha'aretz in the sight of all them that gaze upon thee. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` All they that know thee among the peoples shall be appalled at thee; thou shalt be a horror, and thou shalt be no more, ad olam. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Again the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying, 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Ben adam, set thy face toward Tzidon (Sidon), and prophesy against it, 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Hineni, I am against thee, O Tzidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Hashem, when I shall have executed shefatim (punishments, judgments) in her, and I shall show Myself as set apart as kodesh in her. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For I will send into her dever, and dahm into her streets; and the slain shall be judged in the midst of her by the cherev upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am Hashem. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the Bais Yisroel, nor any painful kotz (thorn) of all that are around them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: When I shall have gathered the Bais Yisroel from the people among whom they are scattered, and I shall show Myself as set apart as kodesh in them in the sight of the Goyim, then shall they dwell in their adamah (land) that I have given to Avdi Ya'akov (My servant Jacob). 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And they shall dwell securely therein, and shall build batim (houses), and plant kramim (vineyards); indeed, they shall dwell securely, when I have executed shefatim (judgments) upon all those that despise them all around them; and they shall know that I am Hashem Eloheihem.
