:sup:`1` And when HaAm saw that Moshe delayed to come down from HaHar, HaAm gathered themselves together unto Aharon, and said unto him, Up, make us elohim (g-ds), which shall go before us; for as for this Moshe, the ish that brought us up out of Eretz Mitzrayim, we know not what is become of him. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And Aharon said unto them, Take off the rings of zahav in the ears of your nashim, of your banim, and of your banot, and bring them unto me.

'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And he received them at their yad, and fashioned it with a cheret, after he had made it an Egel Masekhah (Molten Calf); and they said, These be thy elohim, O Yisroel, which brought thee up out of Eretz Mitzrayim.

'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` They have turned aside quickly from HaDerech which I commanded them; they have made them an Egel Masekhah, and have bowed down to it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy elohim, O Yisroel, which have brought thee up out of the Eretz Mitzrayim. 
'''
"9" = '''

"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And Moshe besought Hashem Elohav, and said, Hashem, why doth Thy wrath burn hot against Thy people, which Thou hast brought forth out of Eretz Mitzrayim with ko'ach gadol, and with a yad chazakah? 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For ra'ah (evil intent) did He bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of ha'adamah? Turn from Thy fierce wrath, and relent of the ra'ah against Thy people. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Remember Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yisroel, Thy avadim, to whom Thou swore by Thine own Self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your zera as the kokhavim of Shomayim, and kol haaretz hazot that I have spoken of will I give unto your zera, and they shall inherit it l'olam.

"18" = '''

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the machaneh, that he saw the Egel, and the mecholot (dancing); and the anger of Moshe burned hot, and he threw the Luchot out of his hands, and broke them at the foot of HaHar. 
'''
"20" = '''

"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And Moshe said unto Aharon, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so chata'ah gedolah upon them? 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And Aharon said, Let not the anger of adoni burn hot; thou knowest HaAm, that they are prone to rah (evil). 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For they said unto me, Make for us elohim, which shall go before us; for as for this Moshe, the ish that brought us up out of Eretz Mitzrayim, we know not what is become of him. 
'''
"24" = '''

'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And when Moshe saw that HaAm were exposed; (for Aharon had exposed them to derision among their enemies;) 
'''
"26" = '''

'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And he said unto them, Thus saith Hashem Elohei Yisroel, Put every man his cherev by his side, and go in and out from sha'ar to sha'ar throughout the machaneh, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And the Bnei Levi did according to the word of Moshe; and there fell of HaAm that day about three thousand men. 
'''
"29" = '''

'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And it came to pass on the next day, that Moshe said unto HaAm, Ye have sinned a chata'ah gedolah; and now I will go up unto Hashem; perhaps I can make kapporah for your chattat.

'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Therefore now go, lead HaAm unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; hinei, Malachi shall go before thee; nevertheless in the yom when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
