TEHILLIM.
Chapter 138.
(Of Dovid) 1 I will thank Thee with my whole lev; before the elohim will I sing praise unto Thee. 
I will worship toward Thy Heikhal Kodesh, and praise Shmecha (Thy Name) for Thy chesed and for Thy emes; for Thou hast magnified Thy Word above Kol Shimcha (all Thy Name). 
In the day when I called out, Thou answeredst me, and madest me bold with oz (strength) in my nefesh. 
Kol Malchei Aretz shall praise Thee, Hashem, when they hear the words of Thy mouth. 
Yes, they shall sing of the Darkhei Hashem; for gadol is the Kavod Hashem. 
Though Hashem be on high, yet He looks upon the lowly; but the proud He knoweth from afar. 
Though I walk in the midst of tzoros, Thou wilt preserve me alive; Thou shalt stretch forth Thine yad against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy Yamin (Right Hand) shall save me. 
Hashem will fulfill that which concerneth me; Thy chesed, O Hashem, endureth l'olam; forsake not the works of Thine own yadayim.
