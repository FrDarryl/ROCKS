[49]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Concerning Bnei Ammon, thus saith Hashem: Hath Yisroel no banim? Hath he no yoresh (heir)? Why then doth Malcam (Molech) inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his towns? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Therefore, hinei, the days come, saith Hashem, that I will cause an alarm of milchamah to be heard in Rabbah of Bnei Ammon; and it shall become a desolate tel (mound), and her banot shall be burned with eish: then shall Yisroel dispossess his dispossessors, 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Wail, O Cheshbon, for Ai is plundered: cry out, ye banot of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and rush to and fro inside the walls; for Malcam (Molech) shall go into Golus, and his kohanim and his sarim together. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Why gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing emek (valley), O Bat hashovevah (backsliding Daughter)? That trusted in her otzarot, saying: Who shall come unto Me? 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Hineni, I will bring a pachad (terror) upon thee, saith Adonoi Hashem Tzva'os, from all those that be around thee; and ye shall be driven out, every ish before him; and none shall gather up the fugitive. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And afterward I will bring back the captivity of the Bnei Ammon, saith Hashem. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Concerning Edom, thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Is chochmah no more in Teman? Is etzah perished from the prudent? Is their chochmah vanished? 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Flee ye, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esav upon him, the time that I will visit to punish him. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` If grape gatherers come to thee, would they not leave some grape gleanings? If ganavim balailah (thieves by night), they will destroy only till they have enough. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` But I have stripped Esav bare, I have uncovered his hiding places, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his zera are plundered, and his brethren and his shchenim (neighbors), and he is no more. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Leave thy yatomim (fatherless, orphans), I will preserve them alive; and let thy almanot trust in Me. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For thus saith Hashem: Hinei, they whose mishpat was not to drink of the Kos have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? Thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For I have sworn by Myself, saith Hashem, that Botzrah shall become a desolation, a cherpah, a reproach, and a kelalah; and all the towns thereof shall be perpetual ruins. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` I have heard a message from Hashem, and an envoy is sent unto the Goyim, saying: Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the milchamah. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` For, hinei, I will make thee katon among the Goyim, and despised among adam. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Thy fierceness hath deceived thee, and the zadon (pride, malice) of thine lev, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill; though thou shouldest make thy ken (nest) as high as the nesher, I will bring thee down from there, 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Also Edom shall be a horror; every one that goeth by it shall be appalled, and shall hiss at all the makkot (wounds, blows) thereof. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` As in the overthrow of Sodom and Amora (Gomorrah) and the neighboring towns thereof, saith Hashem, no ish shall abide there, neither shall a ben adam dwell in it. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Hinei, he shall come up like an aryeh from the thicket of the Yarden against the rich pastureland; but I will suddenly make him run away from her; and who is Bachur (Chosen one), that I may appoint over her? Mi khamoni (who is like Me)? And who will arraign Me? And who is that Ro'eh (shepherd) that will stand before Me? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Therefore hear the etzat Hashem, that He hath planned against Edom; and His purposes, that He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman; Surely the young ones of the tzon shall drag them away; surely He shall make their habitation desolate because of them. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Ha'aretz shakes at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in Yam Suf. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Hinei, He shall come up and fly like the nesher, and spread His wings over Botzrah; and in that day shall the lev of the Gibborim of Edom be as the lev of an isha in her birth pangs. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Concerning Damascus: Chamat is shamed, and Arpad, for they have heard bad news; they are fainthearted; there is anxiety on the yam (sea); it cannot be quiet. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Damascus has grown feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath gripped her; anguish and chavalim (pains) have taken her, as a woman in travail. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` How is it that the Ir Tehillah is not deserted, the town of My joy! 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Therefore her bochurim shall fall in her streets, and all the anshei milchamah shall be destroyed in that day, 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And I will kindle an eish in the chomat Damascus, and it shall consume the fortresses of Ben-hadad. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Concerning Kedar, and concerning the mamlechot of Chatzor, which Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel shall strike: Thus saith Hashem: Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and plunder the Bnei Kedem. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Their ohalim and their tzon shall they take away; they shall carry off for themselves their tent curtains, and all their kelim (vessels), their gemalim (camels); and they shall cry unto them: Magor (terror, fear) is on every side. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Flee, get you far off, dwell in the depths, O ye inhabitants of Chatzor, saith Hashem; for Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel hath plotted an etzah (plot, plan, counsel) against you, and hath conceived a plan against you. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Arise, get you up unto the nation which is at ease, that dwelleth securely, saith Hashem, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` And their gemalim (camels) shall be for plunder, and the multitude of their mikneh (herds) a plunder; and I will scatter unto kol ruach (all winds) them that cut off the hair corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` And Chatzor shall be a ma'on (dwelling) for jackals, and a desolation ad olam (forever); there shall no ish abide there, nor any ben adam dwell in it. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` The Devar Hashem that came to Yirmeyah HaNavi against Eilam in the beginning of the reign of Tzidkiyah Melech Yehudah, saying: 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os; Hineni: I will break the keshet (bow, power) of Eilam, the mainstay of their might. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` And upon Eilam will I bring the arba ruchot (four winds) from the four quarters of Shomayim, and will scatter them toward all those ruchot; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Eilam shall not go. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` For I will cause Eilam to be dismayed before their oyevim, and before them that seek their nefesh; and I will bring ra'ah upon them, even My charon af, saith Hashem; and I will send the cherev after them, till I have consumed them: 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` And I will set My Kisse in Eilam, and will destroy from there melech and the sarim, saith Hashem. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` Yet it shall come to pass in the acharit hayamim, that I will bring back the captives of Eilam, saith Hashem.
