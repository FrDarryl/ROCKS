TEHILLIM.
Chapter 132.
(Shir HaMa'alot) 1Hashem, remember Dovid, and all his afflictions; 
How he swore unto Hashem, and vowed unto Avir Ya'akov (the Mighty One of Ya'akov); 
Surely I will not come into the ohel of my bais, nor go up into my bed; 
I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor tenumah (slumber) to mine eyelids, 
Until I find a makom (place) for Hashem, even mishkanot for the Avir Ya'akov. 
Hinei, we heard of it at Ephratah; we found it in the sedei Ya'ar (fields of Ya'ar). 
We will go into His mishkanot; we will worship at the hadom (footstool) of His raglayim. 
Arise, Hashem, into Thy menuchah (resting place); Thou, and the Aron of Thy oz (might). 
Let Thy Kohanim be clothed with tzedek; and let Thy chasidim sing for joy. 
For the sake of Dovid Thy Eved, do not turn away the face of Thine Moshiach. 
Hashem hath sworn in emes unto Dovid; He will not turn from His oath: Of the p'ri (fruit) of thy beten (body) will I set upon thy kisse (throne). 
If thy Banim are shomer over My Brit and My Edot that I shall teach them, their Banim shall also sit upon thy kisse adei-ad (forevermore). 
For Hashem hath chosen Tziyon; He hath desired her for His moshav. 
This is My menuchah (resting place) adei-ad (forever); here will I dwell; for I have desired her. 
I will place a bountiful brocha on her provision; I will satisfy her poor with lechem. 
I will also clothe her Kohanim with Yesha (salvation); and her chasidim shall sing aloud for joy. 
There atzmi'ach (I will make sprout) the Keren of Dovid; I have ordained a ner (lamp) for My Moshiach. 
His oyevim will I clothe with boshet (shame); but upon him shall his nezer (crown) be resplendent.
