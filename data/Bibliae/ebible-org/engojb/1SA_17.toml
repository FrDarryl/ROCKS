"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And Dovid spoke to the anashim that stood by him, saying, What shall be done for the ish that killeth this Pelishti, and taketh away the cherpah (reproach) from Yisroel?

'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` Dovid said moreover, Hashem that saved me out of the paw of the ari, and out of the paw of the dov, He will save me out of the yad of this Pelishti. And Sha'ul said unto Dovid, Go, and Hashem be with thee.

:sup:`40` And he took his makel (stick, staff) in his yad, and chose him chamishah chalukei avanim (five smooth stones) out of the nachal (brook), and put them in a keli haro'im (shepherdʼs bag) which he had, even in a wayfarerʼs bag; and his kela (slingshot) was in his yad; and he drew near to the Pelishti. 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` And the Pelishti came on and drew near unto Dovid; and the ish, the no'se hatzinnah, went ahead of him. 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` And when the Pelishti squinted and saw Dovid, he despised him: for he was but a na'ar (boy), and admoni (ruddy), and yafeh mareh (good-looking). 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` And the Pelishti said unto Dovid, Am I a kelev (dog), that thou comest to me with maklot (sticks)? And the Pelishti cursed Dovid by his g-ds. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` And the Pelishti said to Dovid, Come to me, and I will give thy basar unto the oph hashomayim, and to the behemat hasadeh. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` Then said Dovid to the Pelishti, Thou comest against me with a cherev (sword), and with a khanit (spear), and with a kidon (javelin); but I come against thee b'Shem Hashem Tzva'os Elohei Ma'arkhot Yisroel, whom thou hast defied. 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` This day will Hashem hand thee over into mine yad; and I will strike thee down, and take thine rosh from thee; and I will give the peger machaneh Pelishtim this day unto the oph hashomayim, and to the chayyat ha'aretz; that kol ha'aretz may know that there is Elohim in Yisroel. 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` And kol hakahal hazeh shall know that Hashem yehoshi'a (saveth) not with cherev or khanit; for the milchamah is Hashemʼs, and He will give you (plural) into yadenu (our hands). 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` And it came to pass, when the Pelishti arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet Dovid, that Dovid hastened, and ran toward the ma'arakhah (battle line) to meet the Pelishti. 
'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` And Dovid put his yad in his keli (bag), and took from there an even (stone), and slung it, and struck the Pelishti in his metzach (forehead), that the even (stone) sunk into his metzach; and he fell upon his face to the ground. 
'''
"50" = '''
:sup:`50` So Dovid prevailed chazak over the Pelishti with a sling and with an even (stone), and struck down the Pelishti, and killed him; but there was no cherev in the yad Dovid. 
'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` Therefore Dovid ran, and stood over the Pelishti, and took hold of his cherev, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slaughtered him, v'yikhrat (and cut off) his rosh therewith. And when the Pelishtim saw their gibbor was dead, they fled. 
'''
"52" = '''
:sup:`52` And the Anshei Yisroel and of Yehudah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Pelishtim, until thou come to the gey (valley), and to the Sha'arei Ekron. And the challei Pelishtim fell by the derech to Sha'arayim, even unto Gat, and unto Ekron. 
'''
"53" = '''
:sup:`53` And the Bnei Yisroel returned from chasing after the Pelishtim, and they plundered their machanot. 
'''
"54" = '''
:sup:`54` And Dovid took the rosh of the Pelishti, and brought it to Yerushalayim; but he put his kelim (weapons) in his ohel. 
'''
"55" = '''
:sup:`55` And when Sha'ul saw Dovid go forth to meet the Pelishti, he said unto Avner, the sar hatzavah, Avner, whose ben is this na'ar? And Avner said, As thy nefesh liveth, O Melech, I cannot tell. 
'''
"56" = '''
:sup:`56` And the Melech said, Inquire thou whose ben this elem (young man) is. 
'''
"57" = '''
:sup:`57` And as Dovid returned from the slaughter of the Pelishti, Avner took him, and brought him before Sha'ul with the rosh of the Pelishti in his yad. 
'''
"58" = '''
:sup:`58` And Sha'ul said to him, Whose ben art thou, na'ar? And Dovid answered, I am the ben avdecha Yishai of Beit-Lechem.
