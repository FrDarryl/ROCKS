Moshiachʼs Letter through the Shliach Sha'ul to the Brit Chadasha Kehillah in Ephesus.
Chapter 1.
Sha'ul a Shliach of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua b'ratzon Hashem(by the will of G-d) to the Kedoshim who are in Ephesus, and who are HaNe'emanim in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua; 
Chen v'Chesed Hashem to you and shalom from Elokim Avinu and Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua. 
Baruch Hashem Elokim Avi Adoneinu Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, who has bestowed on us every birkat hanefesh in Shomayim in Moshiach, 
Just as He in Him chose us to be part of Hashemʼs Bechirim (Chosen Ones) before the hivvased tevel (foundation of the world), that we should be Kedoshim and without mum(defect) before Him in ahavah: 
Having provided the yi'ud merosh (predestination) for us to be chosen as adopted bnei brit through Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua to Himself, according to the chafetz (good pleasure) of His ratzon (will), 
To the tehillat kavod of the Chen v'Chesed Hashem of Him (to the praise of the glory of His grace) by which Hashem freely favored us in the Moshiach HaAhuv. 
In Him we have the pedut (redemption, Geulah release on payment of ransom) through the dahm of Moshiach, the selichat chatoteinu (forgiveness of our sins), according to the osher (wealth) of His Chen v'Chesed Hashem(grace of G-d); 
Which He lavished upon us, 
In all chochmah (wisdom) and binah (understanding), having made hisgalus (revelation) to us of the sod of His ratzon (mystery of His will), His chafetz (good pleasure), according to the etza (counsel, plan of G-d) which Hashem set forth in Moshiach: 
For a pekudat Hashem(stewardship of G-d), a plan for the fullness of time, gathering up all things in Moshiach, both the things in Shomayim and the things on Ha'Aretz in Him. 
In Moshiach we have also obtained a nachalah(allotted inheritance), having been predestined according to the tochnit Hashem(purposeful and willed plan of G-d), who works all things after the counsel of His ratzon, 
To the end that we who were Rishonim to have tikvah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach should be to the tehillat kavod (praise of glory) of Him. 
In Moshiach you also, having heard the message of HaEmes, the Besuras HaGeulah of Yeshu'as Elokeinu which is yours, having also come to emunah, did receive your chotam (seal) in Moshiach with the Ruach Hakodesh of havtachah (promise), 
Who is bestowed as an eravon (pledge) of our nachalah (allotted inheritance), with a view to the Geulah of Hashemʼs own possession, to the tehillat kavod (praise of glory) of Him. 
Because of all of this, I, too, having heard of the emunah in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua which is yours, and having heard of your ahavah for all the Kedoshim, 
Do not cease giving hodayah (thanksgiving) for you, while speaking of you in my tefillos; 
That Hashem of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu Yehoshua, the Avi Hakavod, may give to you a ruach of chochmah and hisgalus (revelation) in the da'as (knowledge) of Moshiach. 
It is my tefillah that the eynayim of your levavot may be enlightened so that you may have da'as of what is the tikvah of His kri'ah (his summons from Shomayim), what is the osher (wealth) of the kavod of His nachalah (allotted inheritance) in the Kedoshim, 
And what is the surpassing gedulat hagevurah (greatness of His power) to us who have emunah, according to the working of the ko'ach of His might 
Which He exerted in Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach when He raised Him in the Techiyas HaMoshiach, having seated Him at His yamin (right hand) in Shomayim, 
Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the Olam Hazeh but also in Olam Habah. 
And Hashem subordinated all things under the feet of Moshiach and gave Him as Rosh over all things to the Brit Chadasha Kehillah, 
Which is the Guf HaMoshiach (body of Messiah), the melo (plentitude) of Him, who fills all in all.
