TEHILLIM.
Chapter 24.
(Mizmor of Dovid) 1 Ha'aretz is Hashemʼs, and the fullness thereof; the tevel (world), and they that dwell therein. 
For He hath founded it upon the yamim (seas), and established it upon the waters. 
Who shall ascend the Har Hashem? Or who shall stand in His Makom Kodesh? 
He that hath clean hands, and a bar levav (pure heart); who hath not lifted up his nefesh unto shahv (vanity), nor sworn l'mirmah (deceitfully). 
He shall receive the brocha (blessing) from Hashem, and tzedakah from Elohei Yisho (the G-d of his Salvation). 
This is the generation of them that seek Him, that seek Thy face, O Ya'akov. Selah 
Lift up your heads, O ye she'arim; and be ye lifted up, ye Pitchei Olam (everlasting doorways); and Melech HaKavod shall come in. 
Who is this Melech HaKavod? Hashem strong and mighty, Hashem Gibbor Milchamah. 
Lift up your heads, O ye she'arim; even lift them up, ye Pitchei Olam; and Melech HaKavod shall come in. 
Who is this Melech HaKavod? Hashem Tzva'os, He is Melech HaKavod. Selah
