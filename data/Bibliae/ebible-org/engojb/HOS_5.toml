[5]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Hear ye this, O kohanim; and pay heed, ye Bais Yisroel; and give ye ear, O Bais HaMelech; for hamishpat (the judgment) is against you, because ye have been a pach (snare, bird trap) at Mitzpah, and a reshet (net) spread upon Tavor. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And the revolters have deepened their slaughter, and I will be musar (punishment) of them all. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` I know Ephrayim, and Yisroel is not hid from Me; for now, O Ephrayim, thou committest whoredom, and Yisroel is tameh (unclean, defiled). 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Their doings do not permit them to turn unto Eloheihem; for the ruach zenunim is in the midst of them, and they have not known Hashem. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And the ga'on Yisroel (pride of Yisroel) doth testify to his face; therefore shall Yisroel and Ephrayim stumble and fall in their avon (iniquity); Yehudah also shall fall with them. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Hashem; but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` They have dealt treacherously against Hashem; for they have begotten banim zarim (strange, illegitimate children); now shall a Rosh Chodesh devour them with their fields. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Blow ye the shofar in Giv'ah, and the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud at Beit-Aven; after thee, O Binyamin! 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Ephrayim shall be desolate in the Yom Tokheichah (Day of Rebuke): among the Shivtei Yisroel have I made known that which is certain. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` The sarim (princes) of Yehudah were like them that remove the gevul (boundary stone); therefore I will pour out My wrath upon them like mayim. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Ephrayim is oppressed and crushed in mishpat (judgment), because he willingly walked after tzav (human statute). 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Therefore will I be unto Ephrayim like maggots, and to the Bais Yehudah like rottenness. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` When Ephrayim saw his sickness, and Yehudah saw his sores, then went Ephrayim to the Assyrian, and sent to the great king; yet he was not able to heal you, nor cure you of your wound. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For I will be unto Ephrayim like a lion, and as a great lion to the Bais Yehudah; I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there will be no one rescuing. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; in their tzar (affliction, distress) they will beg My favor.
