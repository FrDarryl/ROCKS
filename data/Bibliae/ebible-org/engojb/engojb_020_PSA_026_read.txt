TEHILLIM.
Chapter 26.
(Of Dovid) 1 Vindicate me, Hashem; for I have walked in mine tohm (guilelessness); I have trusted also in Hashem without wavering. 
Examine me, Hashem, and prove me; try my heart and my mind. 
For Thy chesed is before mine eyes; and I have walked in Thy emes. 
I do not sit with metei-shav (men of vanity), neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
I have hated the kehal mere'im (congregation of evil doers); and will not sit with the resha'im. 
I will wash mine hands in nikkayon (innocency, cleanness, freedom from punishment); so will I encompass Thine Mizbe'ach, Hashem; 
That I may publish with the voice of todah, and tell of all Thy wondrous works. 
Hashem, I have loved the ma'on of Thy Bais, and the Mishkan where Thine kavod dwelleth. 
Take not away my nefesh with chatta'im (sinners), nor my Chai (life) with anshei damim; 
In whose hands is zimmah (wicked plans), and their right hand is full of shochad (bribery). 
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; redeem me, v'chaneini (and be merciful and gracious unto me). 
My regel standeth on level ground; in the great assemblies unto Hashem will I render brocha.
