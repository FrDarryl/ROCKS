'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Come now, therefore, please, curse for me this people; for they are too mighty for me; perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of ha'aretz; for I know that he whom thou blessest is m'vorach (blessed), and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And Elohim said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for baruch hu (it the people is blessed). 
'''
"13" = '''

:sup:`21` And Balaam rose up in the boker, and saddled his donkey, and went with the sarim (princes) of Moav. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` But the Af Elohim (G-dʼs anger) was kindled as he was going; and the Malach Hashem stood in the derech (road) l'satan (for an adversary, opposer) against him. Now he was riding upon his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And the donkey saw the Malach Hashem standing in the derech, and his cherev drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned off the derech, and went into the sadeh; and Balaam beat the donkey, to turn her back onto the derech.

'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And Balaam answered the donkey, Because thou hast mocked me; If only there were a cherev in mine hand, would I have killed thee. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And the donkey said unto Balaam, Am not I thine donkey, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so unto thee? And he said, Loh. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Then Hashem opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Malach Hashem standing in the derech, and his cherev drawn in his hand; and he bowed down his head, and fell facedown. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` And the Malach Hashem said unto him, Why hast thou beaten thine donkey these shalosh regalim? Hinei, I came l'satan (as adversary, opposer) to thee, because thy derech is perverse before me; 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` And the donkey saw me, and turned from me these shalosh regalim; had she not turned from me, surely now also I would have slain thee, and saved her alive. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` And Balaam said unto the Malach Hashem, Chatati (I have sinned); for I was without da'as that thou stoodest in the derech against me; now, therefore, if it displease thee, I will return home. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` And the Malach Hashem said unto Balaam, Go with the anashim; but only the devar (message) that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the sarim (princes) of Balak.

'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` And Balaam said unto Balak, Hinei, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to say anything? The devar (word, message) which Elohim putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
