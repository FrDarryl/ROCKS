'''
"7" = '''

'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Then they despised the eretz chemdah (desirable land); they believed not His Devar; 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But murmured in their ohalim, and paid heed not unto the kol (voice) of Hashem. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Therefore He lifted up His yad against them, that He would overthrow them in the midbar; 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` To make their zera fall also among the Goyim, and to scatter them among the aratzot (lands). 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` They joined themselves also unto Ba'al-Pe'or, and ate the zivkhei mesim (sacrifices offered to the dead). 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Thus they provoked Him to anger with their inventions; and the magefah (plague) broke out among them. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Then stood up Pinchas, and interposed; and so the magefah (plague) was halted.

'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` They angered Him also at the waters of Merivah, so that it went ill with Moshe on their account;

'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` They did not destroy the amim (peoples), as Hashem commanded them;

"35" = '''

"36" = '''
:sup:`36` And they served their atzabim (idols); which were a mokesh (snare) unto them.

"37" = '''

"38" = '''
:sup:`38` And they shed dahm naki (innocent blood), even the dahm of their banim and of their banot, whom they sacrificed unto the atzabei Kena'an (idols of Canaan); and HaAretz was polluted with blood-guilt. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` Thus they made themselves tameh with their own ma'asim, and went a-whoring with their own inventions. 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` Therefore was the wrath of Hashem kindled against His people, insomuch that He abhorred His own nachalah. 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` And He gave them into the yad Goyim; and they that hated them ruled over them.
