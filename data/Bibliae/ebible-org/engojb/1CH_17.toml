:sup:`1` Now it came to pass, as Dovid sat in his bais, that Dovid said to Natan HaNavi, Hinei, I dwell in a bais ha'arazim (a palace of cedars) but the Aron Brit Hashem dwelleth under tent curtains.

:sup:`4` Go and tell Dovid Avdi, Thus saith Hashem, Thou shalt not build Me HaBayit to dwell in, 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For I have not dwelt in a Bayit since the day that I brought up Yisroel until this day, but have gone from ohel to ohel, and from one mishkan to another. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Wheresoever I have walked with kol Yisroel, spoke I a word to any of the Shofetim of Yisroel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, Why have ye not built me a Bais Arazim?

"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto Avdi Dovid, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, I took thee from the naveh, even from following the tzon, that thou shouldest be Nagid over My people Yisroel;

'''
"18" = '''

'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For Thy people Yisroel didst Thou make Thine own people ad olam; Thou Hashem, became their Elohim.

'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` For Thou, O Elohai, hast revealed in the ozen of Thy eved that Thou wilt build him a Bais; therefore Thy eved hath found to daven in prayer before Thee.
