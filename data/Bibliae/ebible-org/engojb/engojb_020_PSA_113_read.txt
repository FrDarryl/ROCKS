TEHILLIM.
Chapter 113.
Praise ye Hashem. Praise O ye avadim of Hashem, praise the Shem of Hashem. 
Blessed be the Shem of Hashem from this time forth and forevermore. 
From the rising of the shemesh unto the going down of the same the Shem of Hashem is to be praised. 
Hashem is high above kol Goyim, and His kavod above HaShomayim. 
Who is like unto Hashem Eloheinu, Who dwelleth on high, 
Who stoopeth down to behold the things that are in Shomayim, and in ha'aretz! 
He raiseth up the poor out of the aphar (dust), and lifteth the needy out of the ash heap; 
That he may seat him with princes, even with the princes of amo (His people). 
He settleth the akeret (barren woman) in her bais to be a happy em of banim. Praise ye Hashem.
