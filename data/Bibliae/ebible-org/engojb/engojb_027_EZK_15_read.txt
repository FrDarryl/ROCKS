YECHEZKEL.
Chapter 15.
And the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying: 
Ben adam, how is the etz hagefen (wood of the grapevine) better than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? Or will men take a yated (peg) of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
Hinei, it is cast into the eish for fuel; the eish devoureth both the ends of it, and the middle of it is charred. Is it fit for any melachah (work)? 
Hinei, when it was tamim (whole), it was fit for no work; how much less shall it be fit yet for any work, when the eish hath devoured it, and it is charred? 
Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: As the etz hagefen among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the eish for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Yerushalayim. 
And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from one eish, and another eish shall devour them; and ye shall have da'as that I am Hashem, when I set My face against them. 
And I will make ha'aretz desolate, because they have committed ma'al (unfaithfulness, betrayal of a trust), saith Adonoi Hashem.
