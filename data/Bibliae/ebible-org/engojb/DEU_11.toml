:sup:`1` Therefore thou shalt love Hashem Eloheicha, and be shomer over His mishmeret (charge, what is to be preserved), and His chukkot, and His mishpatim, and His mitzvot, always. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And know ye today; for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the musar of Hashem Eloheicha, His greatness, His yad chazakah, and His outstretched zero'a, 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And His otot, and His ma'asim, which He did in the midst of Mitzrayim unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and unto all his land; 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And what He did unto the army of Mitzrayim, unto their susim, and to their chariots; how He made the mayim of Yam Suf to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Hashem hath destroyed them unto yom hazeh;

:sup:`5` And what He did unto you in the midbar, until ye came into this place; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And what He did unto Datan and Aviram, the bnei Eliav ben Reuven; how ha'aretz opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their oholim, and every living thing in their possession, in the midst of kol Yisroel; 
'''

:sup:`10` For ha'aretz, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as Eretz Mitzrayim, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy zera, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a gan (garden) of herbs: 
'''

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Therefore shall ye lay up these My devarim in your lev and in your nefesh, and bind them for an ot upon your hand, that they may be as totafos (ornaments, Ex 13:16, Shabbos 57a) between your eyes. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And ye shall teach them your banim, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine bais, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours; from the midbar and the Levanon, from the River, the river Euphrates, even unto the Western Sea shall your border be. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` There shall no man be able to stand before you; for Hashem Eloheichem shall lay the pachad (terror, fear) of you and the dread of you upon kol ha'aretz that ye shall tread upon, as He hath said unto you. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` See, I set before you today a brocha and a kelalah;

"27" = '''
:sup:`27` A brocha, if ye obey the mitzvot Hashem Eloheichem, which I command you today;
