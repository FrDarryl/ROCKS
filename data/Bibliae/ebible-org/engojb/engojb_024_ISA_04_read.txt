YESHAYAH.
Chapter 4.
And in Yom Hahu (that day) sheva nashim (seven women) shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own lechem, and wear our own clothes; only let us be called by thy shem, to take away our disgrace. 
In Yom Hahu shall the Tzemach Hashem be beautiful and glorious, and the p'ri ha'aretz shall be the ga'on (pride) and glory for them that are escaped of Yisroel. 
And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Tziyon, and he that remaineth in Yerushalayim, shall be called kadosh, even every one that is hakatuv lachayyim(recorded for life…Rosh Hashana theme) in Yerushalayim: 
When Adonoi shall have washed away the filth of the Banot Tziyon, and shall have purged the dahm of Yerushalayim from the midst thereof by the Ruach Mishpat, and by the Ruach Ba'er (Spirit of Burning). 
And Hashem will create upon the whole place of Mount Tziyon, and upon her assemblies, an anan and smoke by yom, and the shining of a flaming eish by lailah; for upon all the kavod shall be a Chuppah. 
And there shall be a Sukkah for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
