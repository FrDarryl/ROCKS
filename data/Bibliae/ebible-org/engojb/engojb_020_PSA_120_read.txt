TEHILLIM.
Chapter 120.
(Shir HaMa'alot — Song of Ascents) 1 In my tzoros I cried unto Hashem, and He heard me. 
Save my nefesh, Hashem, from sefat sheker (lying lips), and from lashon remiyyah (a tongue of deceit). 
What shall be given unto thee? Or what shall be done unto thee, thou lashon remiyyah? 
Sharp khitzim (arrows) of the gibbor, with burning (charcoal) coals of the broom plant. 
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the ohalim of Kedar! 
My nefesh hath long dwelt with him that hateth shalom. 
I am for shalom; but when I speak, they are for milchamah (war).
