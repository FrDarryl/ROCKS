"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Yisroel is a running gefen, he bringeth forth p'ri unto himself; according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the mizbechot; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly matzevot (stone pillars, monuments). 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Their lev is deceitful; now shall they bear guilt; He shall break down their mizbechot, He shall destroy their matzevot. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For now they shall say: We have no Melech, because we feared not Hashem; but if we did have a Melech, what could he do for us? 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They have spoken words, swearing falsely in cutting brit (covenant); thus mishpat springeth up as poisonous herb in the furrows of the sadeh. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` The inhabitants of Shomron tremble because of the eglot (calf-idols) of Beit-Aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, likewise the komer (idolatrous priests), who shout for joy over it, for its kavod from it has departed. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a minchah (present) to the great king; Ephrayim shall receive disgrace, and Yisroel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` As for Shomron, her melech will float off like a twig upon the surface of the mayim. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` The high places also of Aven, the chattat Yisroel, shall be made shmad; the kotz (thorn) and the dardar (thistle) shall come up on their mizbechot; and they shall say to the mountains: Cover us; and to the hills: Fall on us. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` O Yisroel, thou hast sinned from the yamei Giv'ah; there they have continued. Did not milchamah (war) overtake the bnei alvah (children of unruliness) in Giv'ah? 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` When I please, I will chastise them; amim shall be gathered against them, when they are punished for their shtei avon (double iniquity). 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And Ephrayim is an eglah melummadah (a trained heifer), and loveth to tread out the grain; but I will put a yoke on her fair neck; I will drive Ephrayim; Yehudah shall plow, and Ya'akov shall break his clods. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Sow to yourselves in tzedakah, reap in chesed; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek Hashem, till He come and rain tzedek upon you. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Ye have plowed resha, ye have reaped avlah; ye have eaten the pri kachash (fruit of lies); because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy gibborim (mighty men). 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be devastated, as Shalman devastated Beit-Arbel on the yom milchamah; the em were dashed in pieces with their banim. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` So, O Beit-El, shall it be done unto you because of your great wickedness; in the shachar (dawn) shall the Melech Yisroel utterly be cut off.
