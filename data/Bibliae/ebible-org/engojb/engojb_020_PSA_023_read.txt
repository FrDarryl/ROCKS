TEHILLIM.
Chapter 23.
(Mizmor of Dovid) 1Hashem is my Ro'eh (Shepherd); I shall not lack. 
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the mei menuchot (tranquil waters). 
He restoreth my nefesh; He guideth me in the paths of tzedek l'ma'an Shmo (righteousness for the sake of His Name). 
Yea, though I walk through the Gey Tzalmavet (Valley of the Shadow of Death), I will fear no rah (evil); for Thou art with me; Thy shevet (rod) and Thy staff they comfort me. 
Thou preparest a shulchan before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with shemen (olive oil); my kos runneth over. 
Surely tov and chesed shall follow me kol y'mei chaiyyai (all the days of my life): and I will dwell in the Bais Hashem l'orech yamim (for length of days, whole life long, forever).
