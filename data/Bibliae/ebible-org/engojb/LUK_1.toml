'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` I thought it expedient also, having done an iyun (investigative research), accurately and carefully being meayen (engaged in research) in every source and making a medakdeke (pain-stakingly thorough) investigation of every aspect from HaReshit (the Beginning), to write for you and to mesader (arrange, place in succession) an orderly account, most noble Theophilus,

'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` But the malach said to him, Do not have pachad (fear), Zecharyah. Your tefillah (prayer) was heard and your isha, Elisheva, will bear a ben to you and you will call his shem Yochanan.

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And Zecharyah said to the malach, Just how will I have daas that this is so? For I am old and my isha is advanced in her yamim (days). 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And in reply, the malach said to Zecharyah, I am Gavriel, I stand before Hashem. And I was sent to speak to you and to announce these things to you. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And hinei! You will be illem (mute) and not be able to speak, until the yom (day) when these things come to pass, because you did not have emunah in my devarim (words), which will be fulfilled in their time. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And the people were expecting Zecharyah and they were bewildered at his delay in the Beis HaMikdash. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And when he came out, he was illem (mute) and not able to speak to them, and they had daas that he had seen a chazon in the Heikhal. He kept motioning to them and he remained illem.

'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Hashem has done this for me. In these yamim he looked with Chen vChesed (favor and mercy, loving kindness) on me to take away my reproach among Bnei Adam. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Now in the chodesh shishi the malach Gavriel was sent from Hashem to a shtetl in the Galil called Natzeret,

'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And when the malach approached her, he said, Shalom, favored one! Hashem is with you! 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` But she was greatly perplexed at the message, and kept pondering what sort of Shalom greeting this might be. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And the malach said to her, Do not have pachad (fear), Miryam, for you have found chen before Hashem.

'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` He will be gadol (great) and will be called Ben HaElyon (Son of the Most High). Adonoi Elohim will give him the kisse Dovid Aviv,

'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` And in reply, the malach said to her, The Ruach Hakodesh will come upon you and the gevurah of HaElyon will overshadow you. Therefore, also, the one being born will be called HaKadosh (The Holy One), Ben HaElohim. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` And Elisheva your krovah also has conceived a ben in her old age, and this chodesh is hashishi (the sixth) for her who is called barren. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` For nothing will be impossible with Hashem. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` And Miryam said, Hinei! I am the shifcha of Hashem. May it be done to me according to your dvar. And the malach departed from her.

'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` And why has this happened to me that the Em Adoni should come to me?

"44" = '''
:sup:`44` For hinei! When the sound of your Birkat Shalom came into my ears, the yeled leaped with simcha in my womb. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` And ashrey is the one having had emunah that there will be a fulfillment to the things having been spoken to Miryam by Hashem. 
'''
"46" = '''

:sup:`50` And the chesed of Hashem is DOR VDOR to those with yirat Shomayim. 
'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` Hashem has done niflaot (wonders) with his zeroa (arm). He scattered those who in the machshavot (thoughts) of their levavot are the Gaayonim (the Haughty ones).

'''
"73" = '''
:sup:`73` The Brit HaShevu'ah (the Covenant of the oath) which He swore to Avraham Avinu to grant us, 
'''
"74" = '''
:sup:`74` Having been delivered from the yad haoyvim (hand of enemies) of us to serve Hashem fearlessly,
