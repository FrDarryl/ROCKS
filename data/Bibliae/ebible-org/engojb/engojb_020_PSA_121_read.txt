TEHILLIM.
Chapter 121.
(Shir HaMa'alot) 1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the harim (hills), from whence cometh ezri (my help). 
Ezri (my help) cometh from Hashem, Oseh Shomayim va'Aretz. 
He will not allow thy regel to slip; He that is shomer over thee will not slumber. 
Hinei, He that is shomer over Yisroel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
Hashem is the One shomer over thee; Hashem is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
The shemesh shall not strike thee by day, nor the yarei'ach by night. 
Hashem shall preserve thee from kol rah; He shall preserve thy nefesh. 
Hashem shall be shomer over thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even v'ad olam.
