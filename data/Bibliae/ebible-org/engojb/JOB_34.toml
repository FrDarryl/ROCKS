:sup:`2` Hear my words, O ye chachamim; and give ear unto me, ye that have da'as. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For the ozen trieth words, as the mouth tasteth food. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Let us choose for ourselves what is mishpat (right); let us know among ourselves what is tov. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For Iyov hath said, I am innocent; and El hath taken away my mishpat (right). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` I declare the mishpat (case) against me a lie; though without peysha, my arrow wound is incurable. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` What gever is like Iyov, who drinketh up the scorn of his friends like mayim?

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Who goeth in chaverah with the po'alei aven (workers of iniquity, evildoers), and walketh with anshei resha. 
'''

:sup:`9` For he hath said, It profiteth a gever nothing that he should please Elohim. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore pay heed unto me ye anashei levav (men of understanding); far be it from El, that He should do evil, and from Shaddai, that He should do wrong. 
'''

:sup:`11` For the po'al adam (work of a man) shall He repay unto him, and make every man to find according to the man ºs ways.

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Shall even one that hateth mishpat (right) govern? And wilt thou condemn Him that is Tzaddik and Kabir (the Mighty One)? 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Is it fit to say to a melech, Thou art beli'ya'al? And to nobles, Ye are rasha. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Who shows no partiality to sarim (princes), nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they all are the ma'aseh (work) of His hands. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` In a moment shall they die, and at chatzot lailah the people shall be shaken, and pass away, and the mighty shall be taken away without human hand.

"22" = '''

'''
"25" = '''

'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` He striketh them as resha'im in the open sight of others; 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Because they turned back from following Him, and would not regard any of His drakhim; 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto Him, and He heareth the cry of the aniyim. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` When He giveth quietness, who then can condemn? When He hideth His panim, who then can behold Him? Whether it be a nation, or an individual only? 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` That the chanef (hypocrite) reign not, nor those who ensnare the people. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` For has anyone said unto El, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more; 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` Teach Thou me what I see not; im (if) I have done iniquity, I will do no more? 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Will He then recompense to suit you, just because you disavow it? Thou must choose, not I; therefore speak that of which thou hast da'as. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Let anshei levav (men of understanding) say to me, and let a gever chacham who pays heed unto me say, 
'''

'''

:sup:`36` Iyov ought to be tried unto the limit, because his answers are those of anshei aven. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` For he addeth peysha unto his chattat, he clappeth his hands (shaking fist at G-d) among us, and multiplieth his words against El.
