TEHILLIM.
Chapter 146.
Praise Hashem. Praise Hashem, O my nefesh. 
While I live will I praise Hashem: I will sing praise unto Elohai while I have any being. 
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the ben adam, in whom there is no teshuah (salvation). 
His ruach departs, he returneth to his adamah; in yom hahu his plans come to nothing. 
Ashrei is he that hath El Ya'akov for his ezer, whose hope is in Hashem Elohav: 
Oseh Shomayim vaAretz, the yam, and all that therein is: HaShomer Emes l'olam (Who keepeth Truth forever): 
Oseh mishpat for the oppressed; Who giveth lechem to the hungry. Hashem mattir asurim (sets free the prisoners): 
Hashem openeth the eyes of the ivrim: Hashem raiseth them that are bowed down: Hashem loveth the tzaddikim: 
Hashem shomer over the gerim; He relieveth the yatom (fatherless, orphan) and almanah; but the Derech Resha'im He frustrates. 
Hashem shall reign l'olam, even thy G-d, O Tziyon, l'dor vador. Praise Hashem.
