:sup:`1` In the beginning of the reign of Y'hoyakim (Jehoiakim) Ben Yoshiyah Melech Yehudah came this Davar from Hashem saying, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Thus saith Hashem: Stand in the khatzer (courtyard) of the Bais Hashem, and speak unto all the towns of Yehudah, which come to worship in the Bais Hashem, all the Devarim that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` If so be they will pay heed, turn every man from his derech hara'ah, that I may relent of the ra'ah, which I purpose to do unto them for the evil of their doings. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Hashem: If ye will not pay heed to Me, to walk in My torah, which I have set before you, 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` To pay heed to the Devarim of My Avadim the Nevi'im, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early and sending them, but ye have not paid heed; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Then will I make this Bais like Shiloh, and will make this city a kelalah (curse) to all the Goyim of Ha'Aretz. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` So the kohanim and the nevi'im and kol HaAm heard Yirmeyah speaking these Devarim in the Bais Hashem. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Now it came to pass, when Yirmeyah had made an end of speaking all that Hashem had commanded him to speak unto kol HaAm, that the kohanim and the nevi'im and kol HaAm laid hold of him, saying, Thou shalt surely die. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Why hast thou prophesied B'Shem Hashem, saying, This Bais shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And kol HaAm were gathered against Yirmeyah in the Bais Hashem. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` When the sarim of Yehudah heard these things, then they came up from the Bais HaMelech to the Beis Hashem, and sat down in the petach Sha'ar HeChadash (entrance of the New Gate) of the Beis Hashem. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Then spoke the kohanim and the nevi'im unto the sarim and to kol HaAm, saying, Mishpat mavet for this ish! For he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your oznayim. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then spoke Yirmeyah unto all the sarim and to kol HaAm, saying, Hashem sent me to prophesy against this Bais and against this city all the Devarim that ye have heard. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Therefore now reform your drakhim and your doings, and obey the voice of Hashem Eloheichem; and Hashem will relent of the ra'ah that He hath pronounced against you. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` As for me, see, I am in your yad; do with me as seemeth tov and yashar unto you. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring dahm naki upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for b'emes Hashem hath sent me unto you to speak all these Devarim in your oznayim. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Then said the sarim and kol HaAm unto the kohanim and to the nevi'im; This ish is not mishpat mavet (worthy of death); for he hath spoken to us B'Shem Hashem Eloheinu. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Then rose up anashim zekenim ha'aretz, and spoke to kol kehal HaAm, saying, 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Michah the Morashti prophesied in the days of Chizkiyah Melech Yehudah, and spoke to kol Am Yehudah, saying, Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: Tziyon shall be plowed like a sadeh, and Yerushalayim shall become rubble heaps, and the Har HaBais (Temple Mount) like the bare heights of a ya'ar (forest). 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Did Chizkiyah Melech Yehudah and kol Yehudah put him to death? Did he not fear Hashem, and besought Hashem, and Hashem relented of the ra'ah which He had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure ra'ah gedolah against nafshoteinu. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And there was also an ish that prophesied B'Shem Hashem, Uriyah Ben Shema'yahu of Kiryat-HaYe'arim, who prophesied against this city and against HaAretz Hazot according to all the devarim of Yirmeyah. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And when Y'hoyakim (Jehoiakim) HaMelech, with all his gibborim, and all the sarim, heard his words, HaMelech sought to put him to death; but when Uriyah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Mitzrayim; 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And Y'hoyakim HaMelech sent anashim into Mitzrayim, namely, Elnatan Ben Achbor, and certain anashim with him into Mitzrayim. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And they brought Uriyah out of Mitzrayim, and brought him unto Y'hoyakim HaMelech; who slaughtered him with the cherev, and cast his nevelah (dead body) into the kevarim of the Bnei HaAm (common people). 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Nevertheless the yad (hand, influence) of Achikam Ben Shaphan was with Yirmeyah, that they should not give him into the yad HaAm to put him to death.
