"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Hashem, rebuke me not in Thy wrath; neither chasten me in Thy hot displeasure. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For Thine khitzim (arrows) pierce me, and Thy Yad presseth upon me. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` There is no health in my basar because of Thine anger; neither is there any shalom in my atzmot because of my chattat. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For mine avonot (iniquities) are gone over mine head; as a weighty massa (burden) they are too heavy for me.

"6" = '''
:sup:`6` My chaburot (wounds) are foul and festering because of my wicked folly. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` I am bent down; I am brought low ad me'od; I go about mourning all day long. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no health in my basar. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` I am feeble and broken ad me'od; I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my lev. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Adonoi, all my ta'avah (desire, longing) is before Thee; and my groaning is not hid from Thee. 
'''
"11" = '''

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` My loved ones and my re'a stand aloof from my nega; and my neighbors stand afar off. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` They also that seek after my nefesh lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak of ruin, and plot mirmot (deceptions, deceits) all the day long. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` But I, like a cheresh (deaf man), heard not; and I was like a mute that openeth not his mouth. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Thus I was like an ish that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no tokhachot (reproofs). 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For I wait for Thee, Hashem; Thou wilt hear, Adonoi Elohai. 
'''
"17" = '''

'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` They also that repay ra'ah for tovah are mine adversaries; because I pursue the thing that is tov.
