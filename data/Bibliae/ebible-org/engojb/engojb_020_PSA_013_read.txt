TEHILLIM.
Chapter 13.
(For the one directing. Mizmor Dovid) 
How long wilt Thou forget me, Hashem? Netzach (forever)? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me? 
How long shall I take counsel in my nefesh, having sorrow in my lev daily? How long shall mine oyev be exalted over me? 
Consider and hear me, Hashem Elohai; enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of mavet; 
Lest mine oyev say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am defeated. 
But I have trusted in Thy chesed; my lev shall rejoice in Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation). 6 I will sing unto Hashem, because He hath dealt bountifully with me.
