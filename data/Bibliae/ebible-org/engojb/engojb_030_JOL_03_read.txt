YOEL.
Chapter 3.
And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Ruach upon all basar; and your banim and your banot shall prophesy, your zekenim shall dream chalomot, your bochurim shall see chezyonot (visions): 
And also upon the avadim and upon the shefachot in those days will I pour out My Ruach. 
And I will show mofetim in the heavens and in the earth, dahm, and eish, and pillars of smoke. 
The shemesh shall be turned into choshech, and the yarei'ach into dahm, before the great and terrible Yom Hashem comes. 
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the Shem of Adonoi shall be saved; for in Mount Tziyon and in Yerushalayim shall be deliverance, as Hashem hath said, and in the seridim whom Hashem shall call.
