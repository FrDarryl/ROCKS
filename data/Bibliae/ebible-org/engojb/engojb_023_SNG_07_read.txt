SHIR HASHIRIM.
Chapter 7.
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may gaze upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the mecholat Machanayim (dance of the Machanayim). 
How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O princeʼs daughter! Thy graceful legs are like jewels, ma'aseh yedei amon (the work of the hands of an artist). 
Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not wine: thy waist is like a mound of chittim (wheat) encircled by shoshanim (lilies). 
Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle. 
Thy tzavar (neck) is like a migdal of ivory; thine eyes like the pools of Cheshbon, by the sha'ar (gate) of Bat-Rabbim; thy nose is like the migdal of the Levanon which looketh toward Damascus. 
Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like royal tapestry; Melech is held captive in its tresses. 
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O Ahavah, for delights! 
This thy stature is like a tamar (palm tree), and thy breasts eshkolot (clusters of fruit). 
I said: I will climb up to the tamar, I will take hold of the branches thereof; now also thy breasts shall be as eshkelot hagefen (clusters of the vine), and the scent of thy breath like apples; 
And the roof of thy mouth like the best yayin of dodi (my beloved), that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. 
I am my belovedʼs, and to me goeth forth his teshukah (desire). 
Come, dodi (my beloved), let us go forth into the sadeh; let us lodge in the villages. 
Let us get up early to the kramim (vineyards); let us see if the gefen budded, whether the tender grape appears, and the pomegranates bloom; there will I give thee my love. 
The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of pleasant fruits, chadashim (new ones) and yeshanim (old ones), which I have stored up and kept for thee, O dodi (my beloved).
