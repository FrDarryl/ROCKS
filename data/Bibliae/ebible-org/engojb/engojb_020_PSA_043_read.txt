TEHILLIM.
Chapter 43.
Vindicate me, O Elohim, and plead my cause against a nation lo chasid; O deliver me from the ish mirmah v'avlah (deceitful and unjust man). 
For Thou art the Elohei Ma'oz of me. Why dost Thou cast me off? Why must I go mourning because of the oppression of the oyev? 
O send out Thy Ohr and Thy Emes; let them guide me; let them bring me unto Thy Har Kodesh, and to Thy Mishkan. 
Then will I go unto the Mizbe'ach of Elohim, unto El my exceeding joy; yea, upon the kinnor will I praise Thee, O Elohim Elohai. 
Why art thou cast down, O my nefesh? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in Elohim; for I shall yet praise Him, Who is the Yeshu'ot of my countenance, and Elohai.
