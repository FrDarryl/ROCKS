TEHILLIM.
Chapter 112.
Praise Hashem. Ashrei is the ish that feareth Hashem, that delighteth greatly in His mitzvot. 
His zera shall be gibbor ba'aretz; the dor (generation) of the Yesharim (upright ones) shall be blessed. 
Wealth and osher (riches) shall be in his bais; and his tzedakah endureth forever. 
Unto the Yesharim (upright ones) there ariseth ohr in the choshech; he is channun, and rachum, and tzaddik. 
A tov ish is generous, and lendeth; he will guide his affairs with mishpat. 
Surely he shall never falter; the tzaddik shall be in remembrance olam (forever). 
He shall not be afraid of mishmu'ah ra'ah (news of misfortune, evil tidings); his lev is nachon (steadfast), trusting in Hashem. 
His lev is samuch (sustained), he shall not be afraid, until he look in triumph upon his foes. 
He hath contributed freely, he hath given to the evyonim (needy); his tzedakah endureth forever; his keren shall be lifted up in kavod. 
The rasha shall see it, and be incensed; he shall gnash his teeth, and waste away; the ta'avot resha'im (desire of the wicked ones) shall come to nothing.
