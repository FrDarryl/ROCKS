TEHILLIM.
Chapter 131.
(Shir HaMa'alot, of Dovid) 1Hashem, my lev is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in gedolot, or in things too high for me. 
Surely I have stilled and quieted my nefesh, as a child that is weaned of immo; my nefesh is even as a weaned child. 
Let Yisroel hope in Hashem from henceforth and ad olam.
