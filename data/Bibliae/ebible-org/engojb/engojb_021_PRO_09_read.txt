MISHLE.
Chapter 9.
Chochmah hath built her bais, she hath hewn out her seven ammudim; 
She hath prepared her meat; she hath mixed her yayin; she hath also set her shulchan. 
She hath sent forth her na'arot; she calleth from the highest points of the city; 
Whosoever is simple, let him turn in here; as for him that lacketh lev (a heart of understanding), she saith to him, 
Come, eat of my lechem, and drink of the yayin which I have mixed. 
Forsake the simple ways, and live; and go in the derech binah. 
He that reproveth a letz (mocker) getteth to himself shame, and he that is a mochiach (reprover) of a wicked man getteth himself a blot stain. 
Reprove not a letz, lest he hate thee; rebuke a chacham, and he will love thee. 
Give instruction to a chacham, and he will be yet wiser; teach a tzaddik, and he will increase in learning. 
The Yirat Hashem is the beginning of chochmah, and the da'as Kedoshim (knowledge of the Holy One) is binah (understanding). 
For by me thy yamim shall be multiplied, and shanot chayyim shall be increased to thee. 
If thou be chacham, thou shalt be wise for thyself, but if thou mockest, thou alone shalt suffer. 
Aishes Kesilut (Dame Folly) is clamorous; she is simple, and knoweth nothing. 
For she sitteth at the petach (doorway) of her bais, on a seat in the high places of the city, 
To call those passing on the derech (road) who go straight on their way: 
Whoso is simple, let him turn in here, and as for him that lacketh lev (heart of understanding), she saith to him: 
Stolen waters are sweet, and lechem eaten in secret is pleasant. 
But he has no da'as that the dead ones are there; and that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
