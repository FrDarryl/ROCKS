:sup:`1` Yet the number of the Bnei Yisroel shall be as the sand of the yam (sea), which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are lo ammi (not My people), there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the Bnei El Chai. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Then shall the Bnei Yehudah and the Bnei Yisroel be gathered together, and appoint for them Rosh Echad, and they shall come up out of ha'aretz; for gadol shall be the Yom Yizre'el (Day of Jezreel).

'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Plead with immechem (your mother), plead; for she is not my isha (wife), neither am I her ish (husband); let her therefore put away her zenunim (whoredoms) out of her sight, and her na'afufim (adulteries) from between her breasts; 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Lest I strip her naked, and set her as bare as the day she was born, and make her as a midbar, and turn her like an eretz tziyyah (parched land), and kill her with tzamah (thirst). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And I will not have mercy upon her banim; for they are the bnei zenunim. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For their em hath played the zonah (prostitute); she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said: I will go after my lovers, that give me my lechem and my mayim, my wool and my flax, mine shemen (oil) and my shikkui (drink).

'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And I will visit upon her the yamim of Ba'alim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her ring and her jewelry, and she went after her lovers, and forgot Me, 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Therefore, hinei, I will allure her, and bring her into the midbar, and speak to her lev. 
'''
"17" = '''

'''
"20" = '''

'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And I will betroth thee unto Me l'olam; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in tzedek, and in mishpat, and in chesed, and in rachamim.
