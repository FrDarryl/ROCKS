ZECHARYAH.
Chapter 3.
And he showed me Yehoshua the Kohen HaGadol standing before the Malach Hashem, and HaSatan standing at his right hand to accuse him. 
And Hashem said unto HaSatan, Hashem rebuke thee, O HaSatan; even Hashem that hath chosen Yerushalayim rebuke thee. Is not this a brand, a burning stick, snatched out of the eish? 
Now Yehoshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the malach. 
And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, See, I have taken away thine avon (iniquity, guilt) from thee, and I will clothe thee with machalatzot (extra fine, white clothing). 
And I said, Let them set a tzanif tahor (clean turban), upon his head. So they set a tzanif tahor upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the Malach Hashem stood by. 
And the Malach Hashem testified unto Yehoshua, saying: 
Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os: If thou shalt walk in My ways, and if thou shalt keep My charge, then thou shalt also judge My Beis, and shalt also keep My courts, and I will give thee ways to walk among these standing here. 
Hear now, O Yehoshua the Kohen HaGadol, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee, for they are Anshei Mofet (men of portent); for, hinei, I will bring forth Avdi Tzemach (My Servant, the Branch). 
For hinei the even (stone) that I have set before Yehoshua; upon one even (stone) shall be shivah einayim (seven eyes); hineni, I will engrave the inscription thereof, saith Hashem Tzva'os, and I will remove the avon (iniquity, guilt) of that land in Yom Echad. 
In Yom HaHu, saith Hashem Tzva'os, shall ye invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.
