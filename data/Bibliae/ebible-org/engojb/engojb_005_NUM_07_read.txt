BAMIDBAR.
Chapter 7.
And it came to pass on the day that Moshe had fully set up the Mishkan, and had anointed it, and set it apart as kodesh, and all the instruments thereof, both the Mizbe'ach and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and set them apart as kodesh, 
That the Nasiim (Rulers) of Yisroel, heads of the Bais of their Avot, who were the Nasiim of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered; 
And they brought their korban before Hashem, six covered carts, and twelve oxen; a cart for two of the Nasiim, and for each one an ox; and they brought them before the Mishkan. 
And Hashem spoke unto Moshe, saying, 
Take it of them, that they may be for the service of the Ohel Mo'ed; and thou shalt give them unto the Levi'im, to every man according to his service. 
And Moshe took the carts and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levi'im. 
Two carts and four oxen he gave unto the Bnei Gershon, according to their service; 
And four carts and eight oxen he gave unto the Bnei Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Itamar ben Aharon HaKohen. 
But unto the Bnei Kehat he gave none, because the service of HaKodesh belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders. 
And the Nasiim offered for dedicating of the Mizbe'ach in the day that it was anointed, even the Nasiim (Rulers) offered their korban before the Mizbe'ach. 
And Hashem said unto Moshe, They shall offer their korban, each Nasi on his day, for the dedicating of the Mizbe'ach.
