HOSHEA.
Chapter 3.
Then said Hashem unto me, Go again, love an isha (woman, wife) beloved of her re'a (friend, companion), yet a noefet (adulteress), just like the ahavat Hashem toward the Bnei Yisroel, who look to elohim acharim, and love heathen religion raisin cakes. 
So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of kesef, and for a chomer and a half of se'orim; 
And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide with me yamim rabbim and shalt not play the zonah, and thou shalt not be for another ish; and thus will I also towards thee. 1 
For the Bnei Yisroel shall abide yamim rabbim without a melech, and without a sar, and without a zevach, and without a matzevah (stone pillar, monument) and without an ephod (sacred vest used for consulting a deity), and without teraphim (household idols); 
Afterward shall the Bnei Yisroel return, and seek Hashem Eloheihem, and Dovid their melech; and shall fear Hashem and His goodness in the acharit hayamim (last days).
