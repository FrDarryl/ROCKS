YESHAYAH.
Chapter 20.
In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon Melech Ashur sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it; 
At the same time spoke Hashem by Yeshayah Ben Amotz, saying, Go and remove the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy sandal from thy regel. And he did so, going arom (naked, stripped) and barefoot. 
And Hashem said, Just as Avdi Yeshayah hath walked arom (naked) and barefoot shalosh shanim for an ot and mofet against Mitzrayim and Kush; 
So shall Melech Ashur (Assyria) lead away captive Mitzrayim and Golus-exiled Kush, ne'arim and zekenim, aron (naked) and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Mitzrayim. 
And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Kush their expectation, and of Mitzrayim their tiferet (glory, boast). 
And the inhabitants of this coast shall say in that day, Hinei, such is our expectation, where we fled for ezrah (help) to be delivered from Melech Ashur; and how shall we escape?
