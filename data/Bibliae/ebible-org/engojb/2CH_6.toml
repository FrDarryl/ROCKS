'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Since HaYom when I brought forth Ami out of Eretz Mitzrayim I chose no city among all the Shivtei Yisroel to build a Bais in, that Shmi might be there; neither chose I any ish to be a Nagid over Ami Yisroel, 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` But I chose Yerushalayim, that Shmi might be there; and chose Dovid to be over Ami Yisroel. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Now it was in the levav Dovid Avi to build a Bais for the Shem of Hashem Elohei Yisroel. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But Hashem said to Dovid Avi, Because it was in levavcha to build a Bais for Shmi, thou didst well in that it was in levavcha. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Nevertheless thou shalt not build HaBeis; but bincha (your Son) which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build HaBeis for Shmi. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Hashem therefore hath performed His Devar that He hath spoken; for I am risen up after Dovid Avi, and I sit on the kisse Yisroel, just as Hashem promised, and I built HaBeis for the Shem of Hashem Elohei Yisroel.

:sup:`18` But will Elohim really dwell with HaAdam on ha'aretz? Hinei, Shomayim and the Shmei HaShomayim cannot contain Thee; how much less this Beis which I built! 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Yet give attention to the tefillah of Thy eved, and to his techinnah (supplication), O Hashem Elohai, to pay heed unto the cry and the tefillah which Thy eved prayeth before Thee;

"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Then hear Thou from Shomayim, and forgive the sin of Thy avadim, and of Thy people Yisroel, when Thou hast taught them the Derech HaTovah, wherein they should walk; and send matar upon Thy land, which Thou hast given unto Thy people for a nachalah. 
'''
