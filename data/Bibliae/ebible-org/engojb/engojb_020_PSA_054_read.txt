TEHILLIM.
Chapter 54.
(For the director. With stringed instruments. A maskil. For Dovid, 
when the Ziphim came and said to Sha'ul, Dovid is in hiding among us) 
Hoshieini (save me), O Elohim, by Shimecha, and vindicate me by Thy gevurah (might, power). 
Hear my tefillah, O Elohim; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
For zarim (strangers) are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my nefesh; they have not set Elohim before them. Selah 
Hinei, Elohim is mine Ozer (helper); Adonoi is with them that uphold my nefesh. 
He shall recompense the rah (evil) unto mine enemies; in Thy emes cut them off. 
I will sacrifice a nedavah (freewill offering) unto Thee; I will praise Shimecha, Hashem; for it is tov (good). 
For He hath delivered me out of all my tzoros; and mine eye hath looked in triumph upon mine oyevim (enemies.)
