TEHILLIM.
Chapter 75.
(For the one directing. Set to Do Not Destroy. Mizmor Asaph. Shir) 
Hodinu l'cha Elohim (Unto thee, Elohim, do we give thanks). Hodinu; that Thy Shem is near Thy wondrous works declare. 
I shall seize the mo'ed (appointed time), I will judge uprightly. 
Eretz and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolving; I, even I, hold up the ammudim (pillars) of it. Selah 
I said unto the hollelim (arrogant), Deal not boastfully; and to the resha'im, Lift not up the keren; 
Lift not up your keren on high; speak not with a stiff neck. 
For promotion cometh lo (not) from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert. 
But Elohim is the Shofet; He bringeth down one, and setteth up another. 
For in the yad Hashem there is a kos, and the yayin is foaming; full of mixture; and He poureth out of the same; but the dregs thereof, all rishei aretz (wicked of the earth) shall drain them down, and drink them. 
But I will proclaim l'olam; I will sing zemirot to Elohei Ya'akov. 
All the karnayim of the resha'im also will I cut off; but the karnayim of the tzaddik shall be exalted.
