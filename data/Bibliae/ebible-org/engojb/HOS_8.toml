[8]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Set the shofar to thy lips. He shall come as a nesher against the Bais Hashem, because they have transgressed My brit (covenant), and committed pesha against My torah. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Yisroel shall cry unto Me: Elohai, we know Thee. We, Yisroel! 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Yisroel hath cast off the thing that is tov; the oyev (enemy) shall pursue him. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They have set up melachim, but not from Me; they have made sarim (princes), and I knew it not; of their kesef and their zahav have they made them atzabim (idols), that they may be cut off. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Thy egel (calf-idol), O Shomron, I am casting off; Mine anger is kindled against them; how long will they be incapable of nikkayon (innocency, freedom from punishment)? 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` They are from Yisroel! The craftsman made it; therefore it is not Elohim; but the egel of Shomron shall be broken in pieces. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; the stalk of standing grain hath no tzemach (shoot); it shall yield no kemach (flour); and even if it yielded it, zarim would devour it. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Yisroel is swallowed up; now shall they be among the Goyim like a worthless keli (vessel). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For they are gone up to Assyria, a pere (wild donkey) off by itself alone; Ephrayim hath sold herself to ahavim (lovers). 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Yea, though they have bargained among the Goyim, now will I gather them, and they shall begin to diminish on account of the massa (burden) of Melech Sarim. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Because Ephrayim hath built many mizbechot for sin, mizbechot shall be unto him to sin. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` I have written to him the many things of My torah, but they were regarded as a zar (strange thing). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` They sacrifice basar for the sacrifices of Mine offerings, and eat it; but Hashem accepteth them not; now will He remember their avon (iniquity), and visit punishment on their sins; they shall return to Mitzrayim. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For Yisroel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth heikhalot; and Yehudah hath multiplied fortified towns; but I will send eish upon his towns, and it shall devour the citadels thereof.
