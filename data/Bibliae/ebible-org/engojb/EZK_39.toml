:sup:`1` Therefore, thou Ben Adam, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Hineni, I am against thee, O Gog, nasi rosh Meshech and Tuval; 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And I will turn thee around, and drive thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the far north, and will bring thee upon the harim of Yisroel; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And I will knock thy keshet out of thy left hand, and will cause thine khitzim to fall out of thy right hand. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Thou shalt fall upon the harim of Yisroel, thou, and all thy troops, and the peoples with thee; I will give thee unto the birds of prey of every sort, and to the beasts of the sadeh to be devoured. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Thou shalt fall upon the open sadeh; for I have spoken it, saith Adonoi Hashem.

'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` So will I make Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name) known in the midst of My people Yisroel; and I will not let them profane Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name) any more: and the Goyim shall know that I am Hashem Kadosh b'Yisroel. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Hinei, it is coming, and it shall be done, saith Adonoi Hashem; this is the day whereof I have spoken. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And they that dwell in the towns of Yisroel shall go forth, and shall use for fuel and set on fire the weapons, both the mogen and the bucklers, the keshet and the khitzim, and the clubs, and the spears, and they shall burn them with eish sheva shanim; 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` So that they shall take no wood for fuel out of the sadeh, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with eish; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and pillage those that looted them, saith Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a makom kever (burial place) there in Yisroel â€” the valley of those who pass by, east of the yam; and it shall block the path of the passersby; and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it Gey Hamon Gog. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And seven months shall Bais Yisroel be burying them, that they may make ha'aretz tahor. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Indeed, kol Am Ha'Aretz shall bury them; and it shall give them renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And they shall set apart anshei tamid (a regular detail of men) to work at passing through ha'aretz to bury those passing through, those bodies remaining upon the face of ha'aretz, to make it tahor; for the whole of seven months shall they make the search. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the ones passing through ha'aretz, when any seeth an etzem adam (human bone), then shall he build a tziyun (marker) beside it, until the mekabberim (buriers) have buried it in the Gey Hamon Gog. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And also the shem of the Ir shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they make ha'aretz tahor. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And, thou ben adam, thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the sadeh, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to My zevach (sacrificial feast) that I do sacrifice for you, even a Zevach Gadol upon the harim of Yisroel, that ye may eat basar, and drink dahm. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Ye shall eat the basar gibborim, and drink the dahm of the nasi'im of ha'aretz, as of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And ye shall eat chelev until ye be glutted, and drink dahm until ye be shikkaron, from My Zevach which I have sacrificed for you. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Thus ye shall be filled at My shulchan with susim and riders, with gibbor, and with all ish hamilchamah, saith Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And I will set My Kavod among the Goyim, and kol HaGoyim shall see My mishpat that I have executed, and My yad that I have laid upon them. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` So Bais Yisroel shall know that I am Hashem Eloheihem from that day and forward. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And the Goyim shall know that Bais Yisroel went into the Golus for their avon; because they were unfaithful to Me; therefore hid I My face from them, and gave them into the yad of their enemies; so fell they all by the cherev. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` According to their tumah and according to their peysha'im have I dealt with them, and hid My face from them. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Now will I bring back the captives of Ya'akov, and have compassion upon kol Bais Yisroel, and will be jealous for Shem Kodshi (Name of My Holiness, Holy Name); 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` After that they have borne their shame, and all their unfaithfulness whereby they have been unfaithful against Me, when they dwelt securely in their adamah, and none made them afraid. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` When I have brought them back from the nations, and regathered them out of the lands of their oyevim, and am set apart as kodesh through them in the sight of Goyim rabbim; 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Then shall they know that I am Hashem Eloheihem, Who caused them to be led into the Golus among the Goyim; but I have regathered them unto their own adamah (land), and have left none of them behind any more in the Golus. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Neither will I hide My face any more from them; for I have poured out My Ruach upon Bais Yisroel, saith Adonoi Hashem.
