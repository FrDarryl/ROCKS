TEHILLIM.
Chapter 100.
(Mizmor l'todah) 1 Make a joyful shout unto Hashem, all ye lands. 
Serve Hashem with simchah; come before His presence with joyful singing. 
Know ye that Hashem He is Elohim; it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves, His people, the tzon of His pasture. 
Enter into His she'arim (gates) with todah, and into His khatzerot (courts) with tehillah; be thankful unto Him, and bless Shmo. 
For Hashem is good; His chesed is l'olam; and His emunah (faithfulness) endureth dor vador.
