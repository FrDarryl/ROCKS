:sup:`1` And I saw another ot (miraculous sign) in Shomayim, great and marvelous: shiva (seven) malachim (angels) having sheva (seven) makkot (plagues), the last makkot (plagues), because by them is completed the Charon Af Hashem(the burning fury of G-d).

:sup:`2` And I saw, as it were, a yam (sea) of glass, having been mingled with eish (fire); and I saw the menatzakhat HaChayyah (overcomers of the Beast, Anti-Moshiach) and of its Atzav (image) and of the mispar (number) of its name; and I saw them having taken their stand on the yam (sea) of glass, holding nevalim (harps) of Hashem.

:sup:`3` And they sing the Shir of Moshe Rabbeinu, the eved Hashem, and the Shir of the SEH (Lamb), saying, “Great and marvelous are your ma'asim (works), Hashem Adonoi Tzva'ot; Tzedek (Righteousness) and Emes (Truth) are your derakhim (ways, paths), Melech kol HaGoyim (King of all the Nations).

"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Adonoi, who would not fear You and ascribe kavod to your Name? Because You only are HaKadosh, for kol HaGoyim will come and will worship before You because Your tzedakot (righteous acts) were made known.”
