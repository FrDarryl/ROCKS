TEHILLIM.
Chapter 98.
(A Mizmor) 1 O sing unto Hashem a shir chadash; for He hath done marvellous things; His right hand, and His zero'a kodesh, hath gotten Him victory. 
Hashem hath made known His Yeshu'ah (salvation); His tzedek hath He openly showed in the sight of the Goyim. 
He hath remembered His chesed and His emes toward the Bais Yisroel; all the ends of ha'aretz have seen the Yeshu'at Eloheinu (salvation of our G-d). 
Make a joyful noise unto Hashem, kol ha'aretz; make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 
Sing unto Hashem with the kinnor; with the kinnor, and the voice of singing. 
With trumpets and sound of the shofar make a joyful noise before HaMelech Hashem. 
Let the yam roar, and the fullness thereof; the tevel, and they that dwell therein. 
Let the floods clap their hands; let the harim be joyful together 
Before Hashem; for He cometh to judge ha'aretz; with tzedek shall He judge the tevel, and the people with meisharim (uprightness).
