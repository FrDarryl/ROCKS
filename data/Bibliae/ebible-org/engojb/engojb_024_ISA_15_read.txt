YESHAYAH.
Chapter 15.
The massa (burden) of Moav: Because in the lailah (night) Ar of Moav is destroyed, and brought to silence; because in the lailah Kir of Moav is destroyed, and brought to silence; 
He is gone up to the idol temple, and to Divon, the high places, to weep: Moav shall howl over Nevo, and over Medeva; on all their rosh shall be shaved heads, and every zakan (beard) cut off. 
In their chutzot (streets) they shall gird themselves with sackcloth; on their rooftops, and in their rechovot (open areas), every one shall wail, falling down with weeping. 
And Cheshbon shall cry, and Elealeh; their voice shall be heard even unto Yahatz; therefore the loins of Moav shall shake; his nefesh shall be faint within him. 
My lev shall cry out for Moav; his fugitives shall flee unto Tzoar, and Eglat-Shelishiyah; for by the Ascent of Luchit with bekhi (weeping) shall they go up; for on the Derech Choronayim they shall raise up a lament because of destruction. 
For the waters of Nimrim shall be dried up; for the khatzir (grass) is withered away, the desheh (vegetation) faileth, yerek (green) there is none, 
Therefore the possessions they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the Nakhal HaAravim (Ravine of Willows). 
For the cry is gone all around the borders of Moav; the outcry thereof unto Eglayim, and the wailing thereof unto Be'er Elim. 
For the waters of Dimon shall be full of dahm; for I will bring more upon Dimon, aryeh (lion) upon him that escapeth of Moav, and upon she'erit adamah (the remnant of the land).
