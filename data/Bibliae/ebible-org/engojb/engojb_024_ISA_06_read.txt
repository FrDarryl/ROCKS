YESHAYAH.
Chapter 6.
In the year that the Melech Uziyah died, I saw Adonoi sitting upon a kisse, high and lifted up, and His robe filled the Heikhal. 
Above Him stood ministering the seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly. 
And one cried unto another, and said, Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh, is Hashem Tzva'os; kol ha'aretz is full of His kavod. 
And the doorposts shook at the voice of him that cried, and the Beis was filled with smoke. 
Then said I, Oy (Woe) is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen HaMelech, Hashem Tzva'os. 
Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his yad, which he had taken with the tongs from off the Mizbe'ach: 
And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Hinei, this hath touched thy lips; and thine avon (iniquity) is taken away, and kapporah is made for the purging of thy chattat (sin). 
Also I heard the voice of Adonoi, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then said I, Hineini; send me. 
And He said, Go, and tell this people: Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see indeed, but perceive not. 
Make the lev HaAm hazeh stubborn, and make their ears stopped up, their eyes heavy; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their lev. And have a spiritual turnaround conversion, and be healed. 
Then cried I, Adonoi, ad mosai (how much longer will this go on)? And He answered, Until the towns be wasted without inhabitant, and the batim (houses) are without man, and the ground be utterly desolate, a wilderness, 
And Hashem have removed men far away, and there be many forsaken places within the land. 
But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall be given up to destruction, like the terebinth and like the oak, when they are felled, leave a root-stump: so the root-stump shall be the zera kodesh.
