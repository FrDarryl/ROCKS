:sup:`1` Keep silence before Me, O iyim (islands); and let the people renew their ko'ach (strength); let them come near; then let them speak; let us come near together for mishpat (judgment, i.e., G-d ºs tribunal). 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Who awakened the just one from the mizrach (east), called him to His raglayim, gave the Goyim before him, and made him rule over melachim? He gave them as the aphar to his cherev, and as windblown kash (chaff, stubble) to his keshet (bow). 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` He pursues them, and passes on in shalom, even by the orach (path) that his feet do not even come. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Who hath wrought and done it, calling forth the dorot from the beginning? I Hashem, the Rishon (First), and with the Acharonim (Last ones); I am He. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` The iyim (islands) saw it, and feared; the ketzot ha'aretz (ends of the earth) trembled; they approached and came near.

'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Surely, all they that were raging against thee shall be ashamed and disgraced; they shall be as nothing; and the anshei rivecha (they that strive with thee) shall perish. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even the anshei matzutecha (them that contended with thee): the anshei milchamtecha (they that war against thee) shall be as nothing, and as a thing of naught.

'''
"15" = '''

"17" = '''

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` I will open neharot on the hilltops, and springs in the midst of the valleys; I will make the midbar a pool of mayim, and the dry land sources of mayim. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` I will plant in the midbar the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the etz shemen; I will set in the Aravah the cypress, and the fir, and the box tree together; 
'''

:sup:`21` Present your case, saith Hashem; bring forth your strong arguments for proof, saith Melech Ya'akov. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Let them bring them forth, and tell us what shall happen; let them tell the rishonot (former things), what they are, that we may consider them, and know the acharit (latter end, final outcome) of them; or declare us things to come. 
'''

'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` I have awakened one from the tzafon (north), and he shall come; from the rising of the shemesh shall he call upon My Shem; and he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the yotzer (potter) treadeth clay. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? And from beforehand, that we may say, He was in the right? Indeed, there is none that telleth, indeed, there is none that preacheth, indeed, there is none that heareth your words. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` The rishon shall say to Tziyon, Hinei, behold them; and I will give to Yerushalayim mevaser (one that bringeth good news).
