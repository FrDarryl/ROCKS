"5" = '''
:sup:`5` If ganavim (thieves) came to thee, if shodedei lailah (robbers by night) — oh how art thou cut off! — would they not have stolen only till they had enough? If the grape gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?

"7" = '''
:sup:`7` All the men of thy alliance have forced thee and brought thee even to the border; the anshei shlomecha (the men that were at peace with thee) have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy lechem (bread) have laid a mazor (net, trap) under thee; there is none detecting it.

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` But thou shouldest not have gloated over the day of thy brother in the day of his misfortune; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the Bnei Yehudah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the Yom Tzarah (Day of Trouble). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Thou shouldest not have entered into the sha'ar Ami (gate of My people) in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked down on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; 
'''
"14" = '''

:sup:`20` And those of the Golus of Bnei Yisroel shall possess that of the Kena'anim, even unto Tzarphat; and those of the Golus of Yerushalayim, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the Negev.
