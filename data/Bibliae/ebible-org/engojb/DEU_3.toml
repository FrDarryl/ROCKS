:sup:`1` Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og Melech HaBashan came out against us, he and all his people, to engage in milchamah at Edre'i. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And Hashem said unto me, Fear him not; for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sichon Melech HaEmori which dwelt at Cheshbon. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` So Hashem Eloheinu delivered into our hands also Og Melech HaBashan, and all his people; and we struck him until no remnant was left to him. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And we took all his towns at that time; there was not a kiryah (town, city) which we took not from them, threescore towns, all the region of Argov, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` All these towns were walled with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns harbeh me'od (very many). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And in cherem we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sichon Melech Cheshbon, in cherem utterly destroying the men, nashim, and little ones, of every town. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` But all the behemah (livestock), and the plunder of the towns, we took for booty to ourselves. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And we took at that time out of the hand of the two melachim of the Emori the land that was on this side of Yarden, from the Wadi Arnon unto Mt Chermon;

'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` All the towns of the plain, and all Gil'ad, and all Bashan, unto Salkhah and Edre'i, towns of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For only Og Melech HaBashan remained of the remnant of Repha'im; hinei, his bedstead was a bedstead of barzel. Is it not in Rabbah of the Bnei Ammon? Nine regular cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And ha'aretz hazot, which we possessed at that time, from Aro'er, which is by the Wadi Arnon, and half way up the hill country of Gil'ad, and the towns thereof, gave I unto the Reuveni and Gadi. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And the rest of Gil'ad, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Menasheh; all the region of Argov, with all Bashan, which was called Eretz Repha'im. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Yair ben Menasheh took all the region of Argov unto the border of Geshuri and Ma'akhati, and called them after shmo (his own name), HaBashan Havot Yair, unto hayom hazeh. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And I gave Gil'ad unto Machir. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And unto the Reuveni and unto the Gadi I gave from Gil'ad even unto the Wadi Arnon with the middle of the valley as the border even unto the Wadi Yabbok, which is the border of the Bnei Ammon; 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` The Aravah also, and Yarden, and the coast thereof, from Kinneret even unto the yam of the Aravah, even the Yam HaMelach (the Salt Sea, the Dead Sea), under the slopes of Pisgah to the east. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And I commanded you at that time, saying, Hashem Eloheichem hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the Bnei Yisroel, all bnei chayil (valiant men, men fit for military service). 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` But your nashim, and your little ones, and your livestock (for I know that ye have much livestock,) shall abide in your towns which I have given you; 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Until Hashem have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess ha'aretz which Hashem Eloheichem hath given them beyond Yarden; and then shall ye return every man unto his yerushah (possession, inheritance), which I have given you. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And I commanded Yehoshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Hashem Eloheichem hath done unto these two melachim; so shall Hashem do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Ye shall not fear them; for Hashem Eloheichem He shall fight for you. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And I besought Hashem at that time, saying, 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` O Adonoi Hashem, Thou hast begun to show Thy eved Thy greatness, and Thy mighty hand; for what El (G-d) is there in Shomayim or on Ha'Aretz, that can do according to Thy works, and according to Thy might? 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Ah, let me go over, and see ha'aretz hatovah that is beyond Yarden, that fine hill country, and the Levanon. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` But Hashem was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me; and Hashem said unto me, Enough from thee; speak no more unto Me of this matter. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see it with thine eyes; for thou shalt not go over this Yarden. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` But commission Yehoshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit ha'aretz which thou shalt see. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` So we abode in the valley over against Beit-Pe'or.
