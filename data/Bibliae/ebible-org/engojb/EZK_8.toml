:sup:`1` And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine bais, and the zekenim of Yehudah sat before me, that the yad Adonoi Hashem fell there upon me.

:sup:`3` And He put forth the form of a yad, and took me by a lock of mine rosh; and the Ruach lifted me up between Ha'Aretz and Shomayim, and brought me in mar'ot Elohim (divinely granted visions) to Yerushalayim, to the Petach Sha'ar Hapenimit (entrance of the inner gate), the one facing north; where was the moshav (seat) of the semel hakinah (statue of jealousy), which provoketh Hashem ºs jealousy.

:sup:`6` He said furthermore unto me, Ben adam, seest thou what they do? Even the to'evot gedolot (great abominations) that Bais Yisroel committeth here, causing that I go far off from My Mikdash? But turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see to'evot gedolot (greater abominations).

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And He said unto me, Go in, and behold the to'evot hara'ot (wicked abominations) that they do here.

:sup:`11` And there stood before them seventy ish of the zekenim of the Bais Yisroel, and in the midst of them stood Ya'azanyahu Ben Shaphan, with every ish his mikteret (censer, incense burner) in his yad; and a thick anan (cloud) of ketoret (incense) went up.

"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then said He unto me, Ben adam, hast thou seen what the zekenim of Bais Yisroel do in the choshech (dark), every ish in the cheder (room) of his maskit (image)? For they say, Hashem seeth us not; Hashem hath forsaken ha'aretz.

"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Then He said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O ben adam? Is it a trivial thing to Bais Yehudah that they commit the to'evot (abominations) which they commit here?

:sup:`18` Therefore will I also deal in chemah (fury); Mine eye shall not pity, neither will I spare; and though they cry in Mine oznayim with a kol gadol, yet will I not hear them.
