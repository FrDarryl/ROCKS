IYOV.
Chapter 25.
Then answered Bildad the Shuchi, and said, 
Dominion and pachad are with Him, oseh shalom bimromav. 
Is there any number of His armies? And upon whom doth not His ohr arise? 
Mah yitzdak Enosh im El (how then can man be justified, set right, with G-d?) Or how can he be clean that is born of isha? 
If even the yarei'ach shineth not, yea, the kokhavim are not pure in His sight, 
How much less enosh, that is a maggot? And the ben adam, which is a tola'at (worm)?
