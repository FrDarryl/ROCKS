:sup:`1` (For the one directing. Of Dovid. Mizmor) 1 Hold not Thy peace, O Elohei tehillati; 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For the mouth of the rasha and the mouth of the mirmah are opened against me; they have spoken against me with a leshon sheker (a lying tongue). 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` They surrounded me also with divrei sinah (words of hatred); and attacked me without cause. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` In return for my ahavah they are my adversaries; but I give myself unto tefillah (prayer). 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Thus they have laid upon me ra'ah for tovah, and sinah for my ahavah. 
'''
"6" = '''

"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Let there be none to extend chesed unto him; neither let there be any to favor his yetomim.

"13" = '''

"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Let the avon of his avot be remembered before Hashem; and let not the chattat immo be blotted out. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Let them be before Hashem tamid, that He may cut off the memory of them from ha'aretz. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Because he remembered not to show chesed, but persecuted the ish oni and the evyon, that he might even slay the nikheh levav (broken-hearted person). 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` As he loved kelalah (cursing), so it came on him; as he delighted not in brocha (blessing), so it was far from him. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` As he clothed himself with kelalah as with his garment, so let it come into his inward parts like mayim, and like shemen into his atzmot. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Let it be unto him like a beged which covereth him, and for a belt wherewith he is girded tamid (continually).

"20" = '''
:sup:`20` This is the reward of mine adversaries from Hashem, and of them that speak rah against my nefesh.

:sup:`21` But Thou O Hashem Adonoi, do with me for the sake of Thy Name; because Thy chesed is tov, deliver Thou me. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For I am oni and evyon, and my lev is wounded within me.

"23" = '''
:sup:`23` I am gone like a lengthening tzel (shadow); I am shaken off like the arbeh. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` My knees are weak from a tzom; and my basar faileth of fatness. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` I became also a cherpah (reproach) unto them; when they looked upon me, they shaked their heads. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Help me, O Hashem Elohai; O hoshi'eini (save me) according to Thy chesed; 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` That they may know that this is Thy Yad; that Thou, Hashem, hast done it.

"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Let them make kelalah (curse), but do Thou make brocha; when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let Thy eved rejoice. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own shame, as with a me'il (cloak).

'''
"31" = '''
