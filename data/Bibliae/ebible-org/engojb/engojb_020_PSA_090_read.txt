TEHILLIM.
Chapter 90.
(Tefillah of Moshe, ish HaElohim) 1 Adonoi, Thou hast been our ma'on (dwelling place) b'dor vador. 
Before the harim were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed eretz and the tevel (inhabited world), even from olam ad olam, Thou art El (G-d). 
Thou turnest enosh to dakka (dust); and sayest, Shuvu, ye Bnei Adam. 
For an elef shanim in Thy sight are but as yom etmol (yesterday) when it is past, and as an ashmurah (watch, division of time) in the lailah. 
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sheinah (sleep); in the boker they are like khatzir (grass) which withereth. 
In the boker it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the erev it is cut down, and drieth up. 
For we are consumed by Thine anger, and by Thy chemah are we troubled. 
Thou hast set avonoteinu before Thee, our secret sins in the ohr of Thy countenance. 
For kol yameinu are passed away in Thy evrah (fury); we spend shaneinu (our years) like a sigh. 
The yamim of shnoteinu (our years, life) are threescore shanah and ten; and if by reason of gevurot they are fourscore shanah, yet is their boast amal (trouble, toil) and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 
Who has da'as of the oz (power) of Thine anger? Thy evrah is as great as Thy yirah (fear of, reverence owed G-d). 
So teach us to number yameinu, that we may apply levav unto chochmah. 
Shuvah, Hashem. Ad mosai? Have compassion on Thy avadim. 
O satisfy us baboker with Thy chesed; that we may sing for joy and be glad kol yameinu (all our days). 
Make us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen ra'ah. 
Let Thy work appear unto Thy avadim, and Thy glory unto their banim. 
And let the no'am (favor, delightfulness) of Adonoi Eloheinu be upon us; and establish Thou the ma'aseh yadeinu upon us; yes, the ma'aseh yadeinu establish Thou it.
