TEHILLIM.
Chapter 126.
(Shir HaMa'alot Song of Ascents) 1 When Hashem brought the return of the captivity of Tziyon, we were like the cholemim (them that dream). 
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and leshoneinu (our tongue) with rinnah (joyful song); then said they among the Goyim, Hashem hath done great things for them. 
Hashem hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 
Return our captivity and restore our fortunes, Hashem, like torrents in the Negev. 
They that sow in dimah (tears) shall reap in rinnah (joyful song). 
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing meshek hazara (seed to be sown) shall doubtless come again with rinnah, bearing his alummot (sheaves).
