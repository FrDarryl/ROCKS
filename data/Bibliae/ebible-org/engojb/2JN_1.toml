"1" = '''
:sup:`1` From the Zaken(Elder). To the Gevirah HaBechirah (the Chosen Lady) and her Banim (Sons, Children), for whom I have ahavah (agape) b'Emes, and not only I but also all those who have Da'as HaEmes (Knowledge of the Truth), 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Because of HaEmes that dwells inside us, and will be immanu (with us) for Yamim HaOlam. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Chen v'Chesed Hashem(unmerited Favor and Kindness), Rachamim Hashem(Mercy), and Shalom Hashem(Peace) will be immanu (with us) from Elohim HaAv and from Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua, HaBen of HaAv, in Emes and Ahavah (agape). 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` I had simcha gedola (much joy) that I have found some of your Banim with a walk which is Halakhah b'Derech Emes (Conduct in the Way of Truth), just as we received a mitzvah (commandment) to do so from HaAv. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And now I beseech you, Gevirah, not as a mitzvah chadasha (new commandment) I am writing you, but that which we had meyReshit (from the Beginning): that we should have ahavah (agape) one for the other, 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And this is ahavah, that we should walk with a halichah according to the Mitzvot of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; this is the mitzvah just as you have heard it meyReshit. You must walk in it. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Because mat'im rabbim (many misleaders, deceivers) have gone out into the world, the ones not making the Ani Ma'amin hoda'ah (confession) that Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Yehoshua habah b'basar (has come in bodily flesh); this one is HaMat'eh (the Deceiving One) and the Anti-Moshiach. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Watch out for yourselves, lest you lose what we worked for, but may receive a sachar maleh (full reward). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Everyone who runs ahead and does not remain in the torah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach does not have Hashem; the one remaining in the torah of Moshiach, this one has both HaAv and HaBen. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` If anyone comes to you and does not bring this torah, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him Drishat Shalom. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For the one giving Drishat Shalom to him has shuttafut (partnership) with his ma'asim hara'im (evil deeds). 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` I have many things to write to you; I wanted not to do so with parchment and ink, but I have the tikvah (hope) to be with you and to speak panim el panim (directly, in person), that our simcha (joy) may be shleimah (complete). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Drishat Shalom from the Banim of your Achot HaBechirah (Chosen Sister).
