DIVREY HAYAMIM ALEF.
Chapter 20.
And it came to pass, at the time of eshuvat hashanah, at the time that melachim go out to battle, Yoav led forth the chayl hatzava, and laid waste the eretz Bnei Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But Dovid tarried at Yerushalayim. And Yoav struck Rabbah, and destroyed it. 
And Dovid took the ateret of their melech from off his rosh, and found it to weigh a talent of zahav, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon rosh Dovid; and he brought also exceeding much plunder out of the Ir. 
And he brought out the people that were in it, and consigned them to saws, and to picks of barzel (iron), and to axes. Even so dealt Dovid with all the towns of the Bnei Ammon. And Dovid and kol HaAm returned to Yerushalayim. 
And it came to pass after this, that there arose milchamah at Gezer with the Pelishtim (Philistines); at which time Sibbekhai the Chushati slaughtered Sippai, that was of the yeledim of the Repha'im, and they were subdued. 
And there was milchamah again with the Pelishtim (Philistines); and Elchanan ben Yair slaughtered Lachmi the brother of Golyat (Goliath) the Gitti, whose spear staff was like a weaverʼs beam. 
And yet again there was milchamah at Gat, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each yad, and six on each foot and he also was of Rapha descent. 
But when he defied Yisroel, Yehonatan ben Shimea achi Dovid slaughtered him. 
These were from the Rapha descended in Gat; and they fell by the yad of Dovid, and by the yad of his avadim.
