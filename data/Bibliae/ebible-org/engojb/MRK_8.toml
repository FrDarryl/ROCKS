'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` I have rachmei shomayim (heavenly mercy, compassion) on the multitude, because they already shlosha yamim (three days) have remained with me and they do not have anything they may eat; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And if I send them away hungry to their batim (houses), they will give out on the way; and some of them have come from far away. 
'''
"4" = '''

'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach directed the multitude to recline at tish, as it were, on the ground.

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And aware of this, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach says to them, Why are you discussing that you do not have kikrot? Do you not yet have binah (understanding) nor comprehend? Have your levavot fallen into timtum halev (hardening of the heart), KESHI(hardness, stubbornness)? 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` EINAYIM LAKHEM VLO TIRU VOZNAYIM LAKHEM VLO TISHMAU?(Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?) And do you not remember,

'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was speaking about the matter plainly. And Shim'on Kefa took him aside and began to rebuke him. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` But having turned around and having looked at his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach rebuked Kefa, and says, Get behind me, HaSatan; for you are not putting your machshavot (thoughts) on the interests of Hashem but on that of Bnei Adam. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` And having summoned the multitude along with his talmidim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to them, If anyone wishes to follow after me, let him make denial of himself, and take up his etz shel mesiros nefesh (tree of self-sacrifice), and follow me. 
'''
"35" = '''
