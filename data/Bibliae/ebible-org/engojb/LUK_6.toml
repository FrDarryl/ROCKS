'''

'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to them, I ask you whether it is mutar on Shabbos to do hatov or to do harah, to save nefesh or destroy it? 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And having looked around at all of them, he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he did. And his hand was restored. 
'''

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Now it came about in those yamim that Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach went forth to the mountain to daven, and he was spending the whole night b'tefillah to Hashem. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And when boker came, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach summoned his talmidim, and chose from them Shneym Asar (Twelve), whom he also named Shlichim:

'''
"19" = '''

'''
"20" = '''

'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Have simcha in that day and leap for chedvah (rejoicing), for your sachar (reward) is gadol in Shomayim. According to the same their Avot were doing to the Neviim. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` But oy to you, you ashirim, for you have already received in full your nechamah (comfort). 
'''

'''

:sup:`26` Woe when all Bnei Adam speak well of you. For according to the same things were their Avot doing to the neviei hasheker (false prophets). 
'''

:sup:`31` And just as you want that Bnei Adam may do to you, do to them similarly. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` And if you show ahavah to the ones showing ahavah to you, what kind of shvakh (commendation) to you is that? For even the chote'im (sinners) show ahavah to the ones showing ahavah to them. 
'''

'''
"37" = '''

'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, having been pressed down and having been shaken, overflowing, will be put into your kheyk (lap). For by what measure you measure it will be measured in return to you. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` Now he told also a mashal to them. Surely an ivver is not able to guide an ivver, is he? Will not both fall into a pit? 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` A talmid is not above his moreh. But everyone, having been fully trained, will be like his moreh (teacher). 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` And why do you see the speck in the eye of your ach, but the log in your own eye you do not notice? 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` How are you able to say to your ach, Ach, let me remove the speck in your eye, while you yourself are not seeing the log in your own eye? Tzeva, remove first the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck from your ach b'Moshiach. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` For there is no etz tov producing pri rah, nor again an etz rah producing pri tov. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` For each etz by its own pri will be known. For not from thorns do they gather figs nor from a thorn bush do they pick grapes. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` The ish tov from the good storehouse of the lev produces tov, and the ish rah out of the evil storehouse produces rah. For from the abundance of the lev the peh (mouth) speaks. 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` And why do you call me Adoni and yet you do not do what I say? 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` Everyone coming to me and hearing my divrei torah and putting them into practice, I will show you to whom he is likened. 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` He is likened to the man building a bais who dug and went down deep and laid a yesod upon the av sela (bedrock). And a flood having come, the river struck against that bais, and the flood was not strong enough to shake it, because its binnuy was firm. 
'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` Now the one having heard, and not having put them into practice, is like a man having built a bais (house) upon the ground without a yesod (foundation), which the river struck against, and ofen ort (immediately) the bais collapsed, and gadol (great) was the churban of that bais.
