'''

'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And, hinei, he speaks publicly and they say nothing to him. Perhaps the manhigim (the gedolim of Judaism) have da'as that this man is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach?

'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` The Perushim heard the telunnah (murmuring) of these things from the multitude, the talk about Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and they sent the Rashei Hakohanim and the mesharetim of the Perushim that they might arrest him.

'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` But this he said about the Ruach Hakodesh which the ones having emunah (faith) in him were about to receive, for the Ruach Hakodesh had not yet been given, because Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach had not yet received kavod. 
'''

'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` Others were saying, This man is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. But some were saying, Surely the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach comes not from the Galil, does he? 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` Has not the Kitvei Hakodesh said that the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach is from the zera Dovid and from Beit-Lechem, the shtetl where Dovid lived?

'''
"52" = '''
:sup:`52` They answered and said to Rav Nakdimon, Surely not you also are from the Galil, are you? Search the Kitvei Hakodesh and see that from the Galil a Navi does not arise. 
'''
"53" = '''
:sup:`53` And they went each one to his bais.
