"1" = '''
:sup:`1` And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Ben adam, speak unto Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Hinei, Ashur (the Assyrian) was a cedar in Levanon with yafeh branches, and with a forest shade, and of a high stature; and his top was above the thick boughs. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` The mayim made it grow, the tehom (underground water) set him up in height by her streams flowing all around its planting, and sent her rivulets unto all the trees of the sadeh. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Therefore his height was exalted above kol atzei hasadeh (all the trees of the field), and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the mayim rabbim, as it sent them out. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` All the oph HaShomayim made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the sadeh give birth to their young, and under his tzel (shadow) dwelt kol Goyim rabbim. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Thus was he beautiful in his gadol (greatness), in the length of his branches; for his shoresh (root) reached to mayim rabbim. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` The cedars in the Gan Elohim could not compare with him; the pine trees were not like his boughs, and the plane trees were not like his branches; nor any etz (tree) in the Gan Elohim was like unto him in his beauty. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` I have made him beautiful by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the Gan Elohim, envied him. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Because thou hast increased thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top above the thick boughs, and his lev is proudly lifted up in his height, 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` I have therefore delivered him into the yad of the mighty one of the Goyim; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out according to his wickedness. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And zarim, the most terrible of the Goyim, have cut him down, and have left him; upon the harim and in all the ge'ayot (valleys) his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the ravines of the earth; and kol Amei HaAretz (all the nations of the earth) departed from his tzel (shade), and forsook him. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Upon his ruin shall all the oph Shomayim remain, and all the beasts of the sadeh shall come to his branches; 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` To the end that none of all the trees by the mayim exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top above the thick boughs, and that no trees that drink mayim may reach up to them in height; for they are all delivered unto mavet, to the depths of ha'aretz, in the midst of the bnei adam, with them that go down to the bor (pit). 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning; I covered the tehom (deep) for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof, and the mayim rabbim were held back; and I caused Levanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the sadeh wilted and fainted for him. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` I made the Goyim to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the bor (pit); and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Levanon, all that drink mayim, shall be consoled in the depths of ha'aretz. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that be slain with the cherev; and they that were his zero'a, that dwelt under his tzel (shade) in the midst of the Goyim. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` To whom art thou thus like in kavod and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the depths of ha'aretz; thou shalt lie in the midst of the arelim (uncircumcised) with them that be slain by the cherev. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith Adonoi Hashem.
