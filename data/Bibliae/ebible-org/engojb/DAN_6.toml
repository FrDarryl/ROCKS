:sup:`4` Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the overseers and satraps, because an excellent ruach was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole malchut. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Then the overseers and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the malchut; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was trustworthy, neither was there any negligence or corrupt thing found in him. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Then said these anashim, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the dat (law, religion) of his G-d.

"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Then these overseers and satraps assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Daryavesh, L'olam yicheyeh (live for ever!)

:sup:`8` All the overseers of the malchut, the administrators, and the satraps, the counselors, and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall make a petition of any g-d or man for shloshim yom (thirty days), except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the ketav (writing, document), that it cannot be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then these anashim assembled, and found Daniel davening and making supplication before his G-d. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the kingʼs decree: Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall make a petition of any g-d or man within shloshim yom, except of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the Bnei Golus of Yehudah, shows no regard for thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Then the king, when he heard these words, was greatly displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him, and he did strive till the going down of the shemesh to deliver him. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Then these anashim assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Have da'as, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Eloheicha (Thy G-d) whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And an even (stone) was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring, and with the signet ring of his nobles, that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Then the king went to his heikhal, and spent the night fasting, neither were entertainments brought before him, and his sheynah fled from him. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Then the king arose very early in the boker, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And when he came to the den, he cried with an anguished voice unto Daniel; and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, eved of HaElohim HaChai, is thy G-d, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, L'olam yicheyeh (live for ever). 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` My G-d hath sent his malach, and hath shut the lionsʼ mouths that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Him innocence was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no rah (wrong). 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he had emunah in his G-d. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And the king commanded, and they brought those anashim which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` Then king Daryavesh wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in kol ha'aretz; Shalom aleichem l'machbir (Peace be multiplied unto you). 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` I make a decree, That in every dominion of my malchut men must tremble and fear before the G-d of Daniel, for He is HaElohim HaChai, and stedfast l'olamim (forever), and His malchut that which shall not be destroyed, and His dominion shall be even ad hasof (unto the end). 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` He delivereth and rescueth, and He worketh otot and mofetim in Shomayim and in ha'aretz, Who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Daryavesh, and in the reign of Koresh (Cyrus) the Persian.
