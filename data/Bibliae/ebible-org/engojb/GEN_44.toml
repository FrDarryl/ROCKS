'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Hinei, the kesef, which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we brought back unto thee out of Eretz Kena'an; how then should we be ganavim stealing kesef or zahav out of the bais adoneicha?

'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And Yosef said unto them, What ma'aseh (deed) is this that ye have done? Know ye not that an ish like me can find things out as a menachesh (diviner)? 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And Yehudah said, What shall we say unto adoni? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? HaElohim hath found out the avon (iniquity) of thy avadim; look at us, we are now avadim la'adoni, both we, and he also with whom the gevi'a (cup) is found. 
'''
"17" = '''

"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And thou saidst unto thy avadim, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 
'''
"22" = '''

"23" = '''
:sup:`23` And thou saidst unto thy avadim, Except achichem hakaton (your youngest brother) come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And it came to pass when we came up unto thy eved Avi we told him the divrei adoni.

:sup:`25` And avinu said, Shuvu, (go back, return) and buy us a little ochel. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And we said, We cannot go down; if achinu hakaton (our youngest brother) be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the face of HaIsh, except achinu hakaton be with us.

'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Now therefore when I come to thy eved Avi, and the na'ar be not with us; seeing that his nefesh is bound up in the nefesh of the na'ar; 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the na'ar is not with us, that he will die; and thy avadim shall bring down the gray hair of thy eved avinu with yagon (sorrow) to Sheol,

'''
"33" = '''
