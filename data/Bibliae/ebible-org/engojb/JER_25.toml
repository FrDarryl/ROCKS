'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` For, hinei, I begin to bring ra'ah on the Ir which is called by My Shem, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a cherev upon all the inhabitants of ha'aretz, saith Hashem Tzva'os. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Therefore prophesy thou against them all these Devarim, and say unto them: Hashem shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His Ma'on Kodesh; He shall mightily roar upon His Naveh (Dwelling); He shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of ha'aretz. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` A noise shall come even to the ends of ha'aretz; for Hashem hath a legal controversy with the Goyim, He will plead His case with kol basar; He will give them that are wicked to the cherev, 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` Thus saith Hashem Tzva'os, Hinei, ra'ah shall go forth from Goy to Goy, and a sa'ar gadol (great whirlwind) shall be raised up from the farthest ends of Eretz.
