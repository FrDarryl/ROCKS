TEHILLIM.
Chapter 149.
Praise Hashem. Shiru l'Adonoi shir chadash (Sing unto Hashem a new song), and His praise in the Kahal Chasidim. 
Let Yisroel rejoice in Him that made him; let the Bnei Tziyon be glad in their Melech. 
Let them praise Shmo in the dance; let them sing zemirot unto Him with the tambourine and kinnor. 
For Hashem taketh pleasure in His people; He will crown the meek with Yeshu'ah (salvation). 
Let the Chasidim be joyful in kavod; let them sing for joy upon their beds. 
Let the high praises of G-d be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 
To execute vengeance upon the Goyim, and punishments upon the people; 
To bind their melachim with chains, and their nobles with shackles of barzel (iron); 
To execute upon them the mishpat katuv (written judgment); this honor have all His Chasidim. Hallelu Hashem.
