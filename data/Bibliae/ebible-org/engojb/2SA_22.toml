"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And he said, Hashem is my rock, and my matzadah, and my deliverer; 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` The Elohei (G-d of) my Tzur; in Him will I trust; He is my mogen, and the keren of my Salvation, my stronghold, and my refuge, my Moshia; Thou savest me from chamas.

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Then ha'aretz shook and trembled; the mosedot (foundations) of Shomayim moved and shook, because He was in wrath. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` There went up an ashan (smoke) out of His nostrils, and eish out of His peh (mouth) devoured; coals were kindled by it.

"10" = '''
:sup:`10` He bowed HaShomayim also, and came down; and a dark cloud was under His raglayim.

'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Hashem rewarded me according to my tzedakah; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For I have been shomer over the drakhei Hashem, and have not wickedly departed from Elohai. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` For all His mishpatim were before me; as for His chukkot, I did not depart from them.

'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` With the chasid (loyal, the one having chesed, the devout one) Thou wilt show Thyself loyal, and with the Gibbor tamim (blameless man) Thou wilt show Thyself blameless. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` With the pure Thou wilt show Thyself pure; and with the ikkesh (crooked, devious) Thou wilt show Thyself shrewd. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And the Am oni (afflicted people) Thou wilt save; but Thine eyes are upon the haughty, that Thou mayest bring them down.

"29" = '''
:sup:`29` For Thou art my ner (lamp), Hashem; and Hashem will lighten my choshech. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` For by Thee I have run through a troop; by Elohai can I leap over a wall.

"31" = '''
:sup:`31` As for G-d, His derech is tamim; the Word of Hashem is proven; He is a mogen (shield) to all them that trust in Him.

"38" = '''
:sup:`38` I have pursued mine oyevim, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.

"39" = '''
:sup:`39` And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise; indeed, they are fallen under my raglayim. 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` For Thou hast girded me with chayil (strength) for milchamah (battle); them that rose up against me hast Thou caused to bow down under me. 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` Thou hast also given me victory over the necks of mine oyevim, that I might destroy them that hate me. 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` They looked, but there was no moshia; even unto Hashem, but He answered them not. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` Then did I beat them as small as the aphar of eretz, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did scatter them abroad. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` Thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people, Thou hast kept me to be Rosh of the Goyim; a people which I knew not shall serve me.
