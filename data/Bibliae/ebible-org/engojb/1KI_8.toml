'''
"64" = '''
:sup:`64` The same day did HaMelech consecrate as kodesh the interior of the Khatzer (Court) that was before the Beis Hashem; for there he offered olah and minchah, and the chelvei hashelamim because the Mitzbe'ach HaNechoshet that was before Hashem was too katon (small) to receive the olah, and minchah, and the chelvei hashelamim. 
'''
"65" = '''
:sup:`65` And at that time Sh'lomo observed a Chag, and kol Yisroel with him, a Kahal Gadol, from the Approach of Chamat unto the Wadi Mitzrayim, before Hashem Eloheinu, shivat yamim and shivat yamim, even arba'a asar yom.
