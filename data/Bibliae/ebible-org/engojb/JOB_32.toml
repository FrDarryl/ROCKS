"1" = '''
:sup:`1` So these shloshet ha'anashim ceased to answer Iyov, because he was tzaddik in his eyes. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu ben Barakhel the Buzi, of the mishpochah Ram; against Iyov was his wrath kindled, because Iyov justified his nefesh rather than Elohim. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no ma'aneh (refutation, answer), and yet had condemned Iyov. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Now Elihu had waited till Iyov had spoken, because they were elder than he. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` When Elihu saw that there was no ma'aneh in the mouth of these shloshet ha'anashim, then his wrath was kindled. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Elihu ben Barakhel the Buzi answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and dared not tell you of what I have da'as. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` I said, Yamim should speak, and multitude of shanim should teach chochmah. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But there is a ruach in enosh, and the neshamat Shaddai giveth them binah. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` Great men are not always wise, neither do the zekenim understand mishpat. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore I said, Pay heed to me; I also will tell of what I have da'as. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Hen (behold), I waited for your devarim; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Yea, I attended unto you, and, hinei, there was none of you that proved Iyov wrong, or that answered his words. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Yet do not say, We have found chochmah; El may vanquish him, lo ish (not man). 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Now he hath not directed his millin (words) against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` They were amazed; they answered no od (more); they left off speaking. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no od more); 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` I said, I will answer also my chelek (portion); I also will show of mine da'as. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` For I am full of millim (words), the ruach within me compelleth me. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Hinei, my beten is like yayin which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like ovot chadashim (new wineskins). 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` I will speak that I may be relieved; I will open my sfatayim and answer. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Let me not, now, show any man partiality, neither let me flatter adam. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For I am not skilled in flattery; in so doing Oseini (my Maker) would soon take me away.
