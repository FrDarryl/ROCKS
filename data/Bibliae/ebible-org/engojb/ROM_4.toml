"1" = '''
:sup:`1` What then shall we say about the one who according to the basar (flesh) is Avraham Avinu? What did he find to be the case? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For if Avraham Avinu was accounted to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM and acquitted before Hashem on the basis of ma'asim (of gezetz), he has something to boast about. But not before Hashem! 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For what does the Torah say? Avraham Avinu had emunah (faith) in Hashem V'YACHSHEVEHA LO TZEDAKAH(and it was accounted, credited, reckoned, imputed to him for righteousness). 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Now to him who works, the loin (wages, batzalon remuneration) is not credited to oneʼs account as a favor or gift of chesed but as a choiv (debt). 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` But to the man who does not “work” but has emunah and bitachon in the One who takes the impious man lacking chasidus and accounts him to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM (justified with G-d), such a man who does not “work” but has emunah (faith), such emunah is credited to him for TZEDAKAH(righteousness). 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` As also Dovid HaMelech speaks of the me'ushar (blessedness) of the person whom Hashem reckons to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM (justified with G-d) without dependence on ma'asim (of gezetz): 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Ashrey (blessed, happy) are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over; 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` ASHREY ADAM LO YAKHSHOV HASHEM LO AVON(Blessed, happy is the one whose sin Hashem will by no means count). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` This me'ushar (blessedness), then, does it come on those of the milah (the circumcised) or also on those without the bris milah (the uncircumcised)? For we say, emunah “was credited (counted, reckoned)” to Avraham Avinu for TZEDAKAH(righteousness). 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` When then was it “credited”? When Avraham Avinu was bris milah and was in the state of circumcision? Or when Avraham Avinu did not have the bris milah and was in the state of uncircumcision? 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision! And he received the ot (sign or distinguishing mark) of the milah (circumcision) as a chotam (seal) of the Tzidkat HaEmunah (the Righteousness of Faith) which he had in his uncircumcision, in order that he might be father of all who believe through uncircumcision, that to be YITZDAK IM HASHEM might be reckoned, counted to them as well, 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And in order that he might be Av (Father) to the Nimolim (Circumcised ones), to those who are not only HaNimolim but also who follow in the footsteps of the emunah of Avraham Avinu, which he had in his uncircumcision. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` For the havtachah (promise) to Avraham Avinu and his Zera (seed), that he should be Yoresh HaOlam (Heir of the World), did not come through the context of gezetz but through the Tzidkat HaEmunah (the Righteousness of Faith). 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For if those depending on zokheh of works are yoreshim (heirs), emunah (faith) is rendered invalid and the havtachah (the promise) is annulled, 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` for gezetz (law) brings about the Charon Af Hashem, and where there is no gezetz there is no averah (transgression, violation of the Law). 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For this reason the havtachah (promise) is of emunah (faith), in order that it might be in accordance with unmerited Chen v'Chesed Hashem, that the havtachah might be certain to all the zera (seed), not to him who is of the Torah only, but also to bnei emunat Avraham (the sons of the faith of Avraham Avinu, to those who are of the faith of Abraham). Avraham Avinu is the father of us all, 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` as it is written, AV HAMON GOYIM N'TATICHA(I have made you father of many nations). This was in the sight of Hashem in whom “he believed,” G-d who gives Chayyim to the Mesim and calls things which have no existence into existence. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Against tikvah (hope), in tikvah “he believed,” in order that he might become AV HAMON GOYIM(father of many nations) in accordance with what had been said, So shall thy ZERA (seed) be. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Without weakening in emunah (in personal faith, bitachon, trust) he contemplated his own body, now as good as dead vi-bahlt (since) he was about one hundred years old, and also the deadness of Sarahʼs womb. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` He did not, in disbelief, doubt the havtachah of Hashem(the promise of G-d), but was strengthened in emunah (faith), giving kavod (glory) to Hashem, 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Being fully convinced that what Hashem had promised He also was able to do. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Therefore, V'YACHSHEVEHA LO TZEDAKAH (it was credited to him for righteousness). 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Nor was it written down for his sake alone that “it was reckoned to him,” 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` But also for us, to whom it is to be reckoned, who believe in Him who raised Yehoshua Adoneinu from the mesim (dead ones), 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Who was handed over for PEYSHA'EINU(our transgressions), and made to stand up in his Techiyas HaMoshiach that we be YITZDAK IM HASHEM(be justified with G-d, that we have our justification, our acquittal, vindication).
