"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Hinei, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? Wouldest thou be spoken for to HaMelech, or to the Sar HaTzava? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Geichazi answered, Verily she hath no ben, and her ish is zaken.

'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And when she came to the Ish HaElohim at the har, she took hold of him by the raglayim: but Geichazi came near to thrust her away. And the Ish HaElohim said, Let her alone; for her nefesh is marah within her: and Hashem hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Then she said, Did I make request of adoni for a ben? Did I not say, Do not deceive me? 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` Then he said to Geichazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my mishe'net (staff) in thine yad, and run: if thou meet any ish, salute him not; and if any ish salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my mishe'net (staff) upon the face of the na'ar. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And the em hana'ar said, As Hashem liveth, and as thy nefesh liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her. 
'''
"31" = '''

'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` And the one serving him said, What, should I set this before a hundred ish? He said again, Give HaAm, that they may eat; for thus saith Hashem, They shall eat, and there shall be shirayim. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` So he set it before them, and they did eat, and there was shirayim thereof, according to the Devar Hashem.
