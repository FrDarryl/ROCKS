'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` You are already metoharim (clean) because of the dvar which I have spoken to you. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Remain in me and I in you. As the sarig is not able to bear p'ri from itself, unless it remains on the gefen (vine), so neither are you, unless you remain in me. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Ani Hu (I am) HaGefen; you are the sarigim (branches). The one remaining in me and I in him, this one bears much p'ri, because apart from me you are not able to do anything.

'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` No longer do I call you avadim, because the eved does not have da'as of what his Adon is doing. But you I have called chaverim, because all things which I heard from HaAv of me, of all these things I gave you da'as. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` It was not that you chose me, but I chose you, and have given you s'michah that you go and bear p'ri and the p'ri of you remain, that whatever you ask HaAv b'Shem of me (Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach), HaAv may give it to you.

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Put in zikaron (remembrance) the dvar which I told you, An eved is not gadol (greater) than his Adon. If they brought redifah (persecution) on me, they will also bring redifah on you. If over my dvar they were shomer, also over yours they will be shomer. 
'''
"21" = '''
