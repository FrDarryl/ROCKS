TEHILLIM.
Chapter 123.
(Shir HaMa'alot Song of Ascents) 1 Unto Thee lift I up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in Shomayim. 
Hinei, as the eyes of avadim look unto the yad adoneihem, and as the eyes of a shifchah (maiden) unto the yad of her gevirah; so our eyes wait upon Hashem Eloheinu, until He have channun (favor, grace) upon us. 
Channenu Hashem, channenu; for we are more than sated with buz (contempt). 
Nafsheinu (our nefesh) is more than sated with the scorn of those that are at ease, and with the buz (contempt) of the g'eiyonim (proud ones, arrogant ones).
