TEHILLIM.
Chapter 10.
Why standest Thou afar off, Hashem? Why hidest Thou Thyself in times of tzoros? 
The reshah in his ga'avah (haughtiness) doth persecute the ani (poor); let them be caught in the devices that they have schemed. 
For the reshah boasteth of his ta'avat nefesh (soulʼs lust), and blesseth the covetous, whom Hashem abhorreth. 
The reshah, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after Him; Elohim is not in all his thoughts. 
His ways are always prosperous; Thy mishpatim are on high, out of his sight; as for all his enemies, he sneers at them. 
He hath said in his lev, I shall not be shaken; throughout all generations I shall never be in trouble. 
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud; under his leshon (tongue) is trouble and iniquity. 
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages; in the places for ambush doth he murder the naki (innocent); his eyes are secretly set against the poor. 
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his reshet. 
He crouches, and stoops, that the poor may fall by his atzum (might). 
He hath said in his lev, El hath forgotten; He hideth his face; He will never see it. 
Arise, Hashem; O El, lift up Thine yad; forget not the aniyim. 
For why doth the reshah renounce Elohim? He hath said in his lev, Thou wilt not call me to account. 
Thou hast seen it; for Thou beholdest trouble and ka'as (grief), to requite it with Thy yad; the helpless committeth himself unto Thee; Thou art the Ozer (helper) of the yatom (orphan). 
Break Thou the zero'a of the reshah and the evil man; call to account his wickedness that would not be found out. 
Hashem is Melech olam va'ed; the Goyim are perished out of His land. 
Hashem, Thou hast heard the desire of the aniyim; Thou wilt strengthen their lev, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to hear; 
To judge the yatom (orphan) and the oppressed, that enosh of the earth may no more strike terror.
