TEHILLIM.
Chapter 142.
(Maskil of Dovid; A tefillah when he was in the me'arah) 
I cried out unto Hashem with my voice; with my voice unto Hashem did I make my techinnah (supplication). 
I poured out my complaint before Him; I showed before Him my tzoros. 
When my ruach became faint within me, then Thou had da'as of my path. In the way wherein I walked have they laid a pach (snare, hidden trap) for me. 
I looked on my right, and behold, there was no man that would know me; refuge failed me; no man cared for my nefesh. 
I cried unto Thee, Hashem; I said, Thou art my refuge and my chelek (portion) in the Eretz HaChayyim. 
Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; save me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 
Release my nefesh from prison, to praise Shemecha (Thy Name); the tzaddikim shall gather about me; for Thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
