'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And they shall fill thy batim (houses), and the batim (houses) of all thy avadim, and the batim (houses) of kol Mitzrayim; which neither thy avot, nor the avot of thy avot have seen, since the day that they were upon ha'aretz unto this day.

'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And the arbeh went up over kol Eretz Mitzrayim, and rested on the entire border of Mitzrayim: very grievous were they; before them there were no such arbeh as they, neither after them shall be such. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` For they covered the kol ha'aretz, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat kol esev ha'aretz, and kol p'ri haetz which the barad had left as remnant; and there remained not any yerek baetz, or in the esev hasadeh, through kol Eretz Mitzrayim.
