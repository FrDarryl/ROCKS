[9]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Rejoice not, O Yisroel, for joy, as other people; for thou hast gone a-whoring from thy G-d, thou hast loved for hire upon every threshing floor. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` The floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, and the tirosh shall fail in her. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` They shall not dwell in Hashem ºs land; but Ephrayim shall return to Mitzrayim, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` They shall not offer yayin offerings to Hashem, neither shall they be pleasing unto Him; their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their own nefesh and shall not come into the Beis Hashem. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` What will ye do in the Yom Mo'ed, and in the Yom Chag Hashem? 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For, lo, they are gone because of destruction; Mitzrayim shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; nettles shall possess their valuables of kesef; thorns shall be in their tents. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` The days of pekudah (visitation for divine punishment) are come, the yamim of recompence are come; Yisroel shall know it. The navi is a fool, the ish haruach (spiritual man) is meshuga, for the multitude of thine iniquity and great hatred. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` The watchman of Ephrayim was with my G-d; but the navi is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the bais of his G-d. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the yamim of Giv'ah; therefore He will remember their iniquity, He will visit their sins. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` I found Yisroel like grapes in the midbar; I saw your avot as the bikkurah in the fig tree at her first season; but they went to Ba'al-Pe'or, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` As for Ephrayim, their kavod shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the beten (womb), and from the conception. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Though they bring up their banim, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Ephrayim, as I saw Tzor, is planted in a pleasant place; but Ephrayim shall bring forth his banim to the murderer. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Give them, O Hashem. What wilt Thou give? Give them a miscarrying rechem (womb) and dry breasts. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them; for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of Mine bais, I will love them no more; all their sarim (princes) are sorerim (rebels). 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Ephrayim is struck, their shoresh (root) is dried up, they shall bear no fruit; yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their beten (womb). 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` My G-d will cast them away, because they did not pay heed unto Him; and they shall be nodedim (wanderers) among the Goyim.
