'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach was saying to them, Indeed the Katzir is plentiful, but the poalim of the Katzir are few; therefore, ask the Adon of the Katzir that he might send out poalim into his Katzir.

:sup:`30` In reply, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said, A certain ish was coming down from Yerushalayim to Yericho, and he encountered shodedim. They stripped him and inflicted a klap, more than one, and they went away and left him half dead.
