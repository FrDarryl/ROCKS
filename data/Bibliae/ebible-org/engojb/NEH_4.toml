:sup:`1` But it came to pass, that when Sanvalat, and Toviyah, and the Arabs, and the Ammonim, and the Ashdodim, heard about the Chomat Yerushalayim, that its repairs had gone ahead, and that the gaps began to be closed up, then they were very angry, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And they plotted all of them together to come and to fight against Yerushalayim, and to hinder it. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Nevertheless we davened unto Eloheinu, and set a watch against them yomam valailah, because of them.

:sup:`4` And Yehudah said, The koach of the bearers of burdens is giving out, and there is much rubble, so that we are not able to rebuild the Chomah (Wall). 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And our adversaries said, They shall have no da'as, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the melachah (work) to cease. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And it came to pass, that when the Yehudim which dwelt near them came, they said unto us eser pe'amim, Wherever ye turn, they will be upon us.

:sup:`7` Therefore set I behind the lower places of the Chomah, and on the exposed places, I even set HaAm by their mishpekhot with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the Nobles, and to the Officials, and to the rest of HaAm, Be not ye afraid of them. Remember Adonoi HaGadol vHaNorah, and fight for your achim, your banim, and your banot, your nashim, and your batim.

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And it came to pass, when our enemies were aware that it was known unto us, and HaElohim had brought their etzah (plan) to nought, that we returned all of us to HaChomah, every one unto his melachah (work). 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And it came to pass from that day forth, that half of my men did the melachah, and the other half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the body armor; and the officials posted themselves behind Kol Bais Yehudah

"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Who were HaBonim BaChomah. And they that bore burdens, carried their loads such that each one with one of his hands did the melachah, and with the other hand held a weapon. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For the Bonim, every one had his cherev girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the shofar was by me. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And I said unto the Nobles, and to the Officials, and to the rest of haAm, The melachah is great and spread out, and we are separated along the Chomah, one far from another. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` In what place therefore ye hear the kol haShofar, rally ye thither unto us; Eloheinu shall fight for us. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` So we labored in the melachah, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn till the kokhavim appeared. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Likewise at the same time said I unto HaAm, Let every one with his servant lodge within Yerushalayim, that in halailah they may be a mishmar (guard) to us, and at hayom a melachah (workman). 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my men, nor the anshei hamishmar (the men of the guard) which followed me, none of us put off our clothes; every one carried his weapon, even when he went for water.
