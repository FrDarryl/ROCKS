TEHILLIM.
Chapter 84.
(For the one directing. On the gittit. Mizmor for the Bnei Korach) 
How yedidot (lovely) are thy mishkanot, O Hashem Tzva'os! 
My nefesh longeth, yea, even fainteth for the khatzrot Hashem(courts of Hashem); my lev and my basar crieth out for El Chai. 
Yea, the sparrow hath found a bais, and the swallow a ken (nest) for herself, where she may lay her young, even Thine mizbechot, O Hashem Tzva'os Malki v'Elohai. 
Ashrei are they that dwell in Thy Beis; they are ever praising Thee. Selah 
Ashrei is the adam whose oz (strength) is in Thee; in whose lev are their highways to Tziyon. 
Who passing through the valley of Baca (weeping) make it a ma'ayon (spring, fountain); the moreh (early rain) also covereth it with berakhot (blessings). 
They go from strength to strength, every one of them who appeareth before Elohim in Tziyon. 
O Hashem Elohim Tzva'os, hear my tefillah; give ear, O Elohei Ya'akov. Selah 
Behold mogineinu (our shield), O Elohim, and look upon the face of Thine Moshiach. 
For a yom in Thy khatzrot is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the Beis Elohai, than to dwell in the ohalim resha (tents of wickedness). 
For Hashem Elohim is a shemesh and a mogen; Hashem will give chen and kavod; no good thing will He withhold from the holekhim b'tamim (them that walk uprightly). 
O Hashem Tzva'os, ashrei is the adam bote'ach (man that trusteth, hath confident faith) in Thee.
