:sup:`1` In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Ben adam, set thy face against Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, and prophesy against him, and against all Mitzrayim: 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Speak, and say, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Hineni, I am against thee, Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his channels, which hath said: My Nile is mine own, and I have made it for myself. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the dag (fish) of thy channels to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy river channels, and all the dag (fish) of thy channels shall stick unto thy scales. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And I will throw thee out into the midbar, thee and all the dag (fish) of thy river channels; thou shalt fall upon the open sadeh; thou shalt not be picked up together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of ha'aretz and to the oph HaShomayim. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And all the inhabitants of Mitzrayim shall know that I am Hashem. Because they have been mishenet kaneh (a staff of reed) to Bais Yisroel, 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` When they took hold of thee by thy palm, thou didst splinter, and tear all their katef (shoulder); and when they leaned upon thee, thou broke, and madest all their loins unsteady. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Hineni, I will bring a cherev upon thee, and cut off adam and behemah from thee. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And Eretz Mitzrayim shall be desolate and in ruins; and they shall know that I am Hashem. Because he hath said: The Nile is Mine, and I have made it, 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Hineni, therefore I am against thee, and against thy river channels, and I will make Eretz Mitzrayim utterly ruins and desolate, from Migdol to Seveneh even unto the border of Kush. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` No regel of adam shall pass through it, nor regel of behemah shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited arba'im shanah. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And I will make Eretz Mitzrayim desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her towns among the towns that are laid waste shall be desolate arba'im shanah; and I will scatter the Mitzrayim among the Goyim, and will disperse them through the countries. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Yet thus saith Adonoi Hashem: At the end of arba'im shanah will I gather Mitzrayim from the peoples where they were scattered; 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And I will bring back the captives of Mitzrayim, and will cause them to return into Eretz Patros, into the land of their ancestry; and they shall be there a lowly mamlachah. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` It shall be the shefalah (lowliest) of the mamlechot; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the Goyim; for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the Goyim. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And it shall be no more the confidence of Bais Yisroel, but shall bring their avon to remembrance, when they turned toward them; but they shall know that I am Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the Davar Hashem came unto me, saying: 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Ben adam, Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel caused his army to avodah gedolah (labor strenuously) against Tzor (Tyre); every rosh was rubbed bare, and every katef (shoulder) was rubbed raw; yet had he no sachar (pay), nor his army, from Tzor (Tyre), for the avodah that he had served against it; 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Hineni, I will give Eretz Mitzrayim unto Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel; and he shall take her wealth, and take her plunder, and pillage her booty; and it shall be the sachar (wages) for his army. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` I have given him Eretz Mitzrayim as his pay for which he worked, because they worked for Me, saith Adonoi Hashem. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` In that day will I cause the keren (horn, strength) of Bais Yisroel to atzmiach (branch, sprout), and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Hashem.
