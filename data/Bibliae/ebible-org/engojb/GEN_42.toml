'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And he said unto them, Lo, but to see the ervat ha'aretz ye came. 
'''
"13" = '''

'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And Reuven answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the yeled; and ye would not hear? Therefore, hinei, the accounting for his dahm is required of us.
