TEHILLIM.
Chapter 129.
(Shir HaMa'alot) 1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my ne'ur, may Yisroel now say; 
Many a time have they afflicted me from my ne'ur (youth); yet they have not prevailed against me. 
The choreshim (plowers) plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows. 
Hashem is tzaddik; He hath cut asunder the cords of the resha'im. 
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Tziyon. 
Let them be as the khatzir (grass) upon the housetops, which withereth before it groweth up; 
With it the kotzer (reaper) filleth not his yad; nor he that gathereth sheaves, his bosom. 
Neither do they which go by say, Birkat Hashem be upon you; we bless you b'Shem Hashem.
