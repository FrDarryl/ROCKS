TEHILLIM.
Chapter 53.
(For the one directing. According to ma'alot. Maskil of Dovid) 
The naval (fool) hath said in his lev, Ein Elohim (There is no G-d). Corrupt are they, and they do abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth tov. 
Elohim looked down from Shomayim upon Bnei Adam, to see if there were any of seichel, that did seek Elohim. 
Every one of them has fallen away; they are altogether perverse; there is none that doeth tov, no, not echad (one). 
Have the workers of iniquity no da'as? Who eat up My people as they eat lechem; they have not called upon Elohim. 
There were they in great pachad (fear), pachad such as never was; for Elohim hath scattered the atzmot of him that encampeth against thee; thou hast put them to shame, because Elohim hath rejected them. 
Oh that the Yeshu'at Yisroel would come out of Tziyon! When Elohim bringeth back the captivity of Amo (His people), Ya'akov shall rejoice, and Yisroel shall be glad.
