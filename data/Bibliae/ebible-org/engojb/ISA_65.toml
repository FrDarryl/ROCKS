[65]
"1" = '''
:sup:`1` I let Myself be sought of them that asked not for Me; I let Myself be found of them that sought me not; I said: Hineni, behold Me, unto a Goy (Nation, People) that was not called by My Shem. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` I have spread out My yad kol hayom unto an Am Sorer (stubbornly rebellious people), which walketh in a derech lo tov, after their own machshevot (thoughts); 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` HaAm that provoketh Me to anger continually to My face; that sacrificeth in ganot (gardens), and burneth sacrifices upon brick; 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Which remain among the kevarim, and spend the night in closed places, which eat basar hachazir, and broth of piggulim(unclean meat) in their vessels; 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Which say: Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am kadosh to thee (holier than thou). These are a smoke in My nose, an eish that burneth kol hayom. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Hinei, it is written before Me: I will not keep silent, but will recompense fully, even recompense into their kheyk, 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Your avonot, and the iniquities of your avot together, saith Hashem, because they burned sacrifices upon the mountains, and insulted Me upon the hills; therefore will I measure their former peulot into their kheyk. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Thus saith Hashem: As the tirosh is found in the cluster, and one saith: Destroy it not; for a brocha is in it; so will I do in behalf of My Servants, that I may not destroy them all. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And I will bring forth a zera out of Ya'akov, and out of Yehudah a yoresh (inheritor) of My mountains; and Mine Bechir (Chosen ones) shall inherit it, and My Servants shall dwell there. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And Sharon shall be a meadow for tzon, and the valley of Achor a place for the flock to lie down, for Ami (My People) who seek Me. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` But ye are they that forsake Hashem, that forget My Har Kadosh, that prepare a shulchan for Fortune, and that furnish the drink offering for Destiny. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Therefore will I destine you for the cherev, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughtering place; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spoke, ye did not hear; but did the rah before Mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Therefore thus saith Adonoi Hashem: Hinei, My Servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; hinei, My Servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; hinei, My Servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Hinei, My Servants shall sing for joy of lev, but ye shall cry out from anguish of lev, and shall wail from brokenness of ruach. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And ye shall leave your shem for a curse unto My Bechir; for Adonoi Hashem shall put thee to death, and call His Avadim by another shem; 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` That he who blesseth himself in ha'aretz shall bless himself by Elohei Omein (the G-d of the Amen, the G-d of Truth); and he that taketh an oath in ha'aretz shall take the oath by Elohei Omein; because the former tzoros are forgotten, and because they are hid from Mine eyes. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For, hinei, I create Shomayim Chadashim and eretz Chadashah; and the rishonot shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` But be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, hinei, I create Yerushalayim a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And I will rejoice in Yerushalayim, and joy in Ami; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying out. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` There shall be no more in there an infant of days, nor a zaken (old man) that hath not filled his days; for he that shall die a hundred years old will be regarded a na'ar; but the choteh (sinner), a hundred years old, will be accursed. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And they shall build batim (houses), and inhabit them; and they shall plant kramim (vineyards), and eat the fruit of them. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of HaEtz are the days of Ami, and Mine Bechir shall long enjoy the ma'aseh of their hands. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for misfortune; for they are the Zera Beruchei Hashem(Seed of the Blessed ones of Hashem), and their offspring with them. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet medaberim (speaking), I will hear. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and aphar shall be the lechem of the nachash. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My Har Kadosh, saith Hashem.
