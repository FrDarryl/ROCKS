TEHILLIM.
Chapter 79.
(A Mizmor.Of Asaph) 1 O Elohim, the Goyim are come into Thine Nachalah; Thy Heikhal Kodesh have they defiled; they have reduced Yerushalayim to rubble. 
The dead bodies of Thy avadim have they given to be food unto the oph HaShomayim, the basar of Thy Chasidim, unto the beasts of the earth. 
Their shefach dahm (shedding of blood) is like mayim all around Yerushalayim; and there is none to bury them. 
We are become a reproach to our shekhenim (neighbors), a scorn and derision to them that are around us. 
How long, Hashem? Wilt Thou be angry lanetzach (forever)? Shall Thy kina (jealousy) burn like eish? 
Pour out Thy wrath upon the Goyim that have no da'as of Thee, and upon the mamlachot that have not called upon Thy Shem. 
For they have devoured Ya'akov, and laid waste his naveh (home). 
O remember not against us avonot rishonim (former iniquities); let Thy rachamim speedily come to us; for we are brought very low. 
Help us, O Elohei Yisheinu, (G-d of our salvation), for the kavod of Thy Shem; and deliver us, and make kapporah for our sins, for Thy Nameʼs sake. 
Why should the Goyim say, Where is Eloheihem? Let there be known among the Goyim in our sight, vengeance for the shefach dahm of Thy avadim. 
Let the groaning of the asir (prisoner) come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy Zero'a preserve Thou those that are Bnei Temutah (sons of death); 
And repay unto our shekhenim (neighbors) sevenfold into their kheyk their reproach, wherewith they have reproached Thee, Adonoi. 
So we Thy people and tzon of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks l'olam (forever); we will show forth Thy praise l'dor vador.
