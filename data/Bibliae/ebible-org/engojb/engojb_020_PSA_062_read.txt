TEHILLIM.
Chapter 62.
(For the one directing. According to Yedutun. Mizmor of Dovid) 
Truly my nefesh waiteth silently upon Elohim; from Him cometh my Yeshu'ah (salvation). 
Truly He is my Tzur and my Yeshu'ah (salvation); He is my stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken. 
How long will ye rush to attack an ish? To thrust at, all of you, as at a leaning kir (wall), and as at a tottering gader (fence). 
Truly they consult to bring down a person of prominence; they delight in kazav (lie, falsehood, deceptive thing); they make a brocha with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah 
Truly in Elohim wait silently, my nefesh, for my tikvah (hope) is from Him. 
Truly He is my Tzur and my Yeshu'ah (salvation); He is my stronghold; I shall not be shaken. 
In Elohim is my salvation and my Kavod: the Tzur of my strength, and my refuge, is in Elohim. 
Trust in Him at all time ye people, pour out your lev before Him; Elohim is a refuge for us. Selah 
Truly Bnei Adam (those of low estate) are hevel (vanity), and Bnei Ish (those who are highborn) are kazav (a lie); they go up in the balances; they are altogether lighter than hevel (vanity). 
Trust not in oshek (oppression, extortion) and become not vain in gazel (the thing taken as plunder); if riches increase, set not your lev upon them. 
Elohim hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that oz (strength) belongeth unto Elohim. 
Also unto Thee, Adonoi, belongeth chesed; for Thou renderest to ish (every man) according to his ma'asim (deeds).
