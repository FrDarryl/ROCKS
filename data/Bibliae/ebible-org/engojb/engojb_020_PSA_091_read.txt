TEHILLIM.
Chapter 91.
He that dwelleth in the seter Elyon (covering, hiding place of the Most High) shall abide under the tzel Shaddai (shadow of the Almighty). 
I will say of Hashem, He is my refuge and my fortress; Elohai (my G-d); in Him will I trust. 
Surely He shall save thee from the pach yakosh (deadly snare of the fowler), and from the devastating dever (plague). 
He shall cover thee with His evrah (pinion, flight feathers), and under His kenafayim (wings) shalt thou find defense; His Emes shall be thy shield and buckler. 
Thou shalt not be afraid of the pachad (terror) by lailah; nor of the khetz (arrow) that flieth yomam (by day); 
Nor for the dever (plague) that walketh in darkness; nor for the ketev (pestilence, destruction) that destroyeth at tzohorayim (noon). 
An elef (thousand) may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy yamin (right hand); but it shall not come near thee. 
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the shillumah (recompense, retribution) of the resha'im. 
Because thou hast made Hashem, which is my refuge, even Elyon, thy ma'on (habitation, dwelling), 
There shall no ra'ah (evil, disaster) befall thee, neither shall any nega come near thy ohel. 
For He shall give charge to His malachim (angels) concerning thee, to be shomer over thee in kol drakhim of thee. 
They shall bear thee up on their palms, lest thou dash thy regel against an even (stone). 
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the tannin (serpent) shalt thou trample under foot. 
Because he hath set his longing upon Me, therefore will I rescue him; I will set him on high, because he hath da'as of Shmi (My Name). 
He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in tzoros; I will deliver him, and honor him. 
With orech yamim (length of days, long life) will I satisfy him, and show him My Yeshu'ah (salvation).
