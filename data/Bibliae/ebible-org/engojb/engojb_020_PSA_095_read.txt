TEHILLIM.
Chapter 95.
O come, let us sing unto Hashem; let us make a joyful noise to the Tzur of our salvation. 
Let us come before His presence with todah, and extol Him with zemirot (joyful songs). 
For Hashem is El Gadol, and Melech Gadol above kol elohim (g-ds). 
In His yad are the deep places of ha'aretz; the peaks of the harim are His also. 
The yam is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the yabashah (dry land). 
O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Hashem Oseinu (our Maker). 
For He is Eloheinu; and we are the people of His pasture, and the tzon of His yad. Today if ye will hear His voice, 
Harden not your lev, as in Merivah, and as in the Yom Massah in the midbar; 
When your avot tested Me, tried Me, and saw My work. 
Arba'im shanah was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do stray in their lev, and they have no da'as of My ways; 
Unto whom I swore an oath in My wrath that they should not enter into My menuchah.
