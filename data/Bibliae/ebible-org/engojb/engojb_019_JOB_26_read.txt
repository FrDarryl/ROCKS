IYOV.
Chapter 26.
But Iyov answered and said, 
How hast thou helped him that is without ko'ach? How savest thou the zero'a that hath no oz (strength)? 
How hast thou counseled him that hath no chochmah? And how hast thou plentifully declared the tushiyyah (efficient wisdom)? 
To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose neshamah came from thee? 
Dead things tremble from under the mayim, and the inhabitants thereof. 
Sheol is naked before Him, and Avaddon hath no cover. 
He stretcheth out the Tzafon over the tohu, and hangeth eretz upon nothing. 
He bindeth up the mayim in His thick clouds; and the anan doeth not burst under them. 
He covers the face of His kisse, and spreadeth His anan upon it. 
He hath circled the horizon on the face of the mayim for a boundary between ohr and choshech. 
The ammudim of Shomayim tremble and are aghast at His rebuke. 
He divideth the yam with His ko'ach, and by His understanding He struck down Rahav. 
By His Ruach He hath made fair Shomayim; His yad hath pierced the fleeing nachash. 
Lo, these are but the ketzot of His ways, but how faint the davar we hear of Him. And the thunder of His gevurah who can understand?
