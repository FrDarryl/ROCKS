TEHILLIM.
Chapter 130.
(Shir HaMa'alot) 1 Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, Hashem. 
Adonoi, hear my voice; let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my techinnot (supplications). 
If Thou, Hashem, shouldest record iniquities, Adonoi, who could stand? 
But there is selichah (forgiveness) with Thee; therefore, Thou art feared. 
I wait for Hashem, my nefesh doth wait, and in His Devar do I hope. 
My nefesh waiteth for Adonoi more than the shomrim that watch for the boker; I say, more than the shomrim that watch for the boker. 
Let Yisroel hope in Hashem; for with Hashem there is chesed, and with Him is plenteous pedut (redemption). 
And He shall redeem Yisroel from all his iniquities.
