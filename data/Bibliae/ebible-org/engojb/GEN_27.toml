'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` And Yitzchak answered and said unto Esav, See, I have made him gevir over you, and all his achim have I given to him for avadim; and with dagan and tirosh have I sustained him; and what shall I do now unto thee, beni?

'''
"45" = '''

'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` And Rivkah said to Yitzchak, I am weary of my life because of the Banot Chet: if Ya'akov take an isha of the Banot Chet (Hittite women) such as these which are of the banot ha'aretz, what will chayyim to me be?
