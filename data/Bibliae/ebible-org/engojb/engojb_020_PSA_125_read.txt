TEHILLIM.
Chapter 125.
(Shir HaMa'alot Song of Ascents) 1They that trust in Hashem shall be as Mount Tziyon, which is immoveable, and abideth l'olam. 
As harim (the mountains) surround Yerushalayim, so Hashem surrounds His people from henceforth v'ad olam (and to forever). 
For the shevet (scepter) of the resha shall not rest upon the goral (allotment, property) of the tzaddikim; lest the tzaddikim put forth their hands unto iniquity. 
Do good, Hashem, unto the tovim, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 
As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Hashem shall turn them away with the workers of iniquity; but shalom shall be upon Yisroel.
