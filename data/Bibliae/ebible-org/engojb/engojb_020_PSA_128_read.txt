TEHILLIM.
Chapter 128.
(Shir HaMa'alot) 1 Ashrei kol yerei (fearers of)Hashem; that walketh in His drakhim. 
For thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be tov with thee. 
Thy isha shall be as a fruitful gefen inside thine bais; thy banim like olive shoots around thy shulchan. 
Hinei, thus shall the gever be blessed that feareth Hashem. 
Hashem shall bless thee out of Tziyon; and thou shalt see the tov of Yerushalayim all the days of thy life. 
Yea, thou shalt see thy bnei banim, and shalom upon Yisroel.
