TEHILLIM.
Chapter 93.
Hashem reigneth, He is robed with majesty; Hashem is clothed with strength, wherewith He hath girded Himself; the tevel (world) also is established, that it cannot be moved. 
Thy kisse is established of old; Thou art me'olam (from everlasting). 
The floods have lifted up, Hashem, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 
Hashem on high is mightier than the noise of mayim rabbim, yea, than the mighty waves of the yam. 
Thy testimonies are very sure; Kodesh becometh Thine Beis, Hashem, forever.
