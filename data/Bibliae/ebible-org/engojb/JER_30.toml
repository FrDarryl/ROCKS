'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Thus speaketh Hashem Elohei Yisroel, saying, Write thee all the Devarim that I have spoken unto thee in a sefer. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For, hinei, the days are coming, saith Hashem, that I will bring back from captivity My people Yisroel and Yehudah, saith Hashem; and I will cause them to return to ha'aretz that I gave to their avot, and they shall possess it. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And these are the Devarim that Hashem spoke concerning Yisroel and concerning Yehudah. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For thus saith Hashem: We have heard a cry of fear, of pachad (terror), and not of shalom. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Ask ye now, and see whether a zachar (male) doth travail with child? Why do I see every gever with his hands on his stomach, like a woman in labor, and all faces are turned deadly pale? 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Alas! For gadol hayom, so that none is like it; it is even the Et (Time) of Tzarah l'Ya'akov (Jacobʼs Trouble), but he shall be saved out of it. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For it shall come to pass in that day, saith Hashem Tzva'os, that I will break his yoke from off thy tzavar (neck), and will burst thy bonds, and zarim (foreigners) shall no more make a slave of him;

'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Therefore, fear thou not, O Avdi Ya'akov, saith Hashem; neither be dismayed, O Yisroel; for, hineni, I will save thee from afar, and thy zera from the eretz of their captivity; and Ya'akov shall return, and shall be at rest, and be secure, and none shall make him afraid. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For I am with thee, saith Hashem, to save thee; though I make a full end of all Goyim where I have scattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in mishpat, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For thus saith Hashem: Thy bruise is incurable, and thy makkah (blow, wound) is grievous. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` There is none to uphold thy cause, no refu'ot for your wound, no healing for you. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the makkat oyev, with the musar (chastisement) of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine avon, because thy sins were increased. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Why dost thou cry out over thine affliction? Thy pain is incurable for the multitude of thine avon; because thy chattot were increased, I have done these things unto thee. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that plunder thee shall become plunder, and all that prey upon thee will I give for prey. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy makkot (wounds), saith Hashem; because they called thee a Nidachah (Outcast), saying: This is Tziyon, whom no one careth for. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Thus saith Hashem: Hineni, I will bring back the captivity of Ya'akovʼs ohalim, and have compassion on his dwelling places; and the Ir shall be rebuilt upon her own ruins, and the armon (citadel) shall stand on its rightful site. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And out of them shall proceed todah (thanksgiving) and the voice of them that rejoice; and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also honor them, and they shall not be disdained. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Their banim also shall be as formerly, and their Edah (Congregation) shall be established before Me, and I will punish all that oppress them. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And their Adir (Prince, Leader) shall be one of their own, and their Moshel (ruler) shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto Me; for who is this that devoted his lev to approach unto Me? 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And ye shall be My people, and I will be your Elohim. 
'''

'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` The Charon Af Hashem shall not return, until He hath accomplished it, and until He have performed the mezimmot (intents, purposes) of His lev; in the acharit hayamim (latter days) ye shall understand this.

:sup:`25` At the same time, saith Hashem, I will be Elohim l'khol mishpekhot Yisroel, and they shall be My people.
