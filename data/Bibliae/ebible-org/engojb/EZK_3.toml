:sup:`1` Moreover He said unto me, Ben Adam, eat that thou findest; eat this megillah, and go speak unto Bais Yisroel. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that megillah. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And He said unto me, Ben Adam, cause thy beten to eat, and fill thy bowels with this megillah that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as devash for sweetness. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And He said unto me, Ben Adam, go, get thee unto the Bais Yisroel, and speak My words unto them. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For thou art not sent to an Am Imkei Safah (a people of indecipherable language) and of obscure lashon, but to Bais Yisroel; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` Not to amim rabbim of indecipherable language and obscure lashon whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have paid heed unto thee. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` But Bais Yisroel will not pay heed unto thee; for they will not pay heed unto Me; for kol Bais Yisroel are khizkei metzach (hard-set of brow) and keshei-lev (hard-hearted). 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Hinei, I have made thy face chazakim against their faces, and thy metzach chazak (forehead strong) against their metzach. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` As a shamir (adamant, hardest stone) more chazak than flint have I made thy metzach (forehead); fear them not, neither be terrified at their looks, though they be a bais meri (house of rebellion). 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Moreover He said unto me, Ben Adam, all My words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine lev, and hear with thine oznayim. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And go, get thee to them of the Golus, unto the Bnei Amecha, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem; whether they will hear, or whether they will refrain. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then the Ruach lifted me and took me up, and I heard behind me a kol ra'ash gadol (a voice of a great rustling), saying, Baruch Kavod Hashem from His makom (place, home). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` I heard also the noise of the wings of the Chayos that touched one another, and the noise of the Ofanim (wheels) opposite them, and a voice of ra'ash gadol. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` So the Ruach lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in mar (bitterness), in the anger of my ruach; but the yad Hashem was chazah upon me. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Then I came to them of the Golus at Tel-Aviv, that dwelt by the Nahar Kevar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there speechlessly astounded among them shivat yamim. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And it came to pass at the end of shivat yamim, that the Devar Hashem came unto me, saying, 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Ben Adam, I have made thee a tzofeh (watchman) unto the Bais Yisroel; therefore hear the word at My mouth, and give them warning from Me. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` When I say unto the rasha, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the rasha from his derech harasha'ah, to save his life; the same rasha shall die in his avon; but I will hold accountable thine yad for his dahm. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Yet if thou warn the rasha, and he turn not from his resha, nor from his derech harasha'ah, he shall die in his avon; but thou hast saved thy nefesh. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Again, When a tzaddik doth turn from his tzedek, and commit evil, and I lay a michshol (stumbling block of temptation) before him, he shall die; because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his chattat, and his tzidkot which he hath worked shall not be remembered; but I will hold accountable thine yad for his dahm. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Nevertheless if thou warn the tzaddik, that the tzaddik sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast saved thy nefesh. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And the Yad Hashem(Hand, Power of Hashem) was there upon me; and He said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there speak with thee. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and, hinei, the Kavod Hashem stood there, as the Kavod which I saw by the Nahar Kevar; I fell on my face. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Then the Ruach entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself in the confines of thine bais. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But thou, O Ben Adam, hinei, they tied on thee ropes, and have bound thee with them, that thou canst not go out among them; 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And I will make thy leshon cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be mute, and shalt not be to them an ish mokhi'ach (admonisher); for they are a bais meri. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Adonoi Hashem; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that refuseth, let him refuse; for they are a bais meri.
