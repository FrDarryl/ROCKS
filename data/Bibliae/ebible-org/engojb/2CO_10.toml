"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Now I myself, Sha'ul, appeal to you gently in Moshiach and in his anavah (humility) I who am peh el peh (panim el panim, face to face) “lowly” among you but have “chutzpah” with you when absent. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` Now I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show enough chutzpah to oppose certain persons, the ones considering us to act according to the standards of the basar of the Olam Hazeh. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For though walking in basar, we war not according to the basar, 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For the weapons of our warfare are not of the basar, but full of ko'ach through Hashem to the overthrowing of strongholds, reasonings, 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And every high minded thing rising up against the da'as of Hashem, and leading captive every machshavah (thought) into the mishma'at of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And prepared to discipline all disobedience whenever your mishma'at (obedience) is completed. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` You look at things according to outward appearance. If anyone has persuaded himself that he belongs to Moshiach, have zikaron (recollection) of this: as he is of Moshiach, so also are we. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Now even if I should glory a little too much in our samchut (authority) as Shlichim of Moshiach which Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu gave for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will make good my claim. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` I did not intend to seem as if my iggrot were meant to frighten you. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For they say, “His iggrot indeed are weighty and strong but his physical presence is weak and his shprach (diction), as far as rhetoric is concerned, is despicable.” 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Let such a one consider this: that the dvar we speak through iggrot when absent will become action we will very well do when present! 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` For we dare not to make a geder (classification) for ourselves or to compare ourselves with some of the ones commending themselves, but when they measure themselves by the standard of one another or compare themselves with one another, they do not show seichel. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` But we will not boast out of our depth, but will be shomer to keep within the sadeh (field)Hashem has apportioned to us which reached out even as far as you. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For we were not getting out of our depth when we reached even as far as you. We were the chalutzim (pioneers) who came with the Besuras HaGeulah of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` We do not boast out of our depth, that is, in the labor of others; but tikvateinu is that, as your emunah grows, our sphere of Shlichus (Divine mission) among you will also be enlarged, 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` So that we may abundantly proclaim the Besuras HaGeulah to the regions beyond you, without boasting in someone elseʼs Messianic chalutz accomplishments. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` But HAMMIT HALLELYIT HALLEL (“The one boasting let him boast” in the L-rd); 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` For it is not the one commending himself that has the haskama (approval), but it is the one to whom Moshiach Adoneinu gives the haskama.
