"4" = '''
:sup:`4` But Avimelech had not come near her; and he said, Adonoi, wilt Thou slay also a goy tzaddik?

"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Said he not unto me, She is my achot? and she, even she herself said, He is achi: in the tohm (integrity, guilelessness) of my lev and with clean hands of my innocency have I done this. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And HaElohim said unto him in a chalom, Yea, I have da'as that thou didst this in the tohm (integrity, guilelessness) of thy lev; for I also withheld thee from sinning against Me; therefore allowed I thee not to touch her.

"13" = '''
