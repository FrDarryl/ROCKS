TEHILLIM.
Chapter 70.
(For the one directing. Mizmor of Dovid. For the memorial portion of the minchah) 
Make haste, Elohim, to deliver me; make haste to help me, Hashem. 
Let them have bushah and be confounded that seek my nefesh; let them be turned back, and be put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 
Let them be turned back for a reward of their bushah that say, Aha, aha. 
Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and have simcha in Thee; and let such as love Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) say continually: Let Elohim be magnified. 
But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, Elohim; Thou art my help and my deliverer. Hashem, make no delay.
