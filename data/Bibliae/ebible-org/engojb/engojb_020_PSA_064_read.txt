TEHILLIM.
Chapter 64.
(For the one directing. Mizmor of Dovid) 
Hear my voice, O Elohim, in my si'akh (complaint); preserve my life from the pachad (terror) of the oyev (enemy). 
Hide me from the sod (secret counsel, conspiracy) of the re'im; from the rigshah (insurrection, noisy crowd, assembly) of the workers of iniquity; 
Who whet their tongue like a cherev, and aim their khitzim (arrows), even davar mar (bitter words); 
That they may shoot in secret at the tam (innocent); pitom (suddenly) do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
They encourage themselves in a davar rah (an evil plan); they speak in order to set mokshim (snares, hidden traps); they say, Who shall see them? 
Or search out their iniquities? They have accomplished a cunningly devised plot; for the mind of ish (man) and the lev (heart) are deep. 
But Elohim shall shoot at them with a khetz (arrow); pitom (suddenly) shall their wounds be. 
So the leshon of them will bring ruin upon them; all that see them shall shake their head. 
And kol adam shall fear, and shall declare the po'al Elohim (work of G-d); for they shall ponder His ma'aseh. 
The tzaddik shall be glad in Hashem, and shall take refuge in Him; and all the yishrei lev (upright of heart) shall glory.
