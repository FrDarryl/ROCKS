:sup:`1` And the Kohen Gadol said, Are these things so? 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And Stefanos said, Achim and Avot, hear me! Elohei Hakavod appeared to Avraham Avinu while he was in Mesopotamia before he lived in Charan. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And Hashem said to Avram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come to the land which I shall show you. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Then having departed from the land of the Chaldeans, he settled in Charan. And from there, after the mavet of his Av, he was settled by Hashem here in this land in which we now are living. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And Hashem did not give to him a nachalah (inheritance) in it nor AD MIDRACH KAF REGEL (even enough to put your foot on); and yet, even when he had no ben, the havtachah (promise) of Hashem to him was ES HAARETZ HAZOT E'TEN (This land I will give) to him and to his zera (seed) after him. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Hashem spoke thus, that GER YIHIYEH ZAR'ACHA (your seed will be strangers aliens) in anotherʼs land and them they will enslave and they will mistreat them ARBA ME'OT SHANAH (four hundred years). 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` V'GAM ES HAGOY ASHER YA'AVODU DAN ANOCHI (And whatever nation to which they shall be in bondage I myself will judge, said Hashem,) VACHAREI KHEN YETZU (And after that they will come out) and serve me in this place. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And he gave to him bris milah. And thus Avraham Avinu became the father of Yitzchak and he did his bris milah on the Yom HaShemini and Yitzchak became the father of Ya'akov and Ya'akov of the Sheneym Asar HaAvot. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And the Avot had kinah toward Yosef and sold him into Mitzrayim (Egypt), and Hashem was with him. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And Hashem delivered Yosef from all his tzoros and gave to him Chen v'Chesed Hashem and chochmah before Pharaoh king of Mitzrayim (Egypt) and he appointed him his grand vizier to rule over Mitzrayim and over his whole bais. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Now a famine came over all Mitzrayim (Egypt) and Kena'an and tzarah gedolah (great tribulation) and Avoteinu were not finding okhel. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And when Ya'akov Avinu heard that there was grain in Mitzrayim (Egypt), he sent Avoteinu there pa'am harishonah (the first time). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And on the second visit Yosef was recognized by his Achim, and Yosefʼs mishpochah became known to Pharaoh. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And having sent, Yosef summoned Ya'akov his Abba and all his mishpochah, SHIVIM(Seventy) nefashot (souls). 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And Ya'akov Avinu went down to Mitzrayim (Egypt) and he died, as did Avoteinu. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And they were brought back to Shechem and were placed in the kever (tomb) which Avraham bought for a sum of silver from the banim of Chamor in Shechem. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Now as the time of the havtachah (promise) was drawing near, which Hashem promised to Avraham Avinu, the people grew and were multiplied in Mitzrayim, 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Until over Mitzrayim there appeared a MELECH CHADASH ASHER LO YADA ES YOSEF (a new king who knew not Yosef). 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` This king exploited by his shrewdness our nation and mistreated Avoteinu so as to make their ollelim (infants) exposed in order not to keep them alive. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And at this time Moshe Rabbenu was born and he was well pleasing to Hashem; and he was nurtured for shloshah chodashim in the bais of his abba. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And after he had been exposed, the bat Pharaoh took Moshe Rabbeinu away, and brought him up as her own son. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And Moshe Rabbenu was instructed in all the chochmah of the Egyptians and in devarim (words) and pe'ulot (deeds) he was given ko'ach. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` But when arba'im shanah of his days were completed, it entered into his lev (heart) to visit his Achim of the Bnei Yisroel. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And having seen one of them being treated unjustly he retaliated and brought yashrus (justice) for the one being oppressed by striking down the Egyptian. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Now he was assuming that his achim had binah that Hashem by the hand of Moshe was giving Yeshu'at Eloheinu to them, but they did not have binah (understanding). 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And on the next day he came to them as they were fighting and Moshe was trying to reconcile them in shalom, saying, Anashim, you are achim, why are you injuring one another? 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` But the one injuring his re'a pushed Moshe aside, saying MI SAMECHA L'ISH SAR V'SHOFET ALENU? (Who made you ruler and judge over us)? 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` HALEHARGENI ATAH OMER KA'ASHER HARAGTA yesterday ES HAMITZRI (You do not mean to kill me in the same manner as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?) 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And Moshe Rabbenu fled at this dvar and became a stranger in eretz Midyan, where he became the father of shnei banim. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` And at the fulfillment of arba'im shanah a MALACH appeared to him BELABAT EISH MITOCH HASENEH (in flame of fire from within a burning thorn bush) in the desert of the mountain Sinai. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` And Moshe Rabbenu having seen this, was nispoyel (standing in awe) at the chazon and, as he was approaching it to look more closely, there came the kol (voice) of Hashem, 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` I am the G-d of your Avot, I am the G-d of Avraham and the G-d of Yitzchak and the G-d of Ya'akov. But Moshe Rabbenu was trembling with pachad and was not daring to look. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` And Hashem said to him, SAL NE'ALECHA ME'AL RAGLECHA (Take off your sandals from your feet) for the place on which you have stood is admat kodesh (holy ground). 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` I have seen the ONI AMMI ASHER B'MITZRAYIM (misery of my people in Mitzrayim Egypt) and the groaning of them I heard and I came down to deliver them. And now come that I may send you to Mitzrayim (Egypt). 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` This Moshe whom they denied, having said, MI SAMECHA L'ISH SAR V'SHOFET? (Who made you a ruler and a judge?), is the one whom G-d sent to be both SAR (ruler) and GO'EL (redeemer) with the help of the malach having appeared to him in the thorn bush. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` This one led them out, effecting moftim and otot in eretz Mitzrayim (Egypt) and in the Yam Suf and in the midbar arba'im shanah. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` This is the Moshe who said to the Bnei Yisroel, NAVI MIKIRBECHA ME'ACHECHA KAMONI YAKIM (A prophet from among you from your brothers like me Hashem will raise up.) 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` This is the one having been in the kahal (assembly) in the midbar together with the malach speaking to him at the mountain of Sinai, who was with Avoteinu; he is the one who received torat chayyim to give to us. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` And Avoteinu were not willing to have mishma'at (obedience) to Moshe Rabbenu, but they pushed him aside and they turned their levavot back to Mitzrayim (Egypt), 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` Having said to Aharon, Make for us g-ds who will go before us; for this Moshe who led us out of the land of Mitzrayim we do not know what happened to him. 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` And at that time they made an egel (calf) and brought a sacrifice offering to the elil (idol) and were taking delight in the ma'asim (works) of their hands. 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` But Hashem turned away and handed them over to serve the tzeva Shomayim, just as it has been written in the sefer haNevi'im, HAZEVACHIM UMINCHAH HIGASHTEM LI BAMIDBAR ARBA'IM SHANAH, BET YISROEL (It was not to me that you offered victims and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, was it, O House of Israel?) 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` You also took up the ohel of Moloch and the KOKHAV of your g-d Reifan, the tzelamim (idols) which you made to worship them; therefore N'HIGLEITI ETKHEM MEHALAH (I will exile you beyond) Babylon. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` Avoteinu had the Mishkan HaEdut in the midbar just as the One who spoke to Moshe Rabbeinu directed him to make it according to the TAVNIT (pattern) which he had seen. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` And having received it in their turn, Avoteinu brought it in with Yehoshua (Joshua) upon the dispossessing of the land of the Goyim, which Hashem drove out from the presence of Avoteinu until the yamim of Dovid. 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` And Dovid found Chen v'Chesed Hashem before G-d, and asked that he might find a mishkan for Elohei Ya'akov. 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` And Sh'lomo (Solomon) built for him a Beis. 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` But HaElyon does not dwell in battim made by human hands, just as the Navi (prophet) says, 
'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` HASHOMAYIM KISSI V'HAARETZ HADOM RAGLAI (Heaven is my throne and earth is the footstool for my feet). EI-ZEH BAYIT ASHER TIVNU LI (What kind of House will you build for me?) says Hashem, V'EI ZEH MAKOM MENUCHATI (Or where will my resting place be?) 
'''
"50" = '''
:sup:`50` Did not my hand ASATAH (make) all these things? 
'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` You AM KESHEH OREF (stiff-necked people), you who are without the “bris milah” of the lev (heart) and of the oznayim (ears), you always resist the Ruach Hakodesh; you are doing like your Avot. 
'''
"52" = '''
:sup:`52` Which of the Nevi'im (prophets) did your Avot not persecute? And they killed the ones having announced beforehand about the Bias HaMoshiach, the coming of the Tzaddik of whom now you became bogedim and rotzechim (murderers); 
'''
"53" = '''
:sup:`53` You who received the Torah at the directions of malachim and were not shomer of it. 
'''
"54" = '''
:sup:`54` And hearing these things, they were infuriated in their levavot, and they were grinding their teeth at him. 
'''
"55" = '''
:sup:`55` But being full of the Ruach Hakodesh and having gazed into Shomayim, Stefanos saw the kavod (glory) of Hashem and Yehoshua standing limin Hashem. 
'''
"56" = '''
:sup:`56` And Stefanos said, Hinei, I see Shomayim having been opened and the Bar Enosh(Moshiach) standing limin Hashem. 
'''
"57" = '''
:sup:`57` And having cried out with a kol gadol, they shut their oznayim and they rushed down with one impulse upon Stefanos. 
'''
"58" = '''
:sup:`58` And having driven Stefanos outside the Ir (City), they were stoning him. And the edim took off their garments at the feet of a bochur named Sha'ul. 
'''
"59" = '''
:sup:`59` And they went on stoning Stefanos as he called upon Hashem, saying, Adoneinu, receive my neshamah. 
'''
"60" = '''
:sup:`60` And having fallen down, he cried out in a kol gadol, Adoneinu, may this aveirah not be held against them! And having said this, Stefanos fell asleep. And Rav Sha'ul was giving approval to the murder of Stefanos.
