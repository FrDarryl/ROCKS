'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For there will be a time when sound charedi (orthodox) hora'ah they will not tolerate, but according to their ta'avot they will accumulate morim to tickle their ears. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And from HaEmes of Hashem they will turn their ear away shmad and to aggadah they will be turned aside. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` But, you, exercise shlitah atzmi (self-control) in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of a mevaser of the Besuras HaGeulah, fully carry out your avodas kodesh ministry of kiruv rechokim (bringing near the far away ones).

'''

'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Alexander the coppersmith did ra'ot rabbot (much evil) to me; Adonoi will repay him L'ISH K'MA'ASEIHU (to each as his deeds). 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` You also watch out for him, because he greatly opposed our message. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` At my first hitstaddekut (defense), no one came to be with me, but all forsook me. May it not be counted against them. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` But Adoneinu stood with me, and empowered me, that through me the hachrazah (proclamation, kerygma) of the Besuras HaGeulah might be fully preached and all the Nations might hear it. And I was rescued out of the mouth of the lion. 
'''
"18" = '''
