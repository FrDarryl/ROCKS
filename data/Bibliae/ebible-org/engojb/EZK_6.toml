"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And say, Ye mountains of Yisroel, hear the Devar Adonoi Hashem; Thus saith Adonoi Hashem to the harim (mountains), and to the geva'ot (hills), to the ravines, and to the valleys: Hineni, I, even I, will bring a cherev upon you, and I will destroy your high places.

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And they that escape of you shall remember Me among the Goyim where they shall be carried captive, how I have known hurt by the lev hazoneh of them which turned away from Me, and by their einayot hazonot which went a-whoring after their gillulim; they shall lothe themselves for the ra'ot (evils) which they have committed in all their to'avot.

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` He that is far off shall die by dever; and he that is near shall fall by cherev; and he that surviveth and is besieged shall die by ra'av (famine); thus will I accomplish My chemah (fury) upon them.
