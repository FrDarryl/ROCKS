'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And she answered him, No, achi, do not violate me; for no such thing ought to be done in Yisroel; do not thou this nevalah (foul deed, shameful thing). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And I, to where shall I cause my cherpah (shame, disgrace) to go? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the nevalim (wicked fools) in Yisroel. Now therefore, speak unto HaMelech; for he will not withhold me from thee. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Howbeit he would not pay heed unto her voice; but, being stronger than she, violated her and raped her, and lay with her.
