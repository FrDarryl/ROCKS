"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And Moshe said unto Aharon, and unto El'azar and unto Itamar, his banim, Don't uncover your head, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon kol HaEdah; but let your brethren, the kol Bais Yisroel, bewail the burning which Hashem hath kindled.

'''
"9" = '''

'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And ye shall eat it in the makom kadosh, because it is the chok (share, portion) of thee and thy banim, of the sacrifices of Hashem made by eish; for so I am commanded. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And the breast of the waving and raised up thigh shall ye eat in a makom tahor; thou, and thy banim, and thy banot with thee; for they are thy chok, and the chok of thy banim, which are given out of the zevakhim of shelamim (peace offerings) of the Bnei Yisroel.

"15" = '''
:sup:`15` The raised-up thigh and the breast of the waving shall they bring with the offerings made by eish of the chalavim (fat portions), to wave it for a wave offering before Hashem; and it shall be thine, and unto thy banim with thee, by a chok olam (portion forever); as Hashem hath commanded.

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Why have ye not eaten the chattat in the makom hakodesh, seeing it is kodesh kodashim, and G-d hath given it you to bear away the avon HaEdah, to make kapporah for them before Hashem? 
'''
"18" = '''

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And Aharon said unto Moshe, See, today have they offered their chattat (sin offering) and their olah (burnt offering) before Hashem; and such things have befallen me; and if I had eaten the chattat today, should it have been accepted in the sight of Hashem?
