So HaMelech Sh'lomo was Melech over kol Yisroel. 
And these were the sarim which he had; Azaryah Ben Tzadok HaKohen, 
Elichoreph and Achiyah, the Bnei Shisha, Sofrim (scribes); Yehoshaphat Ben Achilud, the Mazkir (secretary). 
And Benayah Ben Yehoyada was over the Tzava (army); and Tzadok and Evyatar (Abiathar) were the Kohanim; 
And Azaryah Ben Natan was over the Nitzavim (commissioners) and Zavud Ben Natan kohen re'eh HaMelech; 
And Achishar was over the Bais (palace); and Adoniram Ben Avda was over the forced labor. 
And Sh'lomo had twelve Nitzavim (commissioners) over kol Yisroel, which provided provision for HaMelech and his Bais (palace); each man his month in a shanah (year) made provision. 
And these are their shemot; Ben-Chur, in har Ephrayim; 
Ben-Deker in Makatz, and in Sha'albim, and Beit-Shemesh, and Elon Beit-Chanan;

Yehudah and Yisroel were many, as the chol (sand) which is by the yam in multitude, eating and drinking, and rejoicing.
