DEVARIM.
Chapter 34.
And Moshe went up from the plains of Moav unto Mt Nevo to the top of Pisgah, that is, over against Yericho. And Hashem showed him all Eretz Gil'ad, unto Dan, 
And all Naphtali, and Eretz Ephrayim, and Menasheh, and all Eretz Yehudah, unto the Western Sea, 
And the Negev, and the plain of the valley of Yericho, the Ir Hatemarim (City of Date Palms), unto Tzoar. 
And Hashem said unto him, This is HaAretz which I swore unto Avraham, unto Yitzchak, and unto Ya'akov, saying, I will give it unto thy zera; I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. 
So Moshe Eved Hashem died there in Eretz Moav, as Hashem had said. 
And He buried him in a valley in Eretz Moav, over against Beit-Pe'or; but no man knoweth of his kever unto this yom. 
And Moshe was me'ah v'esrim shanah when he died; his eyesight was not weakened, nor his natural force reduced. 
And the Bnei Yisroel wept for Moshe in the plains of Moav shloshim yom; then the yamim of weeping and mourning for Moshe were ended. 
And Yehoshua ben Nun was full of the ruach chochmah; for Moshe had laid his hands upon him; and the Bnei Yisroel were heedful unto him, and did as Hashem commanded Moshe. 
And there arose not a navi since in Yisroel like unto Moshe, whom Hashem knew panim el panim (face to face), 
In all the otot and the mofetim, which Hashem sent him to do in Eretz Mitzrayim to Pharaoh, and to all his avadim, and to all his land, 
And in all that yad hachazakah, and in all the morah hagadol (great terror) which Moshe did in the sight of kol Yisroel.
