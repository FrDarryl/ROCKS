TEHILLIM.
Chapter 67.
(For the one directing. On Neginot. With stringed instruments. Mizmor. Shir) 
Elohim be channun (gracious) unto us, and put a brocha upon us; and may He make His face to shine upon us. Selah 
That Thy Derech may be known upon HaAretz, Thy Yeshu'ah (salvation) among kol Goyim. 
Let the Amim praise Thee, O Elohim; let kol Amim praise Thee. 
O let the peoples be glad and sing for joy, for Thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the peoples upon HaAretz. Selah 
Let the people praise Thee, O Elohim; let kol Amim praise Thee. 
Then shall eretz yield her yevul (increase, produce, harvest); and Elohim, even Eloheinu, shall put a brocha upon us. 
Elohim shall bless us; and kol afsei aretz (all the ends of the earth) shall fear Him.
