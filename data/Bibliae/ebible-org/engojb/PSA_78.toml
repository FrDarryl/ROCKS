"1" = '''
:sup:`1` (Maskil of Asaph) 1 Give ear, O my people, to my torah; incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` I will open my mouth in a mashal; I will utter dark sayings from of old, 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` Which we have heard and known, and Avoteinu have told us. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` We will not hide them from their banim, recounting to the dor acharon the tehillot Hashem, and His power, and His nifla'ot (wonderful works) that He hath done. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` For He established edut in Ya'akov, set torah in Yisroel, which He commanded Avoteinu, that they should make them known to their banim; 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` So that the dor acharon might know them, even the banim which should be born; who should arise and recount them to their banim; 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` That they might put their confidence in Elohim, and not forget the ma'allei El (works of G-d), but keep His mitzvot; 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And might not be as their Avot, a dor sorer u'moreh (stubborn and rebellious generation); a generation that set not its lev aright, and whose ruach was not faithful to G-d. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` The Bnei Ephrayim, being armed, and shooting keshet (the bows), turned back in the day of battle. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` They kept not the Brit Elohim, and refused to walk in His torah; 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And forgot His works, and His nifla'ot (wonders) that He had shown them. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Peleh (marvellous things) did He in the sight of their avot, in Eretz Mitzrayim, in the sadeh (area) of Tzoan. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` He divided the yam, and caused them to pass through; and He made the mayim to stand like a heap. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` In the daytime also He led them with an anan, and all the lailah with an ohr of eish. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` He split the rocks in the midbar, and gave them drink as out of the great tehomot. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused mayim to run down like rivers. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And they sinned yet more against Him by provoking Elyon in the wilderness. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And they tested G-d by their lev by demanding ochel for their lust. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And they spoke against Elohim; they said, Can G-d spread a shulchan in the midbar? 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Behold, He struck the Tzur, that the mayim gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can He give lechem also? Can He provide meat for His people? 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` Therefore Hashem heard this, and was in wrath; so an eish was kindled against Ya'akov, and anger also came up against Yisroel; 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` Because they believed not in Elohim, and trusted not in His Yeshu'ah (salvation); 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Though He had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the daletei Shomayim (doors of heaven), 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the bread of Shomayim. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Ish did eat the bread of angels; He sent them lechem to the full. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` He caused an east wind to blow from Shomayim; and by His oz He brought in the south wind. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` He rained meat also upon them like aphar, and winged fowls like the chol (sand) of the sea; 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And He let it fall in the midst of their machaneh, all around their mishkenot (habitations). 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` So they did eat, and were well filled; for He gave them their own ta'avah (evil desire). 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` They were not estranged from their ta'avah. But while their food was yet in their mouths, 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` The Af Elohim (wrath of G-d) came upon them, and slaughtered the stoutest of them, and cut down the bochurim of Yisroel. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` For all this they sinned still, and believed not in His nifla'ot (wondrous works). 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Therefore their yamim did He consume in hevel (futility, vanity) and their shanim in terror. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` When He slaughtered them, then they sought Him; and they returned and inquired diligently after G-d. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` And they remembered that Elohim was their Tzur, and the El Elyon their Go'el (Redeemer). 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Nevertheless they did flatter Him with their mouth, and they lied unto Him with their leshon. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` For their lev was not right with Him, neither were they faithful in His Brit. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` But He, being full of compassion, made kapporah for their avon and destroyed them not; and He many times turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` For He remembered that they were but basar; a ruach (wind) that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` How oft did they provoke Him in the midbar, and grieve Him in the desert! 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` Again and again they turned back and tested G-d, and imposed limits on Kadosh Yisroel. 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` They remembered not His Yad (Hand, Power), nor the yom (day) when He redeemed them from the enemy. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` How He had wrought His otot in Mitzrayim, and His mofetim in the area of Tzoan. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` And had turned their rivers into dahm; and their streams, that they could not drink. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them; and tzfarde'a (frogs), which destroyed them. 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` He gave also their crop unto the grasshopper, and their produce unto the arbeh (locust). 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` He destroyed their gefen with barad (hail), and their fig trees with frost. 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` He gave up their cattle also to the barad (hail), and their livestock herds to hot thunderbolts. 
'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` He cast upon them His charon af, evrah (wrath), and za'am (indignation), and tzarah, by sending malachim ra'im among them. 
'''
"50" = '''
:sup:`50` He made a way for His anger; He spared not their nefesh from mavet (death), but gave their beasts over to the dever (plague); 
'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` And struck all the bechor in Mitzrayim; the reshit (first fruit) of their strength in the ohalim of Cham; 
'''
"52" = '''
:sup:`52` But made His own people to go forth like tzon, and guided them in the midbar like an eder (flock). 
'''
"53" = '''
:sup:`53` And He led them in safety, so that they had no terror; but the yam overwhelmed their oyevim. 
'''
"54" = '''
:sup:`54` And He brought them to His gevul kadosh (His holy border), even to this Har, which His Yamin had purchased. 
'''
"55" = '''
:sup:`55` He cast out the Goyim also before them, and divided by measure a nachalah for them, and made the Shivtei Yisroel to dwell in their ohalim. 
'''
"56" = '''
:sup:`56` Yet they tested and provoked Elohim Elyon, and were not shomer over His edot; 
'''
"57" = '''
:sup:`57` But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their avot; they turned like a treacherous keshet. 
'''
"58" = '''
:sup:`58` For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their pesilim. 
'''
"59" = '''
:sup:`59` When Elohim heard this, He was in wrath, and greatly abhorred Yisroel; 
'''
"60" = '''
:sup:`60` So that He forsook the Mishkan of Shiloh, the Ohel which He placed among adam (men); 
'''
"61" = '''
:sup:`61` And delivered His oz (strength) into captivity, and His tiferet into the hand of the enemy. 
'''
"62" = '''
:sup:`62` He gave His people over also unto the cherev; and was in wrath with His nachalah. 
'''
"63" = '''
:sup:`63` The eish consumed their bochurim; and their betulot had no wedding celebration. 
'''
"64" = '''
:sup:`64` Their kohanim fell by the cherev; and their almanot made no lamentation. 
'''
"65" = '''
:sup:`65` Then Adonoi awaked as one from sleep, and like a gibbor that shouteth from yayin. 
'''
"66" = '''
:sup:`66` And He struck down His enemies behind; He put them to cherpat olam (perpetual reproach). 
'''
"67" = '''
:sup:`67` Moreover He rejected the Ohel Yosef, and chose not the Shevet Ephrayim; 
'''
"68" = '''
:sup:`68` But chose the Shevet Yehudah, Har Tziyon which He loved. 
'''
"69" = '''
:sup:`69` And He built His Mikdash like heavenly heights, like Eretz which He hath established l'olam. 
'''
"70" = '''
:sup:`70` He chose Dovid also His Eved, and took him from the mikhle'ot tzon (sheepfolds); 
'''
"71" = '''
:sup:`71` From following the nursing ewes He brought him to shepherd Ya'akov His people, and Yisroel His nachalah. 
'''
"72" = '''
:sup:`72` So he shepherded them according to the tohm (integrity, guilelessness) of his lev; and led them by the skillfulness of his hands. 
'''
