:sup:`1` And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was going out from the Beis HaMikdash, one of his talmidim says to him, Hinei! Rebbe, what large stones and impressive binyanim (buildings)! 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Do you see these great binyanim? Not one even (stone) will be left resting on another even (stone). All will be thrown down! 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the Beis HaMikdash having a yechidus (private meeting) with Kefa and Ya'akov and Yochanan and Andrew.

'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach began to say to them, Beware lest anyone deceive you. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` For many will come in my name saying I am here. And they will deceive many. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled. It is necessary for these things to occur, but it is not yet HaKetz (the End). 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For there will be an intifada of ethnic group against ethnic group and malchut against malchut, there will be earthquakes in place after place, and there will be famines. These things are but the beginning of the Chevlei. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` But as for yourselves, take heed and be careful. For they will hand you over to the sanhedrin and in the shuls you will be beaten and before moshlim (governors) and melachim (kings) you will take your stand for the sake of me as a solemn edut (testimony) to them. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` And it is necessary that the Besuras HaGeulah first be proclaimed to all nations. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` And when they arraign you and hand you over for trial, do not be worried beforehand about what you might say; but whatever is given to you in that hour, this you shall say, for it is not you yourselves who are the ones speaking, but the Ruach Hakodesh. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And ach will hand over ach to mavet, and Av his own yeled, and yeladim will rise up against horim (parents) and cause them to be condemned with onesh mavet (the death penalty). 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And everyone will hate you with sinas chinom (baseless hatred) because of my Name. But the one having endured to HaKetz, this one will receive Yeshu'at Eloheinu. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` And when you see the SHIKUTS MESHOMEM(the abomination of desolation, the abomination that causes desolation) standing where it ought not — let the one reading this, take heed — then let the ones in Yehudah flee to the mountains. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And the one on the roof, let him not come down back inside, and let him not enter his bais to take anything away. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And the one in the sadeh (field) let him not turn back to get his kaftan.

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` But daven tefillos that it may not occur in khoref (winter). 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For in those days will be Tzarah Gedolah (Great Tribulation) of such a kind as has not happened from the Reshit Yedei HaBriah (Beginning of the Days of Creation) which Hashem created until now, and never again will be. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And unless Hashem makes those yamim shortened, no one would be delivered in the Yeshu'at Eloheinu. But for the sake of the Bechirim, whom Hashem chose, he shortened the yamim. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` And, then, if someone says to you, Hinei! Here is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach! Hinei! There! do not have emunah in what they say. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` For meshichei sheker (false moshiachs) will arise, and neviei sheker (false prophets), and they will perform otot and moftim so as to deceive and lead astray, if possible, the Bechirim. 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` But you beware. I have forewarned you concerning all things. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` But after the Tzarah of yamim hahem, the shemesh will be darkened, and the levanah will not give its ohr, 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And the kokhavim (stars) will be falling out of Shomayim, and the kochot (powers), the ones in Shomayim, will be shaken. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` And then you will see the BAR ENOSH BA BAANANIM (the Son of Man Moshiach coming in clouds) with gevurah rabbah (great power) and kavod (glory). 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` And then he will send the malachim and he will gather together his Bechirim from the four winds, from the ends (extremities) of haaretz to the ends (extremities) of Shomayim. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And from the etz teenah (fig tree) learn the mashal: when by that time its branch has become tender and it puts forth the leaves, you have daas that Kayitz is near; 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` So also you, when you see these things happening, have daas that it is near, at the doors. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Omein, I say to you that by no means HaDor HaZeh passes away until all these things take place. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` Shomayim and haaretz will pass away, but the devarim of me will by no means pass away. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` But concerning HaYom HaHu or the shaah, no one has daas, neither the malachim in Shomayim nor HaBen, but only HaAv. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Beware, stay shomer (on guard), for you do not have daas when the time is. 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` It is like a man, when departing on a journey and leaving his bais (house) and, having put his avadim (servants) in charge, each with his assigned avodah (work), gives orders to the gatekeeper to be shomer. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` Therefore you be shomer, for you do not have daas when the Baal Bayit comes, either late in the yom or at chatzot halailah or at cockcrow or baboker, 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` Lest having come PITOM (suddenly) he finds you sleeping. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` And what I say to you, I say to all, be shomer.
