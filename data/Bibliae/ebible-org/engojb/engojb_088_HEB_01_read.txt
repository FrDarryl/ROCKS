Moshiachʼs Letter to the Ma'aminim Hameshichiyim from among the Yehudim.
Chapter 1.
In many and various drakhim (ways)Hashem in amolike times (olden times) spoke to the Avot by the Nevi'im. 
At the Ketz HaYamim, Hashem spoke to us by HaBen, whom He appointed Bechor of the Bechorah, Yoresh Kol (Heir of All Things), through whom also Hashem BARAH ES HASHOMAYIM V'ES HA'ARETZ; 
Who being the Shekhinah zohar (brilliance) of Hashem and the exact impress and demut of Hashemʼs essential nature, being, and reality, and sustaining everything by his Dvar HaKo'ach, after he made tihur (purification) of chatta'im (sins), sat down at LIMIN (the right hand) of the Majesty on High. 
He had become as much superior to the malachim as ha-Shem (the Name) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has inherited is more fest (excellent) than theirs. 
For to which of the malachim did Hashem ever say, BENI ATAH, ANI HAYOM YELIDTICHA (My Son you are; today I have become your Father)? And again, ANI EH'H'YEH LO L'AV V'HU YIHEYEH LI L'BEN (I will be to Him a Father and He will be to Me as a Son)? 
And again, when Hashem brings HaBechor into the Olam Hazeh, He says, “Let all Hashemʼs malachim worship him.” 
And of the malachim, Hashem says OSEH MALAKHAV RUCHOT MESHARTAV EISH L'HET (He makes his angels winds and his servants i.e., ministering angels flaming fire). 
And Hashem says to HaBen, KIS'AHCHA ELOHIM OLAM VAED SHEVET MISHOR SHEVET MALKHUTECHA (Your throne, O G-d, will endure for ever and ever, and the scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom). 
AHAVTA TZEDEK VATISNA RE'SHA, AL KEN MESHAKHACHA ELOHIM, ELOHEICHA SHEMEN SASSON MECHAVERECHA (You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; on account of this G-d, your G-d, anointed you with the oil of gladness more than your companions). 
And, Atah Adonoi LEFANIM HA'ARETZ YASADETA UMA'ASEH YADECHA SHOMAYIM (You L-rd in the beginning founded the earth and the heavens, the work of your hands); 
HEMMAH YOVEDU V'ATAH TA'AMOD V'KHULAM KABEGED YIVLU (They will perish but you remain and all of them like the garment they will wear out), 
KALVUSH TACHALIFEM V'YACHALOFU V'ATAH HU USHENOTECHA LO YITTAMMU (Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded, but you are the same and the years of you they never come to an end). 
And to which of the malachim has Hashem ever said, Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies as a footstool for your feet? 
Are not all RUCHOT sharet (ministering spirits, malachey hasharet) sent out with the shlichus (mission) to do avodas kodesh service as Hashemʼs klei kodesh (ministers) on behalf of the ones being about to inherit Yeshu'at Eloheinu?
