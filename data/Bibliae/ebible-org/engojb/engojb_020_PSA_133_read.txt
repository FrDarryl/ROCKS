TEHILLIM.
Chapter 133.
(Shir HaMa'alot, of Dovid) 1Hinei, mah tov umah na'im shevet achim gahm yachad! (how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity)! 
It is like the precious shemen upon the rosh, that ran down upon the beard, even Aharonʼs beard; that went down to the collar of his robes; 
As the tal of Chermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Tziyon; for there Hashem commanded the brocha, even Chayyim Ad Olam.
