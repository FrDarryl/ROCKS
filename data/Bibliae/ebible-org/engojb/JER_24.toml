:sup:`1` Hashem showed me, and, hinei, two baskets of figs were set in front of the Heikhal Hashem; after that Nevukhadretzar Melech Bavel had carried away into the Golus Melech Yehudah Yechanyah ben Y'hoyakim, and the sarim (princes) of Yehudah, with the craftsmen and artisans, from Yerushalayim, and had brought them to Babylon.
