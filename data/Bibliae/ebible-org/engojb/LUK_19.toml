:sup:`1` And having entered, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was passing through Yericho. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And, hinei, a man by name Zakkai was there and he was a chief moches (tax collector) and he was an oisher (rich man). 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And he was seeking to catch a look at Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach and was not able to do so, because of the multitude, and because he was komah (short of stature). 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And having run ahead to the front, he climbed up onto an etz (tree), a sycamore, that he might see Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, because by that derech (way) he was about to pass by. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And as he came to the place, having looked up, Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach said to him, Zakkai, hurry and come down, for hayom (today) in your bais (house) it is necessary for me to remain. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` And having hurried, Zakkai came down and welcomed with Kabbalas HaMalchus (accepting his sovereignty as king) Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach with simcha (joy). 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And all, having seen this, were beginning to kvetch (complain), saying, With a choteh (sinner) he entered to rest? 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` And Zakkai stood there and said to Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu: Hinei, half of my possessions, Adoni, I give as tzedakah (contribution to charity) to the aniyim, and if from someone I defrauded of anything, I am paying back arbatayim (four times). 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` And he said to him, Hayom (Today) Yeshu'at Eloheinu has come to this bais, because he also is a Ben Avraham. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For the Bar Enosh came to seek and to save the lost. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` Now as they were hearing these things, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach added a mashal (parable), because he was near to Yerushalayim and they had the havamina (assumption) that the Malchut Hashem was about to appear immediately. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then Moshiach said, A certain man of noble birth traveled to a distant country to get for himself royal power for his malchut and to return. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And having summoned ten avadim (servants) of his, he gave them ten minas and he said to them, Conduct business until I come. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` But his subjects were hating the man of noble birth and they sent a delegation after him saying, We do not want this one to rule over us. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` And it came about when he returned, having received the royal power of his malchut, he summoned to his presence these avadim to whom he had given the kesef, that he might have daas of what they had gained by trading. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And the rishon (first) came, saying, With your mina, Adoni, ten minas more were gained. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Yafeh! Eved tov! Because you have been ne'eman (faithful) in a very small thing, have shlita (authority) over ten towns. 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` And the sheni (second) came saying, Your mina, Adoni, made five minas. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` And the man of noble birth said also to this one, And you have shlita (authority) over five towns. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` And the other came saying, Adoni, hinei! Your mina which I had put away in a tichel (kerchief). 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For I was fearing you, because you are a big machmir (stickler), you take what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` He says to him, From your own mouth I will judge you, eved rasha (bad servant). You had daas that I am a big machmir (stickler), taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` Why then did you not put my kesef on deposit? Then when I came I would have collected ribit (interest). 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` And to the ones having stood nearby he said, Take from him the mina and give it to the one having ten minas. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` And they said to him, Adoneinu, he has ten minas! 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` I say to you, that to everyone having, more will be given, but from the one not having, even what he has will be taken away. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` But these oyevim of mine, the ones refusing me the Kabbalas HaMalchus (refusing my sovereignty as king) over them, bring here and execute them before me. 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` And having said these things, he was traveling ahead, making his aliyah leregel to Yerushalayim. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` And it came about as he came near to Beit-Pagey and Beit-Anyah, by the Mount of Olives, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach sent two of the talmidim, 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Saying, Go to the shtetl ahead of you, in which entering you will find an AYIR having been tied, upon which none among Bnei Adam ever sat, and having untied it, bring it here. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` And if someone asks you, Why are you untying it? — you will say this: HaAdon has need of it. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` And having departed, the ones having been sent found it just as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach told them. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` And while untying the AYIR, its owners said to them, Why are you untying the AYIR? 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` And they said, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach Adoneinu has need of it. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` And they led it to him and, having thrown their kaftans on the AYIR, they put Rebbe Melech HaMoshiach on it. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` And as Moshiach rode along, the people were spreading their garments on the road. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` And as Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach was now approaching the path that makes the descent from the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the Rebbeʼs talmidim began with simcha (joy) and with a kol gadol (a loud voice) to shout Baruch Hashem for all the nifla'ot (wonders) and gevurot (mighty deeds) of Hashem! For they had been edei reiyah (eyewitnesses) of these, 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` Saying, BARUCH HABAH, HaMelech B'SHEM ADONOI! Shalom b'Shomayim! And kavod in the Highest! 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` And some of the Perushim from the multitude said to him, Rabbi, rebuke your talmidim! 
'''
"40" = '''
:sup:`40` And in reply he said, I say to you, if these will be silent, the avanim (stones) will cry out. 
'''
"41" = '''
:sup:`41` And as he came near, having seen the Ir (City) of Yerushalayim, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach wept over it, 
'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` Saying, If you had only had daas in HaYom HaZeh of the things leading to shalom, but now it was nistar from your eyes. 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` Because yamim (days) will come upon you when your oyevim (enemies) will construct a siege against you and they will surround you and will hem you in from all directions. 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` And they will dash you to the ground, you and your yeladim with you. And they will not leave an even (stone) upon an even (stone) within you, because you did not have daas of the zman (time) of your YOM PEKUDDAH (visitation, reckoning). 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` And having entered into the Beis HaMikdash, Moshiach began to throw out the sellers, 
'''
"46" = '''
:sup:`46` Saying to them, It has been written, BEITI BEIT TEFILLAH YIKAREI, but you made it a MEARAT PARITZIM. 
'''
"47" = '''
:sup:`47` And he was saying shiurim yom yom in the Beis Hamikdash. But the Rashei Hakohanim and the Sofrim were seeking to kill him, and also the Rashei HaAm, 
'''
"48" = '''
:sup:`48` And they were not finding what they might do, for HaAm were all hanging on his every dvar.
