TEHILLIM.
Chapter 122.
(Shir HaMa'alot Song of Ascents, of Dovid) 1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the Bais Hashem. 
Our feet shall stand within thy she'arim, O Yerushalayim. 
Yerushalayim is built as an Ir bound firmly together; 
That is where the Shevatim (tribes) go up, the Shivtei Hashem, according to the edut l'Yisroel (the statute to Yisroel), to give thanks unto the Shem of Hashem. 
For there are set kise'ot l'mishpat (thrones of judgment), the kise'ot of the Bais Dovid. 
Sha'alu shalom Yerushalayim (pray for the peace of Jerusalem); they shall prosper that love thee. 
Shalom be within thy wall, and security within thy citadels. 
L'ma'an (for the sake of) my achim and companions, I will now say, Shalom be within thee. 
L'ma'an the Bais Hashem Eloheinu I will seek thy tov.
