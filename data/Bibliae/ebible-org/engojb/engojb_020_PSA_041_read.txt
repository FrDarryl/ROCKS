TEHILLIM.
Chapter 41.
(For the one directing, Mizmor of Dovid) 
Blessed is he that considereth the helpless; Hashem will deliver him in time of ra'ah (evil, trouble). 
Hashem will be shomer over him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed in ha'aretz; and Thou wilt not surrender him unto the desire of his enemies. 
Hashem will support him upon the sickbed; in his illness, all his bedridden languishing Thou wilt change. 
I said, Hashem, channeni (be gracious unto me); heal my nefesh; for I have sinned against Thee. 
Mine enemies speak rah (evil) of me: When will he die, and shmo (his name) perish? 
And if one cometh to see me, he speaketh falsely; his lev gathereth wickedness to itself; when he goeth lachutz (outside, around) he telleth it. 
All that hate me whisper together against me; against me do they devise my hurt. 
A thing of beliya'al (a wicked fate), say they, cleaveth fast unto him, that when he lieth he shall rise up no more. 
Yea, mine own ish shalom (familiar friend, close friend), in whom I trusted, which did eat of my lechem, hath lifted up his heel against me. 
But Thou, O Hashem, channeni (be gracious, merciful unto me), and raise me up, that I may repay them. 
By this I know that Thou favorest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 
And as for me, Thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before Thy face l'olam (forever). 
Baruch Hashem Elohei Yisroel m'haolam v'ad haolam. Omein and Omein.
