TEHILLIM.
Chapter 111.
Praise Hashem. I will praise Hashem with kol levav, in the Sod (company, council) of the Yesharim (upright ones), and in the Edah (assembly). 
The ma'asei Hashem are gedolim, derushim (sought out, pondered) of all them that have delight therein. 
His po'al (deed, work) is glorious and majestic; and His tzedakah (righteousness) endureth forever. 
He hath caused His nifla'ot (wonderful works) to be remembered; Hashem is channun (gracious) and rachum (compassionate). 
He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He will be mindful of His Brit (covenant) l'olam. 
He hath showed His people the ko'ach of His works, that He may give them the nachalat Goyim. 
The works of His hands are emes and mishpat; all His pikkudim (precepts, commands) are ne'emanim (sure, trustworthy ones). 
They stand fast la'ad l'olam (forever and ever), and are done in emes and yashar (uprightness). 
He sent redemption unto His people; He hath ordained His Brit (covenant) l'olam (forever); Kadosh (holy) and Nora (awesome, reverend) is Shmo. 
The fear of Hashem is the reshit chochmah; seichel tov have all they that live by it; His tehillah (praise) endureth forever.
