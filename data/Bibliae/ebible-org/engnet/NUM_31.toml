"15" = '''

'''
"16" = '''

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Now therefore kill every boy, and kill every woman who has had sexual intercourse with a man.

:sup:`22` ‘Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` everything that may stand the fire, you are to pass through the fire, and it will be ceremonially clean, but it must still be purified with the water of purification. Anything that cannot withstand the fire you must pass through the water.

"30" = '''

:sup:`49` and said to him, “Your servants have taken a count of the men who were in the battle, who were under our authority, and not one is missing.

"50" = '''
