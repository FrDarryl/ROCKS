"13" = '''
:sup:`13` The trumpeters and musicians played together, praising and giving thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they loudly praised the Lord, singing: “Certainly he is good; certainly his loyal love endures!” Then a cloud filled the Lord’s temple. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` The priests could not carry out their duties because of the cloud; the Lord’s splendor filled God’s temple.
