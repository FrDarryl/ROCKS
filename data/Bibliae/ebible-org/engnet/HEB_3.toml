"2" = '''
:sup:`2` who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God’s house. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself!

"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.

'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 
'''
"18" = '''

'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.
