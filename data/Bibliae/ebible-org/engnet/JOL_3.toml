'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` and they cast lots for my people. They traded a boy for a prostitute; they sold a little girl for wine so they could drink. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Why are you doing these things to me, Tyre and Sidon? Are you trying to get even with me, land of Philistia? I will very quickly repay you for what you have done!

'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` I will avenge their blood which I had not previously acquitted. It is the Lord who dwells in Zion!
