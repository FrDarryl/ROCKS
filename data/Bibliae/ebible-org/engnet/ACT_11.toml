:sup:`2` So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers took issue with him, 
'''
"3" = '''

"5" = '''
:sup:`5` “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, an object something like a large sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me.

:sup:`6` As I stared I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds.

"7" = '''
:sup:`7` I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; slaughter and eat!’

"8" = '''
:sup:`8` But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord, for nothing defiled or ritually unclean has ever entered my mouth!’ 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` But the voice replied a second time from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not consider ritually unclean!’ 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` This happened three times, and then everything was pulled up to heaven again.

"11" = '''
:sup:`11` At that very moment, three men sent to me from Caesarea approached the house where we were staying. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.

'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` who will speak a message to you by which you and your entire household will be saved.’ 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Then as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he did on us at the beginning. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` And I remembered the word of the Lord, as he used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Therefore if God gave them the same gift as he also gave us after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder God?” 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, “So then, God has granted the repentance that leads to life even to the Gentiles.” 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message to no one but Jews. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` But there were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene among them who came to Antioch and began to speak to the Greeks too, proclaiming the good news of the Lord Jesus.

"24" = '''
:sup:`24` because he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and a significant number of people were brought to the Lord. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to look for Saul, 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught a significant number of people. Now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.

"28" = '''

:sup:`30` They did so, sending their financial aid to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
