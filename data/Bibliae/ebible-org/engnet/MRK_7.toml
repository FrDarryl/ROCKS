"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Now the Pharisees and some of the experts in the law who came from Jerusalem gathered around him. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` And they saw that some of Jesus’ disciples ate their bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing, holding fast to the tradition of the elders. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They hold fast to many other traditions: the washing of cups, pots, kettles, and dining couches. ) 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?” 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘ This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrine the commandments of men.’ 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` Having no regard for the command of God, you hold fast to human tradition.” 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` He also said to them, “You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For Moses said, ‘ Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘ Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’ 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, ‘Whatever help you would have received from me is corban’ (that is, a gift for God), 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this.” 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Then he called the crowd again and said to them, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` There is nothing outside of a person that can defile him by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him.” 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16`  Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` He said to them, “Are you so foolish? Don’t you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him? 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` For it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the sewer.” (This means all foods are clean.) 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` He said, “What comes out of a person defiles him. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` For from within, out of the human heart, come evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder, 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` All these evils come from within and defile a person.” 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but he was not able to escape notice. 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet. 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin. She asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and to throw it to the dogs.” 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` She answered, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Then he said to her, “Because you said this, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.” 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they asked him to place his hands on him. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers in the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh, “ Ephphatha” (that is, “Be opened”). 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` And immediately the man’s ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly. 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` Jesus ordered them not to tell anything. But as much as he ordered them not to do this, they proclaimed it all the more. 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` People were completely astounded and said, “He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
