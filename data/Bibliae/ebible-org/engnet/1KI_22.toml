:sup:`3` The king of Israel said to his servants, “Surely you recognize that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us, though we are hesitant to reclaim it from the king of Syria.” 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` Then he said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I will support you; my army and horses are at your disposal.”

"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Then Jehoshaphat added, “First seek an oracle from the Lord.” 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` So the king of Israel assembled about four hundred prophets and asked them, “Should I attack Ramoth Gilead or not?” They said, “Attack! The sovereign one will hand it over to the king.” 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not a prophet of the Lord still here, that we may ask him?” 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can seek the Lord’s will. But I despise him because he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster. His name is Micaiah son of Imlah. Jehoshaphat said, “The king should not say such things.”

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` The king of Israel summoned an official and said, “Quickly bring Micaiah son of Imlah.”

'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` When he came before the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth Gilead or not?” He answered him, “Attack! You will succeed; the Lord will hand it over to the king.” 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` The king said to him, “How many times must I make you solemnly promise in the name of the Lord to tell me only the truth?” 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Micaiah said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd. Then the Lord said, ‘They have no master. They should go home in peace.’” 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he does not prophesy prosperity for me, but disaster?” 
'''
"19" = '''

'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` The Lord said, ‘Who will deceive Ahab, so he will attack Ramoth Gilead and die there?’ One said this and another that.

'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` He replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ The Lord said|strong="H0559", ‘Deceive and overpower him. Go out and do as you have proposed.’ 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` So now, look, the Lord has placed a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours; but the Lord has decreed disaster for you.” 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached, hit Micaiah on the jaw, and said, “Which way did the Lord’s spirit go when he went from me to speak to you?” 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` Micaiah replied, “Look, you will see in the day when you go into an inner room to hide.” 
'''

'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Now an archer shot an arrow at random, and it struck the king of Israel between the plates of his armor. The king ordered his charioteer, “Turn around and take me from the battle line, because I’m wounded.” 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` While the battle raged throughout the day, the king stood propped up in his chariot opposite the Syrians. He died in the evening; the blood from the wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot.
