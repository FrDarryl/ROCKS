'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` Indeed, the Lord knocks down|strong="H7817" those who live in a high place, he brings down an elevated town; he brings it down to the ground, he throws it down to the dust. 
'''

"9" = '''
:sup:`9` I look for you during the night, my spirit within me seeks you at dawn, for when your judgments come upon the earth, those who live in the world learn about justice. 
'''
"10" = '''

'''
"17" = '''

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` We were pregnant, we strained, we gave birth, as it were, to wind. We cannot produce deliverance on the earth; people to populate the world are not born. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` Your dead will come back to life; your corpses will rise up. Wake up and shout joyfully, you who live in the ground! For you will grow like plants drenched with the morning dew, and the earth will bring forth its dead spirits.
