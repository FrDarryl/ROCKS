"1" = '''
:sup:`1` Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said, 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat.” 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` He answered them, “And why do you disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For God said, ‘ Honor your father and mother’ and ‘ Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’ 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` But you say, ‘If someone tells his father or mother, “Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,” 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` he does not need to honor his father.’ You have nullified the word of God on account of your tradition. 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said, 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` ‘ This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is|strong="G0568" far from me, 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` and they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’” 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` Then he called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.” 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that when the Pharisees heard this saying they were offended?” 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And he replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Leave them! They are blind guides. If someone who is blind leads another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.” 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.” 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` Jesus said, “Even after all this, are you still so foolish? 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer? 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a person. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For out of the heart come evil ideas, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` These are the things that defile a person; it is not eating with unwashed hands that defiles a person.” 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` After going out from there, Jesus went to the region of Tyre 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!” 
'''
"23" = '''
:sup:`23` But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him, “Send her away, because she keeps on crying out after us.” 
'''
"24" = '''
:sup:`24` So he answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” 
'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` But she came and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, help me!” 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs,” he said. 
'''
"27" = '''
:sup:`27` “Yes, Lord,” she replied, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” 
'''
"28" = '''
:sup:`28` Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great! Let what you want be done for you.” And her daughter was healed from that hour. 
'''
"29" = '''
:sup:`29` When he left there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain, where he sat down. 
'''
"30" = '''
:sup:`30` Then large crowds came to him bringing with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them. 
'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel. 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` Then Jesus called the disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way.” 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` The disciples said to him, “Where can we get enough bread in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?” 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They replied, “Seven – and a few small fish.” 
'''
"35" = '''
:sup:`35` After instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground, 
'''
"36" = '''
:sup:`36` he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds. 
'''
"37" = '''
:sup:`37` They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. 
'''
"38" = '''
:sup:`38` Not counting children and women, there were four thousand men who ate. 
'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
