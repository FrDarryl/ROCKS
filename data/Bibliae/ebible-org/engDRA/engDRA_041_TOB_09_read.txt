Tobit.
Chapter 9.
Then Tobias called the angel to him, whom he took to be a man, and said to him: Brother Azarias, I pray thee hearken to my words: 
If I should give myself to be thy servant I should not make a worthy return for thy care. 
However, I beseech thee, to take with thee beasts and servants, and to go to Gabelus to Rages the city of the Medes: and to restore to him his note of hand, and receive of him the money, and desire him to come to my wedding. 
For thou knowest that my father numbereth the days: and if I stay one day more, his soul will be afflicted. 
And indeed thou seest how Raguel hath adjured me, whose adjuring I cannot despise. 
Then Raphael took four of Raguel’s servants, and two camels, and went to Rages the city of the Medes: and finding Gabelus, gave him his note of hand, and received of him all the money. 
And he told him concerning Tobias the son of Tobias, all that had been done: and made him come with him to the wedding. 
And when he was come into Raguel’s house he found Tobias sitting at the table: and he leaped up, and they kissed each other: and Gabelus wept, and blessed God, 
And said: The God of Israel bless thee, because thou art the son of a very good and just man, and that feareth God, and doth almsdeeds: 
And may a blessing come upon thy wife and upon your parents. 
And may you see your children, and your children’s children, unto the third and fourth generation: and may your seed be blessed by the God of Israel, who reigneth for ever and ever. 
And when all had said, Amen, they went to the feast: but the marriage feast they celebrated also with the fear of the Lord.
