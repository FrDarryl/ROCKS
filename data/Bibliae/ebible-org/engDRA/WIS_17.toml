"1" = '''
:sup:`1` For thy judgments, O Lord, are great, and thy words cannot be expressed: therefore undisciplined souls have erred. 
'''
"2" = '''
:sup:`2` For while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the holy nation, they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses, lay there exiled from the eternal providence. 
'''
"3" = '''
:sup:`3` And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly afraid and troubled with exceeding great astonishment. 
'''
"4" = '''
:sup:`4` For neither did the den that held them, keep them from fear: for noises coming down troubled them, and sad visions appearing to them, affrighted them. 
'''
"5" = '''
:sup:`5` And no power of fire could give them light, neither could the bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night. 
'''
"6" = '''
:sup:`6` But there appeared to them a sudden fire, very dreadful: and being struck with the fear of that face, which was not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse: 
'''
"7" = '''
:sup:`7` And the delusions of their magic art were put down, and their boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked. 
'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at. 
'''
"9" = '''
:sup:`9` For though no terrible thing disturbed them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear: and denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided. 
'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` For whereas wickedness is fearful, it beareth witness of its condemnation: for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous things. 
'''
"11" = '''
:sup:`11` For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And while there is less expectation from within, the greater doth it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment. 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` But they that during that night, in which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell, slept the same sleep. 
'''
"14" = '''
:sup:`14` Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their soul failing them: for a sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them. 
'''
"15" = '''
:sup:`15` Moreover if any of them had fallen down, he was kept shut up in prison without irons. 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly. 
'''
"17" = '''
:sup:`17` For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence, 
'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For the whole world was enlightened with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours. 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.
