"13" = '''
:sup:`13` who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 
'''

'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”

'''
"25" = '''
:sup:`25` They asked him, “Why then do you baptise if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?” 
'''
"26" = '''
:sup:`26` John answered them, “I baptise in water, but amongst you stands one whom you don’t know. 
'''
"27" = '''

'''
"31" = '''
:sup:`31` I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptising in water, that he would be revealed to Israel.” 
'''
"32" = '''
:sup:`32` John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him. 
'''
"33" = '''
:sup:`33` I didn’t recognise him, but he who sent me to baptise in water said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he who baptises in the Holy Spirit.’ 
'''
"34" = '''
:sup:`34` I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.” 
'''
"35" = '''

:sup:`37` The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 
'''
"38" = '''

'''
"39" = '''
:sup:`39` He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.

'''
"42" = '''
:sup:`42` He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter). 
'''
"43" = '''
:sup:`43` On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, “Follow me.” 
'''
"44" = '''
:sup:`44` Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
'''
"45" = '''
:sup:`45` Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 
'''

'''
"49" = '''
:sup:`49` Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!” 
'''
"50" = '''
:sup:`50` Jesus answered him, “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” 
'''
"51" = '''
:sup:`51` He said to him, “Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”
