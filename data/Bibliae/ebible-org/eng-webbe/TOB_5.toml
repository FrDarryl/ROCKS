'''
"8" = '''
:sup:`8` He said to him, “Go, and don’t wait. And he went in and said to his father, “Behold, I have found someone who will go with me.” But he said, “Call him to me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trustworthy man to go with you.”

'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` And he said, “I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, of your kindred.” 
'''
"13" = '''
:sup:`13` And he said to him, “Welcome, brother. Don’t be angry with me, because I sought to know your tribe and family. You are my brother, of an honest and good lineage; for I knew Ananias and Jathan, the sons of Shemaiah the great, when we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of our increase; and they didn’t go astray in the error of our kindred. My brother, you are of a great stock.

'''
"18" = '''
:sup:`18` Don’t be greedy to add money to money; but let it be as refuse compared to our child. 
'''
"19" = '''
:sup:`19` For what the Lord has given us to live is enough for us.” 
'''
"20" = '''
:sup:`20` Tobit said to her, “Don’t worry, my sister. He will return safe and sound, and your eyes will see him. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For a good angel will go with him. His journey will be prospered, and he will return safe and sound.” 
'''
