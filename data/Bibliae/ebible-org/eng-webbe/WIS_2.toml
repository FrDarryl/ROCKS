:sup:`11` But let our strength be a law of righteousness; for that which is weak is proven useless. 
'''
"12" = '''
:sup:`12` But let’s lie in wait for the righteous man, because he annoys us, is contrary to our works, reproaches us with sins against the law, and charges us with sins against our training.
