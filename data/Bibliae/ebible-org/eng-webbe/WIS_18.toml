"9" = '''

'''
"10" = '''
:sup:`10` But the discordant cry of the enemies echoed back, and a pitiful voice of lamentation for children was spread abroad.

"14" = '''
:sup:`14` For while peaceful silence wrapped all things, and night in her own swiftness was half spent,

"15" = '''
:sup:`15` your all-powerful word leapt from heaven, from the royal throne, a stern warrior, into the midst of the doomed land, 
'''
"16" = '''
:sup:`16` bearing as a sharp sword your authentic commandment, and standing, it filled all things with death, and while it touched the sky it stood upon the earth.

"20" = '''
:sup:`20` The experience of death also touched the righteous, and a multitude were destroyed in the wilderness, but the wrath didn’t last long. 
'''
"21" = '''
:sup:`21` For a blameless man hurried to be their champion, bringing the weapon of his own ministry, prayer, and the atoning sacrifice of incense. He withstood the indignation and set an end to the calamity, showing that he was your servant. 
'''
"22" = '''
:sup:`22` And he overcame the anger, not by strength of body, not by force of weapons, but by his word, he subdued the avenger by bringing to remembrance oaths and covenants made with the fathers.

'''
