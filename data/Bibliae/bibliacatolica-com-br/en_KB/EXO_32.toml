"1" = ''':sup:`1` Meanwhile, finding that Moses’ return from the mountain was so long
delayed, the people remonstrated with Aaron. Bestir thyself, they said;
fashion us gods, to be our leaders. We had a man to lead us, this
Moses, when we came away from Egypt; but there is no saying what has
become of him.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Take out the gold ear-rings, said Aaron, that your wives and sons
and daughters wear, and bring them to me.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The people, then, brought him their ear-rings as he had bidden them,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and he melted down what they had given him and cast them into the
figure of a calf. And all cried out, Here are thy gods, Israel, the
gods that rescued thee from the land of Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Aaron, finding them so minded, built an altar in front of it, and
bade the crier give out that there would be a solemn feast next day in
the Lord’s honour.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So when they awoke on the morrow, they offered burnt-sacrifice and
welcome-offerings; and with that, the people sat down to eat and drink,
and rose up to take their pleasure.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And now the Lord said to Moses, Away, down with thee; they have
fallen into sin, this people thou didst bring out of Egypt with thee.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They have been swift to leave the way thou didst mark out for them,
by making a molten calf and falling down to worship it; brought victims
to it, and cried out, Here are thy gods, Israel, the gods that rescued
thee from the land of Egypt.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the Lord said to Moses, I know them now for a stiff-necked race;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` spare me thy importunacy, let me vent my anger and destroy them; I
will make thy posterity into a great nation instead.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But Moses would still plead with the Lord his God; What, Lord, said
he, wilt thou vent thy anger on thy people, the people thou didst
rescue from Egypt so imperiously, with so strong a hand?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Wilt thou let the Egyptians say it was but a treacherous
deliverance; that thou hadst marked them out for death, here in the
mountains, and no trace left of them on earth? Oh let the storm of thy
anger pass; pardon thy people’s guilt!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, and the oath thou
didst swear by thy own name: I will make your posterity countless as
the stars in heaven, and give them all this land of which I spoke to
you, to be their everlasting home.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So the Lord relented, and spared his people the punishment he had
threatened.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` With that, Moses came down from the mountain, carrying in his hand
the two tablets of the law, with writing on either side,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` God’s workmanship; a divine hand had traced the characters they
bore.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And now, as the noise of shouting reached him, Josue said to Moses,
I hear the cry of battle in the camp.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` No, said he, this is no sound of triumph or of rout; it is the
sound of singing that I hear.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then they drew nearer the camp, and he saw the calf standing there,
and the dancing. And so angry was he that he threw down the tablets he
held, and broke them against the spurs of the mountain;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` then he took the calf they had made and threw it on the fire, and
beat it into dust; this dust he sprinkled over water, which he made the
Israelites drink.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And he asked Aaron, What harm has this people done thee, that thou
hast involved them in such guilt?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Do not be angry with me, my lord, said he; thou knowest how the
whole bent of this people is towards wrong-doing,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and it was they who said to me, Fashion us gods to be our leaders.
We had a man to lead us, this Moses, when we came away from Egypt, but
there is no saying now what has become of him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So I asked them, Which of you has any gold in his possession? And
they brought what they had, and gave it to me; I cast it into the fire,
and this calf was the issue of it.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Moses saw, too, that the people went all unarmed; Aaron had let
them strip, in their shameless debauchery, so that they were
defenceless against attack.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So he stood there at the gate of the camp, and said, Rally to my
side, all that will take the Lord’s part. Then the whole tribe of Levi
gathered round them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and he said, A message to you from the Lord God of Israel. Gird on
your swords, and pass to and fro through the middle of the camp, from
gate to gate, killing your own brothers, your own friends, your own
neighbours.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So the sons of Levi did as Moses bade them, and that day some
twenty-three thousand men fell slain.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` To-day, said Moses, at war with your own flesh and blood, you have
dedicated your hands to the Lord’s service, and earned his blessing.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When the morrow came, Moses told the people, You have sinned
heinously; I will go up into the Lord’s presence, and see if I can make
amends for your guilt.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And so, having recourse to the Lord again, he prayed thus: Thy
people have sinned heinously, in making themselves gods of gold. I
entreat thee, pardon this offence of theirs;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` or else blot out my name too from the record thou hast written.✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Whoever sins against me, the Lord answered, shall be blotted out
from my record.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But do thou march on, and lead this people into the land I told
thee of, and my angel shall still go before thee. But when the time
comes for vengeance, this sin of theirs shall not be forgotten.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The Lord, then, made the people suffer for their wickedness in the
matter of the calf Aaron made for them.✻

Notas de rodapé:
32:1-6 - The people ask Aaron to make a golden calf, falling into
idolatry while Moses is on the mountain. This act reflects the constant
temptation to replace the worship of the true God with idols, a direct
32:7-10 - God expresses His anger at Israel's sin, threatening to
destroy them. This passage highlights the gravity of idolatry and the
holiness of God, who cannot tolerate covenant betrayal (see also
32:11-14 - Moses intercedes for the people, asking for God's mercy.
Moses' intercession points to the role of mediator between God and His
people, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate intercessor (see also
32:15-20 - Moses comes down from the mountain and breaks the tablets of
the Law, symbolizing Israel's breaking of the covenant. His destruction
of the golden calf demonstrates the need to eradicate the sin of
idolatry from among the people (see also 2 Kings 23:4-6 and
32:25-29 - The Levites are called by Moses to punish those guilty of
idolatry by executing three thousand men. This severe act illustrates
the seriousness of sin and the need for discipline among God's people
