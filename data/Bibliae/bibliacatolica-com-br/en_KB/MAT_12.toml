"1" = ''':sup:`1` At this time, Jesus was walking through the corn-fields on the
sabbath day. And his disciples, who were hungry, fell to plucking the
ears of corn and eating them.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The Pharisees saw this, and said to him, Look, thy disciples are
doing a thing which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Whereupon he said to them, Have you never read of what David did,
when he and his followers were hungry?✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` How he went into the tabernacle, and ate the loaves set out there
before God, although neither he nor his followers, nor anyone else
except the priests had a right to eat them?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Or again, have you not read in the law that the priests violate the
sabbath rest in the temple, and none blames them?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And I tell you there is one standing here who is greater than the
temple.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` If you had found out what the words mean, It is mercy, not
sacrifice, that wins favour with me, you would not have passed
judgement on the guiltless.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The Son of Man has even the sabbath at his disposal.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So he went on his way, and afterwards came into their synagogue.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And here there was a man who had one of his hands withered; and
they asked Jesus whether it was lawful to do a work of healing on the
sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But he answered, Is there a man among you that has a sheep, who
would not take hold of it and pull it out, if it should fall into a pit
on the sabbath?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And of what value is a sheep compared to a man? There is nothing
unlawful, then, in doing a work of mercy on the sabbath day.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And with that he said to the man, Stretch out thy hand; and when he
stretched it out, it was restored to him as sound as the other.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thereupon the Pharisees left the synagogue, and plotted together to
make away with him.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Jesus was aware of this, and withdrew from the place; great
multitudes followed him, and he healed all their diseases;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` but he laid a strict charge on them that they should not make him
known.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This he did to fulfil the word spoken by the prophet Isaias,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen, my elect, with whom my soul
is well pleased. I will lay my spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim
judgement among the Gentiles.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He will not protest and cry out; none shall hear his voice in the
streets.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He will not snap the staff that is already crushed, or put out the
wick that still smoulders, until the time comes when he crowns his
judgement with victory.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the Gentiles will put their trust in his name.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then they brought to him a man possessed, who was both blind and
dumb; whom he cured, giving him both speech and sight.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The multitudes were filled with amazement; Can this, they asked, be
no other than the Son of David?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But the Pharisees said, when they heard of it, It is only through
the power of Beelzebub, the prince of the devils, that he casts the
devils out.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Whereupon Jesus, who knew what was in their thoughts, said to them,
No kingdom can be at war with itself without being laid waste; no city
or household that is at war with itself can stand firm.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` If it is Satan who casts Satan out, then Satan is at war with
himself, and how is his kingdom to stand firm?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Again, if it is through Beelzebub that I cast out devils, by what
means do your own sons cast them out? It is for these, then, to
pronounce judgement on you.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But if, when I cast out devils, I do it through the Spirit of God,
then it must be that the kingdom of God has already appeared among you.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` How is anyone to gain entrance into the house of a strong man and
plunder his goods without first making the strong man his prisoner?
Then he can plunder his house at will.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He who is not with me, is against me; he who does not gather his
store with me, scatters it abroad.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And now I tell you this; there is pardon for all the other sins and
blasphemies of men, but not for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` There is no one who blasphemes against the Son of Man but may find
forgiveness; but for him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit there
is no forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come.✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Either tell us that the tree is sound and its fruit sound, or that
the tree is withered and its fruit withered; the test of the tree is in
its fruit.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Brood of vipers, how could you speak to good effect, wicked as you
are? It is from the heart’s overflow that the mouth speaks;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` a good man utters good words from his store of goodness, the wicked
man, from his store of wickedness, can utter nothing but what is evil.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And I say this, that in the day of judgement men will be brought to
account for every thoughtless word they have spoken.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Thy words will be matter to acquit, or matter to condemn thee.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Hereupon some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, Master,
may we see a sign from thee?
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` He answered them, The generation that asks for a sign is a wicked
and unfaithful generation; the only sign that will be given it is the
sign of the prophet Jonas.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Jonas was three days and three nights in the belly of the
sea-beast, and the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in
the heart of the earth.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` The men of Nineve will rise up with this generation at the day of
judgement, and will leave it without excuse; for they did penance when
Jonas preached to them, and behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` The queen of the south will rise up with this generation at the day
of judgement, and will leave it without excuse; for she came from the
ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater
than Solomon is here.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` The unclean spirit, which has possessed a man and then goes out of
him, walks about the desert looking for a resting-place, and finds
none;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` and it says, I will go back to my own dwelling, from which I came
out. And it comes back, to find that dwelling empty, and swept out, and
neatly set in order.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Thereupon, it goes away, and brings in seven other spirits more
wicked than itself to bear it company, and together they enter in and
settle down there; so that the last state of that man is worse than the
first. So it shall fare with this wicked generation.✻
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` While he was still speaking to the multitude, it chanced that his
mother and his brethren were standing without, desiring speech with
him.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And someone told him, Here are thy mother and thy brethren standing
without, looking for thee.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` But he made answer to the man that brought him the news, Who is a
mother, who are brethren, to me?
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Then he stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said,
Here are my mother and my brethren!
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` If anyone does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my
brother, and sister, and mother.✻
