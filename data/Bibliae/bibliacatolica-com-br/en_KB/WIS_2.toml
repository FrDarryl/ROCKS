brief our time here, so full of discomfort, and death brings no remedy!
Never a man yet made good his title to have come back from the grave!
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Whence came we, none can tell; and it will be all one hereafter
whether we lived or no. What is our breath, but a passing vapour; what
is our reason, but a spark that sets the brain whirling?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Quench that spark, and our body is turned to ashes; like a spent
sigh, our breath is wasted on the air; like the cloud-wrack our life
passes away, unsubstantial as the mist yonder sun disperses with its
ray, bears down with its heat.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Where is he, the just man? We must plot to be rid of him; he will

Notas de rodapé:
2:1-5 - The wicked doubt God's justice and claim that life is fleeting.
This materialistic view reflects a lack of spiritual understanding and
2:6-9 - The pursuit of temporal pleasures and the denial of any divine
responsibility lead to arrogance. The author emphasizes that true
wisdom opposes this mindset and seeks what is eternal (see also
2:10-12 - The persecution of the righteous is a consequence of
rejecting wisdom. The wicked try to eliminate those who live
righteously, revealing their true nature and contempt for the truth
2:13-16 - The righteous are seen as an affront to the lives of the
wicked, for their righteousness exposes moral corruption. The contrast
between the righteous and the wicked is emphasized, showing how the
light of wisdom overshadows the darkness of unrighteousness (see also
2:17-24 - The death and resurrection of Christ are prefigured in this
passage, which reveals wisdom's victory over death. The assurance of
eternal life for the righteous is a source of hope and encouragement
