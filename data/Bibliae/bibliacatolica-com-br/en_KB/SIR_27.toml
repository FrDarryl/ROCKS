Notas de rodapé:
27:4-7 - The author uses metaphors such as sifting and forging to
illustrate how people's true character is revealed through trials. Just
as a sieve separates the good from the worthless, so a person's words
27:8-10 - The importance of following the commandments and standing
firm in God is emphasized. Those who pursue righteousness will find
life, while those who abandon the fear of God will fall. This principle
reflects divine justice and the role of human choices (see also
27:11:00 - The words of a fool are like a heavy burden on a journey. A
person's words reveal their wisdom or folly. Those who speak words of
wisdom will always be in harmony with God's righteousness (see also
27:22-24 - Betrayal by a friend is compared to a breach of trust and
how difficult it is to repair. Broken trust leads to the loss of
friendship and the impossibility of complete restoration, emphasizing
27:30:00 - Bitterness and anger are described as destructive,
alienating a person from God's mercy. The cultivation of anger and
revenge is condemned, reinforcing the need for forgiveness and
6:14-15).
