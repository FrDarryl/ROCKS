"1" = ''':sup:`1` Afterwards, in the reign of Achaz, whose father was Ozias’ son
Joathan, an attack was made upon Jerusalem by Rasin, king of Syria, and
Phacee, son of Romelia, king of Israel. As it proved, they were not
strong enough to take it;

footing in Ephraim, the hearts of Achaz and his people trembled like
forest trees before the wind.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then it was that the Lord said to Isaias, Take with thee thy son,
Jashub the Survivor,✻ and go out to the end of the aqueduct that feeds
the upper pool in the Fuller’s Ground. There thou wilt meet Achaz,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and this shall be thy message to him, Shew a calm front, do not be
afraid. Must thy heart fail thee because Rasin king of Syria and the
son of Romelia are thy sworn enemies? What is either of them but the
smouldering stump of a fire-brand?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` What if Syria, what if Ephraim and the son of Romelia are plotting
to do thee an injury?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` They think to invade Juda and strike terror into it, so that they
can bring it into their power, and set up the son of Tabeel as its
ruler;

Samaria, if you lose courage, your cause is lost.

thee, or in the height above thee.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` But Achaz said, Nay, I will not ask for a sign; I will not put the
Lord to the test.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Why then, said Isaias, listen to me, you that are of David’s race.
Cannot you be content with trying the patience of men? Must you try my
God’s patience too?

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Sign you ask none, but sign the Lord will give you. Maid shall be

none, the two kingdoms that are thy rivals.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` As for thee, and for thy people, and for thy father’s house, the
Lord means to bring upon thee such days of trouble as have not been
seen since Ephraim parted from Juda, with the coming of the king of
Assyria.

flies that hatch by the last rivers of Egypt; yonder bees, that hive in
the land of Assur.

cavern; thicket is none, nor underground pit, shall be safe from them.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Hard times, when the Lord will be hiring mercenaries from beyond
Euphrates, the king of Assyria’s men, and will leave you quite bare,
hair of head and legs shaved close with this hired rasor of his, and
the beard too!

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Hard times, when one heifer and a pair of sheep are all the stock a
man has;

"22" = ''':sup:`22` milk plentiful, so that he has butter to eat; of butter and honey
the survivors will have no lack;

"23" = ''':sup:`23` but where once a thousand vines grew, each worth a silver piece,
all will be thorns and brushwood.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Covert of thorns and brushwood, where men go armed with bow and
arrows;

"25" = ''':sup:`25` only the hill-sides, that have felt the hoe, shall be free from the
terrors of the covert, and these the cattle shall graze, the sheep
trample under foot.

Syria and Israel. This crisis serves as the backdrop for the prophecy
of divine intervention, showing that God is the refuge of His people in
7:3-4 - God instructs Isaiah to comfort Ahaz, telling him not to fear

who will conceive a son, named Immanuel, “God with us.” This is a
messianic prophecy pointing to the coming of Jesus Christ (see also
7:15-16 - The child Immanuel will eat butter and honey, symbolizing
simplicity, and will know good and evil, indicating moral maturity. The
prophecy emphasizes the future hope and deliverance of Judah (see also
7:17-20 - God warns that He will bring the king of Assyria against
Judah as judgment for their iniquities. This shows that God uses even
enemy nations to discipline His people and bring justice (see also
