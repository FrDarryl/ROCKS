'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Micha, Reia and Baal;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` from him, too, came Beera, the Rubenite chieftain who was carried
off as a prisoner by Thelgath-Phalnasar, king of the Assyrians.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the stock of his clan counted many households, who had still
their own chieftains, Jehiel, and Zacharias,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and Bala, that was descended from Joas through Samma and Azaz, and
held lands in Aroer right up to Nebo and Beelmeon.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` On the east, they were bounded by the approaches of the desert, and
the river Euphrates; many were the cattle they grazed in the Galaadite

'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and levied war on the Agareans, who had Ituraea and Naphis and
Nodab

camels, two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand asses,
besides a hundred thousand prisoners;

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
5:1-2 - Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, loses his birthright due to
his sin. This event highlights the importance of obedience and purity
before God. The birthright is transferred to Joseph, demonstrating that
Deuteronomy 21:17).
5:9-10 - Reuben's descendants expanded their borders and defeated the
Hagrites, demonstrating God's favor in their military conquests.
5:18-20 - The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh
successfully fight powerful enemies. Their victory is due to faith in
God and prayer, showing that trust in the Lord brings victory (see also
5:23-24 - The tribe of Manasseh stands out for its strength and
territorial expansion. God's blessing is present in the accomplishments
of those who follow His ways, demonstrating God's faithfulness to His
17:1-2).
5:25-26 - The eastern tribes of Israel fall into sin, worshiping false
gods. As a result, God allows the Assyrians to take them into exile.
This reflects divine justice and the consequences of unfaithfulness
