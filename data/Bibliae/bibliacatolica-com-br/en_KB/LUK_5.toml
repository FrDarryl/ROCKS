"1" = ''':sup:`1` It happened that he was standing by the lake of Genesareth, at a
time when the multitude was pressing close about him to hear the word
of God;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and he saw two boats moored at the edge of the lake; the fishermen
had gone ashore, and were washing their nets.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he went on board one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and
asked him to stand off a little from the land; and so, sitting down, he
began to teach the multitudes from the boat.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, Stand out into the
deep water, and let down your nets for a catch.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Simon answered him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and caught
nothing; but at thy word I will let down the net.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And when they had done this, they took a great quantity of fish, so
that the net was near breaking,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and they must needs beckon to their partners who were in the other
boat to come and help them. When these came, they filled both boats, so
that they were ready to sink.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` At seeing this, Simon Peter fell down and caught Jesus by the knees;
Leave me to myself, Lord, he said; I am a sinner.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Such amazement had overcome both him and all his crew, at the catch
of fish they had made;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` so it was, too, with James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were
Simon’s partners. But Jesus said to Simon, Do not be afraid; henceforth
thou shalt be a fisher of men.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So, when they had brought their boats to land, they left all and
followed him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Afterwards, while he was in one of the cities, he came upon a man
who was far gone in leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face in
entreaty; Lord, he said, if it be thy will, thou hast power to make me
clean.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said, It is my
will; be thou made clean. Whereupon all at once his leprosy passed from
him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Jesus warned him not to tell anyone of it; Go and shew thyself
to the priest, he said, and bring an offering for thy cleansing, as
Moses commanded, to make the truth known to them.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But still the talk of him spread more and more, and great
multitudes came together to listen to him, and be healed of their
infirmities.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he would steal away from them into the desert and pray there.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It chanced one day that he was teaching, and that some Pharisees
and teachers of the law were sitting by, who had come from every
village in Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem; and the power of the
Lord was there, to grant healing.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Just then, some men brought there on a bed one who was palsied,
whom they tried to carry in and set down in Jesus’ presence.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But, finding no way of carrying him in, because of the multitude,
they went up on to the house-top, and let him down between the tiles,
bed and all, into the clear space in front of Jesus.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he, seeing their faith, said, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Whereupon the Pharisees and scribes fell to reasoning thus, Who can
this be, that he talks so blasphemously? Who can forgive sins but God
and God only?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Jesus knew of these secret thoughts of theirs, and said to them
openly, Why do you reason thus in your hearts?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Which command is more lightly given, to say, Thy sins are forgiven
thee, or to say, Rise up and walk?✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And now, to convince you that the Son of Man has power to forgive
sins while he is on earth (here he spoke to the palsied man), I tell
thee, rise up, take thy bed with thee and go home.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And he rose up at once in full sight of them, took up his bedding,
and went home, giving praise to God.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Astonishment came over them all, and they praised God, full of awe;
We have seen strange things, they said, to-day.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then he went out, and caught sight of a publican, called Levi,
sitting at work in the customs house, and said to him, Follow me.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he rose up, and left all behind, and followed him.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then Levi made a great feast for him in his house, and there was a
crowded company of publicans and others who were their fellow guests.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Whereupon the Pharisees and scribes complained to his disciples,
How comes it that you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But Jesus answered them, It is those who are sick, not those who
are in health, that have need of the physician.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` I have not come to call the just; I have come to call sinners to
repentance.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then they said to him, How is it that thy disciples eat and drink,
when John’s disciples are always fasting and praying, and the
Pharisees’ disciples too?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And he said to them, Can you persuade the men of the bridegroom’s
company to fast, while the bridegroom is still with them?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` No, the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them;
then they will fast, when that day comes.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he told them this parable; Nobody uses a piece taken from a new
cloak to patch an old one; if that is done, he will have torn the new
cloak, and the piece taken from the new will not match the old.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Nor does anybody put new wine into old wine-skins; if that is done,
the new wine bursts the skins, and there is the wine spilt and the
skins spoiled.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If the wine is new, it must be put into fresh wine-skins, and so
both are kept safe.✻
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Nobody who has been drinking old wine calls all at once for new; he
will tell you, The old is better.

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-11 - The calling of the first disciples (Simon, James, and John)
reflects Jesus' transformative capacity. He invites them to follow a
divine mission that goes beyond their everyday occupations. Obedience

power to restore not only health but also human dignity. Jesus'
response to the leper reveals the importance of faith and repentance
5:17-26 - The healing of the paralytic demonstrates Jesus' authority to
forgive sins, something the Pharisees questioned. He not only heals
physically but also spiritually, emphasizing that salvation includes
5:27-32 - Levi's call (Matthew) highlights the theme of inclusion of
the marginalized. Jesus associates with sinners, showing that His
mission is to bring the lost to salvation, not just the righteous (see
5:33-39 - The comparison between new wine and old wineskins highlights
the need for a new understanding and experience of God. Jesus did not
come to follow rigid traditions, but to bring radical spiritual renewal
