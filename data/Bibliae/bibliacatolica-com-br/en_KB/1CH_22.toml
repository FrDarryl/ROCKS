Notas de rodapé:
22:5 - David is concerned with preparing materials for the temple, as
his son Solomon will be young and inexperienced. David's vision
demonstrates his dedication to establishing a suitable place for God's
22:7-9 - David explains that although he desired to build the temple,
God chose Solomon for the work because of the blood David had shed in
battle. This reveals God's desire for the temple to be built by someone
7:12-13).
22:11-12 - David blesses Solomon and encourages him to obey God,
emphasizing the importance of following the commandments for the
kingdom's success. Obedience to God's will is essential for prosperity
22:13 - David reminds Solomon that success in building the temple and
ruling will depend on his faithfulness to God. The concept of obedience
as the key to success reflects a constant in the Old Testament (see
also 1 Kings 2:3-4 and Deuteronomy 28:1-2).
22:17-19 - David exhorts Israel's leaders to help Solomon and seek God
with all their hearts so that the temple can be completed. Cooperation
and unity among leaders are crucial to the fulfillment of God's purpose
