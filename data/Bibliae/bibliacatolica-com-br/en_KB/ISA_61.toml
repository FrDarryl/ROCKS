me to bring good news to men that are humbled, to heal broken hearts,
promising the release of captives, the opening of prison doors,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` proclaiming the year of the Lord’s pardon, the day when he, our God,
will give us redress. Comfort for every mourner;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Sion’s mourners, what decree should I make for them, what gift offer
them? Heads shall be garlanded, that once were strewn with ashes;
bright with oil, the faces that were marred with grief; gaily they
shall be clad, that went sorrowing. Sturdy growths (men will say) that
fulfil hope reposed in them,✻ pride of the Lord’s planting!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Theirs to rebuild what long has lain desolate, repair the ruins of
past days, restore the forsaken cities that were lost, we thought, for
ever.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Strangers they shall be that tend your flocks for you, farm and
vineyard alien hands shall till;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` for you, a higher name, a greater calling, priests and chosen
ministers of the Lord our God. All the wealth of the nations shall be
yours to enjoy, their spoils shall be your boast;

honoured now. Twice happy that home-coming, eternal that content;✻

when men rob me of my sacrifice. Faithfully I will give them their
recompense, bind myself, now, by an eternal covenant.

shall acknowledge; none that sees them but shall know them for a people
the Lord has blessed.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Well may I rejoice in the Lord, well may this heart triumph in my
God. The deliverance he sends is like a garment that wraps me about,
his mercy like a cloak enfolding me; no bridegroom so proud of garland
that crowns him, no bride of the necklace she wears.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` See how yonder earth gives promise of spring, how the garden seeds
give promise of flower! And the Lord God will make good his promise for
all the world to see; a spring-time of deliverance and renown.
