"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When the first day of the first month comes, set up the tabernacle
that is to bear record of me,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and put the ark in it, and screen the ark with the veil.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then bring in the table, and set out due offerings there; the
lamp-stand, too, must be in its place, with lamps on it,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and the golden altar upon which incense is burnt, there before the
ark that bears record of me. Stretch out the hanging at the entrance to
the tabernacle,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and set down before it the altar for burnt-sacrifice,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` with the basin there, full of water, between altar and tabernacle;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and screen off the court and its entrance with the hangings.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then bring out the anointing-oil, and hallow by unction with it the
tabernacle and its appurtenances;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the altar for burnt-sacrifice and all that belongs to it,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and the washing-basin with its stand; all must be consecrated with
the anointing-oil, to be holiness itself.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Bring Aaron, too, and his sons to the doors of the tabernacle that
bears record of me, and, when they have washed,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` clothe them with the sacred vestments in which they are to minister
to me, and anoint them to be my priests for ever.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Moses did as the Lord bade him;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and on the first day of the first month, in this second year of
wandering, the tabernacle was set up.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` To set it up, Moses must first dispose the frames, with their
sockets and poles, and erect the posts;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` then he spread the tapestry over the tabernacle, and covered it, as
the Lord bade him, with the canopy.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He put the tablets of the law in the ark, and passed the poles
through at the base of it, and fixed the throne above it.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then, bringing the ark into the tabernacle, he spread the veil in
front of it, in fulfilment of the Lord’s command.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` In front of the veil, at the northern end of the tabernacle that
bore record of the Lord, he put down the table,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and on it, as the Lord bade him, he set out the consecrated loaves.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` On the south side of the tabernacle, opposite the table, he set up
the lamp-stand,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` with all its lamps in position as the Lord bade him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And before the veil, still under the tabernacle roof, he placed the
golden altar,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` on which, at the Lord’s command, he burnt incense made from spices.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And now he must hang the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and by the door of the tabernacle must stand the altar for
burnt-sacrifice, on which he offered the victims and sacrificial gifts
which the Lord had prescribed.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` He put the basin, too, between the tabernacle and the altar,
filling it with water,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` so that Moses and Aaron and Aaron’s sons could wash their hands and
feet
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` whenever they would enter the tabernacle that bore record of the
covenant, or approach the altar, as the Lord had commanded him.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He also set up the court round the tabernacle and the altar, and
hung the screen at the entrance to it.When all was done,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` a cloud covered the tabernacle, and it was filled with the
brightness of the Lord’s presence;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` nor could Moses enter the tabernacle that bore record of the
covenant, so thick the cloud that spread all about it, so radiant was
the Lord’s majesty; all was wrapped in cloud.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Whenever the cloud lifted from the tabernacle, the Israelites would
muster and set out on the march,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and while it hung there, they halted.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` The divine cloud by day, the divine fire by night, still brooded
over the tabernacle for all Israel to see it, wherever they halted on
their journey.
