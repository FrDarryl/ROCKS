calling upon thee by thy name;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and that I do it for love of my servant Jacob, of Israel, my chosen

his own Fashioner; shall the clay dare ask the potter who moulds it,
What ails thee? Or tell him he is no craftsman?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Strange, if a man should be asked by his own son, why he begot him,
or a woman, why she gave birth!✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and Israel’s maker, Of
me you must learn, what times they be that are coming; trust me to do
what I will with my sons, with my own creatures.

my hands that spread out the heavens, my voice that marshalled the
starry host;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I, too, have summoned this man to perform my designs faithfully; go
he where he will, my guidance shall be his. He shall build up my own
city, he shall let my captives go free, without bribe or ransom, says

"19" = ''':sup:`19` it was not in secret, not in some dark recess of earth, that my
word was spoken. Not in vain I bade the sons of Jacob search for me; I
am the Lord, faithful to my promises, truthful in all I proclaim.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Gather yourselves and come near, flock together to my side, heathen
men that have found deliverance; who still, in your ignorance, set up
wooden images of your own fashioning, and pray to a god that cannot
save.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Tell us your thoughts, come, take counsel among yourselves; who was
