"1" = ''':sup:`1` Who is this, coming from Edom, coming on the road from Bosra, with
garments deep-dyed? Who is this, so gaily clad, marching so valiantly?I
am one who is faithful to his promises, a champion bringing
deliverance.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And why are thy garments stained with red? Why dost thou go clad
like the men who tread out the wine-press?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` None other has trodden the wine-press but I only; out of all the
nations, no champion came to stand at my side. I have been treading
them down in my anger, trampling on them, full of vengeance; their
blood that has been sprinkled on the clothes about me; I come in
garments deep-dyed.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` My heart told me the time had come for vengeance, this was my
destined year of ransom;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` looked I all around, there was none to help me; vainly I called for
aid. My own arm should bring the deliverance I intended; my own
indignation uphold me.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I have trampled the peoples down in my anger, stunned them✻ with my
fury, brought down their strength to the dust.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Listen, while I tell again the story of the Lord’s mercies, what
renown the Lord has won; all the Lord has done for us, all the wealth
of blessings his pardoning love, his abounding pity has lavished on the
race of Israel.

false to me; and with that, he delivered them.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` In all their straits, power of his was not straitened;✻ his angel,
token of his presence, brought them deliverance. In love and pity he
ransomed them, lifted them in his arms and raised them up, all through
the days gone by.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Only when they rebelled against him, when they distressed the
spirit of his chosen servant,✻ he would turn their enemy, and fight
against them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And even yet he would bethink him of times past, of Moses and the
people that once was his.Where is he now, the God that led them through
the sea, his flock with his own appointed shepherds; gave his holy
spirit to the man of his choice?✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Majestic power, that led Moses by the hand; that parted the sea at
their coming, to win his name renown.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Through its waters they passed, sure of their foothold as horse
that is led through the desert;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` carefully as driver on some treacherous hill-side, the Lord’s
spirit guided his people. Thus didst thou bring them home, and win
thyself honour.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Bethink thee now, in heaven; look down from the palace where thou
dwellest, holy and glorious. Where, now, is thy jealous love, where thy
warrior’s strength? Where is thy yearning of heart, thy compassion? For
me, compassion is none.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Yet, who is our father, Lord, if not thou? Let Abraham disown us,
Israel disclaim his own blood, we are thy sons still; is it not thy
boast of old, thou hast paid a price for us?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And now, Lord, wouldst thou drive us away from following thee,
harden our hearts till worship we have none to give thee? For love of
thy own servants, relent, for love of the land that by right is thine.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Is it nothing to thee, enemies of thy holy people should have the
mastery, trample thy sanctuary down?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Fared we worse in old days, before ever we called thee King, ever
took thy holy name for our watchword?
