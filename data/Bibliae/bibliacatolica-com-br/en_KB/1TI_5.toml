"2" = ''':sup:`2` to the older women, as mothers, to the younger (but with all
modesty) as sisters.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Give widows their due, if that name really belongs to them;✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` if a widowed woman is left with children or grandchildren, she must
be warned that their own flesh and blood has the first claim on their
piety. They must make due returns to those who gave them birth; that is
what God asks of them.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The woman who is indeed a widow, bereft of all help, will put her
trust in God, and spend her time, night and day, upon the prayers and
petitions that belong to her state;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` one who lives in luxury would be alive and dead both at once.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Warn them of this, too, or they will bring themselves into
disrepute;

"8" = ''':sup:`8` the man who makes no provision for those nearest him, above all his
own family, has contradicted the teaching of the faith, and indeed does
worse than the unbelievers do.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` If a woman is to be put on the list of widows, she must have
reached, at least, the age of sixty, and have been faithful to one
husband.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` She must have a name for acts of charity; has she brought up
children? Has she been hospitable? Has she washed the feet of the
saints? Has she helped those who were in affliction? Has she attached
herself to every charitable cause?

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Have nothing to do with younger widows; they will live at their
ease at Christ’s expense, and then be for marrying again,✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` thus incurring the guilt of breaking the promise they have made.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Meanwhile, they learn habits of idleness as they go from house to
house; nor are they merely idle, they gossip and interfere, and say
what they have no right to say.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So I would have the younger women marry and bear children and have
households to manage; then they will give enmity no handle for speaking
ill of us.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Already there are some who have turned aside, to follow Satan.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Meanwhile, if a believer has any widows depending on him, he should
undertake their support, leaving the church free to support the widows
who are really destitute.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Presbyters who have acquitted themselves well of their charge
should be awarded double consideration; those especially, who bestow
their pains on preaching and instruction:✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` there is a passage in scripture which tells us not to muzzle the ox
while it is threshing grain, and the labourer has a right to expect his
maintenance.✻

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Do not take cognizance of any charge made against a presbyter,
unless there are two witnesses or more.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` As for the imposition of hands, do not bestow it inconsiderately,
and so share the blame for the sins of others. Keep thyself clear of
fault.✻

"23" = ''':sup:`23` (No, do not confine thyself to water any longer; take a little wine
to relieve thy stomach, and thy frequent attacks of illness.)✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Some men have faults that are plain to view, so that they invite
question; with others, discovery follows upon the heels of enquiry;

"25" = ''':sup:`25` so it is, too, with their merits; some are plain to view, and where
they are not, they cannot long remain hidden.

the value of commitment to faith and good reputation. The church must
5:17-18 - Elders who rule well should be worthy of honor, especially
those who teach. Faithful leadership deserves recognition, and the

leaders, urging that discipline be administered fairly. Leadership
