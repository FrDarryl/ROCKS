"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now turn we to one whom all this news concerned; a widow called
Judith, that was descended (from Ruben)✻ through Merari, Idox, Joseph,
Ozias, Elai, Jamnor, Gedeon, Raphaim, Achitob, Melchias, Enan,
Nathanias, Salathiel and Simeon.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` She had been married to one Manasses, but lost him when the barley
was a-reaping;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he must needs be hurrying his men on as they bound the sheaves on
his farm, while the sun beat fierce on his head, and of that stroke he
died, and was laid to rest with his fathers, there in his native town
of Bethulia.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Judith had now been left a widow these three years and six months
past;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` ever she dwelt cloistered among her maid-servants, in a secret bower
she had made for herself on the roof of her house,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` wearing sackcloth about her waist and keeping fast continually, save
on the sabbath and the new moon and what other holidays were observed
in Israel.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` She was a woman very fair to see, and her husband had left her great
wealth, a full household, and lands well stocked with cattle and sheep;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` a woman of high repute everywhere, and the Lord’s devout worshipper;
no man had a word to say in her dispraise.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` This Judith, then, when she heard how Ozias had promised to
surrender the city in five days’ time, would have two of the elders,
Chabri and Charmi, pay her a visit.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And thus she greeted them, Is it true Ozias has promised he will
hand the city over to the Assyrians, if in five days no rescue comes to
you?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` By what right, sirs, do you put the Lord’s goodness to such a test?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This is no way to win it; rather, we shall earn his displeasure,
add fuel to his vengeance.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What, would you set a date to the Lord’s mercies, bid him keep
tryst with you on a day of your own appointing?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Well for us that he, at least, is patient; repent we, and with
flowing tears ask his pardon!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He will not overwhelm us with reproaches, as men do; not his the
human anger that bursts into flame.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Abate we our pride, and wait on him with chastened spirits;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` entreat him with tears to grant us relief at a time of his own
choosing. Then shall we, who stand aghast now at the pride of our
enemies, triumph in the reward of our humility.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It is something that we have not followed the evil example of our
forefathers, who forsook their own God and worshipped alien gods
instead,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` dooming themselves thus to massacre, to plunder, and to insult at
the hands of their enemies. At least we acknowledge one God, and him
only.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Wait we humbly till he sends us relief; he will avenge our wrongs
by bringing misfortune on our enemies; he, the Lord our God, will bring
the invader low, and disappoint him of his prize.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` You, brethren, are among the elders of the people; their lives are
in your charge. Yours to hearten them, by reminding them what trials
our fathers underwent, to shew whether they were God’s worshippers
indeed;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` how Abraham was put to the proof, tested by long endurance, before
he became God’s friend;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` how Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and all who won God’s favour, must be
loyal to him under great affliction first.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And what of those others, who could not hold out, submitting to the
divine will, under these trials; who bore themselves impatiently, and
did the Lord despite by complaining against him?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` These were the men the destroying angel slew, the men who fell a
prey to serpents.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` It is our turn to suffer now, and never a word said in
remonstrance;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` think we the Lord’s rod too light a punishment for our sins,
believe we that he is punishing us as his servants, to chasten, not to
destroy.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` All thou sayest is true, Ozias and the elders confessed, beyond
cavil.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Pray for us, holy woman as thou art, and the Lord’s true
worshipper.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Why then, said Judith, if you recognize the words I say as God’s
words,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` judge for yourselves whether the deed I mean to do is of God’s
ordaining; and pray him to bring my design to effect.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Stand at the gate this night, while I pass beyond it with my
handmaid for company, and pray that the Lord bring Israel relief within
the five days you spoke of.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But what my design is, never ask me; till I come back and give you
news, I would have nothing of you but your prayers to the Lord our God.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Go in peace, Ozias said, and the Lord be with thee, to the
confusion of our enemies. And with that they left her, and withdrew.
