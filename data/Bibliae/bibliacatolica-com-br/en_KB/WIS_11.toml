brought all their enterprises!

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Through desert solitudes they journeyed on, pitching their camp far
from the haunts of men;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` boldly they confronted their enemy, and overcame his malice.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When they were thirsty, on thy name they called, and out of the
rock’s sheer face water was given to heal their thirst, out of the hard
flint.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Strange likeness between the punishment that befell their enemies,✻
who went thirsty while Israel had drink to their heart’s content,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and the relief of their want Israel now experienced!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thou who once, into defiling blood, hadst troubled the sources of a
living stream,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` to avenge a murderous edict against new-born children, didst now
give thy people abundant water to drink, by means unlooked for.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` How ill it had gone with their adversaries in Egypt, that thirst of
theirs in the desert plainly shewed them;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` in mercy schooled, yet sorely tried, they learned to know what
torments the wicked had undergone, forfeit to thy vengeance.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For Israel, only a test of their faith; only a father’s correction;
for Egypt, as from a king, stern scrutiny and stern doom.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Tidings from far away, that racked the Egyptians no less than their
own former sufferings;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` anguish redoubled, as they groaned over the memory of things past!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` That the same plague of thirst which had tortured themselves should
be the source of Israel’s rejoicing! Then indeed they felt the Lord’s
power, then indeed they wondered at the revenge time had brought;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` wondered at Moses, whom their insolence had long ago disinherited,
when they exposed him with the other children. Thirst, that had been
Egypt’s enemy, had no terrors for the just.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So lost to piety were these Egyptians, such foolish reasonings led
them astray, that they worshipped brute✻ reptiles, and despicable
vermin. And swarms of brute beasts thou didst send to execute thy
vengeance,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` for the more proof that a man’s own sins are the instrument of his
punishment.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thy power knows no restraint, the power that created an ordered
world out of dark chaos. It had been easy to send a plague of bears
upon them, or noble lions;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` or to form new creatures, of a ferocity hitherto unknown, breathing
fiery breath, churning out foul fumes, terrible sparks darting from
their eyes,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` so that men would die of fear at their very aspect, without waiting
for proof of their power to do harm.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Nay, without more ado thou mightest have overthrown them with a
single blast; all at once their sins should have found them out, thy
fierce breath whirled them away; but no, all thou doest is done in
exact measure, all is nicely calculated and weighed.

Notas de rodapé:
11:1-6 - Wisdom is seen as a manifestation of God's power in judgment.
The punishment of the wicked is a central theme, highlighting God's
justice in response to sin and the importance of righteousness (see
11:7-12 - God's mercy is revealed in saving the righteous during the
destruction of the wicked. This duality emphasizes God's compassion and
the hope the righteous have in His protection, even in the midst of
11:13-16 - God’s power is evident in His works in nature. Creation
reflects His wisdom and strength, and recognizing this truth leads to
11:17-21 - The description of the plagues of Egypt serves as a reminder
of God's power to discipline and correct. This narrative emphasizes
that divine wisdom manifests itself not only in blessings but also in
12:6).
