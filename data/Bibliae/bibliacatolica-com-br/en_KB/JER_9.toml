"1" = ''':sup:`1` Well-head were this head of mine, eyes of a fountain these eyes,✻
day nor night should serve me to weep enough for my country’s dead.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Oh that some lodging-place in the wilderness for me were
dwelling-place, far from the haunts of my own people, that are
faithless lovers, rebel subjects all!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Deceitful tongues, treacherous as the hidden archer’s bow, hearts
that lord it over their fellow-countrymen, wrong leading to wrong, and
my claims forgotten! the Lord says.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Neighbour of neighbour beware, kinsman let kinsman never trust; none
goes about to overthrow thee more craftily than brother of thine or
friend.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` None but will overreach his fellow with lies; all their schooling is
in falsehood, all their striving for ill-gotten gain.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In what a nest of treason thou dwellest! And such treason, the Lord
says, as will acknowledge no claim of mine.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` This warning, then, he utters, the Lord of hosts: The fire for them!
They must be tried in the crucible; what other choice has my faithless
people left me?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Tongues that wound like an arrow, with deceit for poison, ever the
smooth word of friend laying snare for friend;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` what, shall I let all this pass me by, the Lord says; shall I not
take my fill of vengeance against such a nation as this?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Sad dirge be made for the hills, lament for all the wide
pasture-lands, that are scorched bare, and left untravelled; silent the
herdsman’s call; birds that nested there, cattle that grazed there,
fled and gone.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I mean to turn Jerusalem into a heap of dust, the lair of
serpents;✻ the cities of Juda shall stand desolate, with none to
inhabit them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Come now, who is wise enough to read the riddle, to what spokesman
shall the Lord’s proclamation be entrusted, when he tells us why the
land lies ruined, burnt up like the wilderness, and never a passer-by?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is because they forsook the commandment I gave them, the Lord
says, would not heed my call or follow it;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` because they had recourse to ill devices of their own, and to the
gods of the country-side, whose worship their fathers taught them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` This doom, then, the Lord of hosts pronounces, the God of Israel:
On wormwood I will feed this people of mine, gall shall be the drink I
give them;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` far away I will scatter them, in countries never they, never their
fathers knew; and the sword shall follow close behind, to exterminate
them.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This too the Lord of hosts says, the God of Israel: Search all
about, and find mourners, mistresses of their craft, and such as will
answer your summons with all haste;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` no time let them lose in making dole for us; weep every eye, be
every eye-lid blubbered with tears.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Listen to Sion’s lament: Alas, what scathe, alas, what shame! Our
land lies deserted, our homes in ruins!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` To you, women, the Lord’s word comes; this is matter for your
hearing. To daughters of yours, neighbours of yours, teach the sad
melody of yonder lament;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` here is death looking in at our windows, finding its way into our
palaces, and soon there will be no children playing out of doors, nor
grown men passing to and fro in the streets.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` A message from the Lord: Like dung they shall lie on the ground,
the corpses of the dead, like the sheaf left after reaping is done,
that none is at pains to gather.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` This, too, is the Lord’s message: Never boast, if thou art wise, of
thy wisdom, if thou art strong, of thy strength, if thou art rich, of
thy riches;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` boast is none worth having, save that insight which gives knowledge
of me; in all my dealings with mankind so merciful a Lord, the Lord
says, so just, so faithful, and a lover of such dealings where they are
found.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` A time of reckoning there shall be, the Lord says, for all the
nations that practice circumcision,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Egypt, Juda, Edom, Ammon, Moab; ay, and the desert folk that clip
their foreheads bare. The whole world is uncircumcised; all have hearts
uncircumcised, and Israel with the rest.✻
