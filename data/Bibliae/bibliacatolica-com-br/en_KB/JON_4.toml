"1" = ''':sup:`1` As for Jonas, he took it sore amiss, and was an angry man that day.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And thus he made his prayer to the Lord: See if this be not the very
thought I had, far away in my own country! Good cause had I to seek
refuge at Tharsis from such an errand as this. I knew from the first
what manner of God thou art, how kind and merciful, how slow to punish,
how rich in pardon, vengeance ever ready to forgo.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` A boon of thee, Lord! Take away this life of mine; I had rather die
than live.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Why, the Lord said, what anger is this?✻

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Jonas had left the city, and sat now under a little arbour he had
made for himself on the east of it, waiting there in the shade to see
what doom would fall on Nineve.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And now, at the Lord God’s bidding, an ivy-plant grew up over Jonas’
head, to give him shade and shelter after his toiling; and great joy he
had of his ivy-plant.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But when the morrow dawned, came at God’s bidding a worm, that
struck at the plant’s root and killed it.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Up rose the sun, and at the Lord’s bidding the sirocco came; here
was Jonas with the sun’s rays beating on his head, and all of a sweat.
Now indeed his heart’s prayer was, he might die; Better death than
life, said he.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Why, said the Lord, what anger is this over an ivy-plant? Deadly
angry am I, Jonas answered, and no marvel either.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Great pity thou hast, the Lord said, for yonder ivy-plant, that was
not of thy growing, and no toil cost thee; a plant that springs in a
night, and in a night must wither!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And what of Nineve? Here is a great city, with a hundred and twenty
thousand folk in it, and none of them can tell right from left, all
these cattle, too; and may I not spare Nineve?

Notas de rodapé:
4:1-3 - Jonah is furious at God's mercy toward Nineveh. This episode
reveals the human challenge of understanding divine grace, especially
when it extends to those we consider enemies or unworthy (see also
4:4-6 - God causes a plant to grow to provide shade for Jonah, and then
causes it to wither. The lesson is that we must trust in God's wisdom
and providence, who knows what is best for us and teaches us through
4:7-9 - God questions Jonah about his anger toward the dying plant.
This situation illustrates the human tendency to cling to the ephemeral
and to fail to understand God's compassion for the greater good of all
4:10-11 - God explains to Jonah that He has compassion on Nineveh, a
large city with over 120,000 people. This reinforces the idea that
God's mercy extends to everyone, without exception, and that God
Timothy 2:4).
