"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a man once called Elcana, that lived at Ramathaim-Sophim,
in the hill-country of Ephraim; he was an Ephraimite born, descended
from Suph through Jeroham, Eliu and Thohu.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He had two wives, one called Anna, the other Phenenna, and this
Phenenna had borne him sons, whereas Anna was childless.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Never a feast-day would he keep in his own city; he must be at Silo,
worshipping the Lord of hosts, and offering him sacrifice; there dwelt
the Lord’s priests, Ophni and Phinees, the two sons of Heli.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When the time came for Elcana’s sacrifice, Phenenna must have many
portions, for a son here, a daughter there,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and he was sad at heart as he gave Anna her single portion, for Anna
he loved dearly. Why had the Lord denied her motherhood?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And still she must endure bitter persecution from her rival, that
did not scruple to make her childlessness a matter of reproach;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` year after year, when they went up to the Lord’s temple for the
feast, it was ever the same. In tears she sat, with no heart for
eating,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` while her husband Elcana tried to comfort her. Anna, he said, what
need to weep, what need to deny thyself food? What sorrow weighs on thy
heart? Is it not worth the love of ten sons, the love I bear thee?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Once, on such a visit to Silo, when eating and drinking was done,
Anna rose up from her place and went to the temple door, where the
priest Heli was sitting.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Sad at heart, she prayed to the Lord with many tears,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and made a vow: Lord of hosts, if thou wilt take good heed of this
sorrow I bear, if thou wilt keep this handmaid of thine ever in
remembrance, and grant her a son, then he shall be my gift to the Lord
all his life long, a Nazirite unshorn.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Such was the prayer she went on repeating, there in the Lord’s
presence; and Heli saw her lips moving as she did so;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` her lips pronounced the secret petition, but with no sound. Heli
thought her besotted with wine;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Come, he said, wilt thou always be at thy cups? Give thy stomach a
rest from the wine that so bemuses thee.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Nay, my lord, said Anna, thou seest an unhappy woman, unburdening
her heart in the Lord’s presence; there was no wine or strong drink
here.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do not think of thy handmaid as a light woman; only sorrow and
bitter anguish have wrung speech from me all this while.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Go then, answered Heli, and peace go with thee; may the Lord grant
the prayer thou hast made.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` I am thy handmaid, she said; thy favour is all I ask. Then she went
back, and took food, sad-faced no longer;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and next morning, when they had paid their devotions in the Lord’s
presence, they went back home to Ramatha.And the Lord bethought him of
Anna, when next Elcana took her to his bed;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` so, in due time, she conceived and bore him a son. The name she
gave him was Samuel, in token that he was a gift she had won from the
Lord.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When her husband Elcana went to offer the Lord due sacrifice, and
pay his vow, taking all his household with him,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Anna stayed at home. She would not go, she told her husband, until
the boy was weaned; then she would herself bring him into the Lord’s
presence, and leave him there for ever.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Do as thou wilt, Elcana said; wait here till he is weaned, and may
the Lord bring his own will to accomplishment.So she waited at home,
and nursed her child till he was weaned.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And now that he needed her no longer, she took him with her to the
Lord’s house in Silo, still so young. Three bulls, and a bushel of
flour, and a skin of wine, were the offerings she made.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When they brought the boy to Heli, to offer a bull-calf for him,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Anna cried out, Listen, my lord! As thou art a living man, my lord,
this is the same woman that stood here in thy presence, praying so
eagerly!
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And my prayer was for a son, the boy whom thou seest. I prayed to
the Lord, and the Lord granted my request;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and now, in my turn, I make a grant of him to the Lord, a grant
that shall be long as his life. Then they offered the Lord worship, and
Anna made this prayer which follows.
