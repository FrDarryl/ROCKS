"1" = ''':sup:`1` A time came when Dina, Lia’s daughter, went out to visit some of the
women who dwelt in that country.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And one of the chieftains, Sichem, son of Hemor the Hevite, cast
longing eyes at her; then seized her and mated with her, violating her
virginity.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And indeed his heart was set on her, so he comforted her sorrow,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and went to his father Hemor, asking him to demand the girl’s hand
in marriage.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Jacob was told of it, his sons were away, engaged in feeding
their cattle; so he kept silence, awaiting their return.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But even as Hemor, Sichem’s father, was on his way to confer with
Jacob,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Jacob’s sons came back from the plains and heard what had befallen.
They fell into a great rage; Sichem had dishonoured the whole race of
Israel, and done great wrong, by violating their father’s daughter.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And now Hemor began to plead with them, My son Sichem has set his
heart on this maid of yours; grant him her hand in marriage.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It is well that we should intermarry, that you should give us your
daughters, and wed ours,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and settle down amongst us. Our country is yours; you may till and
trade and have your dwelling here.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Sichem, too, said to her father and her brethren, Grant my request,
and I will pay whatever price you name.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Increase the sum of the dowry, ask for presents in addition, you
shall have what you will so you will let me make the girl my wife.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But the sons of Jacob, enraged at their sister’s disgrace, made a
treacherous answer to Sichem and his father:
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` We cannot grant your request, if it means bestowing our sister’s
hand on a husband who is not circumcised; that is a forbidden thing,
abominable to us.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But we can enter into a treaty with you, if you will consent to be
like ourselves, and have every male among you circumcised;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` then we will give our daughters to you in marriage, and accept
yours; we will share your country, and form one people with you.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If you refuse to be circumcised, we must take the girl with us and
be gone.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` This offer of theirs commended itself to Hemor and his son Sichem;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` nor did the young man lose any time in having their request
fulfilled, such was his love for the girl, and such was the influence
he had with all his father’s kindred.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` They both went to the city gate, and there made it known to the
people:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` These are peaceable folk, ready to share our country with us; let
us allow them to trade here and to till the land, wide and open as it
is, and in need of farming; let us marry their daughters, and give them
ours in exchange.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` There is but one thing that stands in the way of this happy
agreement. We must adopt the custom of their race, and have all the
males among us circumcised.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then their wealth and these cattle of theirs and all they have will
be ours too; we have only to humour them in this, to make them form one
people with us.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` To this everyone agreed, and all their men folk were circumcised.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The third day came, which is the day on which the pain of the wound
is most felt. Then, two of Jacob’s sons, who were brothers to Dina,
Simeon and Levi, took up their swords, and made their way boldly into
the city, where they killed all the men folk;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` making an end of Hemor and Sichem with the rest, and carrying off
their sister Dina from Sichem’s house.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When they had left the city, the rest of Jacob’s sons broke in, to
find the men already slain; so they plundered the city to avenge the
wrong done;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` making spoil of their sheep and oxen and asses and all they found
in houses or in fields,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and seizing their children and their wives as captives.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Recklessly the deed was done; in vain did Jacob protest to Simeon
and Levi, You have much injured me, to Chanaanite and Pherezite all
around making my name abominable; see how few we are! If they make
common cause against me, I and mine will perish.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` What, they answered, should we allow him to treat our sister like a
harlot?
