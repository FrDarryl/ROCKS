"1" = ''':sup:`1` Alone she dwells, the city erewhile so populous; a widow now, once a
queen among the nations; tributary now, that once had provinces at her
command.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Be sure she weeps; there in the darkness her cheeks are wet with
tears; of all that courted her, none left to console her, all those
lovers grown weary of her, and turned into enemies.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Cruel the suffering and the bondage of Juda’s exile;✻ that she must
needs dwell among the heathen! Nor respite can she find; close at her
heels the pursuit, and peril on either hand.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Desolate, the streets of Sion; no flocking, now, to the assembly;
the gateways lie deserted. Sighs priest, and the maidens go in
mourning, so bitter the grief that hangs over all.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Exultant, now, her invaders; with her enemies nothing goes amiss.
For her many sins, the Lord has brought doom on her, and all her
children have gone into exile, driven before the oppressor.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Fled is her beauty, the Sion that was once so fair; her chieftains
have yielded their ground before the pursuer, strengthless as rams✻
that can find no pasture.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Heinously Jerusalem sinned; what wonder if she became an outlaw?✻
How they fell to despising her when they saw her shame, that once

Lost to me, all those sons of mine, outmatched by their enemy.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Right the Lord has in his quarrel; I have set his commands at
defiance. O world, take warning; see what pangs I suffer, all my folk
gone into exile, both man and maid.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` So false the friends that were once my suitors! And now the city
lacks priests and elders both, that went begging their bread, to revive
the heart in them.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Take note, Lord, of my anguish, how my bosom burns, and my heart
melts within me, in bitter ruth.✻ And all the while, sword threatens

Notas de rodapé:
1:1-2 - The city of Jerusalem is personified as a widow, mourning its
desolation. The image of a desolate Jerusalem reflects the pain of
exile and the loss of God's presence. This passage highlights the
consequences of sin and the breaking of the covenant with God (see also
1:3-5 - The city suffers the consequences of the destruction wrought by
the Babylonians. Jerusalem's pain is compounded by the lack of comfort
and help. This suffering reveals the severity of God's judgment on
1:6-7 - The loss of festivals and celebrations in Jerusalem is evidence
of the spiritual and social destruction the city has suffered. It
illustrates how sin alienates people from God and robs them of the joys
1:11-15).
1:8-10 - Jerusalem's guilt is acknowledged, and the city is accused of
having sinned against God. This reveals the importance of repentance,
for denial of sin leads to an irreparable separation from God (see also
1:11-12 - The city cries out for help, but realizes that God's judgment
is immutable. This reflects the anguish of being far from God, unsure
