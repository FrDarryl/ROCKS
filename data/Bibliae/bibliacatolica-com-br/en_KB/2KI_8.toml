"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now turn we to the mother of that boy whom Eliseus raised to life.
Eliseus had said to her, Up, go on thy travels, thou and all thy
household with thee, and there dwell where dwell thou canst; the Lord
has a drought in store for us, which will fall upon this land for seven
years together.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` She lost no time in carrying out the prophet’s command, went abroad
with all her household, and for a long time dwelt in the Philistine
country;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` then, when the seven years were over, she came back from the
Philistine country, and sought an audience with the king, to reclaim
her house and lands.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The king, at that very time, was in talk with Giezi, the prophet’s
servant, and had bidden him tell the story of all Eliseus’ marvellous
deeds;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and Giezi was even then describing how the dead boy had been raised
to life, when in came the boy’s own mother, appealing to the king to
restore her house and lands. My lord king, said Giezi, this is the very
woman, and this is that son of hers, whom Eliseus restored to life.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So the king, when he had questioned the woman and had the story from
her, charged one of his own chamberlains to see that she came into her
own, and recovered the revenues the lands had brought in ever since she
left the country.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Eliseus was on a visit to Damascus when Benadad, king of Syria, fell
sick. And when he heard that the servant of God was there,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` the king bade Hazael take gifts with him and go to meet the prophet;
Bid him enquire of the Lord, he said, whether I shall recover from this
sickness of mine or not.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So Hazael went to meet him, and gifts went too, all the best
Damascus had to offer, forty camels’ burden of them. And when he had
made his way to Eliseus’ presence, and told how Benadad king of Syria
had sent to know whether he would recover from his sickness,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Eliseus said, Go and assure him of health restored; but for all
that, the Lord has revealed to me that he is doomed to die.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Hazael, as he stood there talking to him, was in great confusion,
so that his face blushed red; but the servant of God fell a-weeping.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Why weeps my lord? asked Hazael; and his answer was, I weep for all
the calamity I know thou art to bring on the sons of Israel. Their
cities thou wilt burn down, their young men thou wilt slay in battle;
dash little children to the ground, and rip open the pregnant womb.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nay, said Hazael, not for a low-born wretch like thy servant here
such great exploits as these! Thou art to be king of Syria, Eliseus
answered; the Lord has revealed it to me.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So he parted from Eliseus and went back to his master. What said
Eliseus? asked he, and Hazael gave him the message that he should
recover his health;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but next day he took a piece of cloth, soaked it in water, and held
it over Benadad’s face till he was stifled; and thus he succeeded to
the throne.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` It was in the fifth year of Joram, Achab’s son, king of Israel (and
Josaphat, king of Juda), that Josaphat’s son Joram became king of
Juda;✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` he was thirty-two years old when he came to the throne, and his
reign at Jerusalem lasted eight years.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he followed the example of the Israelite kings, just as Achab’s
line did; he himself had married a daughter of Achab’s. So he defied
the Lord’s will;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` but the Lord would not bring ruin upon Juda; had he not promised
his servant David to keep the lamp of his line unquenched for ever?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` It was in Joram’s days that the Edomites renounced their allegiance
to Juda and set up a king of their own choice.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Joram indeed attacked Seira with his whole force of chariots, and
when the Edomites surrounded him, he broke through them with a night
assault, broke through the commanders of the chariots and drove the
foot-soldiers back to their tents;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` but Edom has never been subject to Juda from that day to this.
Lobna, too, revolted at the same time.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` What else Joram did, all his history, is to be found in the Annals
of the kings of Juda.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So he was laid to rest with his fathers, and shared their
burying-place in the Keep of David; and the throne passed to his son
Ochozias.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` This Ochozias, son of king Joram of Juda, came to the throne in the
twelfth year of Achab’s son Joram, king of Israel;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` he was twenty-two years old when he came to the throne, and he
reigned at Jerusalem but one year; his mother was Athalia, descended
from Amri, king of Israel.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` He, too, followed the example of Achab’s line, and defied the
Lord’s will; to Achab’s house he was close allied.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And with Joram, Achab’s son, he went to fight against Hazael, king
of Syria, at Ramoth-Galaad. Joram was wounded in this engagement with
the Syrians,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and went back to Jezrahel to recover his health. And when Joram,
Achab’s son, lay sick at Jezrahel, recovering from the wound he had
received in fighting against Hazael at Ramoth-Galaad, Ochozias son of
Joram king of Juda came there to visit him.
