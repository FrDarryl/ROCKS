"1" = ''':sup:`1` Come down, sit in the dust, poor maid of Babylon; the ground thy
seat shall be; no throne any longer for that queen of the Chaldean folk
we knew once, so dainty, so delicate.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Get thee to the millstones and grind there, ready to expose thy
nakedness; off with thy veil, here are streams to be crossed bare of
leg.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Thou shalt be exposed to shame, thy naked form uncovered; I mean to
take vengeance on thee, and no man shall stay my hand.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` (But we have one to ransom us; who but the Lord of hosts, the Holy
One of Israel?✻ )
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Sit dumb, bury thyself in darkness, lady of Chaldea; thou shalt rule
the nations no longer.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Angry with my people, turned enemy against the land of my choice, I
gave them into thy power; and thou, what mercy didst thou shew them?
Heavy the yoke thou didst lay on aged shoulders.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thou wouldst surely be a queen for ever; thou didst it
light-heartedly, not recking what the end should be.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And now, here is a word for those delicate ears, lady of the
careless heart, who sittest there telling thyself, I am Babylon, the
unrivalled; no lonely widowhood, no childless lot for me.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` These two things shall fall on thee suddenly in a single day,
childlessness and widowhood; fall upon thee in full measure, so blind
amid all thy sorceries, through the crass folly of thy wizards so
blind.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Such was thy trust in these wicked arts of thine, thou hadst no
fear of discovery; thy very wisdom, thy very knowledge were a snare; I
am Babylon, thy heart told thee, rival I have none.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And now comes ruin unforeseen, comes doom no sacrifice can avert;
sudden and strange thy encounter with sorrow.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` All that multitude of wizards, and wilt thou not persevere with thy
enchantments, the hard-earned lore of thy youth? Maybe it will turn to
thy advantage; thou shalt be formidable yet!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But no, thou art wearied of those many consultations. Let them come
to thy side now and save thee if they can, diviners that gaze up at the
stars, count days of the month, to tell thy future for thee!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Like stubble burn they one and all; their own lives they cannot
rescue from the flame. Here is no brazier to warm them, no ingle-nook
to sit by!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And this is the end of all thy long study; trusted counsellors of
thy youth, all have gone astray in their reckoning; deliverance for
thee is none.
