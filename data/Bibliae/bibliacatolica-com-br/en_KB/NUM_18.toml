[18]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` This was the Lord’s word to Aaron: For what is done in the
sanctuary, for the duties of your priesthood,✻ none but thou and thy
sons with thee shall be answerable;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but all the sons of Levi are thy brethren, and these, all that come
of thy father’s tribe, thou mayest call in to relieve thee by their
ministry, while thou and thy sons minister in the tabernacle that bears
record of me.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The Levites shall wait on thy bidding, as the service of the
tabernacle requires it, yet never, at their peril and yours, having
access to the things of the sanctuary, or to the altar.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They shall be content to relieve you by waiting on the needs of the
tabernacle and its worship, in which no other tribe may take part.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` It is for you, if you would not have my displeasure fall on Israel,
to guard the sanctuary and serve the altar’s needs.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` If I have separated your fellow-Levites from the rest of the people,
and dedicated them as a gift to myself, I have designated them only for
the menial offices of my tabernacle;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` the priesthood is for thee and for thy sons. All the ceremonies of
the altar, all that is hidden within the veil, belongs to the priests’
charge; it is death for any other to take part.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This, too, the Lord said to Aaron: Hereby I put the offerings made
to me at thy disposal; all that the sons of Israel dedicate to me, I
pass on to thee and to thy sons, a portion assigned to the priesthood
by right inalienable.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` All that is set apart, when offerings are made to the Lord, is my
gift to thee; whatever is offered by way of bloodless sacrifice, or to
atone for some fault or wrong done, and vowed to holy uses, belongs to
thee and thine.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It must be eaten on holy ground, and only by men, this consecrated
gift I make thee.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The first-fruits which the Israelites dedicate to me, and hold up
in my presence, belong at all times to thee and to thy sons and to thy
daughters as well; all that are clean of defilement in thy household
may partake of them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Do they bring me the best of their oil, their wine, their corn, or
any other kind of first-fruits? It is thine;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` no early fruits of the ground that are brought to the Lord but
shall go to thy use; none of thy household that is clean of defilement
but may partake.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` All that the Israelites give in payment of their vows, is thine.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thine, too, is every living thing that handsels the womb, and so
must be offered to the Lord, be it man or beast; for the first-born of
men, and for the first-born of unclean beasts, thou wilt take a ransom
instead.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` (The ransom-price, to be paid after one month, is five silver
pieces, by sanctuary reckoning; one silver piece is worth twenty
pence).✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But there is no ransoming the first-born of ox or sheep or goat;
they are set apart for the Lord. Their blood is to be shed upon the
altar, and their fat burned, to please the Lord with the smell of its
burning;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` but the flesh-meat shall go to thy use; like the breast and the
right shoulder, it is thy due.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` All the sanctuary dues which the sons of Israel offer I give to
thee and to thy sons and daughters by a perpetual deed of gift; it is a
covenant between the Lord and thy race that time cannot alter.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` This, too, the Lord said to Aaron: You are to hold no lands, no
portion is to be assigned to you, among your fellow-Israelites. I am
all thy portion; these others have their several possessions, thou hast
me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And in return for the service they do me in the tabernacle that
bears record of my covenant, I have allotted to the sons of Levi the
enjoyment of all the tithe Israel pays.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Never henceforward, upon pain of death, must other Israelites come
near my sanctuary;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` it is for the Levites only to do the work of the tabernacle, and
make themselves answerable for all the people does amiss; and it shall
be a law unalterable, age after age, that they possess nothing else,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but live content with the tithe which I have set apart for their
use, to defray all their needs.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And the Lord bade Moses
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` give this charge to the Levites: When the sons of Israel pay the
tithe I have assigned to you, you must offer to the Lord the
first-fruits of them, the tenth part of your tithe,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` as if you were paying dues from threshing-floor and wine-press of
your own;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` you too must offer the Lord first-fruits of all that comes to you,
making them over to the high priest Aaron.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And the part of your tithe which you set aside as an offering to
the Lord must be the best part, the choice part.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When you have offered all that is best and richest, you will have
paid your dues, as surely as if they came from threshing-floor and
wine-press of your own;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` then you may enjoy the rest of the tithe, and your households with
you; it is the reward of all your tabernacle service.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` You must not incur guilt by keeping the best and the richest for
yourselves;✻ for such misuse of the offerings which the sons of Israel
make, death is the penalty.

Notas de rodapé:
18:1-7 - God reaffirms the role of the priests and Levites in the
service of the tabernacle and their responsibility for any
transgression. This underscores the importance of purity in serving God
18:8-14 - The priests receive a portion of the holy offerings as an
inheritance. This establishes that the priests' sustenance will come
18:15-19 - The firstborn of animals and the redemption of the firstborn
of men are given to the priests. This practice reflects the sanctity of
the firstfruits and the consecration of all firstborn to God (see also
18:20-24 - God declares that the Levites will have no inheritance in
the land, but that He Himself will be their inheritance. This
reinforces the separation of the priesthood as a service dedicated
18:25-32 - The Levites, in turn, must offer a tithe of their tithes to
the Lord. This shows that even those who serve God directly must
participate in offering and dedicating themselves to the Lord (see also
