he not spoken to us too? Such were the complaints the Lord must needs
listen to.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` As for Moses, whom they attacked, never was a man more patient on

"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the Lord at once commanded him, and Aaron, and Mary to come out

him. So they went apart;

Prophets there may be among your race; to one I appear in a vision, to

Notas de rodapé:
12:1-2 - Miriam and Aaron criticize Moses because of his Cushite wife
and question his authority. This reflects the human tendency toward
jealousy and power struggles, even among those called by God (see also
12:3 - The description of Moses as the humblest man on earth
underscores the importance of humility in spiritual leadership. Moses
serves as an example of total dependence on God despite criticism (see
12:5-8 - God defends Moses, affirming his uniqueness as a prophet to
whom He speaks directly. This highlights Moses' distinctiveness and the
seriousness of questioning established divine authority (see also
12:9-10 - Miriam is struck with leprosy as punishment for her
rebellion. This shows that God takes disloyalty and defiance of His
authority seriously, but He also provides an opportunity for repentance
(see also 2 Kings 5:27 and Deuteronomy 28:27).
12:13-15 - Moses intercedes for Miriam, and God heals her after seven
days outside the camp. This demonstrates the power of intercession and
Moses' compassionate heart, and it also underscores the value of
1:9).
