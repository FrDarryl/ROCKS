think to build a house for me to dwell in?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` House was never mine, since I rescued the sons of Israel from Egypt;
still in a tabernacle, a wanderer’s home, I came and went.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` This way and that the whole race of Israel journeyed, and I with
them; now to this tribe, now to that, I gave the leadership of the

godless neighbours,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` as they have been ever since I first gave Israel judges to rule

prolong for ever his royal dynasty;

"14" = ''':sup:`14` he shall find in me a father, and I in him a son. If he plays me
false, be sure I will punish him; ever for man the rod, ever for Adam’s

"23" = ''':sup:`23` Can any other nation say, like thy people Israel, that its God came
to buy it back for himself as his own people, winning such renown for
himself, doing such deeds of wonder and dread against any country, and
its people, and its god, as thou didst when thou didst buy back thy
people from Egypt?✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So didst thou pledge this people of Israel to be thy people
eternally, and thou, Lord God, didst become their God.
