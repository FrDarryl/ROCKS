"1" = ''':sup:`1` The purpose for which any high priest is chosen from among his
fellow men, and made a representative of men in their dealings with
God, is to offer gifts and sacrifices in expiation of their sins.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He is qualified for this by being able to feel for them when they
are ignorant and make mistakes, since he, too, is all beset with
humiliations,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and, for that reason, must needs present sin-offerings for himself,
just as he does for the people.✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` His vocation comes from God, as Aaron’s did; nobody can take on
himself such a privilege as this.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So it is with Christ. He did not raise himself to the dignity of the
high priesthood; it was God that raised him to it, when he said, Thou
art my Son, I have begotten thee this day,✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and so, elsewhere, Thou art a priest for ever, in the line of
Melchisedech.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Christ, during his earthly life, offered prayer and entreaty to the
God who could save him from death, not without a piercing cry, not
without tears; yet with such piety as won him a hearing.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Son of God though he was, he learned obedience in the school of
suffering,✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and now, his full achievement reached, he wins eternal salvation for
all those who render obedience to him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` A high priest in the line of Melchisedech, so God has called him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Of Christ as priest we have much to say, and it is hard to make
ourselves understood in the saying of it, now that you have grown so
dull of hearing.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` You should, after all this time, have been teachers yourselves, and
instead of that you need to be taught; taught even the first principles
on which the oracles of God are based. You have gone back to needing
milk, instead of solid food.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Those who have milk for their diet can give no account of what
holiness means; how should they? They are only infants.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Solid food is for the full-grown; for those whose faculties are so
trained by exercise that they can distinguish between good and evil.

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-4 - The author describes the role of the high priest, who is chosen
from among men to intercede for them before God. This is a reflection
Timothy 2:5).
5:5-6 - Jesus is presented as the eternal High Priest after the order
of Melchizedek, highlighting His divine authority and mediatorial role
5:7-10 - The suffering of Jesus, who learned obedience through what he
suffered, is a lesson in humility and dependence on God. He is perfect
5:11-14 - The author rebukes Christians for their lack of spiritual
maturity, comparing them to children who still need simple food. Growth
