"1" = ''':sup:`1` Meanwhile, God aiding, Machabaeus and his followers had recovered
both temple and city.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Down came the altars Gentile folk had set up in the open streets,
down came the shrines,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and the temple was purged of its defilement. They made a fresh
altar, struck fire from flint, and offered sacrifice again after two
years’ intermission; rose incense, burned lamp, loaves were set out on
the sacred table once more.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then, bowing down to earth, they made petition to the Lord, never
again such calamity might overtake them; sin if they did, himself in
his great mercy should chastise them, not hand them over into the cruel
power of blasphemous enemies.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` It so fell out, that the temple was purified on the twenty-fifth day
of Casleu, the very time of its profanation by the Gentiles.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Eight days of rejoicing they kept, with such ceremonies as belong to
the feast of Tent-dwelling; it was a feast of tent-dwelling indeed they
had kept a while back, when they lodged like beasts among the hill-side
caverns!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now that God had made the way clear for his temple’s cleansing, what
wonder if they set up in his honour branches, and green boughs, and
arbours of palm?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` What wonder if a decree was passed, by common consent, all Jewry
should keep the festival year by year?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Now the story is told, how Antiochus called the Illustrious came by
his end,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` turn we to his son, Antiochus Eupator, that was born of a very ill
father;✻ record we in brief the history of his reign, and the hazards
of war that went with it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Upon his accession, this king entrusted all the business of the
realm to one Lysias, commander of the forces in Phoenice and
Coelesyria.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` With Ptolemy, that was called Macer, we are concerned no more; fain
would he have made amends to the Jews for the wrong done them, and kept
their friendship,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` but for that very reason he was denounced to Eupator by his
courtiers. He was a traitor, they said, twice over, false to his trust,
when Philometor left him in charge of Cyprus, and now weary of his new
allegiance to Antiochus the Illustrious! Whereupon he put an end to his
own life by poison.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Gorgias was given command of the district, he was for ever
making war on the Jews, with mercenaries to aid him;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and there were natives of the country besides,✻ well entrenched in
their strongholds, that gave welcome to deserters from Jerusalem, and
so fanned the flames of enmity.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And now the followers of Machabaeus, after prayer made for the
divine assistance, delivered an attack upon the Edomite strongholds.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` These, by a very courageous assault, they occupied, and cut down
all they met, putting not less than twenty thousand men to the sword;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` but there were two fortresses yet remaining, into which the
survivors threw themselves, well provided with means of defence.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Machabaeus himself went off to fight other battles of greater
moment, leaving Simon, Joseph and Zacchaeus, with a strong force under
their command, to carry on the siege.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And here the avarice of Simon’s men was their undoing; for a bribe
of seventy thousand silver pieces, they allowed some of the defenders
to escape.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Machabaeus no sooner heard of it, than he summoned the leaders of
the people, and arraigned the guilty men in their presence; what, would
they sell their brethren’s lives, by letting the enemies of their race
go free?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So he put these traitors to death; and for the strongholds, he
conquered both of them at a blow,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` so carrying all before him by force of arms, that more than twenty
thousand of the defenders perished.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But Timotheus could not be content with one defeat at the hands of
the Jews; he would bring in hordes of foreign soldiery, and cavalry
from Asia, threatening Judaea with slavery.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` At his coming, the party of Machabaeus fell to prayer; earth on
their heads, sackcloth about their loins,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` they lay prostrate at the altar’s foot, entreating the Lord he
would espouse their quarrel, and their foes should be his; the law had
promised it.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then, this supplication made, they took up arms and marched out,
leaving the city far away in their rear, nor ever halted till they were
close to the enemy’s lines.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Soon as the dawn broke, they engaged; on the one side, all trust in
the Lord, valour’s best pledge of victory and fairer times; on the
other, naught but human eagerness to inspire courage.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Hard went the day, and, so it seemed to the enemy, heaven itself
took part. Five horsemen came riding, with splendid trappings of gold,
to lead the Jews onward;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and two of these served Machabaeus for escort, covering him with
their shields to keep all hurt away from him. With shaft of theirs,
lightning of theirs, dazzled and dismayed, the enemy fell to earth;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` twenty thousand and five hundred of them perished that day, besides
six hundred of the cavalry.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` As for Timotheus, he took refuge in Gazara, a strong fortress that
was under the command of Chaereas.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Four days together, Machabaeus and his men eagerly pressed on the
siege of it;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` but the defenders were confident in its strength; loud their
defiance was, and very blasphemous the words they uttered.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Stung by these taunts, twenty warriors of Machabaeus’ company made
a bold attack on the wall as the fifth day was dawning, and, by the
fierceness of their onslaught, made shift to climb it;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` others, following at their heels, fell to burning tower and gateway
alike, and made a bonfire of the blasphemers.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For two whole days they ransacked the fort, and at last came upon
Timotheus✻ in his hiding-place; so they made an end of him, his brother
Chaereas and Apollophanes perishing with him.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` When all was over, they sang hymns of praise and gave thanks to the
Lord, that had done marvellous things for Israel, and granted them
victory.
