"1" = ''':sup:`1` The word of the Lord came to Jeremias at the time when king
Nabuchodonosor of Babylon, at the head of his own army, with vassal
kingdoms and peoples to aid him, levied war on Jerusalem and its
daughter cities.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This was the message sent by the Lord God of Israel: Go and warn
Sedecias, king of Juda, in my name that I mean to hand over this city
to the Babylonian king, who will burn it to the ground.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And add this besides: Thou thyself wilt not escape from him; they
will catch thee, sure enough, and hand thee over to him; thou and the
king of Babylon shall have speech together, meet face to face, and to
Babylon thou shalt go.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Wouldst thou but listen, King Sedecias of Juda, to the Lord’s
bidding!✻ Die by the sword, he tells thee, thou shouldst not;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` peaceful thy death should be, and they should make such burning for
thee as they made for thy fathers that reigned before thee, raise such
cries of lamentation, Alas, what a king was this! This is my promise to
thee, the Lord says.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` All this king Sedecias of Juda must hear from the prophet Jeremias,
there in Jerusalem;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and still the Babylonian army pressed hard on the city, and on those
other cities of Juda that were left, Lachis and Azecha; the rest of the
fortified cities had already been taken.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Here is another message the Lord entrusted to Jeremias, and this was
the occasion of it. King Sedecias had bound the citizens of Jerusalem
by a covenant;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` all alike were to set free their slaves and handmaids that were of
Hebrew blood; would they play the master to their own Jewish kinsfolk?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` On hearing the proclamation, nobles and common people alike had
agreed to release slave and handmaid, and exempt them from all service
henceforward; and this they did obediently enough;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but afterwards they changed their minds, haled them off, men and
women, and reduced them to slavery once again.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then it was word came from the Lord to Jeremias, and thus the
divine message ran:
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Word from the Lord God of Israel! I made a covenant with your
fathers, when I rescued them from their place of bondage in Egypt.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Seven years up, every slave sold in bondage to his fellow Hebrew
must go free; six years of service, and then release. Your fathers
would not listen, turned a deaf ear to me;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but you, to-day, have thought better of it, and done my will,
proclaiming liberty to your fellow-countrymen; you have sworn it in my
presence, in the house that is the shrine of my name.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And then you went back, and dragged my name in the dust! You would
claim them afresh, men and women servants you had set free, now their
own masters; they must be your servants and handmaids still.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This sentence, then, the Lord pronounces: You have not obeyed me,
by granting freedom to your own brethren and neighbours, and here is
the freedom I mean to grant you in return; freedom of the sword,
freedom of the famine, freedom of the pestilence! A bane I will make
you to all the kingdoms of earth.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` I will have no more of them, the men who transgress my covenant,
have no respect for the agreement they made in my own presence, the
calf they cut in two and walked between the slices of it,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` nobles of Juda and Jerusalem, chamberlains and priests, and all the
common folk that passed between share and share.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I mean to give them up into the hands of enemies that are sworn
upon their lives; bird in air and beast on earth shall prey upon that
carrion of theirs.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Sedecias, king of Juda, and his nobles, shall fall into the hands
of pitiless enemies, the armies of Babylon, that now give you a
respite.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` These, at my command, shall march on this city again, lay siege to
it, and capture it, and burn it to the ground; and I will make the
townships of Juda into a desert, never a soul to dwell there.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
34:1-7 - The siege of Jerusalem is imminent, and God warns King
Zedekiah of the city's fall. The message is a call to repentance, but
34:8-11 - The covenant of liberation for the slaves is violated,
demonstrating Israel's unfaithfulness to upholding justice.
Disobedience to God and lack of compassion for others result in severe
34:12-22 - God rebukes the people for failing to fulfill the covenant
to free the slaves, resulting in judgment. Breaking covenants with God
brings painful consequences, highlighting the importance of being
