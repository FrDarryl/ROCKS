"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now Samuel took out his phial of oil, and poured it out over
Saul’s head; then he kissed him, and said, Hereby the Lord anoints thee
to be the leader of his chosen people; thine it shall be to deliver
them from the enemies that hedge them round. Wouldst thou have proof
that this unction comes from the Lord? Listen, then;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When thou leavest me to-day, and hast gone southward as far as
Rachel’s tomb, on the frontiers of Benjamin, thou wilt meet two men
bringing thee news that the lost asses thou art looking for have been
found; that thy father has forgotten them in his anxiety, and only asks
how he is to find his son.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then, passing further on thy way, thou wilt reach the oak of Thabor,
and fall in with three men on pilgrimage to Bethel; one with three
goats, one with three loaves of bread, one with a flagon of wine;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` from these thou wilt have greeting, and two of their loaves for a
gift.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So at last thou wilt come to the Hill of God, where the Philistines
have set a garrison; and here, upon entering the city, thou wilt meet a
company of prophets coming down from the sacred height.✻ With harp and
tambour, flute and zither at their head, they will be uttering words of
prophecy;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and with that the spirit of the Lord will fall upon thee, making
thee prophesy with the rest, and turning thee into a new man.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When all these signs have been granted, go about the work that lies
before thee; the Lord is at thy side.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` At need, betake thyself to Galgal, where I will come to meet thee,
to present there thy burnt-sacrifice and thy welcome-offering; wait for
me seven days, till I come and give thee thy orders.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So parted Saul from Samuel, and as he went on his way, the Lord gave
him a new heart. All the signs he looked for were fulfilled that day,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and when at last he came to the Hill, there was a company of
prophets on its way towards him; whereupon the spirit of the Lord fell
on him, and he prophesied with the rest.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` None that had known him hitherto but marvelled, upon seeing him
prophesy in the company of the others, what had befallen the son of
Cis; Is Saul, too, they asked, among the prophets?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Why, said one to another, who can tell the parentage of any of
them?✻ (This was how the saying grew up, Is Saul, too, among the
prophets?)
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` His trance over, Saul went on, back to the hill-country.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` There was an uncle of his, that asked where they had been, and was
not content with their story of consulting Samuel about the strayed
asses.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Tell me, said he, what message did the prophet give thee?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Why, answered Saul, he told me the asses were found. But of the
kingship promised him he said no word.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And now Samuel bade the whole people gather in the divine presence
at Maspha,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and this message he gave them from the Lord God of Israel: It was I
that rescued you from Egypt, I that protected you from the clutches of
these and of all your oppressors.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And now you have cast away your God, your only shield against so
many misfortunes and afflictions; A king, you say, appoint a king to
reign over us! Come then, present yourselves before the Lord, tribe by
tribe, clan by clan.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Samuel brought forward all the tribes of Israel by name, and
the lot fell on Benjamin;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` brought forward all the families of Benjamin by name, and the lot
fell on Matri’s; and in the end he reached Saul, the son of Cis. When
they looked for him, he was nowhere to be found; was he on his way to
Maspha?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` They asked the Lord, and the answer came that Saul was there,
hiding in his tent.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Whereupon they ran to fetch him, and before long he stood in their
midst, a head and shoulders taller than any of them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The Lord’s chosen! cried Samuel. Look at him, and see if he has his
like in Israel! And all the people shouted, Long live the king!
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And now Samuel proclaimed to the people what the king’s rights
were; wrote it down, too, in a book, which he laid up in the Lord’s
presence; then he bade them disperse to their homes.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Saul went back to Gabaa, and with him went some of the fighting
men, whom God so inspired.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` There were others, graceless folk, who asked contemptuously whether
such a man as this could bring them victory; and no gift would they
offer him. But Saul made as if he could not hear their mutterings.

prophesy. This change confirms Saul's divine calling to lead Israel,

appearance impresses everyone. This marks the formal beginning of his
leadership, though some still question his ability (see also
