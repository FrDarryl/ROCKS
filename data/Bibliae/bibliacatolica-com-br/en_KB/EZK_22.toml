thou not arraign them?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Confront them with their foul misdeeds, and give them this message
from the Lord God: Here is a city that hastens her own end with open
bloodshed, soils herself with idols to her own undoing.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Blood-spilth and idol-filth have brought thy time nearer, shortened
thy years; what marvel if I let the heathen reproach thee, a whole
world mock thee?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` What marvel if men exult over thee, far and near, great only in thy
misfortune, as thou art renowned only for thy shame?

"6" = ''':sup:`6` No better title now to Israel’s nobility, than to fill those streets
with blood!

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Home of wrong, where father and mother are despised, the stranger
oppressed, widow and orphan ill-used!

"8" = ''':sup:`8` My sanctuary, how it is despised, my sabbath how profaned!

deeds done besides;

beds incestuously with his son’s wife, brother mates with sister sprung
of the same blood!

"12" = ''':sup:`12` The murderer’s hire, usury and extortion, gains won by violence;
and of me, the Lord God says, never a thought!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Well may I smite hands together, indignant at thy ill-gotten gains,
thy murderous doings;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` will thy courage be so high, thy arm so powerful, when it is I that
reckon with thee? What the Lord threatens, the Lord fulfils.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Far will I banish thee, widely scatter thee, and bring the tale of
thy shame to an end;

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Son of man, where the race of Israel shews in the heart of the
furnace, nothing I find but dross; all is copper, and tin, and iron,
and lead; dross of silver where silver should be.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This warning, then, the Lord God has for them: I mean to shut you
up in Jerusalem, dross as you are;

"20" = ''':sup:`20` this shall be your furnace, silver and copper and tin and iron and
lead, all together; and I will light a fire to smelt you. There my
angry vengeance shall imprison you, and I will give you respite for a

vengeance falls on it, rain it shall have none.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` What of the prophets?✻ A sworn conspiracy; lions roaring for their
prey, the lives of men; wealth and treasure they must have; there be
widows everywhere.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` What of the priests? Priests, that despise my law, violate my
sanctuary, cannot tell sacred from profane, count all one, clean or
unclean; priests, that leave my own sabbath unregarded; am I not
defiled by their company?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` What of the nobles? Ravening wolves, all blood and murder, greedy
for gain;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and here are the prophets with their untempered mortar, their vain
dreams and false auguries, crying a message from the Lord when message
from the Lord they have none.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Great wrong the citizens themselves do, robbing where they will,
harrying the helpless poor, oppressing the stranger and denying him
redress.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Who would close the breach, intercede with me to spare the land
from ruin? Never a man was found!
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` What wonder if I have poured out my vengeance, burnt them up in my
anger? It was but their deserts I gave them, says the Lord God.
