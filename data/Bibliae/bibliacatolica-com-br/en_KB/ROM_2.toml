"1" = ''':sup:`1` So, friend, if thou canst see thy neighbour’s faults, no excuse is
left thee, whoever thou art; in blaming him, thou dost own thyself
guilty, since thou, for all thy blame, livest the same life as he.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` We know that God passes unerring judgement upon such lives;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and dost thou, friend, think to escape God’s judgement, thou who
dost blame men for living thus, and art guilty of the same acts
thyself?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Or is it that thou art presuming on that abundant kindness of his,
which bears with thee and waits for thee? Dost thou not know that God’s
kindness is inviting thee to repent?

has practised wickedness, the Jew in the first instance, but the
Gentile too;

good, the Jew in the first instance, but the Gentile too.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` There are no human preferences with God.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Those who have been sinners without regard to the law will be
doomed without regard to the law; those who have been sinners with the
law for their rule will be judged with the law for their rule.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` To have heard the law read out is no claim to acceptance with God;
it is those who obey the law that will be justified.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` As for the Gentiles, though they have no law to guide them, there
are times when they carry out the precepts of the law unbidden, finding
in their own natures a rule to guide them, in default of any other
rule;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and this shews that the obligations of the law are written in their
hearts; their conscience utters its own testimony, and when they
dispute with one another they find themselves condemning this,
approving that.✻

will pass judgement, through Jesus Christ, on the hidden thoughts of
men.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thou claimest Jewish blood; thou reliest on the law; God is all thy
boast;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` thou canst tell what is his will, discern what things are of

'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Thou hast confidence in thyself as one who leads the blind, a light
to their darkness;

thou hast the incarnation of all knowledge and all truth.

thyself? Is it a thief that preaches against stealing,

"22" = ''':sup:`22` an adulterer that forbids adultery? Dost thou rob temples, thou,
who shrinkest from the touch of an idol?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thy boast is in the law; wilt thou break the law, to God’s
dishonour?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The name of God, says the scripture, has become a reproach among
the Gentiles, because of you.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Circumcision, to be sure, is of value, so long as thou keepest the
law; but if thou breakest the law, thy circumcision has lost its
effect.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And if one who has never been circumcised observes the conditions
