"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now, Israel, pay good heed to the laws and the decrees I am
making known to you. It is yours to observe them, if you would have
life; if you would find your way into the land promised you by the Lord
God of your fathers, and take possession of it.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There must be no adding to this message of mine, no retrenching it;
the commands I lay upon you are the commands of the Lord your God; keep
them well.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Your own eyes have witnessed what sentence the Lord passed against
Beelphegor, purging out from among you all that worshipped at his
shrine,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` while you, who remain faithful to the Lord, have lived to remember
it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Be well assured that the laws and decrees I have given you come from
the Lord himself, and must still be observed when you have taken
possession of the land that is to be yours.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Keep them in honour and live by them; these are to be the arts, this
the wisdom, that you teach the world, as men come to hear of these
laws, and say to themselves, Surely they must be wise, surely they must
be discerning folk, that belong to so great a nation as this!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And indeed no other nation is so great; no other nation has gods
that draw near to it, as our God draws near to us whenever we pray to
him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` What other nation can boast that it has observances and decrees so
rightly ordered as we have in this law of ours, this law which I am
setting before your eyes to-day?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Keep anxious guard, then, Israel, as thou lovest thy own life. Never
let the memory of what thy own eyes have seen fade from thy heart, as
long as thou livest; hand it on to thy sons, and thy sons’ sons,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the memory of that day when thou didst stand in the Lord’s presence
at mount Horeb. Summon the whole people, the Lord said to me, so that
they may hear these words of mine, and learn, and teach their children
after them, to fear me all their life long.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And you, as you came close to the spurs of the mountain, found it
sending up flames high as heaven, all wreathed in darkness and cloud
and mist.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` From the heart of those flames the Lord spoke to you, so that you
could hear his voice, but had no vision of his form.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He told you of his covenant, that you were to keep; uttered ten
warnings, which he wrote down on two stone tablets;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` bade me, at that same time, hand on to you the observances and
decrees you were to follow in the land that should one day be your
home.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Be watchful, then, at the peril of your lives. When the Lord spoke
to you from the heart of the flame on mount Horeb, there was no outward
shape you saw.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And will you be deluded into carving some outward image or
likeness, of man or woman,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` of beasts that roam on the earth or birds that fly in the air,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` of creeping things on land or fish that dwell in the waters, down
at the roots of earth?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Wilt thou be led astray as thou lookest up at the sky, at sun and
moon and all the host of stars, into making gods of them, worshipping
those creatures which the Lord thy God has made, to be the common
drudges of every nation under heaven?✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Why else did the Lord choose you out, deliver you from Egypt’s
furnace of iron, but to make you a people all his own, as you are this
day?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` What though I, through your fault, have incurred the Lord’s anger,
so that he has sworn never to let me cross Jordan, and see the fair
land he means to give you?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` What though I must die here, still on Jordan’s further bank? You
will cross over it; that fair land will be yours.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Never forget, then, the covenant the Lord thy God has made with
thee; never fashion thyself those images the Lord has forbidden thee to
fashion;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` the Lord thy God is a fire that burns all before it, loves thee
with a jealous love.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Sons will spring from you, and beget sons in their turn; what if
you should go astray, when you have been long settled in the land,
fashion yourselves some idol, and rouse the Lord your God to
indignation at the sight of your evil-doing?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` I call heaven and earth to witness this day; the land which now
lies within your grasp, beyond Jordan, will soon be yours no longer.
Your enjoyment of it will be cut short, and the Lord will make an end
of you,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` scattering you over the world and leaving but a few of you to live
in a land of exile,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` where you must needs worship the gods which men’s hands have made,
things of wood and stone that cannot see or hear, cannot taste or
smell.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` There, if thou wilt have recourse to the Lord thy God, if thou wilt
but have recourse to him with all thy heart, in the bitterness of thy
tribulation, thou wilt find him again.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Yes, when all these threats have come home to thee, thou wilt turn
back to the Lord thy God at last, and listen to his voice.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The Lord thy God is a God of mercy; he will not forsake thee, will
not utterly destroy thee, and will not forget the sworn covenant he
made with thy fathers.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Search the history of the days that went before thee, far back as
the time when God made man on the earth, wide as earth’s end from
earth’s end; is there any other record of such happenings?
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the
heart of the flames, as thou didst, and live to tell of it?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` That God should intervene, and single out for himself one nation
above all the rest; that he should try men’s hearts with portent and
with marvel, fight against them with constraining force, with open
display of his strength, with plagues terrible to see? All this the
Lord your God did for you in Egypt, and your own eyes have witnessed
it;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` proof to you that this Lord is God, that no other can compare with
him.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` From heaven he uttered his warnings, and on earth his voice came to
thee from the heart of that dread fire he shewed thee;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and all because he loved thy fathers, and had chosen out their
posterity. He rescued thee from Egypt, and marched on before thee with
the great power that is his,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` ready to dispossess proud nations that were more than a match for
thee at thy coming, and make their lands thine; it has happened here
under thy eyes.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Be sure, then, of this henceforward, and keep it before thy mind,
that the Lord is the God who reigns in heaven above and on earth
beneath; there is no other.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` His laws and decrees thou must observe, as I have proclaimed them
to thee, if thou and thy sons after thee are to prosper, and have long
enjoyment of the land the Lord thy God means to give thee.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then Moses set apart three cities on the east of Jordan,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` as a place of refuge, if he could but escape to one of them, for
the man that had killed his neighbour unwittingly, without having any
feud against him in times past.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` These were Bosor, out in the desert, in the plain that belongs to
Ruben, Ramoth in Galaad, for Gad, and Golan in Basan, for Manasses.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Here follows the law which Moses proclaimed to the sons of Israel;
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` these are the commandments and decrees and awards he gave to the
Israelites that had marched with him out of Egypt.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` It was beyond Jordan that he gave them, opposite the shrine of
Phogor, in the country that once belonged to the Amorrhite king Sehon,
who reigned in Hesebon. But now Moses had defeated him, and the sons of
Israel, coming back from Egypt,
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` had overrun both his territory and the territory of Og, king of
Basan. These were the two Amorrhite kings that reigned east of the
Jordan,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` from Aroer, on the banks of Arnon, to the hill of Sion, that is, of
Hermon;✻
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` ruled all over the plain that lies east of Jordan, down to the
Desert Sea and the spurs of mount Phasga.
