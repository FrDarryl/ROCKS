[16]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And now, son of man, do thou confront Jerusalem with the record of
her misdoings.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Tell her this, in the name of the Lord God: Root of thee, stock of
thee, spring from yonder soil of Chanaan; an Amorrhite it was begot
thee, a Hethite bore thee.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Born when thou wast, there was none to cut navel-string, in healing
water wash thee, with salt harden thee, wrap thee in swaddling-clothes;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` never an eye melted with pity, none befriended thee; on the bare
ground thou wert cast away, a thing of abhorrence, that day of thy
birth.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Who but I found thee, as I passed on my way, blood-bespattered as
thou wert, and trodden under foot; in that plight preserved thee, bade
it live on, this defiled thing?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Swift as the wild blossoms I bade thee grow; grow thou didst and
thrive, and camest to woman’s estate, the breasts formed, new hair
shewing; and still thou wast all naked, and blushing for thy nakedness.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Who but I came upon thee, as I passed on my way? And already thou
wert ripe for love; cloak of mine should be thrown about thee, to hide
thy shame; my troth I plighted to thee, the Lord God says, and thou
wert mine.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Water to wash thee, all thy stains gone, oil I brought to anoint
thee;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` clad thee with embroidery, shod thy feet with leather; of fine
linen thy tiring should be, of silk thy wear.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` How I decked thee with ornaments! Bracelets for those arms, a
collar for that neck;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` a frontlet on thy brow, rings in thy ears, on thy head a crown
magnifical.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Of gold and silver thy adorning, of fine linen and silk and
embroidery thy apparel, of wheat and honey and oil thy nourishment;
matchless beauty, too, was thine, such beauty as brought thee to a
throne.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` All the world heard the fame of thy loveliness; I had made thee so
fair, says the Lord God, utterly fair!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Fatal beauty, fatal renown, which emboldened thee to play the
harlot, lavish thy favours on every passer-by, and be his!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` That thou shouldst use those garments of thine to make curtains for
thy hill-shrines, what age can match the villainy of it?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Silver and gold of mine, thy adornment and my gift, should they be
turned into gods of male form, at thy harlot’s whim?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And these wouldst thou clothe with thy own embroideries, offer them
the perfume and incense that was mine by right,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` set before them the bread, the oil, the honey I gave thee, to
appease them with the smell of burnt-sacrifice? More happened besides
(he, the Lord God, reminds thee);
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` to these gods thou wouldst bring sons and daughters of thine and
mine, consecrating them to death. Could not thy wanton desires rest
content,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` without immolating my own sons as victims to such as these?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Most foul deeds and most lecherous, that quite put thy youth out of
mind, the days when thou wast naked, and overcome with shame,
blood-bespattered and trodden under foot.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And at last, to crown thy misdoings (Fie on thee, fie on thee for
shame! says the Lord God),
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` thou wouldst build thee a brothel, a common stew, in every street;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` no cross-roads but should carry the blazon of thy harlotry. O the
dishonour done to thy beauty, when thou didst welcome every passer-by
to thy favours, insatiable in thy dalliance!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` With those lusty neighbours of thine, the Egyptians, thou wouldst
play the wanton; these should be my rivals!
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` What wonder I should interpose, and abridge the rights thou didst
enjoy, handing thee over for a prey to the maids of Philistia, rivals
of thy own, and such as blushed to witness thy ill-doings?✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` It was not enough; thou must needs dally with the men of Assur, nor
might their dalliance content thee;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` thou wouldst extend thy trade as far as Chaldaea, where all is for
sale, insatiable to the last.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Salve is none, says the Lord God, for such a heart as thine, set on
following a harlot’s ways.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Never a cross-roads, never a street, but thou hast set up some
brothel for public resort; no harlot thou, to bargain over a hateful
trade.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Thine was the craving of the false wife, that must ever bring a
stranger between her husband’s sheets.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The price of love other harlots claim, thou wouldst offer; gifts of
thine should entice gallants from every side to thy bower.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Never did wanton the like, nor shall again; it is out of all
nature, a harlot that gives, not takes.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Here then, poor wanton, is the Lord’s doom;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` this message he has for thee. Because all thy bronze was put to
such ill use,✻ because thou didst wanton so shamelessly with those
lovers of thine, idols most foul, in whose honour the lives of thy own
children were sacrificed,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` I mean to have a reckoning with thee. All the gallants that have
enjoyed thee, men that love thee and men that hate, I will muster
together; muster them from all around, and then lay thy shame bare,
expose thy nakedness for all to see.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Such punishment thou shalt have as unfaithful wives have, or
murderers; to my jealous anger thy life must make amends;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` I mean to leave thee at their mercy. Ruined thy bower, ransacked
thy brothel shall be; thy garments stripped off thee, plundered thy
fair adornment; naked they shall leave thee, and overcome with shame.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Hue and cry they shall raise against thee, stone thee and put thee
to the sword;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` house of thine the flames shall not spare. Before all womankind
they will make an example of thee; no more dalliance, no more hired
lovers now.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Then at last my vengeance shall be complete, my jealous anger
appeased; thou shalt have a respite from my ill-will.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` So forgetful of thy youth, so obstinate in thy provocations, what
wonder if I pay thee what thou hast earned? the Lord says. Yet even now
I have not requited thee as thy most foul crimes have deserved.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Like mother, like daughter; so runs the proverb, and of thee it
shall be spoken.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that was false to husband and
child; false to husband and child were those sisters of thine; thy
mother a Hethite, thy father an Amorrhite, sure enough.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Here was thy elder sister on thy left, Samaria, thy younger sister
on thy right, Sodom, with daughter towns both of them.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Didst thou follow their example, share their misdoings? Nay, that
was not enough for thee; it should go hard but thou wouldst outdo them
in their crimes.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` As I am a living God, the Lord says, never were Sodom and her
daughters guilty as thou and thine.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Pride was the fault of her, this sister of thine; pride and a full
belly; the peace and plenty she and her daughters had, with no thought
for the poor that stood in need!
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` So it was they rebelled against me, ever I must see foul deeds
done, till I rid myself of them, as thou seest.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Nor was Samaria in her turn half so guilty as thou. It remained for
thee to outvie thy sisters in crime, till thy more abominable doings
put them in countenance.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Their lesser guilt, that somewhat excuses them, is the measure of
thy shame; of that shame thou must bear the brand, while thy sisters go
free.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` When I reverse the doom of exile against Sodom and her daughters,
Samaria and her daughters, then, in their company, thy own exiles shall
return;
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` a sorry boast for thee, that thou hast cheered, in such fashion,
their loneliness!
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` Only when Sodom and her daughters, Samaria and her daughters, to
their former state return, is there any hope for thy daughters and for
thee.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` Time was, when no mention of Sodom’s name might soil thy proud
lips;
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` that was before thy own sins came to light, that now disgrace thee
before Syria’s daughters, Philistia’s daughters, thy watchful
neighbours north and south.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Now it is thy turn, the Lord God says, to undergo the shame of thy
guilt.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` And this is his doom:✻ False to thy oath, thou hast forsworn our
covenant, and thou shalt have the punishment thou hast earned.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` That covenant I made with thee in thy youth shall not be forgotten;
nay, I will ratify it eternally,
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` but humbled thou shalt be with memories of past days, when thou
must needs take thy sisters, older and younger, to thyself. Daughters
of thine they shall be, strangers to the covenant no longer.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` My covenant thus ratified with thee, thou shalt know my power at
last;
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` remembering still, shamefaced and tongue-tied still, even when I
have pardoned all thy ill-doing, says the Lord God.

Notas de rodapé:
16:1-14 - God describes Israel as an abandoned and rejected child, but
one whom He chose, purified, and prospered. The covenant between God
and Israel is an expression of His grace and unconditional love,
despite the people's unfaithfulness (see also Deuteronomy 7:7-8 and
16:15-34 - Israel, however, prostitutes itself spiritually, seeking
alliances with other nations and worshiping other gods. Israel's
unfaithfulness is seen as a great betrayal of its relationship with
16:35-43 - The Lord pronounces severe judgment on Jerusalem because of
its idolatry and immorality. The city will be punished, but God also
promises to restore it after the judgment, showing His mercy (see also
16:44-58 - God references other cities, such as Sodom, to illustrate
the gravity of Jerusalem's sin, emphasizing that the city is even more
guilty because of its greater revelation of grace. The comparison
emphasizes the wickedness of sin and the need for repentance (see also
16:59-63 - God promises to restore the nation of Israel by making a new
covenant, in which He remembers the promise of salvation and
forgiveness despite His people's failures. This points to future grace
