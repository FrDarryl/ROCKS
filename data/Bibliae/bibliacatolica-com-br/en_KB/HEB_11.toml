offering; through that offering of his he still speaks in death.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Enoch was taken away without the experience of death, when God

is the account we have of him before he was taken, that he pleased
God;✻

that he rewards those who try to find him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Noe received a warning about dangers still unseen, it was faith

'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Here is one man, a man for whom life is already over; and from him
springs a race whose numbers rival the stars of heaven, or the
uncounted grains of sand on the sea-shore.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It was faith they lived by, all of them, and in faith they died;

what was to come;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` by faith that Jacob, on his death-bed, made reverence to the top of
Joseph’s staff, as he blessed his two sons in turn;✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` by faith that Joseph, when he, too, came to the end of his life,
spoke of the Israelites’ escape from Egypt, and gave orders for the
removal of his bones.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The parents of Moses shewed faith, in making light of the king’s
edict, and hiding their child away for three months, when they saw what
a fine child he was.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Moses shewed faith, when he grew up, by refusing to pass for
the son of Pharao’s daughter.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He preferred ill-usage, shared with the people of God, to the brief
enjoyment of sinful pleasures;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` all the wealth of Egypt could not so enrich him as the despised lot
of God’s anointed; he had eyes, you see, for nothing but the promised
reward.✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` It was in faith that he left Egypt behind, defying the royal anger,
made strong as if by the very sight of him who is invisible;✻

the blood, to leave Israel untouched by the angel that destroyed the

through all the history of Gedeon, of Barac, of Samson, of Jephte, of
David and Samuel and the prophets.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Theirs was the faith which subdued kingdoms, which served the cause
of right, which made promises come true. They shut the mouths of lions,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` they quenched raging fire, swords were drawn on them, and they
escaped. How strong they became, who till then were weak, what courage
they shewed in battle, how they routed invading armies!
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` There were women, too, who recovered their dead children, brought
back to life. Others, looking forward to a better resurrection still,
would not purchase their freedom on the rack.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And others experienced mockery and scourging, chains, too, and
imprisonment;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` they were stoned, they were cut in pieces, they were tortured,✻
