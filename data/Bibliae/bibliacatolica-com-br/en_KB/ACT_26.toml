"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Agrippa said to Paul, Thou art free to give an account of
thyself. And Paul, stretching out his hand, began his defence:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` King Agrippa, I count myself fortunate to-day, to be defending
myself against all the accusations of the Jews in thy presence.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` No one is more familiar than thou with the customs of the Jews, and
their controversies; and this makes me bold to ask thee for a patient
audience.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` What my life was like when boyhood was over, spent from the first
among my own people and in Jerusalem, all the Jews know;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` their earliest memory of me, would they but admit it, is of one who
lived according to the strictest tradition of observance we have, a
Pharisee.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And if I stand here on my trial, it is for my hope of the promise
God made to our fathers.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Our twelve tribes worship him ceaselessly, night and day, in the
hope of attaining that promise; and this is the hope, my lord king, for
which the Jews call me to account.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Why should it be beyond the belief of men such as thou art, that God
should raise the dead?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Well then, I thought it my duty to defy, in many ways, the name of
Jesus the Nazarene.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And that is what I did, at Jerusalem; it was I, under powers
granted me by the chief priests, who shut up many of the faithful in
prison; and when they were done to death, I raised my voice against
them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Often have I tried to force them into blaspheming, by inflicting
punishment on them in one synagogue after another; nay, so unmeasured
was my rage against them that I used to go to foreign cities to
persecute them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It was on such an errand that I was making my way to Damascus, with
powers delegated to me by the chief priests,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` when, journeying at midday, I saw, my lord king, a light from
heaven, surpassing the brightness of the sun, which shone about me and
my companions.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` We all fell to the ground,✻ and I heard a voice which said to me,
in Hebrew, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? This is a thankless
task of thine, kicking against the goad.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Who art thou, Lord? I asked. And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom
Saul persecutes.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Rise up, and stand on thy feet; I have shewn myself to thee, that I
may single thee out to serve me, as the witness of this vision thou
hast had, and other visions thou wilt have of me.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I will be thy deliverer from the hands of thy people, and of the
Gentiles, to whom I am now sending thee.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thou shalt open their eyes, and turn them from darkness to light,
from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive, through faith
in me, remission of their sins and an inheritance among the saints.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Whereupon, king Agrippa, I did not show myself disobedient to the
heavenly vision.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` First to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem, then to all the
country of Judaea, then to the heathen, I preached repentance, bidding
them turn to God, and so act as befits men who are penitent.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` That is why the Jews, when they caught me in the temple, tried to
murder me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But, thanks to God’s help, I still stand here to-day, bearing my
witness to small and great alike. Yet there is nothing in my message
which goes beyond what the prophets spoke of, and Moses spoke of, as
things to come;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` a suffering Christ, and one who should shew light to his people and
to the Gentiles by being the first to rise from the dead.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When Paul had proceeded so far with his defence, Festus said in a
loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; they are driving thee to madness, these
long studies of thine.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But Paul answered, No, most noble Festus, I am not mad; the message
which I utter is sober truth.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The king knows about all this well enough; that is why I speak with
such confidence in his presence. None of this, I am sure, is news to
him; it was not in some secret corner that all this happened.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Dost thou believe the prophets, king Agrippa? I am well assured
thou dost believe them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` At this, Agrippa said to Paul, Thou wouldst have me turn Christian
with very little ado.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Why, said Paul, it would be my prayer to God that, whether it were
with much ado or little, both thou and all those who are listening to
me to-day should become just such as I am, but for these chains.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then the king rose, and so did the governor, and Bernice, and all
those who sat there with them.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When they had retired, they said to one another, This man is guilty
of no fault that deserves death or imprisonment.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And Agrippa said to Festus, If he had not appealed to Caesar, this
man might have been set at liberty.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
26:1-8 - Paul defends himself before Agrippa, presenting his faith in
Christ as the reason for his imprisonment. He explains that his
conversion experience was a divine revelation. This discourse
highlights the centrality of personal testimony in the Christian faith
26:9-18 - Paul describes his conversion and Jesus' call to be a witness
among the Gentiles. The account is an example of how the gospel
26:19-23 - Paul explains how obedience to Christ's vision led him to
preach repentance and conversion. The call to faith is presented as a

affirms the truth of his message. Agrippa's resistance illustrates the
