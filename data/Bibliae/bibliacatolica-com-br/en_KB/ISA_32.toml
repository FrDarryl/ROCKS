"1" = ''':sup:`1` See, where a king rules his folk justly! His nobles, too, make right
award;✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` to them men look, as for shelter against the wind, cover in a storm;
for running streams in drought, shade of towering rock in a parched
land.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Eyes they will have to see with, no darkness there; ears that are
strained to listen attentively;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` rude minds shall learn wise thoughts, the stammering tongue speak
out readily and clear.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Noble rank shall no longer be for the reckless, or lordly titles for
the crafty.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The reckless man, that speaks ever recklessly, his heart set on
mischief, still full of empty show, and blasphemy against the Lord;
food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty denying still!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And the crafty man, an ill craft is his, false pleas devising to
ruin harmless folk, cheat the poor of their rights!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` From a noble nature spring noble acts; title is none to greatness
higher than this.

fruit-harvest comes.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Bewildered, the minds that were once at ease, full of foreboding,
those untroubled hearts; you must go stripped and shame-faced now, with
sackcloth about your loins,

"12" = ''':sup:`12` mourn for lost fruitfulness, for the fields once so smiling, for
the vineyards that bore so well.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` That thorns and briers should come up in these lands of yours; come
up over haunts you loved, in the city that was all mirth!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Empty, now, the palace, forgotten the hum of yonder streets;
nothing but gloom, where a man must pick his way through caverns✻
endlessly; loved haunts of the wild ass, a pasture-ground for the
flock.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` All this, until the spirit is poured out on us from above; fruitful
as Carmel then the wilderness, to make your well-tilled lands seem but
waste.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Alike desert and fruitful field the home, now, of innocence,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` the abode of loyalty; loyalty, that has peace for its crown,
tranquillity for its harvest, repose for ever undisturbed.

Notas de rodapé:
32:1-2 - A promise is made of a righteous king who will rule with
justice, bringing protection and security to the people. This prophecy
32:3-4 - The arrival of the righteous kingdom will result in
transformation: the blind will see, the deaf will hear, and
understanding will be renewed. This restoration is a work of God's
32:9-14 - The complacent women are warned of coming judgment. This
demonstrates that no one is exempt from accountability before God and
32:15-20 - The coming of the Holy Spirit will bring justice, peace, and
prosperity, restoring divine order to creation. This vision points to
2:17-18).
