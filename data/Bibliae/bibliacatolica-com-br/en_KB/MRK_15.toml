"1" = ''':sup:`1` No sooner had day broken, than the chief priests made their plans,
with the elders and scribes and the whole Council; they took Jesus away
in bonds and gave him up to Pilate.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? He answered
him, Thy own lips have said it.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And now the chief priests brought many accusations against him,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and Pilate questioned him again, Dost thou make no answer? See what
a weight of accusation they bring against thee.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But Jesus still would not answer him, so that Pilate was full of
astonishment.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` At the festival, he used to grant them the liberty of any one
prisoner they chose;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and the man they called Barabbas was then in custody, with the
rebels who had been guilty of murder during the rebellion.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So, when the multitude came up towards him, and began to ask for the
customary favour,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Pilate answered them, Would you have me release the king of the
Jews?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He knew well that the chief priests had only given him up out of
malice.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But the chief priests incited the multitude to ask for the release
of Barabbas instead.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Once more Pilate answered them, What would you have me do, then,
with the king of the Jews?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And they made a fresh cry of, Crucify him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Why, Pilate said to them, what wrong has he done? But they cried
all the more, Crucify him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And so Pilate, determined to humour the multitude, released
Barabbas as they asked; Jesus he scourged, and gave him up to be
crucified.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and
gathered there the whole of their company.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They arrayed him in a scarlet cloak, and put round his head a crown
which they had woven out of thorns,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and fell to greeting him with, Hail, king of the Jews.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And they beat him over the head with a rod, and spat upon him, and
bowed their knees in worship of him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` At last they had done with mockery; stripping him of the scarlet
cloak, they put his own garments on him, and led him away to be
crucified.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` As for his cross, they forced a passer-by who was coming in from
the country to carry it, one Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander
and Rufus.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And so they took him to a place called Golgotha, which means, The
place of a skull.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Here they offered him a draught of wine mixed with myrrh, which he
would not take;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and then crucified him, dividing his garments among them by casting
lots, to decide which should fall to each.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It was the third hour when they crucified him.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` A proclamation of his offence was written up over him, The king of
the Jews;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and with him they crucified two thieves, one on the right and the
other on his left,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` so fulfilling the words of scripture, And he was counted among the
wrong-doers.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The passers-by blasphemed against him, shaking their heads; Come
now, they said, thou who wouldst destroy the temple and build it up in
three days,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` come down from that cross, and rescue thyself.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` In the same way, the chief priests and scribes said mockingly to
one another, He saved others, he cannot save himself.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Let Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross, here and
now, so that we can see it and believe in him. And the men who were
crucified with him uttered taunts against him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` When the sixth hour came, there was darkness over all the earth
until the ninth hour;✻
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, Eloi,
Eloi, lamma sabachthani? which means, My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Hearing this, some of those who stood by said, Why, he is calling
upon Elias.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And thereupon one of them ran off to fill a sponge with vinegar,
and fixed it on a rod, and offered to let him drink; Wait, he said, Let
us see whether Elias is to come and save him.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Then Jesus gave a loud cry, and yielded up his spirit.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And the veil of the temple was torn this way and that, from the top
to the bottom.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The centurion who stood in front of him, perceiving that he so
yielded up his spirit with a cry, said, No doubt but this was the Son
of God.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` There were women there, who stood watching from far off; among them
were Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of
Joseph, and Salome.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` These used to follow him and minister to him when he was in
Galilee, and there were many others who had come up with him to
Jerusalem.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And now it was already evening; and because it was the day of
preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,✻
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` a rich councillor, named Joseph of Arimathea, one of those who
waited for God’s kingdom, boldly went to Pilate, and asked to have the
body of Jesus.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Pilate, astonished that he should have died so soon, called the
centurion to him, to ask if he was dead already,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` and when he heard the centurion’s report, gave Joseph the body.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Joseph took him down, and wrapped him in a winding-sheet which he
had bought, and laid him in a tomb cut out of the rock, rolling a stone
against the door of the tomb.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, saw where he had been
laid.✻

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
15:1-5 - Jesus is brought before Pilate, and His silent attitude in the
face of the accusations reinforces His submission to the Father's will.
Christ's suffering is part of His redemptive plan for humanity,
Peter 2:23).
15:6-15 - The crowd chooses Barabbas over Jesus, symbolizing their
rejection of the Messiah and their preference for violence and sin.
This points to the conflict between the values of God's Kingdom and the
18:39-40).
15:16-20 - Jesus is mocked by the soldiers, crowned with thorns and
dressed in a purple robe, a mockery of His royalty. This humiliation
anticipates the sacrifice of Christ, who is king not by human power,
19:2-3).
15:21-32 - Jesus carries His cross to Golgotha, where He is crucified.
His suffering is the culmination of the plan of salvation, and the
cross becomes the ultimate symbol of God's sacrificial love for
15:33-41 - Jesus' death is marked by a series of supernatural
phenomena, including darkness over the land and the tearing of the
Temple veil. This signals the opening of the way to God and the end of
