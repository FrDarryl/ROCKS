"1" = ''':sup:`1` The seventh month had come; and now Ismahel, son of Nathanias, son
of Elisama, one of the royal princes and the king’s vassals,✻ came with
ten followers to Masphath, where Godolias was, and at Masphath they sat
at table together.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There and then, at the sword’s point, Ismahel and his ten men put
Godolias to death. So perished Godolias, son of Ahicam, son of Saphan,
that held the king of Babylon’s warrant to rule the country.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Such Jews as were with Godolias at Masphath, such Chaldaean soldiers
as he found there, Ismahel despatched at the same time.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the day after Godolias’ murder, before the news of it was out,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` came eighty pilgrims from Sichem, Silo, and Samaria, beards shaven,
garments rent, in mourning all of them, with bloodless offerings and
incense for the Lord’s temple.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Out came Ismahel son of Nathanias from Masphath to meet them, and
wept ever as he went; Welcome, said he, from Godolias son of Ahicam!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when they had reached the middle of the town, just by the
cistern,✻ they were slain by Ismahel and his men;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` all except ten of them, who pleaded for their lives and told Ismahel
they had a hoard of wheat, barley, oil and honey hidden away under
their lands; these were spared the fate of the rest.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When he slew the companions of Godolias, Ismahel had thrown their
bodies into the cistern; it was one which king Asa had made to defend
the place against Baasa, king of Israel; now, Ismahel’s massacre filled
it to the brim.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Thus there was no longer a remnant at Masphath; the king’s
daughters, and all the other folk left there by Nabuzardan under the
care of Godolias, Ismahel took off with him as his captives, and so
would have marched away into the Ammonite country.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But Johanan, son of Caree, and the other army chieftains that were
on his side, no sooner heard the ill news of what Ismahel had done
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` than they mustered all their men to give him battle, and caught up
with him at the pool of Gabaon.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` A welcome sight it was to Ismahel’s company, when they saw Johanan,
son of Caree, and the other chieftains approaching;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` back went all the prisoners to Masphath, and threw in their lot
with Johanan instead;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Ismahel fled at the sight of him, and reached the Ammonite country
with only eight men at his back.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Johanan and his fellow chieftains would not leave at Masphath this
remnant they had rescued from Ismahel after the murder of Godolias; all
the fighting men, the women and children, the eunuchs, who had returned
with them from Gabaon.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They went off and made their home for a time at Chamaan, near
Bethlehem, thinking to take refuge in Egypt
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` from the vengeance of the Chaldaeans. From these they had much to
fear, now that Ismahel son of Nathanias had murdered Godolias son of
Ahicam, the king of Babylon’s own representative in Juda.
