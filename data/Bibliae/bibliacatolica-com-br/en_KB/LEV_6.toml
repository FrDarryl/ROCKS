"4" = ''':sup:`4` If he is found guilty, he must make restitution,

the ashes left by the fire which consumes it, and lay these down by the
altar.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then, taking off the clothes he wears and putting on others, he
will take the ashes away from the camp to a place already purified, and
there calcine them.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The fire on the altar must burn continually; each morning the

'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` No leaven must be put into it, shared as it is with the Lord’s
burnt-sacrifice; it is set apart for holy uses, like the offerings that
are made for a fault or for a wrong done.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Only the male descendants of Aaron may eat it. This is the rule to
be observed continually, age after age, in offering the Lord sacrifice;
whoever touches it becomes holy thereby.

'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` This is the offering Aaron and his sons must make to the Lord when

"24" = ''':sup:`24` And the Lord spoke to Moses again,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` giving him a message for Aaron and his sons: This is the rule that

clothing is stained by its blood, it must be washed on hallowed ground.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` Even the earthenware pot in which it was cooked must be broken; or,
if it is cooked in a pan of bronze, the pan must be scraped clean and

male person belonging to the priestly family,
