"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then the whole assembly of them rose up and brought him before
Pilate,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and there fell to accusing him; We have discovered, they said, that
this man is subverting the loyalty of our people, forbids the payment
of tribute to Caesar, and calls himself Christ the king.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And Pilate asked him, Art thou the king of the Jews? He answered
him, Thy own lips have said it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, I cannot
discover any fault in this man.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But they insisted, He rouses sedition among the people; he has gone
round the whole of Judaea preaching, beginning in Galilee and ending
here.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Pilate, upon the mention of Galilee, asked whether the man was a
Galilean;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and learning that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, remitted his
cause to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at this time.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Herod was overjoyed at seeing Jesus; for a long time he had been
eager to have sight of him, because he had heard so much of him, and
now he hoped to witness some miracle of his.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He asked him many questions, but could get no answer from him,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` although the chief priests and scribes stood there, loudly accusing
him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So Herod and his attendants made a jest of him, arraying him in
festal attire out of mockery, and sent him back to Pilate.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` That day Herod and Pilate, who had hitherto been at enmity with one
another, became friends.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And now Pilate summoned the chief priests, and the rulers, and the
people,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and said to them, You have brought this man before me as one who
seduces the people from their allegiance; I examined him in your
presence, and could find no substance in any of the charges you bring
against him;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` nor could Herod, when I referred you to him. It is plain that he
has done nothing which deserves death.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I will scourge him, and then he shall go free.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` At the festival, he was obliged to grant them the liberty of one
prisoner:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` but the whole concourse raised the cry, Away with this man; we must
have Barabbas released.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` (Barabbas was a man who had been thrown into prison for raising a
revolt in the city, and for murder.)
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Once more Pilate spoke to them, offering to set Jesus at liberty;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but they continued to answer with shouts of, Crucify him, crucify
him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then for the third time he said to them, Why, what wrong has he
done? I can find no fault in him that deserves death; I will scourge
him, and then he shall go free.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But they, with loud cries, insisted on their demand that he should
be crucified; and their voices carried the day;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Pilate gave his assent that their request should be granted,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` releasing the man of their choice who had been imprisoned for
revolt and murder, while he handed Jesus over to their will.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` As they led him off, they caught hold of a man called Simon of
Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and loaded him with the
cross, so that he should carry it after Jesus.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Jesus was followed by a great multitude of the people, and also of
women, who beat their breasts and mourned over him;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` but he turned to them, and said, It is not for me that you should
weep, daughters of Jerusalem; you should weep for yourselves and your
children.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Behold, a time is coming when men will say, It is well for the
barren, for the wombs that never bore children, and the breasts that
never suckled them.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It is then that they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on
us, and to the hills, Cover us.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` If it goes so hard with the tree that is still green, what will
become of the tree that is already dried up?✻
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Two others, who were criminals, were led off with him to be put to
death.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And when they reached the place which is named after a skull, they
crucified him there; and also the two criminals, one on his right and
the other on his left.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus meanwhile was saying, Father, forgive them; they do not know
what it is they are doing. And they divided his garments among
themselves by lot.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The people stood by, watching; and the rulers joined them in
pouring scorn on him; He saved others, they said; if he is the Christ,
God’s chosen, let him save himself.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` The soldiers, too, mocked him, when they came and offered him
vinegar,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` by saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` (A proclamation had been written up over him in Greek, Latin and
Hebrew, This is the king of the Jews.)
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And one of the two thieves who hung there fell to blaspheming
against him; Save thyself, he said, and us too, if thou art the Christ.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` But the other rebuked him; What, he said, hast thou no fear of God,
when thou art undergoing the same sentence?
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And we justly enough; we receive no more than the due reward of our
deeds; but this man has done nothing amiss.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Then he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
kingdom.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And Jesus said to him, I promise thee, this day thou shalt be with
me in Paradise.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` It was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the
earth until the ninth hour.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the
midst:
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and Jesus said, crying with a loud voice, Father, into thy hands I
commend my spirit; and yielded up his spirit as he said it.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And the centurion, when he saw what befell, gave glory to God;
This, he said, was indeed a just man.✻
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And the whole multitude of those who stood there watching it, when
they saw the issue, went home beating their breasts.✻
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` All his acquaintances, with the women who had followed him from
Galilee, watched while this happened, standing at a distance.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And now a man called Joseph came forward, one of the councillors, a
good and upright man,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` who had not taken part with the council and its doings; he was from
Arimathea, a Jewish city, and was one of those who waited for the
kingdom of God.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` He it was who approached Pilate, and asked to have the body of
Jesus.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` This he took, and wrapped it in a winding-sheet, and laid it in a
tomb fashioned out of the rock, in which no man had ever been buried.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` It was the day of preparation; the next day was the sabbath.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` And the women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw
the tomb, and how his body was buried;
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` so they went back, and prepared spices and ointments, and while it
was the sabbath they kept still, as the law commanded.✻

Notas de rodapé:
23:1-5 - Jesus is brought before Pilate, and the false charges against
Him are presented. This moment illustrates the injustice Jesus suffered
and His willingness to submit to God's plan of redemption (see also
23:13-25 - Pilate tries to release Jesus, but gives in to pressure from
the crowd and condemns Him to crucifixion. The people's choice of
Barabbas over Jesus reflects human sin and rejection of the Savior (see
23:26-31 - Jesus is taken to be crucified, and He meets the women of
Jerusalem, warning them of Jerusalem's future suffering. He shows
compassion even in the face of His suffering, revealing His love for
23:39-43 - One of the criminals beside Jesus repents and asks for His
help, and Jesus promises him paradise. This demonstrates God's grace,
which offers forgiveness even in the final moments (see also
23:44-49 - Jesus' death is accompanied by cosmic signs and the
centurion's reaction, who recognizes Jesus as the Son of God. Christ's
death, though painful, is a moment of victory over sin and death (see
