"1" = ''':sup:`1` Six days afterwards, Jesus took Peter and James and John with him,
and led them up to a high mountain where they were alone by themselves;
and he was transfigured in their presence.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` His garments became bright, dazzling white like snow, white as no
fuller here on earth could have made them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And they had sight of Elias, with Moses; these two were conversing
with Jesus.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then Peter said aloud to Jesus, Master, it is well that we should be
here; let us make three arbours, one for thee, and one for Moses, and
one for Elias;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` he did not know what to say, for they were overcome with fear.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And a cloud formed, overshadowing them; and from the cloud came a
voice, which said, This is my beloved Son; to him, then, listen.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then, on a sudden, they looked round them, and saw no one any more,
but Jesus only with them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And as they were coming down from the mountain, he warned them not
to tell anyone what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen
from the dead;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` so they kept the matter to themselves, wondering what the words
could mean, When he has risen from the dead.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And they asked him, Tell us, why do the Pharisees and scribes say
Elias must come before Christ?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He answered them, Elias must needs come and restore all things as
they were; and now, what is written of the Son of Man? That he must be
much ill-used, and despised.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Elias too, I tell you, has already come, and they have misused him
at their pleasure, as the scriptures tell of him.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he reached his disciples, he found a great multitude gathered
around them, and some of the scribes disputing with them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The multitude, as soon as they saw him, were overcome with awe, and
ran up to welcome him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He asked them, What is the dispute you are holding among you?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And one of the multitude answered, Master, I have brought my son to
thee; he is possessed by a dumb spirit,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and wherever it seizes on him, it tears him, and he foams at the
mouth, and gnashes his teeth, and his strength is drained from him. And
I bade thy disciples cast it out, but they were powerless.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he answered them, Ah, faithless generation, how long must I be
with you, how long must I bear with you? Bring him to me.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So they brought the boy to him; and the evil spirit, as soon as it
saw him, threw the boy into a convulsion, so that he fell on the
ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And now Jesus asked the father, How long has this been happening to
him? From childhood, he said;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and often it has thrown him into the fire, and into water, to make
an end of him. Come, have pity on us, and help us if thou canst.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, to him who believes,
everything is possible.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Whereupon the father of the boy cried aloud, in tears, Lord, I do
believe; succour my unbelief.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Jesus, seeing how the multitude was gathering round them,
rebuked the unclean spirit; Thou dumb and deaf spirit, he said, it is I
that command thee; come out of him, and never enter into him again.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` With that, crying aloud and throwing him into a violent convulsion,
it came out of him, and he lay there like a corpse, so that many
declared, He is dead.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Jesus took hold of his hand, and raised him, and he stood up.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When he had gone into a house, and they were alone, the disciples
asked him, Why was it that we could not cast it out?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he told them, There is no way of casting out such spirits as
this except by prayer and fasting.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then they left those parts, and passed straight through Galilee,
and he would not let anyone know of his passage;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` he spent the time teaching his disciples. The Son of Man, he said,
is to be given up into the hands of men. They will put him to death,
and he will rise again on the third day.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But they could not understand his meaning, and were afraid to ask
him.✻
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So they came to Capharnaum; and there, when they were in the house,
he asked them, What was the dispute you were holding on the way?
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` They said nothing, for they had been disputing among themselves
which should be the greatest of them.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then he sat down, and called the twelve to him, and said, If anyone
has a mind to be the greatest, he must be the last of all, and the
servant of all.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And he took a little child, and gave it a place in the midst of
them; and he took it in his arms, and said to them:
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Whoever welcomes such a child as this in my name, welcomes me; and
whoever welcomes me, welcomes, not me, but him that sent me.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And John answered him, Master, we saw a man who does not follow in
our company casting out devils in thy name, and we forbade him to do
it.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But Jesus said, Forbid him no more; no one who does a miracle in my
name will lightly speak evil of me.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The man who is not against you is on your side.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Why, if anyone gives you a cup of water to drink in my name,
because you are Christ’s, I promise you, he shall not miss his reward.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And if anyone hurts the conscience of one of these little ones,
that believe in me, he had better have been cast into the sea, with a
millstone about his neck.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` If thy hand is an occasion of falling to thee, cut it off; better
for thee to enter into life maimed, than to have two hands when thou
goest into hell, into unquenchable fire;
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` the worm which eats them there never dies, the fire is never
quenched.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And if thy foot is an occasion of falling to thee, cut it off;
better for thee to enter into eternal life lame, than to have both feet
when thou art cast into the unquenchable fire of hell;
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` the worm which eats them there never dies, the fire is never
quenched.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And if thy eye is an occasion of falling, pluck it out; better for
thee to enter blind into the kingdom of God, than to have two eyes when
thou art cast into the fire of hell;
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` the worm which eats them there never dies, the fire is never
quenched.✻
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Fire will be every man’s seasoning; every victim must be seasoned
with salt.✻
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Salt is a good thing, but if the salt becomes tasteless, what will
you use to season it with? You must have salt in yourselves, and keep
peace among you.
