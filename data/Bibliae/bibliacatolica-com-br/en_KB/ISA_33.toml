"1" = ''':sup:`1` What, plunderer of the nations, unplundered still? Proud lord of
others, does none dispute thy lordship? A time comes when thou must
cease plundering, and thyself be plundered, when of lordship thou hast
had enough, and others lord it over thee.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Have mercy on us, Lord, that wait for thee so patiently; day after
day be our stronghold, our deliverer thou in time of trouble!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Fled, the alien host, scattered the heathen, thy angel’s voice✻ once
heard, thy power made manifest!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Your spoils, Gentiles, how easily amassed! Easily as the locusts,
where they swarm in the trenches.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The Lord’s power made manifest, that is throned high in heaven! With
his just award Sion shall be well content;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` still in these times of ours✻ the promise well kept, the full
deliverance. Knowledge and wisdom and the fear of the Lord, what
treasure like these?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` See, where they stand at the gates, the men we sent out to report,✻
hailing us; the messengers we sent to ask for peace,✻ weeping bitterly;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Deserted, the highways, the lanes untravelled; the enemy has broken
the truce, making no terms with the cities, not sparing the lives of
men;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` widowed the countryside and lifeless, Lebanon shrunken and withered,
Saron a wilderness, Basan and Carmel quaking with fear.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now, the Lord says, to bestir myself, now to rise up in arms
against them, now to make them feel my power!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` A raging fire conceived in the womb, and nothing but stubble
brought to the birth; your own impetuous spirit shall be a fire,
Gentiles, to devour you;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` like ashes in a kiln they shall be left, the alien hordes, bundles
of brushwood eaten up by the fire.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Listen then, you that live far off, to the story of my doings; and
you, who dwell close to me, learn the lesson of my power.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` In Sion itself there be guilty folk that tremble, false hearts full
of dismay; who shall survive this devouring flame, the near presence of
fires that burn unceasingly?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He only, that follows the path of innocence, tells truth,
ill-gotten gain refuses, flings back the bribe; his ears shut to
murderous counsels, his eyes from every harmful sight turned away.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` On the heights his dwelling shall be, his eyrie among the
fastnesses of the rocks, bread shall be his for the asking, water from
an unfailing spring.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Those eyes shall look on the king in his royal beauty, have sight
of a land whose frontiers are far away.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Of those old fears, how thou wilt recall the memory! Where are they
now, the learned men, that could weight each phrase of the law, that
taught us like children?✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` No longer wilt thou see before thee a rebellious people,✻ all
profound talk that passes thy comprehension, and no wisdom.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Look around thee at Sion, goal of our pilgrimage, see where
Jerusalem lies, an undisturbed dwelling-place; here is tent securely
fixed, its pegs immoveable, its ropes never to be broken.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Here, as nowhere else, our Lord reigns in majesty; a place of
rivers, of wide, open streams, yet no ship’s oar will disturb it, no
huge galleon pass by;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` the Lord our judge, the Lord our lawgiver, the Lord our king, will
himself be our deliverance.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now, thy tackle hangs loose and unserviceable, too weak thy mast is
to display thy pennon; then, thou wilt have the spoil of many forays to
divide, even lame folk shall carry plunder away.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` No more shall they cry out on their helpless plight, these, thy
fellow citizens; none dwells there now but is assoiled of his guilt.
