[24]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` And at very early dawn on the first day of the week they came to the
tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and found the stone already rolled away from the door of the tomb.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They went into it, and could not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They were still puzzling over this, when two men came and stood by
them, in shining garments.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` These said to them, as they bowed their faces to the earth in fear,
Why are you seeking one who is alive, here among the dead?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He is not here, he has risen again; remember how he told you, while
he was still in Galilee,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The Son of Man is to be given up into the hands of sinners, and to
be crucified, and to rise again the third day.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then they remembered what he had said,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and returned from the tomb bringing news of all this to the eleven
apostles and to all the rest.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, who
told the apostles this;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but to their minds the story seemed madness, and they could not
believe it.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Only Peter rose up and ran to the tomb, where he looked in, and saw
the grave-clothes lying by themselves, and went away full of surmise
over what had befallen.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It was on the same day that two of them were walking to a village
called Emmaus, sixty furlongs away from Jerusalem,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` discussing all that had happened.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They were still conversing and debating together, when Jesus
himself drew near, and began to walk beside them;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` but their eyes were held fast, so that they could not recognize
him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he said to them, What talk is this you exchange between you as
you go along, sad-faced?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And one of them, who was called Cleophas, answered him, What, art
thou the only pilgrim in Jerusalem who has not heard of what has
happened there in the last few days?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` What happenings? he asked; and they said, About Jesus of Nazareth,
a prophet whose words and acts had power with God, and with all the
people;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` how the chief priests, and our rulers, handed him over to be
sentenced to death, and so crucified him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For ourselves, we had hoped that it was he who was to deliver
Israel; but now, to crown it all, to-day is the third day since it
befell.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Some women, indeed, who belonged to our company, alarmed us; they
had been at the tomb early in the morning
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and could not find his body; whereupon they came back and told us
that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found that all
was as the women had said, but of him they saw nothing.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then he said to them, Too slow of wit, too dull of heart, to
believe all those sayings of the prophets!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Was it not to be expected that the Christ should undergo these
sufferings, and enter so into his glory?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then, going back to Moses and the whole line of the prophets, he
began to interpret the words used of himself by all the scriptures.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And now they were drawing near the village to which they were
walking, and he made as if to go on further;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` but they pressed him, Stay with us, they said; it is towards
evening, and it is far on in the day. So he went in to stay with them.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And then, when he sat down at table with them, he took bread, and
blessed, and broke it, and offered it to them;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` whereupon their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and with
that, he disappeared from their sight.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And they said to one another, Were not our hearts burning within us
when he spoke to us on the road, and when he made the scriptures plain
to us?
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Rising up there and then, they went back to Jerusalem, where they
found the eleven apostles and their companions gathered together,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` now saying, The Lord has indeed risen, and has appeared to Simon.✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And they told the story of their encounter in the road, and how
they recognized him when he broke bread.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` While they were speaking of this, he himself stood in the midst of
them, and said, Peace be upon you; it is myself, do not be afraid.✻
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` They cowered down, full of terror, thinking that they were seeing
an apparition.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` What, he said to them, are you dismayed? Whence come these surmises
in your hearts?
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Look at my hands and my feet, to be assured that it is myself;
touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I
have.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And as he spoke thus, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then, while they were still doubtful, and bewildered with joy, he
asked them, Have you anything here to eat?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` So they put before him a piece of roast fish, and a honeycomb;
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` and he took these and ate in their presence and shared his meal
with them.✻
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` This is what I told you, he said, while I still walked in your
company; how all that was written of me in the law of Moses, and in the
prophets, and in the psalms, must be fulfilled.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Then he enlightened their minds, to make them understand the
scriptures;
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` So it was written, he told them, and so it was fitting that Christ
should suffer, and should rise again from the dead on the third day;
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Of this, you are the witnesses.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And behold, I am sending down upon you the gift which was promised
by my Father; you must wait in the city until you are clothed with
power from on high.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` When he had led them out as far as Bethany, he lifted up his hands
and blessed them;
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` and even as he blessed them he parted from them, and was carried up
into heaven.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` So they bowed down to worship him, and went back full of joy to
Jerusalem,
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` where they spent their time continually in the temple, praising and
blessing God.✻
