"1" = ''':sup:`1` Sedecias had then but lately come to the throne of Juda; it was the
fourth year of his reign. In the fifth month of that year a prophet
from Gabaon, Hananias son of Azur, came up to me in the temple, in full
sight of priests and worshippers.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` A message, he said, from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: So
much for the king of Babylon’s yoke! I have broken it to pieces.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Two years must run their course, and then all shall come back again
here; all the temple treasures Nabuchodonosor took away with him to his
capital at Babylon,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and the king of Juda too, Jechonias son of Joachim, with all the
exiles from Juda Babylon now holds. I will bring them back, the Lord
says, and break the yoke of the king of Babylon to pieces.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But from Jeremias this prophet Hananias had a prophet’s answer,
there in the presence of the priests, and of all who stood by in the
Lord’s house;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Amen to that! Well indeed it were if the Lord would grant this
prophecy of thine fulfilment, would bring all the temple treasure home,
and all the exiles at Babylon!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Only, here is a word for thy hearing, and for the general hearing no
less.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` So many prophets before thy day and mine, so many nations, such
proud empires their theme, and all alike told of battle, of distress,
of famine;

"9" = ''':sup:`9` here is one at last that brings good news! Why then, when his words
come true, none will doubt that his errand was from the Lord.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` At that, Hananias took the band from Jeremias’ neck and broke it,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` crying out before all the people, A message from the Lord! Thus,
when two years have run their course, I will break the yoke which king
Nabuchodonosor of Babylon has laid on the necks of all the nations!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Jeremias said no more, but passed on. Thus did Hananias break
the band on the neck of his fellow prophet; and thereupon came the word
of the Lord to Jeremias,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Go and give Hananias this message from the Lord: Wooden yoke break,
iron yoke make!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, tells thee that he is putting
a yoke of iron on the necks of all the nations, subjecting them to
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon. His subjects they shall be; even over
the wild beasts dominion is granted him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` This, too, Jeremias said to his fellow prophet, Listen, Hananias;
errand from the Lord thou hast none, thou art cheating yonder people
with false hopes.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And this doom the Lord has uttered: I mean to banish thee from this
earth altogether; thou shalt die within the year, for this language of
rebellion against the Lord.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Hananias died that year, before seven months were over.

Notas de rodapé:
28:1-4 - The prophet Hananiah challenges Jeremiah's word, proclaiming
that God would quickly restore the temple furnishings and the nation.
His prophecy of immediate prosperity is a false hope that contrasts
28:5-9 - Jeremiah responds to Hananiah, stating that previous prophets
also foretold judgment, and that the true word of God is proven by the
fulfillment of prophecy. This highlights the importance of discerning
28:10-11 - Hananiah breaks the wooden yoke that Jeremiah had placed as
a symbol of Babylonian rule, symbolizing his attempt to break
Nebuchadnezzar's rule. His rebellious action, however, does not change
28:12-17 - After Hananiah's falsehood, God reveals to Jeremiah that the
prophet would die that year as a sign of his falsehood. This
demonstrates the gravity of prophesying in God's name without divine
authority and the certainty that God's words will come to pass (see
28:17:00 - Hananiah's death is a reminder that divine truth will
prevail over human lies. God's judgment is certain, and false prophets
