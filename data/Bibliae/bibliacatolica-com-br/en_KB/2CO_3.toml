"1" = ''':sup:`1` You will say, perhaps, that we are making a fresh attempt to
recommend ourselves to your favour. What, do we need letters of
recommendation to you, or from you, as some others do?✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Why, you yourselves are the letter we carry about with us, written
in our hearts, for all to recognize and to read.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` You are an open letter from Christ, promulgated through us; a
message written not in ink, but in the Spirit of the living God, with
human hearts, instead of stone, to carry it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Such, through Christ, is the confidence in which we make our appeal
to God.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Not that, left to ourselves, we are able to frame any thought as
coming from ourselves; all our ability comes from God,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` since it is he who has enabled us to promulgate his new law to men.
It is a spiritual, not a written law; the written law inflicts death,
whereas the spiritual law brings life.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` We know how that sentence of death, engraved in writing upon stone,
was promulgated to men in a dazzling cloud, so that the people of
Israel could not look Moses in the face, for the brightness of it,
although that brightness soon passed away.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` How much more dazzling, then, must be the brightness in which the
spiritual law is promulgated to them!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` If there is a splendour in the proclamation of our guilt, there must
be more splendour yet in the proclamation of our acquittal;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and indeed, what once seemed resplendent seems by comparison
resplendent no longer, so much does the greater splendour outshine it.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` What passed away passed in a flash of glory; what remains, remains
instead in a blaze of glory.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Such is the ground of our confidence, and we speak out boldly
enough.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is not for us to use veiled language, as Moses veiled his face.
He did it, so that the people of Israel might not go on gazing at the
features of the old order, which was passing away.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But in spite of that, dullness has crept over their senses, and to
this day the reading of the old law is muffled with the same veil; no
revelation tells them that it has been abrogated in Christ.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` To this day, I say, when the law of Moses is read out, a veil hangs
over their hearts.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` There must be a turning to the Lord first, and then the veil will
be taken away.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The Spirit we have been speaking of is the Lord; and where the
Lord’s Spirit is, there is freedom.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It is given to us, all alike, to catch the glory of the Lord as in
a mirror, with faces unveiled; and so we become transfigured into the
same likeness, borrowing glory from that glory, as the Spirit of the
Lord enables us.✻

Notas de rodapé:
3:2-3 - Paul praises the Corinthians as living epistles of Christ,
known and read by all. Their spiritual transformation is visible and
3:4-6 - Paul speaks of the confidence we have before God, not because
we are sufficient, but because God empowers us through the Spirit.
Grace is the foundation of Christian ministry, which is based not on
3:7-11 - Paul contrasts the old covenant, which brought death, with the
new covenant in Christ, which brings life and glory. The superiority of
the new covenant is evidenced by the abiding and effective Spirit (see
03:18 - As we behold the glory of Christ, we are transformed from glory
to glory, reflecting the image of God. Sanctification is an ongoing
process in the believer's life, driven by the Spirit's action (see also
