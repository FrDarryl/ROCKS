"1" = ''':sup:`1` After this, Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in
Judaea, because the Jews had designs on his life.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And now one of the Jewish feasts, the feast of Tabernacles, was
drawing near.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And his brethren said to him, This is no place for thee; go to
Judaea, so that thy disciples also may see thy doings.✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Nobody is content to act in secret, if he wishes to make himself
known at large; if thou must needs act thus, shew thyself before the
world.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For even his brethren were without faith in him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Whereupon Jesus said to them, My opportunity has not come yet. Your
opportunity is always ready to hand;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` the world cannot be expected to hate you, but it does hate me,
because I denounce it for its evil doings.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` It is for you to go up for the feast; I am not going up for the
feast, because for me the time is not ripe yet.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And, saying so much to them, he stayed behind in Galilee.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But afterwards, when his brethren had gone up for the feast, he too
went up, not publicly, but as if he would keep himself hidden.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and asked, Where can he
be?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Among the crowd, there was much whispering about him; some said, He
is a good man; No, said others, he leads the multitude astray.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But, for fear of the Jews, nobody dared to speak of him openly.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And it was not till the feast was half over that Jesus went up into
the temple, and began to teach there.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The Jews were astonished; How does this man know how to read? they
asked; he has never studied.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Jesus answered, The learning which I impart is not my own, it comes
from him who sent me.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Anyone who is prepared to do his will, can tell for himself whether
such learning comes from God, or whether I am delivering a message of
my own.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The man who delivers a message of his own seeks to win credit for
himself; when a man seeks to win credit for one who sent him, he tells
the truth, there is no dishonesty in him.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Moses, for example; was it not Moses that gave you the law? And yet
none of you keeps the law.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Why do you design to kill me? The multitude answered, Thou art
possessed; who has a design to kill thee?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Jesus answered them, There is one action of mine which has
astounded you all.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Listen to this; because Moses prescribed circumcision for you (not
that it comes from Moses, it comes from the patriarchs), you are ready
to circumcise a man on the sabbath day;✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and if a man receives circumcision on the sabbath, so that the law
of Moses may not be broken, have you any right to be indignant with me,
for restoring a man’s whole strength to him on the sabbath?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Be honest in your judgements, instead of judging by appearances.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` At this, some of those who belonged to Jerusalem began to ask, Is
not this the man they design to put to death?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Yet here he is, speaking publicly, and they have nothing to say to
him. Can the rulers have made up their minds in earnest, that this is
the Christ?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But then, we know this man’s origins; when Christ appears, no one
is to know whence he comes.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Whereupon Jesus cried aloud as he taught in the temple, You know
me, and you know whence I come; but I have not come on my own errand, I
was sent by one who has a right to send; and him you do not know.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` I know him, because I come from him; it was he who sent me.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And now they were ready to seize him; but none of them laid hands
on him; his time had not yet come.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And indeed, among the multitude there were many who learned to
believe in him; they said, Can the Christ be expected to do more
miracles at his coming than this man has done?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The Pharisees were told of these whispers about him among the
multitude; and both chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest
him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then Jesus said, For a little while I am still with you, and then I
am to go back to him who sent me.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` You will look for me, but you will not be able to find me; you
cannot reach the place where I am.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Whereupon the Jews said among themselves, Where can he mean to
journey, that we should not be able to find him? Will he go to the Jews
who are scattered about the Gentile world, and teach the Gentiles?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` What can it mean, this saying of his, You will look for me, but you
will not be able to find me; you cannot reach the place where I am?
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` On the last and greatest day of the feast Jesus stood there and
cried aloud, If any man is thirsty, let him come to me, and drink;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` yes, if a man believes in me, as the scripture says, Fountains of
living water shall flow from his bosom.✻
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` He was speaking here of the Spirit, which was to be received by
those who learned to believe in him; the Spirit which had not yet been
given to men, because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Some of the multitude, on hearing these words, said, Beyond doubt,
this is the prophet.✻
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Others said, This is the Christ; and others again, Is the Christ,
then, to come from Galilee?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Has not the scripture told us that Christ is to come from the
family of David, and from the village of Bethlehem, where David lived?✻
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Thus there was a division of opinion about him among the multitude;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` some of them would have seized him by violence, but no one laid
hands on him.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Meanwhile the officers had gone back to the chief priests and
Pharisees, who asked them, Why have you not brought him here?
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` The officers answered, Nobody has ever spoken as this man speaks.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And the Pharisees answered, Have you, too, let yourselves be
deceived?
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Have any of the rulers come to believe in him yet, or of the
Pharisees?
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` As for these common folk who have no knowledge of the law, a curse
is on them.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Here Nicodemus, the same man who came to Jesus by night, who was
one of their number, asked,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Is it the way of our law to judge a man without giving him a
hearing first, and finding out what he is about?
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` They answered him, Art thou, too, from Galilee? Look in the
scriptures; thou wilt find that Galilee does not breed prophets.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` And they went back, each to his own home.
