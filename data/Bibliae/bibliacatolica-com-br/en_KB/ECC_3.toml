3:1-8 - The Preacher presents a famous poem about time, asserting that
there is a time for everything under heaven. Life is composed of
seasons, and each event is under God's sovereignty, illustrating divine
17:26).
3:9-11 - Although man is aware of time and eternity, he cannot grasp

3:12-13 - The Preacher affirms that the best thing a human being can do

3:14-15 - What God does is eternal and unchanging. Everything that

God's plan. This highlights divine sovereignty and the reverence we

3:16-17 - The Preacher reflects on the injustice and evil in the world,

ultimate justice is certain, even if it is not currently visible (see
