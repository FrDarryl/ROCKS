"1" = ''':sup:`1` Their next encampment was in the plains of Moab, on the further side
of Jordan opposite Jericho.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But there was one man that took note of all this, Balac the son of
Sephor. He saw how the sons of Israel had defeated the Amorrhites,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` how they had struck terror into Moab, and could not be halted in
their advance.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And he said to the Madianite chiefs, Here is a people that will make
short work of all our neighbours, as easily as an ox tears up grass by
the roots. It was in Moab that Balac himself bore rule at this time.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he sent envoys to Balaam son of Beor, the soothsayer who dwelt on
the Ammonite border, desiring his presence. Here is a people on the
march from Egypt, he said, whose hosts darken the face of earth, and
they are encamped at my doors;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` come and lay thy curse on them, or they are too strong for me. I
would fain overthrow them, drive them out of my country; and I know
well that a blessing falls where thou dost bless, a curse where thou
dost curse.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So the elders of Moab, chiefs of the Madianite country, set out with
gifts in their hands to fee the soothsayer. When they reached Balaam,
and gave him Balac’s message,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he bade them stay there for the night, so that he might answer as
the Lord should direct him. To this they consented; and when God came
to Balaam and asked him,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What is their errand, these guests of thine?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` he answered, They have brought me a message from Balac, son of
Sephor.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He says a people has marched there from Egypt, whose hosts darken
the face of earth, and he would have me come and lay my ban on them, so
that he can make war on them and drive them out of his country.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Do not go with them, the Lord said to Balaam; do not lay thy curse
on the people, for a blessing goes with them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So when he rose next morning he bade the chiefs go back to their
own country; the Lord would not allow him to accompany them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when these returned and told Balac how Balaam had refused to
come with them,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` he sent other chiefs, more in number and greater in rank than those
whom he had sent first.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the message these brought with them to Balaam in the name of
Balac son of Sephor was this; Come to me with all speed;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I am ready to grant thee honours and whatever else thou wouldst
have, if thou wilt only come and lay thy ban on this people.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But Balaam told them, Though Balac should fill his house with
silver and gold and offer to give it me, I have no power to go beyond
the Lord’s bidding by a word great or small.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Be pleased to lodge with me to-night, and wait to hear what answer
the Lord will give me this time.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And that night the Lord came to Balaam and said, If they are here
to summon thee, rise and go with them, but do ever what I bid thee.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Balaam arose in the morning, he saddled his ass and set out in
their company.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But now God was angry at his going.✻ There rode Balaam on his ass,
with two servants attending him, when all at once an angel of the Lord
stood in his path to prevent him.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the ass, seeing an angel standing there with drawn sword, edged
away from the road and took to the open fields, so that Balaam must
needs beat her, to force her into the path again.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Next, the angel stood in a narrow entry between two vineyard walls;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and at the sight of him the ass cowered close against one of the
walls, crushing her rider’s foot, and he must beat her forward again.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But still the angel of the Lord would have his way; he moved on to
a narrow defile, where there was no room to pass right or left, and
stood there to intercept them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And now the ass, seeing him standing there, lay down under her
rider; so that Balaam fell into a rage, and beat her flanks harder than
ever.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Hereupon the Lord endowed the ass with the power of speech, and she
said, This is the third time thou hast beaten me; what have I done to
deserve it?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Thou hast deserved it, answered Balaam, by playing me false; if I
had but a sword in my hand, I would kill thee.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Why, said the ass, am I not thy own beast, that thou hast ridden
these years past? And did I ever play thee such a trick before? Never,
said he;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and with that the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, to make him see the
angel standing there with drawn sword, and he fell to the ground in
worship.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` How comes it, asked the angel, that thou hast thrice beaten thy
ass? I came to intercept thee, because this errand of thine is
headstrong and defies my will;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` if the ass had not turned aside, yielding to my ban, I would have
taken thy life and spared hers.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` I have been at fault, said Balaam, little thinking that thou wert
standing in my way; if thou art displeased with my errand, I will go
home again.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` No, said the angel, go with them, but be sure thou utterest no word
save what I bid thee. So he went on with the chiefs;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and at the news of his coming Balac went out to meet him, at a town
where Arnon marks the furthest boundaries of Moab.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` I sent messengers to summon thee, he said to Balaam; why didst thou
not come to me there and then? Didst thou think I had not the means to
reward thee for thy pains?
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And Balaam answered, I have come, as thou seest; but with no
message for thee save what the Lord puts on my lips.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So together they made their way to this city on the frontier of
Balac’s dominions.✻
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Here he sacrificed oxen and sheep, sending a portion to Balaam and
to the chiefs who had accompanied him;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` and when morning came, he took him up to the Hill of Baal, whence
he could see the furthest outposts of Israel.

Notas de rodapé:
22:1-4 - Moab fears Israel because of their victories over Sihon and
Og. This fear leads Balak, king of Moab, to seek a curse against
Israel. The narrative illustrates how God's favor on His people strikes
2:9-11).
22:5-6 - Balak sends messengers to Balaam, asking him to curse Israel.
This demonstrates his belief in the efficacy of prophetic words in
determining a nation's fate, though the ultimate power belongs to God
22:12 - God commands Balaam not to curse Israel, for they are blessed.
This verse reaffirms God's promise of blessing to Abraham and his
descendants, showing that no one can undo what God blesses (see also
22:21-23 - On the road to Moab, the angel of the Lord blocks Balaam's
path. Balaam's spiritual blindness, in contrast to the donkey's vision,
22:31-35 - Balaam finally sees the angel of the Lord and repents. God's
message is clear: Balaam can only speak what God commands. This
highlights God's sovereignty over the words and actions of the prophets
