"1" = ''':sup:`1` Jesus appeared to his disciples again afterwards, at the sea of
Tiberias, and this is how he appeared to them.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Simon Peter was there, and with him were Thomas, who is also called
Didymus, and Nathanael, from Cana of Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee,
and two more of his disciples.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Simon Peter told them, I am going out fishing; and they said, We,
too, will go with thee. So they went out and embarked on the boat, and
all that night they caught nothing.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But when morning came, there was Jesus standing on the shore; only
the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Have you caught anything, friends, Jesus asked them, to season your
bread with? And when they answered No,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` he said to them, Cast to the right of the boat, and you will have a
catch. So they cast the net, and found before long they had no strength
to haul it in, such a shoal of fish was in it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Whereupon the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the
Lord. And Simon Peter, hearing him say that it was the Lord, girded up
the fisherman’s coat, which was all he wore, and sprang into the sea.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The other disciples followed in the boat (they were not far from
land, only some hundred yards away), dragging their catch in the net
behind them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So they went ashore, and found a charcoal fire made there, with fish
and bread cooking on it.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Bring some of the fish you have just caught, Jesus said to them:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and Simon Peter, going on board, hauled in the net to land. It was
loaded with great fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and with all
that number the net had not broken.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When Jesus said to them, Come and break your fast, none of the
disciples ventured to ask him, Who art thou? knowing well that it was
the Lord.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Jesus came up and took bread, which he gave to them, and fish as
well.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thus Jesus appeared to his disciples a third time after his rising
from the dead.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And when they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
John, dost thou care for me more than these others? Yes, Lord, he told
him, thou knowest well that I love thee. And he said to him, Feed my
lambs.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And again, a second time, he asked him, Simon, son of John, dost
thou care for me? Yes, Lord, he told him, thou knowest well that I love
thee. He said to him, Tend my shearlings.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then he asked him a third question, Simon, son of John, dost thou
love me? Peter was deeply moved when he was asked a third time, Dost
thou love me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou
canst tell that I love thee. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Believe me when I tell thee this; as a young man, thou wouldst gird
thyself and walk where thou hadst the will to go, but when thou hast
grown old, thou wilt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird
thee, and carry thee where thou goest, not of thy own will.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So much he told him, prophesying the death by which he was to
glorify God; and with that he said to him, Follow me.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Peter turned, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following him;
the same who leaned back on his breast at supper, and asked, Who is it
that is to betray thee?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Seeing him, Peter asked Jesus, And what of this man, Lord?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Jesus said to him, If it is my will that he should wait till I
come, what is it to thee? Do thou follow me.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` That was why the story went round among the brethren that this
disciple was not to die. But Jesus did not say, He is not to die; he
said, If it is my will that he should wait till I come, what is it to
thee?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` It is the same disciple that bears witness of all this and has
written the story of it; and we know well that his witness is truthful.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` There is much else besides that Jesus did; if all of it were put in
writing, I do not think the world itself would contain the books which
would have to be written.

Notas de rodapé:
21:1-14 - Jesus appears to the disciples by the sea and performs the
miracle of the miraculous catch of fish. This episode reflects the
continuity of Christ's mission and the call for the Church to be
fishers of men, bringing souls into the Kingdom of God (see also

after his denial. This dialogue highlights the importance of repentance
and restoration in the Christian life. Jesus commissions Peter to
shepherd His sheep, symbolizing the pastoral care of the Church (see
21:18-19 - Jesus predicts Peter's martyrdom, showing that following Him
involves suffering for Him. Faithfulness to Christ may require
sacrifice, but it is accompanied by the promise of eternal glory (see
21:20-23 - Peter questions John's future, and Jesus instructs him to
focus on his own mission. This episode reminds us that comparing
ourselves to others should not be the focus of the Christian life; each

testimony and concludes that there is much more to be said about Jesus'
actions. The chapter highlights the immeasurable depth of Christ's life
