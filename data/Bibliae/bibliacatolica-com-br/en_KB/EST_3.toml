Agagite, Aman the son of Amadathi, bidding him take precedence of all
his other nobles.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And all the royal attendants at the palace gates must bow the knee
and do Aman reverence, such were their orders. But Mardochaeus went his
own way, and would neither bow nor bend.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Often the king’s men asked him at the palace doors why he thus
defied the royal bidding,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` but still he gave them no heed, till at last they told Aman of it.
Would he still be so stiff in his opinions? They had learned from him
by now that he was a Jew.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Aman, when he heard their story, and proved the truth of it for
himself, that Mardochaeus would neither bow nor bend,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` fell into a great passion of rage; and, hearing that he was a Jew,
he would not be content with laying hands on Mardochaeus only; the
whole race, throughout all Assuerus’ dominions, should be brought to
ruin for it.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` It was in the twelfth year of the reign, in Nisan, the first month
of it, that the lot (which the Hebrews call Pur) was cast into the urn
in Aman’s presence, to determine the day and month when he would make
an end of the Jews; and the month chosen was the twelfth month, Adar.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` So now Aman said to king Assuerus, There is a race spread here and

defiance of the royal decrees; judge whether it consorts with thy royal
dignity that licence should embolden them.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Be it thy pleasure to decree their destruction, and I promise thee
an increase of ten thousand talents to thy revenue.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` There and then Assuerus took off the ring he wore on his hand, and
gave it to the Agagite Aman, son of Amadathi, the Jews’ enemy;

for the people, do what thou wilt with them.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` So, on the thirteenth day of that month, Nisan, the royal
secretaries were summoned, and a decree was made in Aman’s sense.
Governor and chieftain must receive a letter, each in the language and
the characters of his own province or tribe, sent in the name of king
Assuerus and sealed with his royal seal.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` All through his dominions the couriers went out on their errand,
bearing death and ruin to all the Jews, to young and old, to women and
little children with the rest. The day fixed for their massacre and the
seizing of their goods was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
Adar.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` The tenour of the letter, sent out to warn all the provinces and
have them in readiness for the stated day, was this …✻
