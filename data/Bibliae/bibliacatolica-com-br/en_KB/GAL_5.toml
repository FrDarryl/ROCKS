"1" = ''':sup:`1` Stand fast, and do not let yourselves be caught again in the yoke of
slavery.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The word of Paul is your warrant for this; if you are for being
circumcised, Christ is of no value to you at all.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Once again I would warn anyone who is accepting circumcision that he
thereby engages himself to keep all the precepts of the law.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` You who look to the law for your justification have cancelled your
bond with Christ, you have forfeited grace.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All our hope of justification lies in the spirit; it rests on our
faith;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` once we are in Christ, circumcision means nothing, and the want of
it means nothing; the faith that finds its expression in love is all
that matters.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Till now, you had been shaping your course well; who is it that has
come between you and your loyalty to the truth?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Not he who called you; this pressure comes from elsewhere.✻

"9" = ''':sup:`9` It takes but a little leaven to leaven the whole batch.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` I am fully confident in the Lord that you will be of the same mind
with me, leaving the disturbers of your peace, be they who they may, to
answer for it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` As for myself, brethren, if it is true that I preach the need of
circumcision, why am I persecuted? If I did, the preaching of the cross
would no longer give offence.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I would rather they should lose their own manhood, these authors of
your unrest.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Yes, brethren, freedom claimed you when you were called. Only, do
not let this freedom give a foothold to corrupt nature; you must be
servants still, serving one another in a spirit of charity.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` After all, the whole of the law is summed up in one phrase, Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` if you are always backbiting and worrying each other, it is to be
feared you will wear each other out in the end.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Let me say this; learn to live and move in the spirit; then there
is no danger of your giving way to the impulses of corrupt nature.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The impulses of nature and the impulses of the spirit are at war
with one another; either is clean contrary to the other, and that is
why you cannot do all that your will approves.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It is by letting the spirit lead you that you free yourselves from
the yoke of the law.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` It is easy to see what effects proceed from corrupt nature; they
are such things as adultery, impurity, incontinence, luxury,

anger, rivalries, dissensions, factions,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` spite, murder, drunkenness, and debauchery. I warn you, as I have
warned you before, that those who live in such a way will not inherit
God’s kingdom.

kindness, generosity, forbearance,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` gentleness, faith, courtesy, temperateness, purity.✻ No law can
touch lives such as these;

"24" = ''':sup:`24` those who belong to Christ have crucified nature, with all its
passions, all its impulses.

Notas de rodapé:
5:1 - Freedom in Christ is the key to the Christian life, and Paul
exhorts the Galatians to stand firm in this freedom, without submitting
again to the yoke of slavery. Freedom is central to the gospel (see
5:13-15 - Paul teaches that Christian freedom should be used to serve
others with love. Love is the fulfillment of the law, and true freedom
22:39).
5:16-18 - Paul exhorts Christians to live by the Spirit and not by the
flesh. Life in the Spirit is a constant struggle against the desires of
the flesh, but it enables us to live according to God's will (see also
5:22-23 - The fruit of the Spirit is a contrast to the works of the
flesh, showing that a life in Christ results in virtues such as love,
peace, and kindness. These fruits reflect the inner transformation
5:24-26 - Paul teaches that those who belong to Christ have crucified
the flesh and now live by the Spirit. True freedom in Christ is a life
