Notas de rodapé:
3:1-3 - God announces the removal of leaders and essential sources of
support from Jerusalem and Judah as punishment for corruption. The
absence of righteous leaders leads to disorder and moral decay (see
3:8-9 - Jerusalem's sin is evident to all, as the people display their
pride and contempt for God's law. This open display of wickedness
1:32).
3:10-11 - Isaiah differentiates the fate of the righteous and the
wicked. While the righteous receive reward, the wicked face ruin,
3:16-17 - God warns the women of Jerusalem who pride themselves on
their beauty and wealth, symbolizing the vanity and materialism that
3:24-26 - Punishment will bring shame and loss. Instead of beauty and
pride, there will be dishonor and suffering, highlighting the
18:7-8).
