"1" = ''':sup:`1` Brethren and fathers, listen to the defence I am putting before you.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` (And now they gave him even better audience, finding that he spoke
to them in Hebrew.)
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia and brought up in this city; I
was trained, under Gamaliel, in exact knowledge of our ancestral law,
as jealous for the honour of the law as you are, all of you, to-day.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I persecuted this way to the death, putting men and women in chains
and handing them over to the prisons.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The chief priests and all the elders will bear me out in that; it
was from them that I was carrying letters to their brethren, when I was
on my way to Damascus, to make fresh prisoners there and bring them to
Jerusalem for punishment.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` While I was on my journey, not far from Damascus, about midday, this
befell me; all at once a great light from heaven shone about me,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul,
Saul, why dost thou persecute me?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Who art thou, Lord? I answered. And he said to me, I am Jesus of
Nazareth, whom Saul persecutes.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` My companions saw the light, but could not catch the voice of him
who spoke to me.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then I said, What must I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise
up, and go into Damascus; there thou shalt be told of all the work that
is destined for thee.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The glory of that light had blinded me, and my companions were
leading me by the hand when I came into Damascus.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` There a certain Ananias, a man well known among his Jewish
neighbours for his pious observance of the law,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` came and stood beside me, and said, Brother Saul, look up and see.
And at that instant I looked up into his face.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then he said to me, The God of our fathers has made choice of thee
to know his will, to have sight of him who is Just, and hear speech
from his lips;✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and what thou hast seen and heard, thou shalt testify before all
men.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Come then, why art thou wasting time? Rise up, and receive baptism,
washing away thy sins at the invocation of his name.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Afterwards, when I had gone back to Jerusalem, and was at prayer in
the temple, I fell into a trance,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and saw the Lord there speaking to me; Make haste, he said, leave
Jerusalem with all speed; they will not accept thy witness of me here.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But, Lord, I said, it is within their own knowledge, how I used to
imprison those who believed in thee, and scourge them in the
synagogues;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and when the blood of Stephen, thy martyr, was shed, I too stood by
and gave my consent, and watched over the garments of those who slew
him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And he said to me, Go on thy way; I mean to send thee on a distant
errand, to the Gentiles.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Up to this point, they listened to his speech; but then they cried
aloud, Away with such a fellow from the earth; it is a disgrace that he
should live.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So, when he saw them raising shouts and throwing down their
garments and flinging dust into the air,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` the captain had Paul taken into the soldiers’ quarters, telling
them to examine him under the lash; thus he would find out the cause of
the outcry against him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And they had already tied Paul down with thongs, when he said to
the centurion who was in charge, Have you the right to scourge a man,
when he is a Roman citizen, and has not been sentenced?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The centurion, as soon as he heard this, went to the captain and
told him of it, What art thou about? he said. This man is a Roman
citizen.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So the captain came and asked him, What is this? Thou art a Roman
citizen? Yes, he said.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Why, answered the captain, it cost me a heavy sum to win this
privilege. Ah, said Paul, but I am a citizen by birth.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Upon this, the men who were to have put him to the question moved
away from him; and the captain himself was alarmed, to find out that
this was a Roman citizen, and he had put him in bonds.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So, the next day, determined to discover the truth about the charge
the Jews were bringing against him, he released him, summoned a meeting
of the chief priests and the whole Council, and brought Paul down to
confront them with him.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
22:1-21 - Paul defends his faith before the people, recounting his
conversion and mission. This discourse highlights the transformative
22:22-29 - Paul reveals his Roman citizenship to avoid being illegally
flogged, showing the importance of asserting civil rights for the
16:37).
