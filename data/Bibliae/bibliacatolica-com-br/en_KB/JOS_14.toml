Nun to divide up Chanaan itself between the clan chieftains of Israel.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` The division was made by lot, in pursuance of the command the Lord
gave through Moses, among the nine and a half tribes that remained.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` (Two and a half had been allotted their portions by Moses, on the
further side of Jordan; the nine and a half did not include the
Levites, since these were not to own territory like their brethren,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` but must be content with cities to live in and pasture for their
beasts around them. Meanwhile, the division of Joseph’s posterity into
two tribes, Ephraim and Manasses, made up the full number.)

"5" = ''':sup:`5` The Israelites, then, set about the task of dividing up the land, as
the Lord through Moses had bidden them.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Moses promised me that day, Thou, who hast taken the part of the
Lord my God, shalt live to have a portion in the very land thou hast
traversed, and leave it to thy race in perpetuity.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` The Lord has made good his promise, and life is still mine. That
word was spoken to Moses forty-five years since, when Israel began its
wanderings up and down the desert, and now, a man eighty-five years
old,

"11" = ''':sup:`11` I am as vigorous as I was when I went on that errand; in battle or
on the march, the strength of old days is still with me.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Give me, now, that hill-country which the Lord promised me in thy
own hearing; there are Enacim living on it,✻ in strong, walled cities,
and I would fain see if I cannot drive them out, with the Lord at my
side, and claim his promise.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Josue blessed him, and gave him Hebron for his portion;
