when Moses and Aaron had led their armies out of Egypt.

now here, now there, at the Lord’s bidding.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They set out from Ramesses on the fifteenth day of the first month,
the second day of the paschal feast, in full sight of the Egyptians,
who must perforce let them go.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And indeed these had enough to do burying their first-born, whom the
Lord had smitten when he took vengeance on the powers of Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Their first encampment was at Socoth,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and from Socoth they marched to Etham, on the verge of the desert;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and from there they marched along past Phihahiroth, which is
opposite Beelsephon, and encamped by Magdalus.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` From Phihahiroth they went across through the heart of the sea into
the wilderness, and after three days’ march in the desert of Etham,
halted at Mara.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` From Mara they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and
seventy palm-trees, and pitched their tents there.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When they left it, they encamped by the Red Sea, and from the Red
Sea
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` they moved their camp to the desert of Sin,

"12" = ''':sup:`12` from the desert of Sin to Daphca,

'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` thence to Raphidim, where the people could not find enough water to
drink.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then from Raphidim to the desert of Sinai,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` thence to the Graves of Greed,

'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` thence to the desert of Sin, that is, to Cades.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` It was after they had left Cades that they encamped on mount Hor,
at the verge of the Edomite territory;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and now, at the Lord’s command, the high priest Aaron went up to
the top of mount Hor and died there. This was on the first day of the
fifth month of the fortieth year since the Israelites left Egypt,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` and Aaron had now reached the age of a hundred and twenty-three.

'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` their camp stretching across the whole Moabite plain from
Bethsimoth to Abelsatim.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And here the Lord spoke to Moses
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` giving him a message for the Israelites: When you have crossed
Jordan, and find yourselves in the land of Chanaan,
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` you must destroy all its inhabitants, break down their pillars,
shatter their idols, devastate their mountain shrines.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` The land must be swept clean before you settle in it. Here it is
that I mean to give you your home,
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` which you will divide up by lot, wide lands for the many, a narrow
strip for the few, each clan and each household receiving such portion
as the lot has assigned to it.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` If you refuse to root out the nations that now live there, those
who are left will be eyesores to you, barbs in your side, to dispute
with you the land that is yours;✻
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` and meanwhile, I will plague you with the plagues that should have
been theirs.

Notas de rodapé:
33:1-4 - Moses records all of Israel's journeys from Egypt, showing
God's faithfulness in guiding them through the wilderness. This account
reinforces the theme of divine providence and God's care throughout
33:5-15 - Israel's stops are listed in detail, from Rameses to Mount
Sinai, where God gave the Law. This demonstrates how each stage of
Israel's journey was significant in God's plan of redemption (see also
33:16-37 - Israel's continuation of stops, including places of hardship
like Kadesh, highlights how God led His people through trials. These
journeys reinforce the need for trust in God even in challenging times
33:38-39 - Aaron's death is mentioned, reminding Israel of the
transience of life and the continuity of God's plan even in the face of
the loss of leaders. Aaron's story serves as a reminder that God raises
up new leaders to fulfill His purposes (see also Deuteronomy 34:5-9 and
33:50-56 - God instructs Israel to drive out the inhabitants of Canaan
and destroy their idols upon entering the promised land. This
underscores the importance of spiritual purity and turning away from
idolatry to ensure God's blessing (see also Deuteronomy 7:1-5 and
