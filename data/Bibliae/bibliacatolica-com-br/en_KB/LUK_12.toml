"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now great multitudes had gathered round him, so that they trod
one another down; and he addressed himself first to his disciples; Have
nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees, he said, it is all
hypocrisy.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` What is veiled will all be revealed, what is hidden will all be
known;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` what you have said in darkness, will be repeated in the light of
day, what you have whispered in secret chambers, will be proclaimed on
the house-tops.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And I say this to you who are my friends, Do not be afraid of those
who can kill the body, and after that can do no more.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I will tell you who it is you must fear; fear him who has power not
only to kill but to cast a man into hell; him you must fear indeed.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Are not sparrows sold five for two pence? And yet not one of them is
forgotten in God’s sight.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` As for you, he takes every hair of your head into his reckoning; do
not be afraid, then; you count for more than a host of sparrows.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And I tell you this; whoever acknowledges me before men, will be
acknowledged by the Son of Man in the presence of God’s angels;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` he who disowns me before men, will be disowned before God’s angels.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` There is no one who speaks a word against the Son of Man but may
find forgiveness; there will be no forgiveness for the man who
blasphemes against the Holy Spirit.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When they bring you to trial before synagogues, and magistrates,
and officers, do not consider anxiously what you are to say, what
defence to make or how to make it;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` the Holy Spirit will instruct you when the time comes, what words
to use.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` One of the multitude said to him, Master, bid my brother give me a
share of our inheritance.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he answered, Why, man, who has appointed me a judge to make
awards between you?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then he said to them, Look well and keep yourselves clear of all
covetousness. A man’s life does not consist in having more possessions
than he needs.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he told them a parable, There was a rich man whose lands
yielded a heavy crop:
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and he debated in his mind, What am I to do, with no room to store
my crops in?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then he said, This is what I will do; I will pull down my barns,
and build greater ones, and there I shall be able to store all my
harvest and all the goods that are mine;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and then I will say to my soul, Come, soul, thou hast goods in
plenty laid up for many years to come; take thy rest now, eat, drink,
and make merry.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And God said, Thou fool, this night thou must render up thy soul;
and who will be master now of all thou hast laid by?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thus it is with the man who lays up treasure for himself, and has
no credit with God.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he said to his disciples, I say to you, then, do not fret over
your life, how to support it with food, over your body, how to keep it
clothed.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Life is a greater gift than food, the body than clothing;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` see how the ravens never sow or reap, have neither storehouse nor
barn, and yet God feeds them; have you not an excellence far beyond
theirs?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Can any of you, for all his fretting, add a cubit’s growth to his
height?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And if you are powerless to do so small a thing, why do you fret
about your other needs?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` See how the lilies grow; they do not toil, or spin, and yet I tell
you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` If God, then, so clothes the grasses which live to-day in the
fields and will feed the oven to-morrow, will he not be much more ready
to clothe you, men of little faith?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` You should not be asking, then, what you are to eat or drink, and
living in suspense of mind;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` it is for the heathen world to busy itself over such things; your
Father knows well that you need them.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` No, make it your first care to find the kingdom of God, and all
these things shall be yours without the asking.✻
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Do not be afraid, you, my little flock. Your Father has determined
to give you his kingdom.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Sell what you have, and give alms, so providing yourselves with a
purse that time cannot wear holes in, an inexhaustible treasure laid up
in heaven, where no thief comes near, no moth consumes.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Where your treasure-house is, there your heart is too.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Your loins must be girt, and your lamps burning,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and you yourselves like men awaiting their master’s return from a
wedding feast, so that they may open to him at once when he comes and
knocks at the door.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Blessed are those servants, whom their master will find watching
when he comes; I promise you, he will gird himself, and make them sit
down to meat, and minister to them.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Whether he comes in the second quarter of the night or in the
third, blessed are those servants if he finds them alert.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Be sure of this; if the master of the house had known at what time
the thief was coming, he would have kept watch, and not allowed his
house to be broken open.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` You too, then, must stand ready; the Son of Man will come at an
hour when you are not expecting him.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Hereupon Peter said to him, Lord, dost thou address this parable to
us, or to all men?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And the Lord answered, Who, then, is a faithful and wise steward,
one whom his master will entrust with the care of the household, to
give them their allowance of food at the appointed time?
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Blessed is that servant who is found doing this when his lord
comes;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` I promise you, he will give him charge of all his goods.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But if that servant says in his heart, My lord is long in coming,
and falls to beating the men and the maids, eating and drinking himself
drunk;
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` then on some day when he expects nothing, at an hour when he is all
unaware, his lord will come, and will cut him off, and assign him his
portion with the unfaithful.✻
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Yet it is the servant who knew his Lord’s will, and did not make
ready for him, or do his will, that will have many strokes of the lash;
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` he who did not know of it, yet earned a beating, will have only a
few. Much will be asked of the man to whom much has been given; more
will be expected of him, because he was entrusted with more.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` It is fire that I have come to spread over the earth, and what
better wish can I have than that it should be kindled?
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` There is a baptism I must needs be baptized with, and how impatient
am I for its accomplishment!
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Do you think that I have come to bring peace on the earth? No,
believe me, I have come to bring dissension.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Henceforward five in the same house will be found at variance,
three against two and two against three;
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` the father will be at variance with his son, and the son with his
father, the mother against her daughter, and the daughter against her
mother, the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.✻
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` And he said to the multitudes, When you find a cloud rising out of
the west, you say at once, There is rain coming, and so it does;
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` when you find the south-west wind blowing, you say, It will be hot,
and so it is.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` Poor fools, you know well enough how to interpret the face of land
and sky; can you not interpret the times you live in?✻
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` Does not your own experience teach you to make the right decision?✻
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` If one has a claim against thee, and thou art going with him to the
magistrate, then do thy utmost, while thou art still on the road, to be
quit of his claim; or it may be he will drag thee into the presence of
the judge, and the judge will hand thee over to his officer, and the
officer will cast thee into prison.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Be sure of this, thou wilt find no discharge from it until thou
hast paid the last farthing.
