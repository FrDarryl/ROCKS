"1" = ''':sup:`1` Find room among you for a man of over-delicate conscience, without
arguing about his scruples.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Another man can, in conscience, eat what he will; one who is
scrupulous must be content with vegetable fare.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Let not the first, over his meat, mock at him who does not eat it,
or the second, while he abstains, pass judgement on him who eats it.
God, after all, has found room for him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Who art thou, to pass judgement on the servant of another? Whether
he keeps his feet or falls,✻ concerns none but his master. And keep his
feet he will; God is well able to give him a sure footing.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` One man makes a distinction between this day and that; another
regards all days alike; let either rest fully content in his own
opinion.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He who observes the day, observes it in the Lord’s honour. Just so,
he who eats does so in the Lord’s honour; he gives thanks to God for
it; and he who abstains from eating abstains in the Lord’s honour, and
he too thanks God.

master.
'''

the dead and of the living.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` And who art thou, to pass judgement on thy brother? Who art thou,
to mock at thy brother? We shall all stand, one day, before the
judgement-seat of Christ;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` (so we read in scripture, As I live, says the Lord, there is no
knee but shall bend before me, no tongue but shall pay homage to God);✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and so each of us will have to give an account of himself before
God.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Let us cease, then, to lay down rules for one another, and make
this rule for ourselves instead, not to trip up or entangle a brother’s
conscience.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` This is my assurance, this is what my conscience tells me in the
name of our Lord Jesus, that there is nothing which is unclean in
itself; it is only when a man believes a thing to be unclean that it
becomes unclean for him.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And if thy brother’s peace of mind is disturbed over food, it is
because thou art neglecting to follow the rule of charity. Here is a
soul for which Christ died; it is not for thee to bring it to perdition
with the food thou eatest.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` We must not allow that which is a good thing for us to be brought
into disrepute.✻
'''

God, and the good opinion of our fellow men.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Let our aim, then, be peace, and strengthening one another’s faith.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` It is not for thee to destroy God’s work for the sake of a mouthful
of food. Nothing is unclean; yet it goes ill with the man who eats to
the hurt of his own conscience.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thou dost well if thou refusest to eat meat, or to drink wine, or
to do anything in which thy brother can find an occasion of sin, a
cause for scandal or scruple.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Thou hast a good conscience? Keep it a matter between thyself and
God; he is fortunate, who can make his own choice without
self-questioning.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He who hesitates, and eats none the less, is self-condemned; he
acts in bad conscience, and wherever there is bad conscience, there is
sin.✻
