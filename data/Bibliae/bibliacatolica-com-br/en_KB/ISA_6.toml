sitting on a throne that towered high above me, the skirts of his robe
filling the temple.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Above it rose the figures of the seraphim, each of them six-winged;
with two wings they veiled God’s face, with two his feet, and the other
two kept them poised in flight.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And ever the same cry passed between them, Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord God of hosts; all the earth is full of his glory.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The lintels over the doors rang with the sound of that cry, and
smoke went up, filling the temple courts.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Alas, said I, that I must needs keep silence;✻ my lips, and the lips
of all my countrymen, are polluted with sin; and yet these eyes have
looked upon their King, the Lord of hosts.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Whereupon one of the seraphim flew up to me, bearing a coal which he
