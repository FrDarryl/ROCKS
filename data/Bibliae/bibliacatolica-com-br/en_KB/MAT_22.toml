"1" = ''':sup:`1` And Jesus once more spoke to them in parables;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Here is an image, he said, of the kingdom of heaven; there was once
a king, who held a marriage-feast for his son,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and sent out his servants with a summons to all those whom he had
invited to the wedding; but they would not come.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then he sent other servants with a fresh summons, bidding them tell
those who had been invited, By this, I have prepared my feast, the oxen
have been killed, and the fatlings, all is ready now; come to the
wedding.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But still they paid no heed, and went off on other errands, one to
his farm in the country, and another to his trading;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and the rest laid hands upon his servants, and insulted and killed
them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The king fell into a rage when he heard of it, and sent out his
troops to put those murderers to death, and burn their city.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` After this, he said to his servants, Here is the marriage-feast all
ready, and those who had been invited have proved unworthy of it.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` You must go out to the street-corners, and invite all whom you find
there to the wedding.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And his servants went out into the streets, where they mustered all
they could find, rogues and honest men together; and so the wedding had
its full tale of guests.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But when the king came in to look at the company, he saw a man
there who had no wedding-garment on;✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` My friend, he said, how didst thou come to be here without a
wedding-garment? And he made no reply.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Whereupon the king said to his servants, Bind him hand and foot,
and cast him out into the darkness, where there shall be weeping, and
gnashing of teeth.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Many are called, but few are chosen.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` After this the Pharisees withdrew, and plotted together, to make
him betray himself in his talk.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And they sent their own disciples to him, with those who were of
Herod’s party, and said, Master, we know well that thou art sincere,
and teachest in all sincerity the way of God; that thou holdest no one
in awe, making no distinction between man and man;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` tell us, then, is it right to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Jesus saw their malice; Hypocrites, he said, why do you thus put me
to the test?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Shew me the coinage in which the tribute is paid. So they brought
him a silver piece,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and he asked them, Whose is this likeness? Whose name is inscribed
on it?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Caesar’s, they said; whereupon he answered, Why then, give back to
Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And they went away and left him in peace, full of admiration at his
words.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` On that day, too, he was approached with a question by the
Sadducees, men who say that there is no resurrection;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Master, they said, Moses told us, If a man leaves no children when
he dies, his brother shall marry the widow by right of kinship, and
beget children in the dead brother’s name.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` We had seven brothers once in our country, of whom the first died,
a married man without issue, bequeathing his wife to the second.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And the same befell the second brother, and then the third, and in
the end all seven,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` the woman dying last of all.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And now, when the dead rise again, which of the seven will be her
husband, since she was wife to them all?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus answered them, You are wrong; you do not understand the
scriptures, or what is the power of God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When the dead rise again, there is no marrying and giving in
marriage; they are as the angels in heaven are.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But now, in the matter of the resurrection, did you never read what
God himself said:
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob?✻ Yet it is of living men, not of dead men, that he is God.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` This the multitude heard, and were amazed by his teaching.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And now the Pharisees, hearing how he had put the Sadducees to
silence, met together;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and one of them, a lawyer, put a question to try him:
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Master, which commandment in the law is the greatest?
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole
heart and thy whole soul and thy whole mind.✻
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` This is the greatest of the commandments, and the first.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And the second, its like, is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.✻
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` On these two commandments, all the law and the prophets depend.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then, while the Pharisees were still gathered about him, Jesus
asked them:
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` What is your opinion concerning Christ? Whose son is he to be? They
told him, David’s.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` How is it then, said he, that David is moved by the Spirit to call
him Master, when he says:
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` The Lord said to my Master, Sit on my right hand while I make thy
enemies a footstool under thy feet?✻
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` David calls Christ his Master; how can he be also his son?
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` None could find a word to say in answer to him, nor did anyone
dare, after that day, to try him with further questions.✻

Notas de rodapé:
22:1-14 - The parable of the king's wedding feast illustrates the
rejection of many of God's invitation and the inclusion of others in
the Kingdom, emphasizing the need for proper spiritual clothing (see
22:15-22 - The question about paying taxes to Caesar tests Jesus'
loyalty to Roman authority. His answer, "Render to Caesar the things
that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," teaches about
22:23-33 - The question of the resurrection raises the doctrine of life
after death. Jesus reveals that in the resurrection, the righteous will
be like angels and that God is the God of the living, affirming the
Corinthians 15:42-44).
22:34-40 - The great commandment is love for God and neighbor. Jesus
summarizes the entire Law and the Prophets in these two commandments,
teaching that love is the foundation of all Christian practice (see
22:41-46 - Jesus questions the Pharisees about the identity of the
Messiah, emphasizing that He is David's Lord, pointing to His deity and
the religious leaders' confusion about His true role (see also
