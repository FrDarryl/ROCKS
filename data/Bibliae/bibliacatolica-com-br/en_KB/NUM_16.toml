"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now a conspiracy was made by Core son of Isaar, a Levite of
Caath’s family, with Dathan and Abiron, sons of Eliab, and Hon son of
Pheleth, a man of Ruben.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` These rose in rebellion against Moses, and there were two hundred
and fifty others, whose names stood high in the councils of the people,
that took part with them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And they confronted Moses and Aaron, making their protest thus: You
presume too much; are not all the Israelites men set apart? Does not
the Lord make his dwelling among all of us alike? We are the Lord’s
people; who are you that you should take command of us?✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` At hearing this, Moses cast himself down to earth.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` To Core, and to his faction, he said, Wait until to-morrow; then the
Lord will make it plain which of us he has set apart for himself, and
admit them to his presence. Those whom the Lord has chosen will find
access to him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Let this be the test; bring censers with you, Core and all you that
are of his faction,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and tomorrow, in the Lord’s presence, put incense on the lighted
coals in them; so the Lord will make his choice, and we shall know
which of us he has set apart; it is you, sons of Levi, that presume too
much.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he made this further answer to Core: Listen, men of Levi;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the people and
made you his own, to do him service in the tabernacle, and stand up,
with the eyes of the whole multitude upon you, as his ministers; does
not that content you?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` If he has given thee and all thy brother Levites access to himself,
must you needs claim the priesthood too?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Must thou and all thy company rebel against the Lord? Aaron, what
has he done that you should complain so loudly of him?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiron, sons of Eliab, to his
presence, but they refused to come.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What, they said, wouldst thou lord it over us now? When thou hast
brought us away from Egypt, a land that was milk and honey indeed, to
die here in the desert?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` No land of milk and honey for our journey’s end, no fields and
vineyards to enjoy; what more wilt thou ask of us? Wilt thou pluck out
our eyes too? No, we will not come.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` At this, Moses said to the Lord, in great anger, Spurn every gift
these men offer thee! Thou knowest that I have never robbed them of an
ass, or done them any harm.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then he said to Core, Present yourselves before the Lord to-morrow,
thou and the whole of thy company; you shall stand on one side, and
Aaron on the other.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Bring your censers with you, and you shall put incense on them
there; you with two hundred censers, and Aaron with his censer all
alone.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` There, on the morrow, Moses and Aaron stood, and those others did
as they were bidden,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and gathered the whole multitude to meet them at the tabernacle
door. And the glory of the Lord’s presence was revealed to them all.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But it was to Moses and Aaron that the Lord spoke;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Stand apart, he said, from all the concourse that surrounds you; I
mean to make an end of them here and now.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Whereupon they fell flat on the ground, crying out, God
all-powerful, Lord of every spirit that breathes, wilt thou take
vengeance on all for one man’s fault?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Bid all the rest of the people stand apart from the tents of Core,
Dathan, and Abiron.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Moses, rising to his feet, went over to where Dathan and Abiron
stood; with him were the elders of the people.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Withdraw, he told the multitude, from the tents of these rebels;
avoid the touch of anything that belongs to them, so that you may not
be involved in their guilt.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So they withdrew to this side and that, from the dwelling-places of
Core, Dathan and Abiron; and now Dathan and Abiron came out and stood
at their tent doors, with their wives and children and all their
households.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Here is proof, Moses said, whether it is at the Lord’s bidding I do
all you see me do, or prompted by my own spirit.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` If these men are left to undergo the common lot of mortality,
called to their account as others are called to their account, then
they are right; the Lord has given me no commission.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But if the Lord alters the order of nature, so that earth gapes and
swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they go down still living
to the depths beneath, then you will have proof that they have spoken
blasphemy against the Lord.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He had scarce done speaking, when the ground parted under their
feet,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` gaped open, and swallowed them up, with their tents and all that
was theirs.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Still living they went down to the depths beneath, and earth closed
over them, and their names were lost to the muster-roll of the people.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And now all the Israelites who stood round and heard the shrieks of
the dying fled away, in dread that they too would be swallowed up by
the earth;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` but not before the two hundred and fifty men who stood there
offering incense had perished by fire sent from heaven.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Bid Aaron’s son, the priest Eleazar, gather up the censers that lie
there among the flames, and scatter the coal in them this way and that.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` They are forfeit, now, through the death of these sinners;✻ he must
beat them out into plates, which he will nail to the altar. Incense has
been offered to the Lord in them, and they must be consecrated things,
a portent and a warning to every Israelite who sees them.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So the priest Eleazar took these brazen censers from the hands of
the dead men the fire had killed, and beat them into plates, which he
nailed to the altar,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` as a warning to the Israelites of after times. No interloper, that
is not of Aaron’s stock, must ever come forward to offer the Lord
incense, or he will suffer the fate of Core and his company, the fate
which the Lord, through Moses, foretold to them.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Next day, the men of Israel were enraged against Moses and Aaron,
for putting the Lord’s people to death.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` A conspiracy was formed, and the uproar grew fiercer,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` until Moses and Aaron took refuge in the tabernacle. As soon as
they entered it, the cloud overshadowed it, and the glory of the Lord’s
presence was revealed.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Withdraw yourselves from this multitude which surrounds you; I
mean, after all, to make an end of them. And as they lay there with
their faces to the ground,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Moses said to Aaron, Take thy censer, and put incense on the
lighted coals in it, and go with all speed to find the people and make
intercession for them; already the Lord has begun to wreak his
vengeance, and destruction rages among them.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Aaron obeyed, and ran into the midst of the throng where the fire
was already making havoc;✻ he offered incense
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` and made intercession for the people, standing there between the
dead and the living, and the divine vengeance ceased.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Already fourteen thousand seven hundred men had been smitten by it,
not counting those who perished in the rebellion of Core.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` But now the destruction was over, and Aaron went back to meet Moses
at the tabernacle door.

Notas de rodapé:
16:1-3 - Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebel against Moses and Aaron,
questioning their leadership. This rebellion reflects human
dissatisfaction and pride that opposes God's established authority (see
16:4-7 - Moses proposes a test to demonstrate whom God has chosen for
the priesthood, making it clear that the Lord is the one who
establishes spiritual leadership. This reinforces divine sovereignty in
5:4).
16:19-21 - God's glory appears to judge the rebels, underscoring God's
holiness and the gravity of rebellion. This shows that opposition to
16:31-33 - God judges Korah, Dathan, and Abiram by opening the earth to
swallow them, an act that serves as an example to the entire community
16:46-48 - Moses and Aaron intercede for the people, and Aaron offers
incense to stop the plague sent by God. This shows the importance of
intercession and the priesthood in God's plan of redemption (see also
