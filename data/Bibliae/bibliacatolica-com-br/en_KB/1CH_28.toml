mine and true lieges. I thought to have built a house, in which the ark

God’s feet should have their resting-place; and all that could be
prepared to that end, prepare I did.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But God warned me that it was not for me to build such a shrine for
his name; I was a war-maker and a shedder of blood.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yet, when he would grant Israel an abiding dynasty, it was on me,
alone of my father’s house, that his choice fell. Out of all the tribes
he has chosen Juda, out of all Juda my father’s house; and of all my
father’s sons, who but I was to be king of all Israel?

"7" = ''':sup:`7` let him ever observe decree and award of mine as they are observed
this day, and his dynasty shall endure for all time.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Let me speak, then, as in the presence of all Israel, with our own
God listening to us. Obey, all of you, the will of the Lord our God,
study, all of you, to learn it; then it shall be yours to enjoy this
fair land, and bequeath it to your posterity for ever.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And do thou, my son Solomon, acknowledge ever thy father’s God,
serving him faithfully, serving him willingly; no heart but is open to
the Lord’s scrutiny, no thought in our minds but he can read it. Search
for him, and thou shalt find him; forsake him, and he will for ever
reject thee.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Meanwhile, here is this house to be built, the Lord’s sanctuary; on
thee his choice has fallen; courage! To the task!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then David handed over to his son Solomon the full plan of porch
and temple, of store-house and parlour and inner chamber, of the throne
of mercy itself;

rooms in which the permanent treasures of the Lord’s house and the
votive offerings were to be laid up.

that had to be done, keep all that had to be kept, in the Lord’s

and silver;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` gold for the table on which the hallowed loaves were set forth,
gold and silver for every table of gold and silver.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Pure gold for fork and bowl and censer and cup; no cup of gold or
silver but had its due weight apportioned;✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` pure gold for the altar of incense, pure gold for the equipage of
cherubs that should spread their wings to overshadow the Lord’s ark.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This came to me, said he, with the Lord’s own sign-manual; all the
pattern he would make clear to me.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Play a man’s part, said David to Solomon; courage! To the task!
Never doubting, never daunted; the Lord thy God will be at thy side,
never failing thee, never forsaking thee, and see that thou hast
strength to do all that must be done for his temple.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Priest and Levite are there, ready to fulfil their appointed duties
in the Lord’s house; chieftains and common folk are all minded to do
thy bidding.
