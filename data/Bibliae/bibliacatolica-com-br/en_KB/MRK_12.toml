"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then he began to speak to them in parables; There was a man who
planted a vineyard, and put a wall round it, and dug a wine-press and
built a tower in it, and then let it out to some vine-dressers, while
he went on his travels.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And when the season came, he sent one of his servants on an errand
to the vine-dressers, to claim from the vine-dressers the revenue of
his vineyard.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Whereupon they took him and beat him, and sent him away
empty-handed.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then he sent another servant on a second errand to them, and him too
they beat over the head and used him outrageously.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He sent another, whom they killed; and many others, whom they beat
or killed at their pleasure.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He had still one messenger left, his own well-beloved son; him he
sent to them last of all; They will have reverence, he said, for my
son.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the vine-dressers said among themselves, This is the heir, come,
let us kill him, and then his inheritance will be ours.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And now, what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come, and
make an end of those vine-dressers, and give his vineyard to others.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Why, have you not read this passage in the scriptures, The very
stone which the builders rejected has become the chief stone at the
corner;✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This parable, they saw, was aimed at themselves, and they would
gladly have laid hands on him, but they were afraid of the multitude;
so they went away and left him alone.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then they sent some of the Pharisees to him, with those who were of
Herod’s party, to make him betray himself in his talk.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` These came and said to him, Master, we know that thou art sincere;
that thou holdest no one in awe, making no distinction between man and
man, but teachest in all sincerity the way of God. Is it right that
tribute should be paid to Caesar? Or should we refuse to pay it?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But he saw their treachery, and said to them, Why do you thus put
me to the test? Bring me a silver piece, and let me look at it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When they brought it, he asked them, Whose is this likeness? Whose
name is inscribed on it? Caesar’s, they said.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Whereupon Jesus answered them, Give back to Caesar what is
Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s. And they were lost in admiration of
him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then he was approached with a question by the Sadducees, men who
say that there is no resurrection:
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Master, they said, Moses prescribed for us that if a man’s brother
dies, leaving a widow behind him but no children, he, the brother,
should marry the widow, and beget children in the dead brother’s name.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` There were seven brethren; the first married a wife, and died
childless;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` the second married her, and he too left no children, and so with
the third;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` all seven married her, without having children, and the woman died
last of all.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And now, when the dead rise again, which of these will be her
husband, since she was wife to all seven?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Jesus answered them, Is not this where you are wrong, that you do
not understand the scriptures, or what is the power of God?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When the dead rise, there is no marrying or giving in marriage,
they are as the angels in heaven are.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But as for the dead rising again, have you never read in the book
of Moses how God spoke to him at the burning bush, and said, I am the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Yet it is of living men, not of dead men, that he is the God; you
are wrong, then, altogether.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` One of the scribes heard their dispute, and, finding that he
answered to the purpose, came up and asked him, Which is the first
commandment of all?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus answered him, The first commandment of all is, Listen,
Israel; there is no God but the Lord thy God;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with the love of thy whole
heart, and thy whole soul, and thy whole mind, and thy whole strength.✻
This is the first commandment,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and the second, its like, is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.✻ There is no other commandment greater than these.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And the scribe said to him, Truly, Master, thou hast answered well;
there is but one God, and no other beside him;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and if a man loves God with all his heart and all his soul and all
his understanding and all his strength, and his neighbour as himself,
that is a greater thing than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then Jesus, seeing how wisely he had answered, said to him, Thou
art not far from the kingdom of God. And after this, no one dared to
try him with further questions.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then Jesus said openly, still teaching in the temple, What do the
scribes mean by saying that Christ is to be the son of David?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` David himself was moved by the Holy Spirit to say, The Lord said to
my Master, Sit on my right hand while I make thy enemies a footstool
under thy feet.✻
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Thus David himself calls Christ his Master; how can he be also his
son? And the multitude at large listened to him readily.✻
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` This was part of the teaching he gave them, Beware of the scribes,
who enjoy walking in long robes, and having their hands kissed in the
market-place,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` and the first seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at
feasts;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` who swallow up the property of widows, under cover of their long
prayers; their sentence will be all the heavier for that.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` As he was sitting opposite the treasury of the temple, Jesus
watched the multitude throwing coins into the treasury, the many rich
with their many offerings;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and there was one poor widow, who came and put in two mites, which
make a farthing.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Thereupon he called his disciples to him, and said to them, Believe
me, this poor widow has put in more than all those others who have put
offerings into the treasury.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` The others all gave out of what they had to spare; she, with so
little to give, put in all that she had, her whole livelihood.✻

Notas de rodapé:
12:1-12 - The parable of the rejected vinedressers reveals the
religious leaders' rejection of the Son of God and the judgment that
will come upon them. Jesus stands as the cornerstone, and those who
12:13-17 - Jesus answers the question about taxes to Caesar by teaching
about the separation of civil and spiritual duties. He states that we
should render to Caesar what is Caesar's, but to God what is God's,
emphasizing the importance of living in obedience to both earthly and
12:18-27 - The discussion of the resurrection reveals God's power over
life and death. Jesus teaches that in the resurrection, there will be
no marriage, for we will be like the angels. He also corrects the
12:28-34 - The greatest commandment is to love God with all your heart,
soul, mind, and strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself. These
two commandments summarize the Law and the Prophets, highlighting the

generosity. Jesus emphasizes that her offering, though small, was more
valuable than the large offerings of the rich, for she gave from her
