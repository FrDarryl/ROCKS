'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, turn thy regard towards the hill-country of Seir, and
prophesy its doom.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This be thy message from the Lord God: Have at thee, Seir! My hand

shalt know my power at last.

need, when doom closed round it?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` As I am a living God, the Lord says, to bloodshed I doom thee,
bloodshed shall hunt thee down, the very bloodshed that liked thee so
little.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Desolate and desert mount Seir shall be, none come and go there,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` every crest of it piled high with the slain. Slain they shall fall,
thy warriors, by hill-slope and valley and ravine,

thou shalt witness my power.

there.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` As I am a living God, the Lord says, the rankling grudge that

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
35:1-9 - God declares judgment against Edom, which rejoiced at Israel's
destruction. Edom represents God's enemies, and Edom's fall symbolizes
35:10-15 - God promises to completely destroy Edom, showing that He
repays according to the actions of the nations. God's justice is
impartial, and those who harm His people will experience His judgment
