"1" = ''':sup:`1` Here is a list of the descendants of Esau (or Edom).
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Esau’s Chanaanite wives were Ada, daughter of Elon the Hethite,
Oölibama, who was daughter of Ana and grand-daughter of Sebeon the
Hevite,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and Basemath, who was daughter of Ismael and sister of Nabaioth.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Ada became the mother of Eliphaz, Basemath of Rahuel,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and Oölibama of Jehus, Ihelon and Core; all of these were born while
their father still lived in the land of Chanaan.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Afterwards Esau removed to another region, with wives and sons and
daughters and all his household, with his wealth and his cattle and all
that Chanaan had given him. He must needs part from his brother Jacob,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` now that they had become too rich to live side by side; the country
in which they lived as strangers hitherto could no longer give feed for
all their cattle.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So Esau (or Edom) dwelt thenceforward in the hill country of Seir.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Thus Esau is the father of those Edomites who live in the hill
country of Seir,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and this was the line that came from him through those two sons of
his, Eliphaz who was his son by his wife Ada, and Rahuel, his son by
his wife Basemath.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The sons of Eliphaz were called Theman, Omar, Sepho, Gatham, and
Cenez.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He also had a concubine called Thamna, by whom he became the
father, and Esau the grandfather, of Amalec. All these were descended
from Esau’s wife Ada.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And Rahuel’s sons were called Nahath, Zara, Samma, and Meza; these
were descended from Esau’s wife Basemath.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Esau’s other three sons, Jehus, Ihelon and Core, were borne to him
by his wife Oölibama, daughter of Ana and grand-daughter of Sebeon.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` These, then, were the Edomite chieftains: of the family of Eliphaz,
Esau’s first-born, Theman, Omar, Sepho, Cenez,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Core, Gatham, Amalec, all Edomite chieftains descended from
Eliphaz, and so through Ada.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Of the family of Esau’s son Rahuel, the chieftains called Nahath,
Zara, Samma and Meza, all Edomite chieftains descended from Rahuel, and
so through Esau’s wife Basemath.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And three chieftains, Jehus, Ihelon and Core, were sons of Esau’s
wife Oölibama, who was daughter of Ana.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So the descendants of Esau (or Edom) are named, after the
chieftains who ruled them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` There were other chieftains native to the land, descended from
Seir, the Horrite. Their names were Lotan, Sobal, Sebeon, Ana,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Dison, Eser, and Disan; all Edomite chieftains, but Horrite by race
and descended from Seir.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Lotan had a sister called Thamna, and the names of his two sons
were Hori and Heman.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The names of Sobal’s sons were Alvan, Manahat, Ebal, Sepho, and
Onam.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Sebeon had two sons, Aia and Ana. It was this Ana who was feeding
his father’s asses, when he came upon hot springs, out in the desert.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He had a son called Dison, and a daughter, Oölibama.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Dison’s sons were called Hamdan, Eseban, Jethram, and Charan;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Eser’s were called Balaan, Zavan, and Acan;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Disan’s were called Hus and Aram.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Thus the Horrites had for their chieftains Lotan, Sobal, Sebeon,
and Ana,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Dison, Eser, and Disan. These were the Horrite chieftains who bore
rule in the land of Seir.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` There were kings ruling in the Edomite country before the
Israelites had kings of their own; these are their names;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Bela the son of Beor reigned in Denaba,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and after his death Jobab son of Zara, from Bosra,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` who was succeeded by Husam from the Themanite country;

"35" = ''':sup:`35` his successor was Adad, son of Badad, who defeated Madian in the
territory of Moab; he ruled at Avith.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Adad was succeeded by Semla from Masreca,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and Semla by Saul from the river Rohoboth,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and Saul by Balanan, son of Achobor,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` and Balanan by Adar, who ruled at Phau; his wife’s name was
Meëtabel, daughter of Matred, who was daughter of Mezaab.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And these chieftains of Esau’s race have clans and territories
called after the names; Thamna, Alva, Jetheth,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Oölibama, Ela, Phinon,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Cenez, Theman, Mabsar,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Magdiel, and Hiram. Such were the chieftains of Edom, each bearing
rule over the territory about him; and the father of the Edomite race
was Esau.
