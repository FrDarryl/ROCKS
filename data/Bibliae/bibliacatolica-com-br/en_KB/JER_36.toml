[36]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the fourth year of Josias’ son Joachim, the Lord gave Jeremias
this commandment:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Get thyself a scroll, and write down on it all the warnings I have
uttered against Israel and Juda, and against the other nations of the
world, ever since I first spoke to thee under king Josias.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Maybe, when the men of Juda hear of all the mischief I mean to do
them, they will leave off their straying in false paths, and so I will
overlook the guilt of their wrong-doing.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Jeremias sent for Baruch the son of Nerias; the Lord’s
utterances, every one, Jeremias rehearsed and Baruch wrote down on the
scroll.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now Jeremias had an errand for him; I must keep my house, said
he, go into the Lord’s temple I may not.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Do thou, on a fasting day, go there instead, and read out some of
the divine utterances I have dictated to thee, in the temple itself,
for all the citizens to hear, and all the men of Juda besides, that
have come in from their several townships.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Maybe their intercession will find its way into the Lord’s presence;
maybe they will leave off their straying in false paths; here are
grievous threats from the Lord of angry vengeance against his people.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So it was Baruch son of Nerias, but in fulfilment of Jeremias’
command, that took the scroll and read out, there in the Lord’s house,
the Lord’s message.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It was the ninth month, in the fifth year of Josias’ son Joachim,
when they proclaimed a fast, that was to be kept in the Lord’s presence
by all the citizens and all who had come in from the other towns of
Juda.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And there in the Lord’s house, from the apartment of Gamarias,
whose father, Saphan, had once been secretary, in the upper court,
close by the entry of the new temple gate, Baruch read out Jeremias’
book of warning.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No line he read of the divine utterance but had an eager listener
in Gamarias’ son Michaeas,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` who thereupon went down to the secretary’s room, where he found all
the notables assembled. There was the secretary, Elisama; there were
Dalaias son of Semeias, and Elnathan son of Achobor, and Gamarias son
of Saphan, and Sedecias son of Hananias, and all the notables in
general.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` To these Michaeas repeated all he had heard Baruch read out from
the scroll in public;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and Judi, son of Nathanias, son of Selemias, son of Cushi, was sent
on an errand to Baruch in the name of all present. Come thither he
must, and bring the scroll he had read thus publicly with him. So it
was Baruch, son of Nerias, that came before them, and the scroll with
him;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` they bade him be seated, and read it aloud to them, so read it he
did.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When all the reading was over, they looked each at other in
amazement, and told Baruch all this must be brought to the king’s ears.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then they asked, How comes it that these are the words of Jeremias,
and yet of thy writing?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Why, said he, Jeremias gave them out, as if he were reading them
aloud, and I sat by with paper and ink to write them down.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Go into hiding, they told him, thou and Jeremias with thee, and be
sure none knows where to find you.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then they made their way into the palace court to find the king,
leaving the book there in the secretary’s room. When they had brought
their news to his hearing,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` the king would have Judi fetch the book itself from Elisama’s room;
which he did, and read it out for the king to hear, and all the
courtiers that stood about him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Since it was the ninth month, Joachim was in his winter parlour,
and a brazier of coals in front of him;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and when Judi had read but three columns or four, he took his
pen-knife and began cutting the scroll into pieces, which he threw on
to the brazier until the whole book had perished in the flames.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` King and courtiers listened to all these warnings, yet feared they
never, nor rent their clothes;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and although Elnathan, Dalaias and Gamarias would have prevented
Joachim from burning the scroll, he would not listen to them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Jeremiel son of Amalech,✻ Saraias son of Ezriel, and Selemias son
of Abdeel were bidden to attach the persons of the scribe Baruch and
the prophet Jeremias; but the Lord kept them in safe hiding.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And this was the Lord’s word to the prophet Jeremias, when the king
burnt the scroll, and with it all the utterances he had dictated to
Baruch:
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Get thee another scroll, and write down on it whatever was
contained in the one king Joachim burnt.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And to king Joachim give this message from the Lord: Burn book and
chide prophet, if thou wilt, for warning thee that the king of Babylon
will come back with all speed, and lay this country waste, leaving
neither man nor beast to dwell in it.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But this is the Lord’s doom against king Joachim of Juda: No son of
his shall follow him on the throne of David; his body shall be cast
away in the open, to bear the day’s heat and the night frost.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` With guilt of his, with guilt of household and court of his, I will
reckon in full; all my unheeded threats against Jerusalem and Juda
shall be made good.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So Jeremias must get Baruch another scroll to write on, and all the
contents of the book Joachim burnt must be dictated anew; much more was
added besides to enlarge it.

Notas de rodapé:
36:1-3 - God tells Jeremiah to write down His words and share them with
the people, warning Israel of impending judgment. God's revelation
through the written Word shows how He desires His people to know and

36:4-8 - Jeremiah commands Baruch to write the Lord's words on a scroll
and proclaim messages of judgment and repentance. Faithfulness to God's
command is essential for the message of salvation to reach the people
36:9-19 - The scroll is read in the temple, and despite the clear
message, the people do not repent. Rejection of God's Word leads to
36:20-26 - King Jeconiah destroys the scroll containing God's message,
demonstrating his resistance to repentance and God's judgment. This
response of rejection of the Lord leads to severe consequences,
reflecting the hardening of the heart against God's will (see also

words of judgment and restoration. Even in the face of human
resistance, God's Word does not fail and will continue to be
