"1" = ''':sup:`1` Out upon you, that enact ill decrees, and draw up instruments of
wrong;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` suppress the claims of the poor, and refuse redress to humble folk;
the widow your spoil, the orphan your prey!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` What shifts will you be put to, when the day of reckoning comes,
when the storm overtakes you that is brewing far away? With whom take
refuge, where hide away your treasures?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yours to crouch down in chains, or fall among the massacred. And
even so the Lord’s wrath is not appeased, his hand threatens us still.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Woe, too, upon the Assyrian! What is he but the rod that executes my
vengeance, the instrument of my displeasure?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I have sent him to punish one nation that has proved false to me;
against one defiant people he holds my warrant; let him prey on it as
he will, carry off what spoils he will, trample it like the mire in the
streets.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Not such are his own thoughts, not such the dreams he cherishes; he
dreams of extermination, of realm after realm dispeopled.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Are not my chieftains, he says,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` as good as kings, every one of them? What difference between
Charcamis and Calano, between Arphad and Emath, between Damascus and
Samaria?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I have had my way with the kingdoms that worship false gods; shall
it not be the same with the images they worship at Jerusalem and
Samaria?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` May I not treat Jerusalem and her images as I treated Samaria and
her false gods?✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Wait we, till the Lord has carried out all his designs upon mount
Sion and Jerusalem. Then he means to reckon with the boastful ambition
of Sennacherib, with the proud glance of those scornful eyes.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` My own strength (the king says to himself) has done all this, my
own wisdom has planned it; I have removed the frontiers of nations, I
have robbed princes of their treasure, with a strong hand I have pulled
down rulers from their thrones.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Mighty peoples, and my hand closed over them like a nest; I
gathered up a whole world, as a man gathers up eggs that lie abandoned;
no flapping of wings, no angry screech to forbid me.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Poor fool, can axe set itself up against woodman, saw defy
carpenter? Shall the rod turn on him who wields it, the staff, that is
but wood, try conclusions with a living man?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` What says our Master, the Lord of hosts? He will send a wasting
sickness into that gorged frame; beneath that pride a living firebrand
shall burn, burn deep.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He who is our light will turn into a fire, the Holy One of Israel
will be a flame, that will burn up suddenly; in one day those
thorn-bushes, that dry brushwood shall be consumed.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Like a proud forest, or a garden plot, he shall be eaten up, body
and soul; see where he flies in terror!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Of all the trees in that forest so few shall be left, a child might
count them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And when that day comes, the remnant of Israel, the survivors of
Jacob’s line, will learn to trust, not in the staff that turns into rod
to smite them,✻ but in the Lord, the Holy One of Israel; here he shall
find loyalty.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` A remnant will turn back, only a remnant of Jacob, to God, the
Mighty One.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Countless though Israel be as the sea sand, only a remnant of it
will return; there must be a sharp reckoning first, before we are
restored, abundantly, to his favour.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Short and sharp is the reckoning the Lord, the God of hosts, will
make, with the whole world for the scene of it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Here, then, is a message for you from the Lord, the God of hosts:
Never lose heart, men of Sion, my own people, before the Assyrian, rod
though he have to smite thee, staff to chastise thee, when thou meetest
him on the road to Egypt.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Wait for a little, for a short moment wait, and my angry vengeance
for his ill doings shall find full scope.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The Lord of hosts will bring the lash down upon him, as he did once
on Madian at the rock Oreb; by the sea-shore, on the road to Egypt, his
rod will be uplifted.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And with that, thy shoulder will be eased of the burden, the yoke
will fall from thy neck, yoke that has gone rotten for want of oil.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` See where he enters Aiath, crosses to Magron, halts his
baggage-train at Machmas!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Already the pass lies behind them; Geba will be theirs by
nightfall. In Rama, what terror! Saul’s own city of Gabaa is in flight.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Cry aloud, maidens of Gallim, and listen, Laisa, to the cry; woe
upon thee, poor Anathoth!
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Medemena stands empty; now, men of Gabim, you need courage!
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Daylight still! Why, he will make his halt at Nobe, threaten the
mountain where queen Sion stands, the very hill of Jerusalem!
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then, as we look, our Master, the Lord of hosts, will spread terror
among them, and break them like earthenware.✻ Yield greatness, and
pride topple;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` axe-iron for yonder tangled forest, the strength of Lebanon
outmatched!
