"1" = ''':sup:`1` And when I preached to you, I had to approach you as men with
natural, not with spiritual thoughts. You were little children in
Christ’s nursery,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and I gave you milk, not meat; you were not strong enough for it.
You are not strong enough for it even now; nature still lives in you.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Do not these rivalries, these dissensions among you shew that nature
is still alive, that you are guided by human standards?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When one of you says, I am for Paul, and another, I am for Apollo,
are not these human thoughts? Why, what is Apollo, what is Paul?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Only the ministers of the God in whom your faith rests, who have
brought that faith to each of you in the measure God granted.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` It was for me to plant the seed, for Apollo to water it, but it was
God who gave the increase.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And if so, the man who plants, the man who waters, count for
nothing; God is everything, since it is he who gives the increase.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This man plants, that man waters; it is all one. And yet either will
receive his own wages, in proportion to his own work.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` You are a field of God’s tilling, a structure of God’s design; and
we are only his assistants.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` With what grace God has bestowed on me, I have laid a foundation as
a careful architect should; it is left for someone else to build upon
it. Only, whoever builds on it must be careful how he builds.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The foundation which has been laid is the only one which anybody
can lay; I mean Jesus Christ.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But on this foundation different men will build in gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, grass, or straw,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and each man’s workmanship will be plainly seen. It is the day of
the Lord that will disclose it, since that day is to reveal itself in
fire, and fire will test the quality of each man’s workmanship.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He will receive a reward, if the building he has added on stands
firm;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` if it is burnt up, he will be the loser; and yet he himself will be
saved, though only as men are saved by passing through fire.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do you not understand that you are God’s temple, and that God’s
Spirit has his dwelling in you?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If anybody desecrates the temple of God, God will bring him to
ruin. It is a holy thing, this temple of God which is nothing other
than yourselves.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` You must not deceive yourselves, any of you, about this. If any of
you thinks he is wise, after the fashion of his fellow men, he must
turn himself into a fool, so as to be truly wise.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This world’s wisdom, with God, is but folly. So we read in
scripture, I will entrap the wise with their own cunning.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, and how empty
they are.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Nobody, therefore, should repose his confidence in men.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Everything is for you, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or
the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future; it is all
for you,✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and you for Christ, and Christ for God.

Notas de rodapé:
3:1-4 - Paul rebukes the Corinthians for their spiritual immaturity,
revealed by divisions and rivalry among followers of different leaders.
True wisdom comes from God, not from human leaders (see also
3:5-9 - Paul and Apollos are simply God's servants, working together to
build up the church. The real work of building the church is done by
God, and human servants are instruments in His hands (see also

on the Day of the Lord. The foundation is Christ, and all believers
must build on this foundation with materials that stand up to judgment

dwells in it. Care and respect for this temple are fundamental to the
