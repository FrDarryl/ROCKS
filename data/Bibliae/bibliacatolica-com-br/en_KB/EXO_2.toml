"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now one of the descendants of Levi wooed and married a woman of
his own clan,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` who conceived and bore him a son. So winning were the child’s looks,
that for three months she kept him hidden away;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` then, unable to conceal him any longer, she took a little basket of
reeds, which she smeared with clay and pitch, and in this put her baby
son down among the bulrushes on the river bank.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The boy’s sister waited at a distance, to see what would happen.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Just then, Pharao’s daughter came down to bathe in the river, while
her maid-servants walked along the bank. She caught sight of the basket
among the rushes, and sent one of her attendants to fetch it;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and when she opened it, and saw the baby crying, her heart was
touched. Why, she said, this must be one of the Hebrew children.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And at that, the boy’s sister asked, Wouldst thou have me go and
fetch one of the Hebrew women, to nurse the child for thee?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Go by all means, she said; and the girl went and fetched her mother.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Take this boy, Pharao’s daughter said, and nurse him for me; I will
reward thee for it. So the woman took the boy and nursed him till he
was grown; then she handed him over to Pharao’s daughter,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` who adopted him as her own son, and gave him the name of Moses, the
Rescuer; I had to rescue him, she said, from the river.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` A time came when Moses, now a grown-up man, went out among his
brethren the Hebrews, and saw how ill they were treated, saw one of
these brethren of his being beaten by an Egyptian;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` whereupon, after looking this way and that to see that no one was
near, he killed the Egyptian and buried him there in the sand.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he went out next day, he found two Hebrews that had come to
blows, and asked the aggressor what he meant by offering violence to a
friend.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Why, said he, who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? Hast thou
a mind to kill me, as thou didst kill that Egyptian yesterday? And
Moses was terrified to find that his action had so strangely come to
light.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When Pharao heard of it, he was for putting Moses to death; and
Moses, to avoid his scrutiny, took refuge in the country of Madian.
Here he sat down to rest by the side of a well.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And it chanced that seven maids, daughters to the priest of Madian,
came out and began drawing water, to fill the troughs and water their
father’s sheep.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But now came shepherds, and would have turned the maidens away,
until Moses stood up for them, and himself watered their sheep.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When they reached home their father, Raguel, asked them why they
were earlier than their wont;✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and they told him, There was an Egyptian there, who took our part
against the shepherds, and then drew water for us himself, for our
sheep to drink.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Upon which he asked, What has become of this man? Why did you part
from his company? Bid him come in and eat.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So it came about that Moses bound himself by an oath to live there
with Raguel, and wedded his daughter Sephora.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The first son she bore him he called Gersam, as if he would say, I
have been a stranger, Ger, in an alien land. And when she bore another
son, Moses called him Eliezer, Help from God; the God of my father
(said he) has helped me to escape from the power of Pharao.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then, after a long while, the king of Egypt died, and the cry of
the Israelites, still groaning aloud in their drudgery, went up to God,
who took pity on this drudgery of theirs,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and listened to their complaint; he had not forgotten the covenant
which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So it was that the Lord looked down in mercy on the Israelites, and
took heed of them.

Notas de rodapé:
2:1-4 - The birth of Moses marks the beginning of God's plan of
deliverance for Israel. His parents, from the tribe of Levi, hide him
in faith, protecting him from Pharaoh's death decree (see also

kills the attacker. His impulsive action reveals his sense of justice,
but also the need for maturity and trust in God's ways (see also
