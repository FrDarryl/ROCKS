"1" = ''':sup:`1` Little children, the purpose of this letter is to keep you clear of
sin. Meanwhile, if any of us does fall into sin, we have an advocate to
plead our cause before the Father in the Just One, Jesus Christ.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He, in his own person, is the atonement made for our sins, and not
only for ours, but for the sins of the whole world.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Have we attained the knowledge of him? The test is, whether we keep
his commandments;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the man who claims knowledge of him without keeping his commandments
is a liar; truth does not dwell in such a man as that.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` No, if a man keeps true to his word, then it is certain that the
love of God has reached its full stature in him; that is what tells us
that we are dwelling in him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` One who claims to dwell in him must needs live and move as he lived
and moved.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Beloved, I am not sending you a new commandment; it is an old
commandment, which you were given from the very first; what was the
message to which you listened long ago but this same commandment, now
grown old?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And yet it is a new commandment I am sending you, now that it is
verified in him and you; the darkness has passed away now, and true
light shines instead.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He who claims enlightenment, and all the while hates his brother, is
in darkness still.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It is the man who loves his brother that lives in light; no fear of
stumbling haunts him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The man who hates his brother is in the dark, guides his steps in
the dark without being able to tell where he is going; darkness has
fallen, and blinded his eyes.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I call you little children; have not your sins been forgiven in his
name?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I call you fathers; have you not knowledge of one who was from the
first? I call you young men; have you not gained victory over the evil
one?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I call you sons; you have learned to recognize the Father. I call
you young men; you are strong, with God’s word dwelling in you always;
you have gained your victory over the evil one.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do not bestow your love on the world, and what the world has to
offer; the lover of this world has no love of the Father in him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` What does the world offer? Only gratification of corrupt nature,
gratification of the eye, the empty pomp of living; these things take
their being from the world, not from the Father.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The world and its gratifications pass away; the man who does God’s
will outlives them, for ever.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` My sons, this is the last age of time. You have been told that
Antichrist must needs come; and even now, to prove to us that it is the
last stage of time, many Antichrists have appeared.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They came of our company, but they never belonged to our company;
if they had belonged to it, they would have persevered at our side. As
it is, they were destined to prove that there are some who are no true
companions of ours.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` With you, it is otherwise; the Holy One has anointed you, and now
nothing is hidden from you,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` so that I am not writing to you as to men from whom the truth is
hidden. Rather, I am appealing to your knowledge of it; the truth,
after all, cannot give birth to a lie.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` To whom do we give the lie, if not to him who tells us that Jesus
is not the Christ? Such a man is Antichrist, disowning as he does both
the Father and the Son.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` To disown the Son is to have no claim to the Father; it is by
acknowledging the Son that we lay claim to the Father too.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Enough for you, that the message which was first brought you should
dwell in you. If that first message dwells in you, you too will dwell
in the Son, and in the Father.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He himself has made us a promise, the promise of eternal life.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So much I have written about those who are trying to mislead you.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Meanwhile, the influence of his anointing lives on in you, so that
you have no need of teaching; no lesson his influence gives you can be
a lie, they are all true. Follow those lessons, and dwell in him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Yes, little children, dwell in him, so that when he appears we may
greet him confidently, instead of being ashamed at his presence.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` You are sure that he is just; be sure, then, that whoever does
right is born of him.
