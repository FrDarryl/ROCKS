"1" = ''':sup:`1` Time was, the holy city was a home of content; ever the laws of it
were well kept; such a high priest they had, Onias, a devout man, and
one that hated evil.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In those days, king and chieftain held the place much in reverence,
and with rich gifts endowed the temple;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` did not Seleucus, king of Asia, defray all the cost of maintaining
its sacrifices?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yet one citizen there was, Simon the Benjamite, the temple governor,
that had lawless schemes afoot, do the high priest what he would to
gainsay him.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And at last, when overcome Onias he might not, what did he? To
Apollonius he betook himself, the son of Tharseas, that was then in
charge of Coelesyria and Phoenice,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and gave him great news indeed; here was the treasury at Jerusalem
stocked with treasures innumerable, here was vast public wealth,
unclaimed by the needs of the altar, and nothing prevented but it
should fall into the king’s hands.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` No sooner did Apollonius find himself in the royal presence than he
told the story of the rumoured treasure; and at that, the king sent for
Heliodorus, that had charge of his affairs, and despatched him with
orders to fetch the said money away.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This Heliodorus set out on his journey without more ado, under
colour of making a progress through the towns of Coelesyria and
Phoenice, but with the king’s business still in mind.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when he reached Jerusalem, and there received a gracious welcome
from the high priest, he made no secret of the information he
possessed, or of his errand, and he would know the truth about these
moneys.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` A plain account the high priest gave him; some were moneys
deposited on trust, for the maintenance of widows and orphans;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` there were some, too, belonging to Hyrcanus son of Tobias, a man of
repute. The information was maliciously laid, nor did the whole sum
amount to more than four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred of
gold.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Men had reposed their confidence in a city and a temple renowned
throughout the world, for the high opinion they had of its sanctity;
and should he play them false? It was not to be thought of.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But Heliodorus stood upon the terms of his commission; delivered to
the king the money must be, there was no other way of it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So the appointed day came, when he would visit the temple and take
order in the matter; what a stir there was then in the city!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Priests, in their sacred vesture, cast themselves down before the
altar, and cried out upon heaven; would not he, whose law enjoined
safe-keeping, keep property safe for its rightful owners?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And for the high priest himself, the very aspect of him was
heart-rending; such a change of look and colour betrayed his inward
feelings;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` grief and horror were stamped on his features, and to all that saw
him he seemed a broken man.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Folk streamed out of their houses in droves, to make public
intercession over the affront that should be put on the holy place;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` sackcloth about their waists, the women thronged the streets, and
maids that might not go abroad must yet run to the housetops, or peer
out at windows, to see Onias pass.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Heavenward they raised their hands, each one of them, in prayer;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and pity it was to see how common folk about him were sharing the
high priest’s agony of suspense.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Here, then, was a whole city praying Almighty God, no loss might
befall the men who had trusted them;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and here was Heliodorus carrying out his design, already arrived at
the treasury with his body-guard in attendance.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` All at once the spirit of God, the omnipotent, gave signal proof of
its presence; daunted by the divine power they trembled and stood
irresolute, these ministers of wrong.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` What saw they? A horse, royally caparisoned, that charged upon
Heliodorus and struck him down with its fore-feet; terrible of aspect
its rider was, and his armour seemed all of gold.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Two other warriors they saw, how strong of limb, how dazzling of
mien, how bravely clad! These stood about Heliodorus and fell to
scourging him, this side and that, blow after blow, without respite.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` With the suddenness of his fall to the ground, darkness had closed
about him; hastily they caught him up and carried him out in his
litter;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` a helpless burden now, that entered yonder treasury with such a
rabble of tipstaves and halberdiers! Here was proof of God’s power most
manifest.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` There he lay, by heaven’s decree speechless and beyond hope of
recovery;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and all around men were praising the Lord, for thus vindicating the
honour of his sanctuary. In the temple, where all had been anxiety and
turmoil until heaven showed its almighty power, all was rejoicing and
contentment now.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` It was not long before friends of Heliodorus were entreating Onias
to call down mercy from the most High, on one that was now at death’s
door.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` This was anxious news for the high priest; what if the king should
suspect the Jews of foul play? Offer sacrifice he did for the man’s
recovery, and with good effect.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He was yet at his prayers, when those two warriors, in the same
brave attire, stood by Heliodorus again; Thanks thou owest, they said,
to the high priest Onias; at his instance, the Lord grants thee life;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` God’s scourge thou hast felt, God’s wondrous power be ever on thy
lips. And with that, they were seen no more.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Be sure this Heliodorus offered God sacrifice; ay, and made vows a
many for his preservation, and thanked Onias besides; then he marched
his army back to the king.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Everywhere he testified how great a God was this, what strange
things his own eyes had witnessed;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and when the king himself asked what manner of emissary he should
next send to Jerusalem,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Why, said he, some enemy of thine, some rebel that plots against
the kingdom. Escape he with his life, I warrant he will come back to
thee soundly beaten. Past doubt, there is some divine influence haunts
yonder place;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` watch and ward he keeps over it, that has his dwelling in heaven,
to be the plague and the undoing of all who come that way upon an
errand of mischief.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Such is the tale of Heliodorus, and of the treasury’s preserving.

prosperity, reflecting God's blessing on His people when they obey His
