"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now the apostles and brethren in Judaea were told how the word
of God had been given to the Gentiles.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who held to the tradition
of circumcision found fault with him;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Why didst thou pay a visit, they asked, to men who are
uncircumcised, and eat with them?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Whereupon Peter told them the story point by point from the
beginning;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I was in the city of Joppa, he said, at my prayers, when I fell into
a trance and saw a vision. A bundle, like a great sheet, came down from
heaven, lowered by the four corners, till it reached me.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I looked closely to find out what it was, and there I saw
four-footed creatures of earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things,
and the birds that fly in heaven.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter, lay about thee and
eat.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So I answered, It cannot be, Lord; nothing profane or unclean has
ever crossed my lips.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And a second utterance came from heaven in answer, It is not for
thee to call anything profane, which God has made clean.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Three times this happened, and then all was drawn up again into
heaven.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And at that very moment three men appeared at the door of the house
where I was, with a message to me from Caesarea.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The Spirit bade me accompany them without misgiving; so these six
brethren came with me, and together we entered the man’s home.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` There he told us how he had had a vision of an angel in his house;
this angel stood before him, and said, Send to Joppa, and bid Simon,
who is also called Peter, come to thee.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He will have such a message for thee as will bring salvation to
thee and to all thy household.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And then, when I had set about speaking to them, the Holy Spirit
fell upon them, just as it was with us at the beginning.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then I was reminded of what the Lord said to us, John’s baptism was
with water, but there is a baptism with the Holy Spirit which you are
to receive.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And now, if God has made them the same free gift, which he made to
us when faith in the Lord Jesus had gone before it, who was I, what
power had I, to stay God’s hand?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` At these words, they were content, and gave glory to God; Why then,
they said, it seems God has granted life-giving repentance of heart to
the Gentiles too.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Meanwhile, those who had been dispersed owing to the persecution
that was raised over Stephen had travelled as far away as Phoenice and
Cyprus and Antioch, without preaching the word to anyone except the
Jews.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when
they found their way to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks as well, preaching
the Lord Jesus to them.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the Lord’s power went with them, so that a great number learned
to believe, and turned to the Lord.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The story of this came to the ears of the Church at Jerusalem, and
they sent Barnabas on a mission to Antioch.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When he came there and saw what grace God was bestowing on them, he
was full of joy, and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord
with steady purpose of heart,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` like the good man he was, full of the Holy Spirit, full of faith; a
great multitude was thus won over to the Lord.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He went on to Tarsus, to look for Saul, and when he found him,
brought him back to Antioch.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For a whole year after this they were made welcome in the Church
there, teaching a great multitude. And Antioch was the first place in
which the disciples were called Christians.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` At this time, some prophets from Jerusalem visited Antioch;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and one of these, Agabus by name, stood up and prophesied through
the Spirit that a great famine was to come upon the whole world, as it
did in the reign of the emperor Claudius.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Thereupon it was decided that each of the disciples should
contribute according to his means, to send relief to the brethren who
lived in Judaea.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And so they did; and in sending it to the presbyters they entrusted
it to the hands of Barnabas and Saul.✻
