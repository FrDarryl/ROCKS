[31]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` All this Moses obediently proclaimed to the people of Israel;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and then he said to them, Here am I, a man of a hundred and twenty
years of age, no longer fit to lead you on your expeditions; and
besides, the Lord has told me that I am not destined to cross yonder
stream of Jordan.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It is the Lord your God that will lead you across, it is he that
will dispossess all these nations to make room for you; and he has
chosen Josue here to march at your head.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` These nations are to fare no better than the Amorrhite kings, Sehon
and Og; the Lord means to overthrow them,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and you, when he gives you the victory over them, must remember what
I told you, and make an end of them.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Play the man, and keep your courage high; there must be no
cowardice, no flinching before them. The Lord your God is himself your
leader now; he will not play you false and forsake you.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Moses summoned Josue, and said to him in the presence of all
Israel, Play the man, and keep thy courage high; it is thy task to lead
this nation into the land which the Lord promised to their fathers, and
divide it up between them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The Lord goes with thee to lead this army of thine; he will not play
thee false and forsake thee; there must be no cowardice, no flinching
here.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And now Moses committed this law to writing, and gave it to the
priests of Levi’s race, bearers of the ark that attested the Lord’s
covenant, and to the elders of Israel.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Every seven years, he told them, when the year of discharge comes
round, and with it the feast of Tent-dwelling,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` at the time when all Israel meets in the place the Lord has chosen,
to present themselves before him, their Lord and God, the terms of this
law must be read out in the presence and in the hearing of the whole
people.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` All alike will be assembled there, not only men but women and
children, and the aliens too that dwell among you; all alike must
listen, and learn to fear the Lord your God, and carry out faithfully
all the terms of this law.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The very children, still all untaught, must listen now, and learn
to fear the Lord their God, as long as this land you are winning for
yourselves beyond Jordan is their home.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` After this the Lord said to Moses, Thou hast not long to live;
summon Josue, and take him with thee to meet me at the tabernacle; I
have a charge to give him. So Moses and Josue took their stand together
beneath the tabernacle that attested the covenant,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and there the Lord appeared in a pillar of cloud that rose above
them at the tabernacle door.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the Lord said to Moses, Thou wilt be laid to rest among thy
fathers, and before long this people of mine, settled now in the land
they have invaded, will begin to play the wanton, and to worship alien
gods; will forsake me, and cancel their covenant with me.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then my anger will burn fiercely indeed; I will forsake them in my
turn, and deny them my favour, and they will fall a prey to woes and
afflictions of every sort, until at last they begin to say, It is
because the Lord is no longer with us that we are encountering
afflictions such as these.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And still I will hide myself, and turn no glance towards them, to
punish them for their wickedness in betaking themselves to alien gods.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I would have you, then, set down a song in writing, and teach the
people to know it by heart and sing it; a song that will vindicate me
against the sons of Israel.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I mean to settle them in this land that is all milk and honey, my
promised gift to their fathers; and they will no sooner have eaten
their fill and grown fat on it, than they will turn to alien gods and
worship them; they will defy me, and annul their covenant with me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Woes and afflictions will come upon them, and it is then that this
song, still remembered by their posterity, will vindicate me against
them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Moses put the song in writing, and taught it to the men of
Israel.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The Lord also gave a charge to Josue, the son of Nun, Play the man,
and keep thy courage high; it is thy task to settle the sons of Israel
in the land I have promised to give them, and I will be with thee in
the doing of it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And now, when Moses had finished his work of setting forth the
terms of this law in a book,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` he gave orders to the Levites, that carried the ark of the Lord,
what they should do with it.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Take this book, he said, and lay it up by the side of the ark that
bears witness of the Lord’s covenant, to vindicate him against you.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` I know well how rebellious you are, how stiff-necked; even in my
life-time, and in spite of my presence among you, you have always been
rebelling against the Lord, and when I am dead, worse must follow.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Summon the elders and counsellors among all the tribes, and let me
say my say in their hearing; let me call upon heaven and earth to bear
witness against them.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` I know well enough that when I am dead you will ruin all, and it
will not be long before you stray from the path I have shewed you; and
I know that when the Lord sees you living amiss, and provoking his
anger by your doings, calamity will fall upon you in the end.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And so Moses, with the whole assembly of Israel listening to him,
pronounced the words of the song which follows, never pausing until it
was all finished.
