"1" = ''':sup:`1` When that day comes, the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins,
who went to bring the bridegroom and his bride home, taking their lamps
with them.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Five of these were foolish, and five were wise;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` the five foolish, when they took their lamps, did not provide
themselves with oil,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` but those who were wise took oil in the vessels they carried, as
well as the lamps.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The bridegroom was long in coming, so that they all grew drowsy, and
fell asleep.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And at midnight the cry was raised, Behold, the bridegroom is on his
way; go out to meet him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thereupon all these virgins awoke, and fell to trimming their lamps;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and now the foolish ones said to the wise, Share your oil with us,
our lamps are burning low.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But the wise ones answered, How if there is not enough for us and
for you? Better that you should find your way to the merchants, and buy
for yourselves.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And so, while they were away buying it, the bridegroom came; those
who stood ready escorted him to the wedding, and the door was shut.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Afterwards those other virgins came, with the cry, Lord, Lord, open
to us.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he answered, Believe me, I do not recognize you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Be on the watch, then; the day of it and the hour of it are unknown
to you.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So it was with a man who went on his travels; he called his trusted
servants to him and committed his money to their charge.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He gave five talents to one, two to another, and one to another,
according to their several abilities, and with that he set out on his
journey.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The man who had received five talents went and traded with them,
until he had made a profit of five talents more;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and in the same way he who had received two made a profit of two.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Whereas he who had received but one went off and made a hole in the
ground, and there hid his master’s money.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Long afterwards, the master of those servants came back, and
entered into a reckoning with them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And so the man who had received five talents came forward and
brought him five talents more; Lord, he said, it was five talents thou
gavest me, see how I have made a profit of five talents besides.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And his master said to him, Well done, my good and faithful
servant; since thou hast been faithful over little things, I have great
things to commit to thy charge; come and share the joy of thy Lord.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then came the man who had received two talents; Lord, he said, it
was two talents thou gavest me; see how I have made a profit of two
talents besides.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And his master said to him, Well done, my good and faithful
servant; since thou hast been faithful over little things, I have great
things to commit to thy charge; come and share the joy of thy Lord.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But when he who had received but one talent came forward in his
turn, he said, Lord, knowing thee for a hard man, that reaps where he
did not sow, and gathers in from fields he never planted,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I took fright, and so went off and hid thy talent in the earth; see
now, thou hast received what is thine.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And his lord answered him, Base and slothful servant, thou knewest
well that I reap where I did not sow, and gather in from fields I never
planted;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` all the more was it thy part to lodge my money with the bankers, so
that I might have recovered it with interest when I came.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Take the talent away from him, and give it to him who has ten
talents already.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Whenever a man is rich, gifts will be made to him, and his riches
will abound; if he is poor, even what he accounts his own will be taken
from him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And now, cast the unprofitable servant into the darkness without;
where there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth.✻
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with
him, he will sit down upon the throne of his glory,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and all nations will be gathered in his presence, where he will
divide men one from the other, as the shepherd divides the sheep from
the goats;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` he will set the sheep on his right, and the goats on his left.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then the King will say to those who are on his right hand, Come,
you that have received a blessing from my Father, take possession of
the kingdom which has been prepared for you since the foundation of the
world.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` For I was hungry, and you gave me food, thirsty, and you gave me
drink; I was a stranger, and you brought me home,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` naked, and you clothed me, sick, and you cared for me, a prisoner,
and you came to me.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Whereupon the just will answer, Lord, when was it that we saw thee
hungry, and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` When was it that we saw thee a stranger, and brought thee home, or
naked, and clothed thee?
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` When was it that we saw thee sick or in prison and came to thee?
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And the King will answer them, Believe me, when you did it to one
of the least of my brethren here, you did it to me.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then he will say to those who are on his left hand, in their turn,
Go far from me, you that are accursed, into that eternal fire which has
been prepared for the devil and his angels.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` For I was hungry, and you never gave me food, I was thirsty, and
you never gave me drink;
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` I was a stranger, and you did not bring me home, I was naked, and
you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison, and you did not care
for me.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Whereupon they, in their turn, will answer, Lord, when was it that
we saw thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in
prison, and did not minister to thee?
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And he will answer them, Believe me, when you refused it to one of
the least of my brethren here, you refused it to me.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And these shall pass on to eternal punishment, and the just to
eternal life.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
25:1-13 - The parable of the ten virgins teaches the importance of
spiritual watchfulness and constant preparation for the Lord's coming.
The wise virgins, who were prepared, represent the faithful who remain
25:14-30 - The parable of the talents highlights the responsibility
given to each Christian to steward the gifts and resources God has
entrusted to them. Neglecting to use talents reflects a lack of faith
25:31-46 - The separation of the sheep from the goats illustrates the
final judgment, in which God will judge each person's actions based on
how they treated those in need. Mercy and service to others are
2:14-17).
