"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now turn we to king Baltassar, that made great cheer for courtiers
of his a thousand, each man drinking wine as his rank entitled him.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he, in his cups, would have the spoils of the old temple at
Jerusalem brought in, cups of gold, cups of silver that his father
Nabuchodonosor had carried away; king and court, wife and concubine
should drink from them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Brought in they were, all the spoils of Jerusalem; king and
courtier, wife and concubine, drank from those vessels;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` drank, and to their own gods gave the praise, gods of gold and
silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then, in that hour, an apparition came to them. They saw the fingers
of a man’s hand writing on the plaster of the palace wall, full in the
lamp’s light; joints of a hand that wrote there the king could not
choose but see.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` All at once he changed colour, a prey to anxious thoughts; melted
his heart within him, and his knees knocked together.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` With a loud cry, he bade them summon the wise men of Babylon, sage
and astrologer and diviner; and to these he made proclamation: Who
reads me yonder writing, and tells me the meaning of it, shall go clad
in purple, a gold chain about his neck, and hold the third place in my
kingdom.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But when they came into the banqueting-hall, never a wise head among
them could read the characters, nor tell the king what they meant;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` whereupon king Baltassar was in a great taking of fear, his cheeks
paler yet, and his princes were no easier in mind than himself.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But now all this ado brought the queen-mother down into the
banqueting-hall; Long life to the king’s grace! cried she; here is no
need for daunted hearts and pale looks!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` One man thou hast in thy realm the holy gods inspire; in thy
father’s time, good proof he gave of the wisdom and learning that were
his. Did not thy father, king Nabuchodonosor, put him at the head of
his wise men one and all, sage nor wizard nor astrologer nor soothsayer
to match him? In such renown thy royal father held him, my lord king;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` no common spirit is his, no common prudence and discernment, dreams
to interpret, hidden things to reveal, spells to unbind. For his name,
it is Daniel; thy father called him Baltassar. Let Daniel be summoned,
and thy riddle shall not long go unread.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Daniel was brought into the king’s presence, and the king asked
him if Daniel he were, one of the Jewish exiles his father had brought
to Babylon?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Great things were told of him; that he had the spirit of the gods,
gave proof of skill, discernment and wisdom above the common.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And here was certain writing, that had baffled sage and diviner
called in to read them; meaning of it they could not tell.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If Daniel had skill indeed to reveal mysteries and unbind spells,
let him read those characters and interpret them; robe of purple he
should have, and a gold chain about his neck, and hold the third place
in the kingdom.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But Daniel spoke out, there in the king’s presence: Purple and gold
keep for thyself; and for thy honours, let him have them who will. But
for the writing, I will read it willingly, and tell thee the meaning of
it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Sir king, thy father was Nabuchodonosor; to him the most High gave
royal state, and splendid renown;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` for that renown of his, every people and race and tribe must
tremble in awe of him; slew he, smote he, exalted he, abased he, all he
would.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` With that, his heart beat high; proud grew his will and obstinate;
and the issue of it? From that throne he must come down, be shorn of
that glory;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` cast out henceforth from the haunts of men. Heart of beast the
heart of him; dwelling-place of wild ass should be his, food of the ox;
and the dews of heaven should drench him, till he had learned that the
most High is overlord of all human kingship, grants it to whom he will.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` All this, Baltassar, thou knewest, yet son no more than father
would abate his pride;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` heaven’s Ruler defying, thou wouldst bring out yonder cups, the
spoil of his temple, to serve wine for thee and thy court, for wife and
concubine. Gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, stone and wood,
that cannot see or hear or feel, thou wouldst magnify; for the God that
holds thy life, thy fortunes, in his keeping, never a word of praise.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` That is why the hand appeared to thee, fingers that wrote what
there stands written.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` This is the charactery of it: Mané, Thecel, Phares.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Mané betokens numbering; so many years allotted to thy empire, and
now God has brought them to an end.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And thecel, weighing; the equal of his benefits God demands, and
has not found in thee.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And phares, rending; Persian and Mede shall be thy successors in
the kingdom that is torn from thy grasp.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` With that, at the royal bidding, they clothed Daniel in purple, and
hung a chain of gold about his neck; proclamation, too, was made that
he held the third place in the kingdom.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But that same night Baltassar, the Chaldaean king, was slain,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and his crown passed to Darius, a Mede, then in the sixty-third
year of his age.✻

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-4 - The banquet of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, reflects pride and
irreverence before God. By using the sacred utensils of the temple in
Jerusalem, he challenges God's holiness, which provokes divine

Belshazzar and the end of his reign. The Babylonian empire comes to an
