"1" = ''':sup:`1` Still Jeremias would speak out before all the people; and among
those who lis-tened to him were Saphatias son of Mathan, Gedelias son
of Phassur, Juchal son of Selemias, and Phassur son of Melchias.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This message they heard him proclaim from the Lord: To remain in
this city means death by sword, famine and pestilence; go over to the
Chaldaeans, you shall have your lives for guerdon, and be spared.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And this: Past doubt, the city will fall into the hands of the king
of Babylon, by right of capture.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And they urged the king, these notables, to make an end of him; He
goes about, said they, to weaken the resolve of the garrison, and of
the people at large, by talking in this fashion; there is malice here,
not good will.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He is at your disposal, king Sedecias answered; not for a king to
withstand you!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So they had their way with Jeremias; he should be left helpless in
the cistern of Melchias the son of Amelech,✻ there in the court where
the prisoners were kept. Into the cistern they lowered him with ropes;
there was no water in it now, only mire, and into the mire he sank.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But there was an Ethiopian chamberlain at the court, named
Abdemelech, that heard how Jeremias had been let down into the cistern;
and as the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` this Abdemelech came out from the palace and remonstrated with him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` My lord king, he said, here is foul wrong done to the prophet
Jeremias; they have let him down into a cistern, where he will die of
hunger, such lack of bread there is in the city.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Why then, said the king to Abdemelech the Ethiopian, take thirty✻
men with thee, and rescue Jeremias from the cistern while there is yet
life in him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So Abdemelech took the men with him, made his way into the palace,
beneath the store-chamber, took old rags and clouts that lay mouldering
there, and let them down by ropes to Jeremias in the cistern.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Here be torn things and mouldering, the Ethiopian said to Jeremias,
but thou mayst put these under thy arm-pits, and the ropes under these
again. Jeremias obeyed,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and they pulled him up by the ropes till he was clear of the
cistern; but the courtyard was his prison still.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then king Sedecias would have the prophet come to him by the third
door of the palace, the one that leads to the temple. I have a question
to ask thee, he said to Jeremias; hide nothing from me.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Why, Jeremias answered, if I tell thee what I know, thou wilt but
kill me, and if I give thee advice, thou wilt not heed it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But king Sedecias took a secret oath, As the Lord is a living God,
the Lord who gave us this breath we breathe, slay thee I will not, nor
hand thee over to thy mortal enemies.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thereupon Jeremias told him a message from the Lord, the God of
hosts: Go out and give thyself up to Nabuchodonosor’s chieftains, and
thy life shall be safe, nor shall there be any burning of the city;
thou and thine shall be spared.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` If thou dost not give thyself up to them, then the Chaldaeans shall
gain mastery of the city and burn it to the ground, and for thyself
there is no escaping them.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Yet my heart misgives me, Sedecias told him, over the Jews that
have already made their submission; what if I should be handed over to
these, and they wreak their spite on me?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` That shall not be, Jeremias answered. Give heed, only give heed, to
this message from the Lord I bear thee; so thou shalt speed well, and
life be granted thee.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Refuse to yield, and here is the doom he has made known to me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Never a woman that is left in the palace of the kings of Juda but
shall be spoil for the chieftains of the king of Babylon! And as they
are led away, this shall be their lament: False friend fooled thee, and
had the better of thee; feet fast in the treacherous morass has left
thee!
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Wife of thine and son of thine led away into the enemy’s camp, and
thou thyself powerless to escape; thyself the king of Babylon shall
take prisoner, and burn thy city to the ground.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` On peril of thy life, king Sedecias warned him, let none hear what
has passed between us.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` If it reach the ears of the nobles that we have had speech
together, and they bid thee repeat what thou saidst, or what said the
king, hiding nothing as thou holdest thy life dear, then be this thy
answer,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Why, I pleaded my suit with the king’s grace that he would not have
me sent back to Jonathan’s house, to die there.✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Come and ask him they did, and he answered as the king bade him; so
with that they let him be; nothing had been overheard.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` This imprisonment of Jeremias in the courtyard lasted until the
taking of Jerusalem; for, sure enough, Jerusalem was taken.

Notas de rodapé:
38:1-6 - Jeremiah is thrown into a pit but is rescued by Ebed-Melech,
an Ethiopian official. This event symbolizes the resistance to God's
plan and the faithfulness of some in supporting the prophets.
Ebed-Melech's actions highlight the importance of defending those who
38:7-13 - Ebed-melech asks King Zedekiah for intervention,
demonstrating that even in times of apostasy, there are those who
defend God's cause. The support of righteous people is vital to the
38:14-28 - Jeremiah is called again to hear God's word, and he advises
Zedekiah on surrender to Babylon. The choice between trusting God or
fighting against God's will is a central theme of the book of Jeremiah
