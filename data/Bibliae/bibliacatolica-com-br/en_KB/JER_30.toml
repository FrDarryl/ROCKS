"1" = ''':sup:`1` Word came to Jeremias from the Lord,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` the God of Israel, bidding him write down in a book the revelation
made known to him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` A time is coming, the Lord says, when I will reverse the sentence of
exile against my people of Israel and Juda; I, the Lord, will restore
them to possession of the land I gave to their fathers.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` This is the divine promise made to Israel and Juda:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` A cry of terror, the Lord says, for all to hear! All is
consternation, where all was peace.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Why, here is a riddle and a wonder; can motherhood fall to the lot
of men folk? Why is there none to be seen but goes by, hand on loins,
cheeks blanched, like a woman in travail?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Alas for pity, what a day is this, none like it; what a time of
distress for Jacob’s race! Yet it shall leave them unharmed.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` A promise they have from the Lord of hosts that he will break the
yoke they bear, when that day comes, and part their chains asunder; no
more shall they be at the mercy of alien masters,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` they shall obey the Lord their God only, and that David-king of
theirs whom he will give them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Have thou no fear, the Lord says, Jacob, that art my servant still;
not for Israel is danger brewing. From that far country of exile I mean
to restore thee, restore those children of thine; Jacob shall return,
and live at ease, every blessing shall enjoy, and enemies have none to
fear;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I am at thy side, the Lord says, to protect thee. Of all the lands
in which I have dispersed thee I will take full toll, but not of thee;
I would but chasten thee with due measure kept, lest thou shouldst hold
thyself altogether acquitted.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Poor Sion, thine is a wound past curing, a grievous hurt, the Lord
says;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` no man brings thee redress or remedy, salve to heal thee thou hast
none;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` thy old lovers think of thee no more, woo thee no more. A shrewd
blow I struck thee, unsparing of correction; so many thy misdoings, thy
guilt so inveterate.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Misdoings a many, and guilt inveterate, these be the cause of thy
hurt, and I the doer of it; and wouldst thou cry out upon a grief there
is no remedying?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Only be sure of this, the enemies that prey on thee shall
themselves fall a prey to exile; spoiled thy spoilers shall be, and all
that plunder thee I will give up to plunder.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then I will heal that scar of thine, the Lord says, cure thee of
thy wounds; too soon they called thee a neglected bride, Sion the
unwooed!
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Nay, says the Lord, I mean to bring tent-dwelling Jacob home, have
pity on those ruined walls, build the city anew on its height, set up
the temple and its ordinances anew;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` here songs of praise shall echo once again, and cries of mirth.
They shall increase, that hitherto had dwindled, be exalted, that once
were brought low.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then, as in days of old, the full muster of the tribes shall have
its place in my regard; who wrongs them shall be called to account for
it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` A prince of their own race they shall have, a home-born ruler,
singled out by my own call to serve me; that office, the Lord says,
none may take on himself unbidden.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You shall be my own people, and I your own God.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Like a whirlwind it will suddenly appear, the Lord’s vengeance;
will break in storm, and light upon rebel heads.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Nor shall the divine anger be appeased till the blow has been
struck and the decree executed; what his design was, will be known all
too well, all too late.✻
