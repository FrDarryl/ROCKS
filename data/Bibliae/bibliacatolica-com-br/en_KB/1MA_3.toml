"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now his son Judas, that was called Machabaeus, came forward to
succeed him;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` nor any of Judas’ clan, nor any that had taken his father’s part,
but lent him their aid still; right merrily they fought Israel’s
battle.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Here was one that brought his race renown; as great a warrior as
ever donned breastplate, or armed himself for the fight, or drew sword
to save his camp from peril;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` lion-hearted his deeds, not lion itself more relentless in pursuit.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Traitors he ever sought out and hunted down, ever with fire-brand
the oppressors of his people dislodged,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` till enemy was none but was daunted by the fear of him, traitor was
none but fled in confusion, so well sped he the work of deliverance.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Great deeds, that kings rued bitterly, Jacob with exultation heard,
posterity holds blessed evermore!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` From city to city he went, ridding Juda of its law-breakers,
averting the vengeance guilt of theirs had deserved;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` no corner of earth but he was renowned there, for one that had been
able to rally a doomed people.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` How sped Apollonius, that mustered a great force, of Gentiles and
Samaritans both, to fight against Israel?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No sooner Judas heard of it, than he met and routed and slew him;
fell many and fled more,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` leaving their spoils behind them. The sword of Apollonius Judas
himself carried away; and this it was he evermore used in battle.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And next it was Seron, captain of the armies in Syria, heard what a
great retinue and faithful following Judas had;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and nothing would serve, but he must win renown and high favour at
court by crushing Judas, and all other his companions that defied the
king’s edict.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So he made all ready, and marched in with a strong muster of the
ungodly at his heels, to be even with the men of Israel.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` As far as Bethoron pass they reached, and there Judas met them with
his company, no better than a handful.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` These, when they saw such a host facing them, were for counsels of
prudence; What, they said to Judas, should we offer battle to foes so
many and so strong, faint as we be from a day of hungry marching?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Nay, said Judas, nothing forbids great numbers should be at the
mercy of small; what matter makes it to the God of heaven, few be his
soldiers or many when he grants deliverance?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Armed might avails not to win the day; victory is from above.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` What though they come to meet us in the proud confidence of
superior strength, and think it an easy matter to slay us, slay our
wives and children, plunder our goods?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Life and loyalty at stake, we will offer battle none the less;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and he, the Lord, will crush them to earth at our coming; never be
afraid.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And with that, all unawares, he fell upon Seron and his army, that
were crushed, sure enough, by his onslaught;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` all down the pass of Bethoron he gave them chase, down into the
plain, and eight hundred of them had fallen before ever they took
refuge in the country of the Philistines.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` By this, the neighbouring peoples had begun to take alarm, so
formidable did Judas and his brethren appear to them,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and the renown of him reached the king’s court; all the world was
talking of Judas and his victories.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` An angry man was king Antiochus when the news came to him; he sent
word round, and had all his army summoned together, a brave array, be
sure of it.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The treasury must be opened, to provide the troops with a whole
year’s pay, and keep them in readiness for every need.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Why, what was this? So heavily had Juda suffered, so great the
discord he had aroused by the abolishing of its ancient usages, that
scant revenue had come in from it, and the treasury was in default!
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Whence, now, to defray the cost of that largesse he had made so
often, and with so lavish a hand? Never was king before him could rival
his munificence.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Here was the king in great confusion of mind; and his thought was,
to march into Persia and take toll of those countries; great store of
money he might there amass.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He left Lysias behind, that was a man of high rank and royal blood;
he was to administer all the business of the kingdom, from Euphrates
down to the Brook of Egypt,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and have charge of the young prince Antiochus, until the king’s
return.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Half his army he entrusted to Lysias, and the elephants besides;
and he signified all that he would have done, concerning Juda and
Jerusalem particularly.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` A force must be sent to overpower all that fought for Israel, or
were yet left in Jerusalem, and make a clean riddance of them; no trace
of these must be left;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` all through the country settlers must be brought in from abroad,
and the lands allotted between them.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` With that, the king left his capital of Antioch, taking the
remainder of his army with him; it was the hundred and forty-seventh
year of the empire. Soon he was across Euphrates river, and on the
march through the high countries.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Three generals Lysias appointed for the task; Ptolemy son of
Dorymenes, Nicanor and Gorgias, nobles all that were high in the royal
favour;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` with forty thousand foot and seven thousand horse they were to
march on Juda and make an end of it, as the king had ordered.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` So out they went, with all this army at their back, marched in, and
pitched their tents near Emmaus, down in the valley.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Be sure the traders all about were apprised of their coming, and
made their way into the camp with great sums of silver and gold, and a
retinue of servants besides, thinking to buy Israelite slaves; levies,
too, from Syria and Philistia made common cause with the invader.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Judas, then, and his brethren found that matters had gone from bad
to worse; here were the enemy encamped within their frontiers; they
heard, besides, what orders the king had given for the destruction and
taking away of their people.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And the word went round among them, Now to restore the lost
fortunes of our race; now to do battle for people of ours, sanctuary of
ours!
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` So a general assembly was called; they must make ready for the
fight, and pray besides, to win mercy and pardon.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Not at Jerusalem; Jerusalem lay there, no city but a desert waste,
nor any of her sons came and went; her sanctuary defiled, her citadel
garrisoned by the alien, she was but a haunt of the Gentiles. Sad days
for the men of Jacob; pipe nor harp sounded there now.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` At Maspha, then, they gathered, looking across towards Jerusalem;
time was when Maspha, too, had its place of prayer.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` All that day they fasted, and wore sackcloth, and covered their
heads with ashes, and tore their garments about them.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` What sights were these? Here, lying open, was a copy of the law,
such as the heathen were ever making search for, … the counterpart of
their own images.✻
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Here they had brought priestly vestments, and offering of
first-fruits and tithes; here Nazirites were gathered, ripe and ready
for the payment of their vows.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And a loud cry rose to heaven, What shall we do for these, thy
votaries? Whither escort them now?
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Sanctuary of thine is all profanation and defilement, priesthood of
thine all misery and despair.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` And now, see where the heathen muster their armies to destroy us!
Needs not we should tell thee, how murderous their intent.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Lord, but for thy aid, how shall we resist their onslaught?
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Loudly their voices, and loud the trumpets rang.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` Thereupon Judas chose out who should be their leaders, one with a
thousand, one with a hundred, one with fifty, one with ten men to
follow him;
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` he sent home, too, all such as the law holds exempt; all that had
but just built house, or married wife, or planted vineyard, and whoever
had no stomach to the fight.✻
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` Then they moved camp, and pitched their tents southward of Emmaus.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Now for girded loins, cried Judas, and brave hearts! By to-morrow’s
light, you must engage yonder heathen, sworn enemies to us, and to the
ground we hold sacred.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Better die in battle, than live to see our race and our sanctuary
overpowered.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` Be it what it may, heaven’s will be done!
'''

3:1-3 - Judas Maccabeus takes the lead and rebuilds the people's
morale, earning a reputation for his courage and faith. His name
