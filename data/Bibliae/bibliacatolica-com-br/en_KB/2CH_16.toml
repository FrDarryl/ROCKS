"3" = ''':sup:`3` There is an alliance between us; were not thy father and mine ever
at peace? Witness these gifts of silver and gold I send thee; do thou
annul the treaty thou hast made with Baasa, king of Israel, and help me
drive him out of my country.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Thus approached, Benadad sent out his generals with orders to attack
the cities of Israel; Ahion they overcame, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and

wood-work that should have been used towards it, and with these
fortified Gabaa and Maspha instead.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thereupon the prophet Hanani came into the royal presence, with this
