"1" = ''':sup:`1` When he put up buildings in the Keep of David, he was careful to
leave a plot of ground for God’s ark, and pitch a tent for it there.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He thought to himself, too, God’s ark must not be carried this way
and that by the first comer; the Levites, whom the Lord has chosen out
to be his servants for all time, have the duty of carrying it.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So now, summoning all Israel to Jerusalem, for the removal of the
ark to the site he had prepared for it,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` he summoned among the rest Aaron’s descendants, and the Levites.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` There were a hundred and twenty Caathites, under Uriel,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` two hundred and twenty Merarites, under Asaia,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` a hundred and thirty Gersonites, under Joel,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` two hundred of Elisaphan’s clan, under Semeias,

"9" = ''':sup:`9` eighty of Hebron’s, under Eliel,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` and a hundred and twelve of Oziel’s, under Aminadab.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` These six David sent for, with the chief priests, Sadoc and
Abiathar;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` You, he said, are the chiefs of the Levite clans; look well to it
that you and your brethren are purified of all defilement before you
bring the ark of the Lord God of Israel to the site prepared for it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Earlier, when you were not there, we brought on ourselves the
Lord’s chastisement; there must be no such happening now, for want of
due order taken.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So priest and Levite cleansed themselves for carrying the ark of
the Lord God of Israel;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and the ark was carried by Levites, with poles resting on their
shoulders, as Moses, speaking in the Lord’s name, had enjoined.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then David would have the Levite chiefs appoint some of their
brethren to be singers, chanting there with instruments of music,
zither and harp and cymbals, till heaven rang with the echoes of their
rejoicing.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So they appointed two Gersonites, Joel’s son Heman and Asaph son of
Barachias, and Ethan, son of Casias, of the clan of Merari,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` with others of lesser degree, their fellow clansmen, Zacharias,
Ben, Jaziel, Semiramoth, Jahiel, Ani, Eliab, Banaias, Maasias,
Mathathias, Eliphalu, Macenias, Obededom and Jehiel, that all held the
office of door-keeper.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Of these singers, Heman, Asaph and Ethan beat cymbals together,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Zacharias, Oziel, Semiramoth, Jahiel, Ani, Eliab, Maasias and
Banaias played, on their zithers, the Alamoth,✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` while Mathathias, Eliphalu, Macenias, Obededom, Jehiel and Ozaziu
led the triumph-song, Seminith-fashion,✻ with the harps they bore.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Chonenias, chief of the Levites, was burden-master,✻ a
burden-master chosen for his excellent skill.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The doors of the ark were guarded by Barachias and Elcana;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and there were seven priests, Sebenias, Josaphat, Nathanael,
Amasai, Zacharias, Banaias and Eliezer, that blew trumpets before it.
(And the doors of the ark were guarded by Obededom and Jehias.✻ )
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So with great rejoicing went David, and with him went all the
elders of Israel and all his captains, to Obededom’s house, to fetch
the ark that bears witness of the Lord’s covenant.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And as the Lord sped the Levites on their journey, with the ark for
their load, seven bulls and seven rams were offered in sacrifice.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Like the Levites who carried the ark, the singers, and Chonenias
that went as burden-master among the singers, David was clad in a robe
of lawn; and he had a mantle of linen as well.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Thus all Israel brought the ark home, keeping high festival, to the
sound of horn and trumpet and cymbals and zither and harp.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Only Michal, Saul’s daughter, watching from her window as the ark
reached David’s Citadel, thought scorn of king David as she saw him
dancing and making music there.✻

Notas de rodapé:
15:1-3 - David prepares a special place for the ark and arranges for
its proper transportation, demonstrating the care and reverence that
must be taken when handling sacred things. He corrects his earlier

themselves and carry the ark as God instructed, revealing the
importance of holiness and obedience in serving the Lord (see also
15:16-18 - David organizes a large choir and musicians to lead the
worship of the Lord. Music and praise are an integral part of
worshiping God, expressing joy and gratitude for His presence (see also
15:25-28 - David and all Israel bring the ark back to Jerusalem with
great joy and celebration. This event symbolizes the centrality of
God's presence among the people and the role of communal worship (see
15:29 - Saul's daughter Michal despises David for his exuberant
behavior in worship. This contrasts David's reverence with Michal's
pride, showing that true worship must be free of self-sufficiency (see
