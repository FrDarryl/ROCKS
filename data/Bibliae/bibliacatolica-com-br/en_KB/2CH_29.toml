[29]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Ezechias was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne, and
his reign at Jerusalem lasted twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was
Abia, the daughter of Zacharias.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Here was one that obeyed the Lord’s will no less than his father
David before him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` In the first year of his reign, when the first month came round, he
opened the gates of the Lord’s house again, and put them in repair.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then he summoned the priests and the Levites to assemble in the open
space east of the temple.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Men of Levi, he said, it is my will that you should cleanse
yourselves; cleanse, too, the house of the Lord, the God of your
fathers, and rid his sanctuary of all defilement.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Ours is an inheritance of guilt, from fathers who have disobeyed the
Lord our God, and forsaken him; turned their backs on his
dwelling-place, where their eyes should ever be.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Fast shut were the gates of yonder porch, spent the lamps, never did
incense smoke, never was victim offered in the sanctuary of the God of
Israel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` What wonder if the Lord was angry with Juda and Jerusalem, doomed
them to unrest, and ruin, and disgrace, such as you see all around?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What wonder if they fell in battle, these fathers of ours; if sons
and daughters and wives were carried off into exile?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Here, then, is my resolve; we must bind ourselves by a covenant to
the Lord our God, if his fierce anger is to relent.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` As my own sons I charge you, do not stand by with folded hands; on
you the Lord’s choice has fallen, to wait upon his presence,
ministering, and doing worship, and burning incense before him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Well did the Levites answer his call; Mahath son of Amasai and Joel
son of Azarias, Caathites; Cis son of Abdi and Azarias son of Jalaleel,
Merarites; Joah son of Zemma and Joah’s son Eden, Gersonites;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` of Elisaphan’s sons, Samri and Jahiel, of Asaph’s, Zacharias and
Mathanias,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` of Heman’s, Jahiel and Semei, of Idithun’s, Semeias and Oziel.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Mustering their brethren, they purified themselves, and so,
obedient to the royal command and the divine will, entered into God’s
house to cleanse it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The priests, too, were in the Lord’s temple for the cleansing; no
unhallowed thing they found in porch or temple but the Levites carried
it away, into the Cedron valley beyond.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It was on the first day of the first month that they set about
their task; on the eighth day of the same month they were still in the
porch, and then they took eight days more ridding the temple itself of
defilement; by the sixteenth day, their undertaking was complete.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And now they craved audience with king Ezechias; We have cleansed
the Lord’s house, they told him, and the altar of burnt-sacrifice, with
all that belongs to it, the table of hallowed loaves, and all that
belongs to the table.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` We have cleansed all the temple furniture that was profaned in the
time of king Achaz, when he fell a-sinning; all this thou wilt find
laid out before the Lord’s altar.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Next day, Ezechias was abroad early, with all the chief men of the
city gathered about him, to make his way into the house of the Lord.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Seven bulls they offered, seven rams, seven lambs; seven goats,
too, as an offering for fault; all this on behalf of the royal house,
of the priestly line, and of Juda.✻ And the king bade the priests,
Aaron’s sons, offer the victims at the Lord’s altar.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So bulls and rams and lambs were slaughtered, and the altar
received their blood;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` the goats were brought out into the presence of king and people,
who laid their hands on them,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and then the priests slaughtered them, and poured out their blood
at the altar to expiate Israel’s common guilt; the king’s command was
that burnt-sacrifice and offering for fault should both be offered on
behalf of the whole people.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He had bidden the Levites take their stations, there in the Lord’s
house, with cymbals, harp, and zither, as David enjoined; as Gad, the
man of visions, and the prophet Nathan enjoined, for it was through
these prophets of his that David had learned the Lord’s will.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` There stood the Levites, with instruments of David’s own, and the
priests with their trumpets;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and when Ezechias gave the word, and the burnt-sacrifice began,
loud echoed their praises to the Lord, loud the trumpets blew, loud
rang the music planned by David, king of Israel, long ago.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Still must singer and trumpeter be at their task among the throng
of worshippers, till all the sacrifice was consumed;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and when this was over, while the king and all his company bowed
down to adore,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` these Levites were bidden by the king and his nobles to praise the
Lord with psalms of David, and of Asaph, the man of visions. Praise him
they did with hearts full of joy, and they too bowed down to worship.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` It was not enough; Here, said Ezechias, are hands consecrated to
the Lord afresh; come forward, and present victim and thank-offering in
the Lord’s house. Thereupon the whole multitude brought victims and
thank-offerings, and some, in their devotion, whole burnt-sacrifice.✻
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` In burnt-sacrifice they offered seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and
two hundred lambs,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and consecrated to the Lord six hundred cattle and three thousand
sheep.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The priests were too few in number to flay so many burnt-offerings
at once, and the Levites must needs help them to finish their task,
till such time as more priests should have rid themselves of
defilement; such cleansing is an easier matter for Levite than for
priest.✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` So much work there was to do with all the burnt-sacrifice that must
be performed; the fat, too, of the welcome-offerings must be burned,
and libations poured over the sacrifices.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Thus was the worship of the Lord’s house restored in full. Greatly
did Ezechias and all the people rejoice over their duty well done, for
all that the resolve was taken so suddenly.
