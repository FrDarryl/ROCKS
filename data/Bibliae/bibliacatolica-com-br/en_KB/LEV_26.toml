idols have fallen, you too will fall. Such will be my loathing for you

indeed; while you are far away,

sabbath of utter loneliness, that land which was never given rest by
any sabbath of yours, while you dwelt there.

"36" = ''':sup:`36` Those of you who are left will be faint-hearted in the lands of
your enemies, ready to take flight at the fall of a leaf, as if it were
