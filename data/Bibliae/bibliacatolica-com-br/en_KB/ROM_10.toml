"1" = ''':sup:`1` Brethren, they have all the good will of my heart, all my prayers to
God, for their salvation.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` That they are jealous for God’s honour, I can testify; but it is
with imperfect understanding.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They did not recognize God’s way of justification, and so they tried
to institute a way of their own, instead of submitting to his.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Christ has superseded the law, bringing justification to anyone who
will believe.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The account which Moses gives of that justification which comes from
the law, is that a man will find life in its commandments if he
observes them.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But the justification which comes from faith makes a different
claim; Do not say, Who will scale heaven for us? (as if we had to bring
Christ down to earth),
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` or, Who will go down into the depth for us? (as if we had to bring
Christ back from the dead).
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` No, says the scripture, the message is close to thy hand, it is on
thy lips, it is in thy heart; meaning by that the message of faith,
which we preach.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Thou canst find salvation, if thou wilt use thy lips to confess that
Jesus is the Lord, and thy heart to believe that God has raised him up
from the dead.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The heart has only to believe, if we are to be justified; the lips
have only to make confession, if we are to be saved.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` That is what the scripture says, Anyone who believes in him will
not be disappointed.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` There is no distinction made here between Jew and Gentile; all
alike have one Lord, and he has enough and to spare for all those who
call upon him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Only, how are they to call upon him until they have learned to
believe in him? And how are they to believe in him, until they listen
to him? And how can they listen, without a preacher to listen to?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And how can there be preachers, unless preachers are sent on their
errand? So we read in scripture, How welcome is the coming of those who
tell of peace, who tell of good news.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` True, there are some who have not obeyed the call of the gospel; so
Isaias says, Lord, who has given us a faithful hearing?✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` (See how faith comes from hearing; and hearing through Christ’s
word.)✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But, tell me, did the news never come to them? Why, yes; the
utterance fills every land, the message reaches the ends of the world.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And, tell me, was not Israel warned of it? Why, there is a saying
that goes back to Moses, I will make them jealous of a nation that is
no nation at all; I will put rivalry between them and a nation which
has never learnt wisdom.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Isaias speaks out boldly, Those who never looked for me have
found me; I have made myself known to those who never asked for word of
me;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and he says of Israel, I have stretched out my hands all day to a
people that refuses obedience and cries out against me.✻

Notas de rodapé:
10:9-13 - Confessing faith in Jesus Christ is fundamental to salvation.
Paul emphasizes the importance of believing and confessing with the
mouth, emphasizing that there is no distinction between Jews and
10:14-17 - The preaching of the gospel is essential for salvation, and
Paul emphasizes the need to send preachers so that everyone can hear
the message of Christ. Faith comes by hearing the word of Christ (see
10:18-21 - Paul asserts that the gospel has already been proclaimed to
all, and Israel's refusal to accept Christ fulfills Scripture.
Rejection of God and rejection of the gospel are recurring themes in
10:1-2 - Paul expresses the desire for his fellow Jews to be saved, but
notes that they seek righteousness through works of the law rather than
10:5-8 - Paul contrasts righteousness based on the law with
righteousness by faith. Righteousness by faith in Christ is accessible
to all, requiring no great deeds, but merely the acceptance of the
