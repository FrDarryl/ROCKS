"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
11:1-8 - God gives instructions regarding clean and unclean animals,
highlighting the separation He requires between the holy and the
profane. The distinction between foods is a symbol of purity and
10:14-15).
11:9-12 - The dietary rules also apply to aquatic creatures, with only
those with fins and scales being permitted. This reinforces the
principle of purity and obedience to God's commandments, even in the
Corinthians 10:31).
11:13-19 - God forbids the consumption of various birds and winged
creatures, instructing the people to maintain purity even in their
dietary choices. Obeying the purity laws reflects God's holiness (see
11:20-23 - Instructions about which insects may and may not be eaten
reinforce God's concern for purity in all aspects of life. This
separation is a constant reminder that God's people must be holy (see
11:44-45 - God commands His people to be holy because He is holy.
Separating unclean foods is a practical way to remind Israel of their
identity as a holy nation, set apart for the Lord's service (see also
