"4" = ''':sup:`4` and still he will not listen. Then Egypt shall feel the weight of my
hand, and I will deliver the Israelites, my army, my people, out of
Egypt, with signal acts of redress.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All Egypt shall know that it was I, the Lord, who raised my hand
against it, and brought out the sons of Israel from its midst.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` This command of the Lord was faithfully carried out by Moses and
Aaron; they did all he bade them do.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` When Pharao asks you to shew him signs of your mission, thou, Moses,
shalt bid thy brother take up his staff and cast it down in Pharao’s

'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So Moses and Aaron gained Pharao’s audience and did as the Lord had
bidden them; Aaron brought out his staff in the presence of Pharao and
his court, and it turned into a serpent.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` At this, Pharao summoned his diviners and magicians, who, in their
turn, uttered secret spells in the Egyptian language and did the like;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` each man’s staff, when he cast it down, turned into a serpent; but
the staff of Aaron devoured them.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Meanwhile, Pharao’s heart was hardened, so that he would not obey
the Lord’s will and heed their warning.✻

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Betake thyself to him to-morrow morning; thou wilt find that he is
walking by the water side, and there on the bank of the river, thou

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and this shall be thy message to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And now the Lord has a new message for thee, to convince thee that
he is indeed the Lord. When I strike the water of the river with this
staff I carry, it will turn into blood;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` the fishes in the river will die, till its waters are full of
corruption; it will go hard with the Egyptians if they are for drinking

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then the Lord gave Moses a message for Aaron, Take up thy staff,
and stretch thy hand out over the waters of Egypt; all their rivers and
channels and marshes and pools of water. All must turn into blood;
blood in every bucket and pitcher, all over Egypt.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had bidden them; Aaron lifted up
his staff and struck the waters of the river in the presence of Pharao
and his court, and the river turned to blood.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` All the fishes in the river died, and its waters stank, so that the
Egyptians could not drink river water any longer, and there was blood
all over the land of Egypt.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the Egyptian magicians did as much with spells of their own;
and Pharao’s heart was still hardened, still he would not obey the
Lord’s will and heed their warning.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He turned away and went home, paying no more attention to them than
before.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` So passed the first week after the Lord smote the river.
