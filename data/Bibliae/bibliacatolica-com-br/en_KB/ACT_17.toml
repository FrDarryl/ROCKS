"1" = ''':sup:`1` They continued their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia, and
so reached Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a synagogue,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and Paul, as his custom was, paid them a visit there. Over a space
of three sabbaths he reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` expounding these and bringing proofs from them that the sufferings
of Christ and his rising from the dead were fore-ordained; the Christ,
he said, is none other than the Jesus whom I am preaching to you.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Some of them were convinced, and threw in their lot with Paul and
Silas; a great number, too, of those Gentiles who worshipped the true
God, and not a few of the leading women.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The Jews were indignant at this, and they found confederates among
the riff-raff of the market-place, to make a disturbance and throw the
city into an uproar. Then they made a sudden descent on Jason’s house,
in the hope of bringing Paul and Silas out into the presence of the
people;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but, as they could not find them, they dragged Jason✻and some of the
brethren before the city council, crying out, Here they are, the men
who are turning the state upside down; they have come here too;✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and Jason has given them hospitality. All these folk defy the edicts
of Caesar; they say there is another king, one Jesus.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Both the crowd and the city council took alarm at hearing this,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and they demanded bail from Jason and the others before they would
let them go.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Thereupon the brethren sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea;
where, as soon as they arrived, they made their way to the Jewish
synagogue.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` These were of a better breed than the Thessalonians; they welcomed
the word with all eagerness, and examined the scriptures, day after
day, to find out whether all this was true;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` so that many of them learned to believe, as certain Greek women of
fashion did, and not a few of the men as well.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But now some of the Thessalonian Jews, hearing that the word of God
had been preached by Paul at Beroea too, came on there, to upset and
disturb the minds of the multitude;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` whereupon the brethren sent Paul away, to continue his journey up
to the coast; Silas and Timothy remained there still.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Those who were escorting Paul on his journey saw him as far as
Athens, and then left him, with instructions for Silas and Timothy to
rejoin him as soon as possible.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his heart was moved
within him to find the city so much given over to idolatry,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and he reasoned, not only in the synagogue with Jews and
worshippers of the true God, but in the market-place, with all he met.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He encountered philosophers, Stoics and Epicureans, some of whom
asked, What can his drift be, this dabbler?✻ while others said, He
would appear to be proclaiming strange gods; because he had preached to
them about Jesus and Resurrection.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So they took him by the sleeve and led him up to the Areopagus; May
we ask, they said, what this new teaching is thou art delivering?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Thou dost introduce terms which are strange to our ears; pray let
us know what may be the meaning of it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` (No townsman of Athens, or stranger visiting it, has time for
anything else than saying something new, or hearing it said.)
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Paul stood up in full view of the Areopagus, and said, Men of
Athens, wherever I look I find you scrupulously religious.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Why, in examining your monuments as I passed by them, I found among
others an altar which bore the inscription, To the unknown God. And it
is this unknown object of your devotion that I am revealing to you.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The God who made the world and all that is in it, that God who is
Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples that our hands have
made;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` no human handicraft can do him service, as if he stood in need of
anything, he, who gives to all of us life and breath and all we have.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` It is he who has made, of one single stock, all the nations that
were to dwell over the whole face of the earth. And he has given to
each the cycles it was to pass through and the fixed limits of its
habitation,✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` leaving them to search for God; would they somehow grope their way
towards him? Would they find him? And yet, after all, he is not far
from any one of us;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` it is in him that we live, and move, and have our being; thus, some
of your own poets have told us, For indeed, we are his children.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Why then, if we are the children of God, we must not imagine that
the divine nature can be represented in gold, or silver, or stone,
carved by man’s art and thought.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` God has shut his eyes to these passing follies of ours; now, he
calls upon all men, everywhere, to repent,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` because he has fixed a day when he will pronounce just judgement on
the whole world. And the man whom he has appointed for that end he has
accredited to all of us, by raising him up from the dead.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` When resurrection from the dead was mentioned, some mocked, while
others said, We must hear more from thee about this.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So Paul went away from among them.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But there were men who attached themselves to him and learned to
believe, among them Dionysius the Areopagite; and so did a woman called
Damaris, and others with them.

Notas de rodapé:
17:2-3 - Paul, as he had often done, began preaching in the synagogues,
explaining the Scriptures and showing that the Messiah would have to
suffer. Paul's preaching emphasized the need to understand the
Scriptures in order to understand the plan of salvation (see also
17:22-23 - Paul addresses the Athenians, presenting the "unknown God"
as the true God, emphasizing that He does not dwell in temples made by
human hands. This discourse highlights the contrast between traditional
17:30-31 - Paul calls the Athenians to repentance, for God has
appointed a day of judgment. Jesus' resurrection is the foundation of
Corinthians 5:10).
17:34 - Some Athenians were converted to the gospel after hearing Paul,
reflecting the power of Christ's message to reach prepared hearts. The
conversion of Dionysius and Damaris is an example of God's grace in
