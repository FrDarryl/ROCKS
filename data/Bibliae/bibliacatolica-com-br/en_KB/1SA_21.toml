"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was to the priest Achimelech, at Nobe, that David betook himself.
Achimelech was dismayed at his coming; Why art thou alone, he asked,
with none to attend thee?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The king, David told him, has given me a task to perform, but errand
and instructions are both secret; and he has given me a trysting-place
where I am to meet my companions.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Hast thou food for them ready to hand, though it were but five
loaves? Let me have what thou canst afford.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Why, answered the priest, never a loaf have I here for common uses;
there is only the holy bread. Are they free from defilement, these
followers of thine, from the touch of woman, at least?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As to women, David told the priest, we are as clean as when we set
out a day or two back; and the packs the men carry are as clean as
themselves. This is no holy errand of ours, but it will not bring any
defilement, to-day, upon aught we carry with us.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So the priest gave him hallowed bread, since he had nothing but the
loaves which had been set out in the Lord’s presence, and must now be
taken away to make room for a new batch.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` One of Saul’s servants was there that day, waiting in the Lord’s
precincts, a man of Edom called Doeg, chief of Saul’s shepherds.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And now David said to Achimelech, Hast thou a sword or spear here
for me? My sword and all my weapons I left behind, so urgent was the
royal command.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Yes, answered the priest, there is the sword of the Philistine,
Goliath, whom thou didst slay in the Valley of the Terebinth. Wrapped
in a cloth it lies, behind the sacred mantle. If thou wilt take that,
take it; there is none other but that. And there is none other like
that, said David; give it me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` David set out the same day, to find refuge from Saul’s pursuit, and
betook himself to Achis, king of Geth.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And at the sight of him, Achis’ men said to their master, Why, is
not this David, a king in his own land? Was it not in his honour their
dancers used to sing, By Saul’s hand a thousand, by David’s ten
thousand fell?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` David marked their words well, and now he went in fear of Achis
king of Geth.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So he changed his mien when they were by, swooning in their hands
and clinging to the door-posts and letting the spittle fall on his
beard,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` till Achis told his men, Why, this is a madman you have found; why
must you bring him into my presence?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Have we not fools enough, that you bring this fellow in to let me
watch his antics? Is this the man you would have me take into my house?
