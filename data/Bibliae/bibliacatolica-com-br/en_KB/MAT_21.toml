[21]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` When they were near Jerusalem, and had reached Bethphage, which is
close to mount Olivet, Jesus sent two of his disciples on an errand;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Go into the village that faces you, he told them, and the first
thing you will find there will be a she-ass tethered, and a foal at her
side; untie them and bring them to me.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And if anyone speaks to you about it, tell him, The Lord has need of
them, and he will let you have them without more ado.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` All this was so ordained, to fulfil the word spoken by the prophet:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Tell the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy king is coming to thee,
humbly, riding on an ass, on a colt whose mother has borne the yoke.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The disciples went and did as Jesus told them;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` they brought the she-ass and its colt, and saddled them with their
garments, and bade Jesus mount.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Most of the multitude spread their garments along the way, while
others strewed the way with branches cut down from the trees.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the multitudes that went before him and that followed after him
cried aloud, Hosanna for the son of David, blessed is he who comes in
the name of the Lord, Hosanna in heaven above.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When he reached Jerusalem, the whole city was in a stir; Who is
this? they asked.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the multitude answered, This is Jesus, the prophet from
Nazareth, in Galilee.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove out from it all
those who sold and bought there, and overthrew the tables of the
bankers, and the chairs of the pigeon-sellers;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is written, he told them, My house shall be known for a house of
prayer, and you have made it into a den of thieves.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And there were blind and lame men who came up to him in the temple,
and he healed them there.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The chief priests and scribes saw the miracles which he did, and
the boys that cried aloud in the temple, Hosanna for the son of David,
and they were greatly angered at it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Dost thou hear what these are saying? they asked. Yes, Jesus said
to them, but have you never read the words, Thou hast made the lips of
children, of infants at the breast, vocal with praise?✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, where he made
his lodging.As he was returning to the city at daybreak, he was hungry:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and, seeing a fig-tree by the road-side, he went up to it, and
found nothing but leaves on it.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he said to it, Let no fruit ever grow on thee hereafter;
whereupon the fig-tree withered away.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` His disciples were amazed when they saw it; How suddenly it has
withered away! they said.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Jesus answered them, I promise you, if you have faith, and do not
hesitate, you will be able to do more than I have done over the
fig-tree; if you say to this mountain, Remove, and be cast into the
sea, it will come about.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` If you will only believe, every gift you ask for in your prayer
will be granted.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Afterwards he came into the temple; and while he was teaching
there, the chief priests and elders approached him, asking, What is the
authority by which thou doest these things, and who gave thee this
authority?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Jesus answered them, I too have a question to ask; if you can tell
me the answer, I will tell you in return what is the authority by which
I do these things.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Whence did John’s baptism come, from heaven or from men? Whereupon
they cast about in their minds;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` If we tell him it was from heaven, they said, he will ask us, Then
why did you not believe him? And if we say it was from men, we have
reason to be afraid of the people; they all look upon John as a
prophet.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And they answered Jesus, We cannot tell. He, in his turn, said, And
you will not learn from me what is the authority by which I do these
things.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But tell me what you think; there was a man who had two sons, and
when he went up to the first, and said, Away with thee, my son, and
work in my vineyard to-day,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` he answered; Not I, but he relented afterwards and went.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then he went up to the other, and said the like to him; and his
answer was, I will, sir; but he did not go.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Which of the two carried out his father’s will? The first, they
said. And Jesus said to them, Believe me, the publicans and the harlots
are further on the road to God’s kingdom than you.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` John came among you following all due observance, but could win no
belief from you; the publicans believed him, and the harlots, but even
when you saw that, you would not relent, and believe him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Listen to another parable. There was a rich man who planted a
vineyard; he walled it in, and dug a wine-press and built a tower in
it, and then let it out to some vine-dressers, while he went on his
travels.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` When vintage-time drew near, he sent his own servants on an errand
to the vine-dressers, to claim its revenues.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Whereupon the vine-dressers laid hands upon his servants; one they
beat, one they killed outright, one they stoned.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he sent other servants on a second errand, more than he had
sent at first, but they were used no better.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` After that, he sent his own son to them; They will have reverence,
he said, for my son.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But when the vine-dressers found his son coming to them, they said
among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and seize
upon the inheritance.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And they laid hands on him, thrust him out from the vineyard, and
killed him.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And now, what will the owner of the vineyard do to those
vine-dressers when he returns?
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` They said, He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and will
let out the vineyard to other vine-dressers, who will pay him his due
when the season comes.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And Jesus said to them, Have you never read those words in the
scriptures, The very stone which the builders rejected has become the
chief stone at the corner; this is the Lord’s doing, and it is
marvellous in our eyes?✻
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` I tell you, then, that the kingdom of God will be taken away from
you, and given to a people which yields the revenues that belong to it.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` As for the stone, when a man falls against it, he will break his
bones; when it falls upon him, it will scatter him like chaff.✻
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` The chief priests and the Pharisees saw clearly, when they heard
his parables, that it was of themselves he was speaking,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and would gladly have laid hands on him, but they were afraid of
the people, who looked upon him as a prophet.✻

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
21:1-11 - Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem as the messianic King
Kingdom of God is near. Hailed with palm branches, Jesus is recognized
as the Messiah, but His kingship differs from popular expectation (see
21:12-17 - The cleansing of the temple, where Jesus drives out the
moneychangers and declares, "My house will be called a house of
prayer," reveals His authority over religion and His mission to restore
21:18-22 - Jesus curses the barren fig tree as a symbol of judgment on
Israel's lack of spiritual fruit. True faith moves mountains, and the
example of the fig tree teaches us that we must bear fruit of
2:26).
21:23-27 - Jesus responds to the religious leaders' question about His
authority with a parable and wisdom that confounds them. He challenges
the Pharisees to acknowledge the truth of His mission, showing that the
Kingdom of God is given to those who practice righteousness (see also
21:28-32 - The parable of the two sons illustrates the difference
between the appearance of obedience and true obedience. Jesus
criticizes the religious leaders for their hypocrisy and extols the
faith of repentant sinners, as exemplified by the tax collectors and
