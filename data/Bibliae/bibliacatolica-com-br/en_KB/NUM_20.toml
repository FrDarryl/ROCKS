"1" = ''':sup:`1` A new year was beginning, when the Israelites, marching in their
full strength, reached the desert of Sin. Here, while they were halting
at Cades, Mary died and was buried.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And now, hard put to it for want of water, the people made common
cause against Moses and Aaron,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` rebelling against their authority. Better for us, they said, if we
had died when our brethren died, by the Lord’s visitation!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` What need was there you should call the Lord’s people out into a
desert that is death to us and to our cattle?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Why must you take us away from Egypt, and bring us out to this sorry
place we cannot cultivate? Figs and grapes and pomegranates it yields
none, and we have no water, even, to drink.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` At this, when they had broken up the gathering, Moses and Aaron went
into the tabernacle that bore record of the covenant, and there cast
themselves down to earth in entreaty. Lord God, they said, listen to
the plea made by this people of thine, and open to them thy store-house
of fresh water, to content them and put an end to their complaints!
Then the bright presence of the Lord was revealed to them;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Take thy rod with thee, and do thou and thy brother Aaron gather all
the people together. Before their eyes, lay thy command upon the rock
here, and it will yield water. This water thou bringest out of the rock
will suffice to give drink to the whole multitude, and to their cattle.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So Moses took up the rod, there in the Lord’s presence, as he was
bidden,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and they made the people gather before the rock. Listen to me, he
said, faithless rebels; are we to get you water out of this rock?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Twice Moses lifted his hand, and smote the rock with his rod;
whereupon water gushed out in abundance, so that all the people and
their cattle had enough to drink.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Why did you not trust in me,
and vindicate my holiness in the sight of Israel? It will not be yours
to lead this multitude into the land I mean to give them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` This is the place called the Water of Rebellion, where the
Israelites challenged the Lord, and he vindicated his holiness before
them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` From Cades, Moses sent envoys to the king of Edom, with a message
to him from his brethren of Israel: Thou knowest what hardships have
overtaken us;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` how our fathers made their way into Egypt, how they and we were
ill-used by the Egyptians during the long time we spent there,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` how we cried out to the Lord, till he listened to us and sent an
angel to rescue us from Egypt. And now we are here at Cades, on the
frontier of thy dominions;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` what we ask of thee is leave to pass through this land of thine.
There shall be no marching through fields or vineyards, no drinking at
thy wells; we will travel by the high road, not to right or left, until
we have passed beyond thy frontiers.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But the Edomites refused to let them pass, threatening armed
resistance.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Let Israel promise as they would to use only the public highway, to
pay in full for all they or their beasts might drink, without haggling
over the price, to make a quick passage of it;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` still Edom refused, coming out to meet them there and then in great
force, ready to overpower them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The Israelites, then, since no entreaties could move them to grant
the right of passage, left the Edomites alone and turned elsewhere.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So, leaving Cades behind them, they reached Mount Hor, on the edge
of the Edomite country;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and here it was that the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Aaron must become a part of his people. For him, there is no
entering the land which is your promised home, so unfaithful was he to
my word at the Water of Rebellion.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Take Aaron and his son with thee to the top of mount Hor,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` strip the father of his priestly garments and clothe his son
Eleazar with them instead; there Aaron shall die, and become part of
his race.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So Moses did as the Lord bade him; together they went up mount Hor
in the sight of the whole multitude,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and there he stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on his son
Eleazar,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and came back with Eleazar alone, leaving Aaron dead on the
mountain top.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And the whole people, thus apprised of Aaron’s death, mourned over
him, all alike, for thirty days.

Notas de rodapé:
20:1-5 - The people complain again about the lack of water at Meribah.
This reflects the Israelites' pattern of murmuring and lack of faith,
even after witnessing God's miracles in the wilderness (see also
20:6-9 - Moses and Aaron seek God's guidance, and He instructs Moses to
speak to the rock so that water may come out. This event highlights the
20:10-13 - Moses, however, strikes the rock instead of speaking to it,
as God had commanded. For this disobedience, Moses and Aaron are barred
from entering the Promised Land. This demonstrates that even spiritual
leaders are held accountable for their actions (see also Deuteronomy
20:14-21 - The Edomites deny passage to the Israelites, despite being
distant relatives. This incident reflects the tensions between the
peoples and the difficulty Israel faces on the road to the Promised
20:22-29 - Aaron's death is narrated when he is succeeded by his son
Eleazar. Aaron's succession highlights the continuity of the Levitical
priesthood and the fulfillment of God's promises to maintain the
