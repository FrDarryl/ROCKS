"1" = ''':sup:`1` Two days afterwards, there was a wedding-feast at Cana, in Galilee;
and Jesus’ mother was there.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Jesus himself, and his disciples, had also been invited to the
wedding.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Here the supply of wine failed; whereupon Jesus’ mother said to him,
They have no wine left.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Jesus answered her, Nay, woman, why dost thou trouble me with that?
My time has not come yet.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And his mother said to the servants, Do whatever he tells you.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` There were six water-pots standing there, as the Jewish custom of
ceremonial washing demanded; they were of stone, and held two or three
firkins apiece.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when Jesus said, Fill the water-pots with water, they filled
these up to the brim.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then he said to them, Now draw, and give a draught to the master of
the feast. So they gave it to him;✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and the master of the feast tasted this water, which had now been
turned into wine. He did not know whence it came; only the servants who
had drawn the water knew that. The master of the feast, then, called to
the bridegroom,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and said to him, It is ever the good wine that men set out first,
and the worse kind only when all have drunk deep; thou hast kept the
good wine till now.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So, in Cana of Galilee, Jesus began his miracles, and made known
the glory that was his, so that his disciples learned to believe in
him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` After this he went down to Capharnaum with his mother, his
brethren, and his disciples, not staying there many days.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And now the paschal feast which the Jews keep was drawing near, so
Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And in the temple there he found the merchants selling oxen and
sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting at their trade.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So he made a kind of whip out of cords, and drove them all, with
their sheep and oxen, out of the temple, spilling the bankers’ coins
and overthrowing their tables;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and he said to the pigeon-sellers, Take these away, do not turn my
Father’s house into a place of barter.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And his disciples remembered how it is written, I am consumed with
jealousy for the honour of thy house.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then the Jews answered him, What sign canst thou shew us as thy
warrant for doing this?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Jesus answered them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will
raise it up again.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` At which the Jews said, This temple took forty-six years to build;
wilt thou raise it up in three days?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But the temple he was speaking of was his own body;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and when he had risen from the dead his disciples remembered his
saying this, and learned to believe in the scriptures, and in the words
Jesus had spoken.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` At this paschal season, while he was in Jerusalem for the feast,
there were many who came to believe in his name, upon seeing the
miracles which he did.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But Jesus would not give them his confidence; he had knowledge of
them all,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and did not need assurances about any man, because he could read
men’s hearts.
