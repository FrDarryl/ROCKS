called her child Cain, as if she would say, Canithi, I have been
enriched by the Lord with a man-child.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Abel, too, brought an offering, and his offering was out of the
first-born of his flock, with their fat. On Abel, and on his offering,
the Lord looked with favour,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` If thy actions are good, canst thou doubt they will be rewarded? If
not, canst thou doubt that guilt, thenceforward, will lie at thy door?
Meanwhile he is at thy mercy, and thou canst have thy way with him.✻

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then Cain said to his brother, Let us go out together;✻ and while
they were out in the open, Cain turned upon his brother Abel and killed
him.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then the Lord said to Cain, Where is thy brother Abel? I cannot
tell, said he; is it for me to keep watch over my brother?

"10" = ''':sup:`10` But the answer came, What is this thou hast done? The blood of thy
brother has found a voice that cries out to me from the ground.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Henceforward thou shalt be an outlaw from this ground, that has
opened to drink in thy brother’s blood, shed by thy hand.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Till that ground, and it will yield thee its fruit no longer; thou
shalt be a wanderer, a fugitive on earth.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Cain said to the Lord, Guilt like mine is too great to find
forgiveness.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And now thou art robbing me of the ground, and I shall be cut off
from thy protection, and wander over the earth, a fugitive; anyone I
meet will slay me.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` But the Lord told him, It shall not be so; whoever kills Cain shall
pay for it sevenfold. And the Lord gave Cain such token of his
protection as should warn the chance-comer not to kill him.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` So Cain was banished from God’s presence, and lived as a fugitive,
east of Eden.

called her child Henoch; and Cain built a city which he called Henoch,
after his son’s name.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` and he had a brother called Jubal, the founder of all those who
play music, on the harp or the pipe.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Sella gave birth to Tubalcain, who became a smith, skilled in every
kind of brass and iron work; and Tubalcain had a sister called Noema.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` It was to his wives, Ada and Sella, that Lamech uttered the saying,
Listen to these words of mine, you wives of Lamech, note my saying
well. The man that wounds me, the stripling who deals me a blow, I
reward with death.✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For Cain, sevenfold vengeance was to be taken; for Lamech, it shall
be seventy times as much.✻

"25" = ''':sup:`25` And once more Adam had knowledge of his wife, and she bore a son;
Seth was the name she gave him, as if she would say, Seth, the Lord has
secured a line of issue for me in place of Abel, now that Cain has
murdered him.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Seth, too, had a son whom he called Enos; and he began to call upon
the name of the Lord.✻
