[4]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` That is how we ought to be regarded, as Christ’s servants, and
stewards of God’s mysteries.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And this is what we look for in choosing a steward; we must find one
who is trustworthy.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Yet for myself, I make little account of your scrutiny, or of any
human audit-day; I am not even at pains to scrutinize my own conduct.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` My conscience does not, in fact, reproach me; but that is not where
my justification lies; it is the Lord’s scrutiny I must undergo.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` You do ill, therefore, to pass judgement prematurely, before the
Lord’s coming; he will bring to light what is hidden in darkness, and
reveal the secrets of men’s hearts; then each of us will receive his
due award from God.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` All this, brethren, I have applied to myself and to Apollo, but it
is meant for you. The lesson you must learn from our example is, not to
go beyond what is laid down for you, one man slighting another out of
partiality for someone else.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` After all, friend, who is it that gives thee this pre-eminence? What
powers hast thou, that did not come to thee by gift? And if they came
to thee by gift, why dost thou boast of them, as if there were no gift
in question?✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Well, you are already fully content; already you have grown rich;
already you have come into your kingdom, without waiting for help from
us. Would that you had come into your kingdom indeed; then we should be
sharing it with you.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` As it is, it seems as if God had destined us, his apostles, to be in
the lowest place of all, like men under sentence of death; such a
spectacle do we present to the whole creation, men and angels alike.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` We are fools for Christ’s sake, you are so wise; we are so
helpless, you so stout of heart; you are held in honour, while we are
despised.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Still, as I write, we go hungry and thirsty and naked; we are
mishandled, we have no home to settle in,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` we are hard put to it, working with our own hands. Men revile us,
and we answer with a blessing, persecute us, and we make the best of
it,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` speak ill of us, and we fall to entreaty. We are still the world’s
refuse; everybody thinks himself well rid of us.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am not writing this to shame you; you are my dearly loved
children, and I would bring you to a better mind.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Yes, you may have ten thousand schoolmasters in Christ, but not
more than one father; it was I that begot you in Jesus Christ, when I
preached the gospel to you.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Follow my example, then, I entreat you, as I follow Christ’s.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` That is why I have sent Timothy to you, a faithful and dearly loved
son of mine in the Lord; he will remind you of the path I tread in
Christ Jesus, the lessons I give to all churches alike.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Some of you have grown contemptuous, thinking that I would never
come to visit you.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But I shall be coming to see you soon, if the Lord is willing, and
then I will test, not the fine words of those who hold me in contempt,
but the powers they can shew.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` It is power that builds up the kingdom of God, not words.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Choose, then; am I to come to you rod in hand, or lovingly, in a
spirit of forbearance?
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
4:1-5 - Paul presents himself as a servant of Christ and steward of
God's mysteries. He emphasizes that the final judgment belongs to God,
not to man, noting that the actions of God's servants will be revealed
25:19-23).
4:6-7 - Paul warns the Corinthians against arrogance and
self-comparison. Everything they have comes from God, and they have no
reason to boast, for God's grace is what makes them special (see also
4:8-13 - Paul mocks the attitude of the Corinthians, who consider
themselves rich and already satisfied, while he and the other apostles
live in poverty and suffering. True greatness in faith is found in
4:14-21 - Paul rebukes the Corinthians, but with love, and presents
himself as a model of discipline and Christian living. He sends Timothy
to teach the true way of living in Christ, calling believers to imitate
3:17).
