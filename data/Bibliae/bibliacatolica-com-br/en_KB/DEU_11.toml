Notas de rodapé:
11:1-7 - Moses recalls God's mighty acts, including the signs in Egypt
and the care in the wilderness. The people's experience with God should
11:8-12 - Moses emphasizes that the promised land is directly cared for
by God. Unlike Egypt, where irrigation depended on the Nile, the new
land is watered by rain, demonstrating Israel's dependence on God's
11:13-15 - Obedience will bring blessings, such as the rain needed for
crops and prosperity. Faithfulness to God is directly linked to
11:18-21 - Moses instructs Israel to keep the commandments in their
hearts, teach them to their children, and share them in every aspect of
their lives. This reinforces the need for a daily and ongoing
relationship with God's Word (see also Deuteronomy 6:6-9 and
11:26-28 - Moses presents the people with a choice between blessing and
cursing, depending on their obedience or disobedience. This pattern of
"choice" is repeated throughout Scripture and highlights human
24:15).
