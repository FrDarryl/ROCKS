"1" = ''':sup:`1` So he brought me into the temple, between pillars that were six
cubits square by tabernacle measure.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The door was ten cubits across, the recess behind the doorway five
cubits on either side; the whole length of the outer temple was forty
cubits, and the width twenty.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then he went into the inner sanctuary, measuring the doorway, two
cubits thick, the door, six cubits across, and the width of the recess
behind the doorway, seven cubits.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Each side had the length of the side next to the outer temple,
twenty cubits. This, said he, is the innermost sanctuary.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then he measured the temple wall, which was six cubits thick; it was
flanked all round by rooms four cubits square.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` There were sixty of these rooms, in three storeys one on the top of
another; and their upper storeys jutted out all round the temple wall,
but keeping apart from it; the temple wall must not be touched.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And there was a round stair-case which went up in a spiral to this
upper loft of the temple building, which projected outwards for that
very reason; there was thus an easy passage from the lower to the
middle, and from the middle to the upper storey.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The building, I saw, was all raised above the ground; the rod shewed
that the ground level of the rooms was six cubits up.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The rooms were at a distance of five cubits beyond the temple wall,
and they enclosed it all round;✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and there was a close of twenty cubits’ width between these and a
line of parlours which flanked the temple.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The doors of the inner rooms let out, to north and south, on a
praying-walk,✻ five cubits in width, which ran round the temple.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Round this again was the close of twenty cubits, and beyond that,
on the west, a pavilion seventy cubits by ninety, with a wall five
cubits thick.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He shewed me that the temple was a hundred cubits long; the close
with the pavilion beyond it, including its walls, a hundred cubits
long;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` the eastern face of the temple, with the close on each side of it,
a hundred cubits long;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and the breadth from side to side of the pavilion beyond the close
(with its galleries) a hundred cubits long …✻ … and the inner
sanctuary, and the halls that gave on to the courtyard,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` the doorways, the slanting windows, the galleries that went round
on three sides, over the several doorways; all were completely panelled
in wood. The panelling ran right up to the windows, which it framed,
right up to the top level of the doorway;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` ran all the way round to meet the inner sanctuary, keeping the same
height within and without it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The design was of alternate cherubs and palm-trees, and each cherub
had two faces,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` shewing like a man towards one palm-tree and like a young lion
towards the other; the same pattern ran all through the building,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` carved cherubs and palm-trees on each wall from ground level to the
height of the door’s lintel.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The entrance of the temple stood square, facing the inner
sanctuary;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` facing the altar, which was of wood, three feet high, and two feet
across; corners and slab and sides were all of wood. This, he told me,
is the table that stands in the Lord’s presence.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Outer temple, inner sanctuary, had two doors each;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and either door had leaves that folded together, two leaves on each
door,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` with the same pattern of cherubs and palm-trees that the walls had.
To match this, the outer porch was faced with thick beams✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` reaching up to the level of the slanting windows; thick beams
figured with palm-trees in either recess … matching the width of the
rooms and of the temple walls.

41:1-4 - Ezekiel sees a detailed description of God's temple, with its
measurements and specifications. This temple is a symbol of God's
presence among His people and how divine holiness should be reflected

41:5-10 - The emphasis on the division of the temple and the separation
of sacred and common areas reveals the need for respect and reverence
for God's holiness. Divine presence demands a separate and dedicated
space, reflecting the purity necessary for worshiping God (see also
41:11-15 - The description of the porticoes and the altar reinforces
the idea that worship should be done with order and beauty, honoring
God's holiness. The temple is designed to be a place of reverence and
41:16-26 - The rich detail in the temple's columns and ornaments points
to God's grandeur and glory. The temple's decoration with figures of
cherubim and palm trees also reflects the presence of heaven on earth
