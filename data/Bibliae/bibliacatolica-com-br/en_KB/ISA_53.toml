"1" = ''':sup:`1` What credence for such news as ours? Whom reaches it, this new
revelation of the Lord’s strength?✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He will watch this servant of his appear among us, unregarded as✻
brushwood shoot, as a plant in waterless soil; no stateliness here, no
majesty, no beauty, as we gaze upon him, to win our hearts.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Nay, here is one despised, left out of all human reckoning; bowed
with misery, and no stranger to weakness; how should we recognize that
face?✻ How should we take any account of him, a man so despised?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Our weakness, and it was he who carried the weight of it, our
miseries, and it was he who bore them.✻ A leper, so we thought of him,
a man God had smitten and brought low;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and all the while it was for our sins he was wounded, it was guilt
of ours crushed him down; on him the punishment fell that brought us
peace, by his bruises we were healed.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Strayed sheep all of us, each following his own path; and God laid
on his shoulders our guilt, the guilt of us all.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` A victim? Yet he himself bows to the stroke;✻ no word comes from
him. Sheep led away to the slaughter-house, lamb that stands dumb while
it is shorn; no word from him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Imprisoned, brought to judgement, and carried off, he, whose birth
is beyond our knowing; numbered among the living no more! Be sure it is
for my people’s guilt I have smitten him.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Takes he leave of the rich, the godless, to win but a grave, to win
but the gift of death;✻ he, that wrong did never, nor had treason on
his lips!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Ay, the Lord’s will it was, overwhelmed he should be with trouble.
His life laid down for guilt’s atoning, he shall yet be rewarded;
father of a long posterity, instrument of the divine purpose;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` for all his heart’s anguish, rewarded in full. The Just One, my
servant; many shall he claim for his own, win their acquittal, on his
shoulders bearing their guilt.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So many lives ransomed, foes so violent baulked of their spoil!
Such is his due, that gave himself up to death, and would be counted
among the wrong-doers; bore those many sins, and made intercession for
the guilty.
