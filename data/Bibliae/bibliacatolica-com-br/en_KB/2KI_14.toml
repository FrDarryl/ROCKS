Notas de rodapé:
14:1-4 - Amaziah begins to reign in Judah and does what is right in the
eyes of the Lord, but not like David. He allows the high places to
stand, which undermines true worship in Judah (see also 1 Kings 3:3 and
14:5-7 - Amaziah executes his father's murderers but spares his sons,
following the law of Moses. This action reflects Amaziah's commitment
to divine justice and obedience to the Law (see also Deuteronomy 24:16
14:8-10 - Amaziah challenges Jehoash, king of Israel, but is warned
against his arrogance. Jehoash's response reveals the danger of pride
14:11-14 - Judah is defeated by Israel, and Amaziah is captured.
Amaziah's defeat serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning
away from God's guidance and relying on one's own strength (see also
14:23-27 - Jeroboam II reigns over Israel, and despite his wickedness,
God uses him to restore Israel's borders. This highlights God's grace,
which works amid His people's disobedience to accomplish His purposes
