'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And now, in the ninth year of Sedecias’ reign, on the tenth day of

'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` a breach was made in the walls; and that night all the fighting men
made their escape by way of the gate between the two walls, by the
royal garden, leaving the Chaldaeans to continue the siege of the city.
They chose for their flight the road which leads to the desert,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and in the desert by Jericho Sedecias was overtaken by the
Chaldaeans, who had set out in pursuit. All his retinue deserted him;

"14" = ''':sup:`14` The troops he brought with him were employed in dismantling the
walls on every side of it.
'''

"16" = ''':sup:`16` leaving only such of the poorer sort as were vine-dressers and farm
labourers.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Brazen pillars and brazen stands and the great basin of bronze that

saucer, all the appurtenances of worship that were of bronze;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` for gold, too, and for silver, bowl and censer and urn and basin
and lamp-stand and spoon and goblet; nothing did Nabuzardan leave
behind him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` There was no reckoning the weight of bronze, when the two pillars,
the great basin, and the twelve brazen calves supporting it, all set up
by Solomon in the temple, are included;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` each pillar was eighteen cubits high, twelve cubits round, and four
fingers thick, and they were hollow within.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` On each rested a brazen capital, five cubits in height, with
network and pomegranate mouldings on the rim; the pattern of each was
the same.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` There were ninety-six pomegranates besides, making a hundred in
all, and all had network around them.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Prisoners, too, Nabuzardan carried away with him, the two chief
priests, Saraias and Sophonias, the three door-keepers from the temple,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and among the citizens, the chamberlain who commanded the army,
seven other courtiers who were left in the city, the secretary who was
charged with the army and had the levying of recruits, and sixty
surviving citizens of the common sort.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` All these were carried away by Nabuzardan to Reblatha, into
Nabuchodonosor’s presence;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and there at Reblatha, in the Emath country, Nabuchodonosor put
them to death. So the men of Juda were exiled from their country.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` Graciously did Evil-Merodach receive him, gave him a seat of honour
