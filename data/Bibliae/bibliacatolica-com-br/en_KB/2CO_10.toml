"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now, here is Paul, the man who is so diffident when he meets you
face to face, and deals so boldly with you at a distance, making an
appeal to you by the gentleness and the courtesy of Christ.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` What I ask is, that you will not force me to deal boldly with you
when we meet. I have my own grounds for confidence, and with these I
may well be counted a match for those who think we rely on merely human
powers.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Human indeed we are, but it is in no human strength that we fight
our battles.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The weapons we fight with are not human weapons; they are divinely
powerful, ready to pull down strongholds. Yes, we can pull down the
conceits of men,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` every barrier of pride which sets itself up against the true
knowledge of God; we make every mind surrender to Christ’s service,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and are prepared to punish rebellion from any quarter, once your own
submission is complete.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Wait and see what happens when we meet.✻ There may be someone who
takes credit to himself for being the champion of Christ; if so, let
him reflect further that we belong to Christ’s cause no less than
himself;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and indeed, I might boast of the powers I have, powers which the
Lord has given me so as to build up your faith, not so as to crush your
spirits, and I should not be put in the wrong.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It must not be thought that I try to overawe you when I write.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` His letters, some people say, are powerful and carry weight, but
his presence in person lacks dignity, he is but a poor orator.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I warn those who speak thus that, when we visit you, our actions
will not belie the impression which our letters make when we are at a
distance.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It is not for us to intrude, or challenge comparison with others
who claim credit for themselves; we are content to go by our own
measure, to compare ourselves with our own standard of achievement.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Yes, we may boast, but our boasting will not be disproportionate;
it will be in proportion to the province which God has assigned to us,
one which reaches as far as you.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Nobody can say that we are encroaching, that you lie beyond our
orbit; our journeys in preaching Christ’s gospel took us all the way to
you.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Ours, then, is no disproportionate boasting, founded on other men’s
labours; on the contrary, as your faith bears increase, we hope to
attain still further vantage-points through you, without going beyond
our province,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and preach the gospel further afield, without boasting of
ready-made conquests in a province that belongs to another.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He who boasts, should make his boast in the Lord;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` it is the man whom God accredits, not the man who takes credit to
himself, that proves himself to be true metal.
