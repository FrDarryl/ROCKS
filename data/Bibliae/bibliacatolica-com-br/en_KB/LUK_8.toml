"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then followed a time in which he went on journeying from one city or
village to another, preaching and spreading the good news of God’s
kingdom. With him were the twelve apostles,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and certain women, whom he had freed from evil spirits and from
sicknesses, Mary who is called Magdalen, who had had seven devils cast
out of her,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and Joanna, the wife of Chusa, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and
many others, who ministered to him with the means they had.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When a great multitude had gathered, and more came flocking to him
out of the cities, he spoke to them in a parable.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Here is the sower gone out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, there
were some grains that fell beside the path, so that they were trodden
under foot, and the birds flew down and ate them.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And others fell on the rocks, where they withered as soon as they
were up, because they had no moisture.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And some fell among briers, and the briers grew up with them and
smothered them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But others fell where the soil was good, and when these grew up they
yielded a hundredfold. So saying, he cried aloud, Listen, you that have
ears to hear with.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then his disciples asked him what this parable meant.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And he told them, It is granted to you to understand the secret of
God’s kingdom; the rest must learn of it by parables, so that they can
watch without seeing, and listen without understanding.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The parable means this; the seed is God’s word.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Those by the way-side hear the word, and then the devil comes and
takes it away from their hearts, so that they cannot find faith and be
saved.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Those on the rock, are those who entertain the word with joy as
soon as they hear it, and yet have no roots; they last for a while, but
in time of temptation they fall away.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the grain that fell among the briers stands for those who hear
it, and then, going on their way, are stifled by the cares, the riches,
and the pleasures of life, and never reach maturity.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the grain that fell in good soil stands for those who hear the
word, and hold by it with a noble and generous heart, and endure, and
yield a harvest.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Nobody lights a lamp, to hide it away in a jar or under a bed; it
is put on a lamp-stand, so that all who come into the house can see its
light.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` What is covered up will all be revealed; what is hidden will all be
made known, and come to light.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Look well, then, how you listen. If a man is rich, gifts will be
made to him; if he is poor, he will lose even what he thinks his own.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And his mother and brethren came to visit him, but could not reach
him because of the multitude.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So word was given him, Thy mother and thy brethren are standing
without, asking to see thee.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But he answered them, My mother and my brethren are those who hear
the word of God, and keep it.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` A day came when he and his disciples embarked on a boat; Let us
cross to the other side of the lake, he said to them; and they began
their voyage.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` While they were sailing, he fell asleep. And now a storm of wind
came down upon the lake, and they began to ship water perilously.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So they came and roused him, crying, Master, master, we are
sinking. And he rose up, and checked both wind and wave, and there was
calm.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then he said to them, Where is your faith? And they were full of
awe and astonishment, saying to one another, Why, who is this, who
gives his command to wind and water, and is obeyed?✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So they came to land in the country of the Gerasenes, which is on
the coast opposite Galilee;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and as he went ashore, he was met by a possessed man who for a long
time had gone naked, and lived homeless among the tombs.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When he saw Jesus, he fell down before him, and cried with a loud
voice, Why dost thou meddle with me, Jesus, Son of the most High God? I
pray thee, do not torment me.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` (For he was bidding the unclean spirit come out of the man.) Often,
at times when it had seized upon him, the man had been bound, under
guard, with chains and fetters, but still he would break his bonds, and
the devil would drive him out into the wilderness.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for
there were many devils that had entered into him.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And they entreated him not to bid them go back to the abyss.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` There was a great herd of swine feeding on the mountain-side, and
the devils besought his leave to go into these instead; this leave he
granted them.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So the devils left the man and entered into the swine; whereupon
the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake, and were drowned.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The herdsmen fled when they saw it happen, and spread the news of
it in the city and about the country-side;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` so that they came out to see what had happened for themselves. When
they reached Jesus, they found the man from whom the devils had been
driven out sitting there, clothed and restored to his wits, at Jesus’
feet; and they were terrified.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Those who had witnessed it told them how the possessed man had been
delivered.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Then all the common folk of the country round Gerasa asked Jesus to
leave them, such fear had gripped them; and he embarked on the boat and
returned.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` The man from whom the devils had been driven out asked leave to
accompany him; but Jesus sent him away;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Go back home, he said, and make known all God’s dealings with thee.
So he went back, and published all over the city the news of the great
things Jesus had done for him.✻
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` When Jesus returned, he found the multitude there to greet him;
they had all been awaiting him.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And now a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue, came
and fell at Jesus’ feet, imploring him to come to his house,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` for he had an only daughter about twelve years old, who was dying.
It happened that, as he went, the multitude pressed about him closely.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And a woman who for twelve years had had an issue of blood, and had
spent all her money on doctors without finding one who could cure her,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` came up behind and touched the hem of his cloak; and suddenly her
issue of blood was stanched.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Then Jesus said, Who touched me? All disclaimed it; Master, said
Peter and his companions, the multitudes are hemming thee in and
crowding upon thee, and canst thou ask, Who touched me?
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` But Jesus said, Somebody touched me; I can tell that power has gone
out from me.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And the woman, finding that there was no concealment, came forward
trembling and fell at his feet, and so told him before all the people
of her reason for touching him, and of her sudden cure.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And he said to her, My daughter, thy faith has brought thee
recovery; go in peace.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` While he was yet speaking, a messenger came to the ruler of the
synagogue, to say, Thy daughter is dead; do not trouble the Master.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Jesus heard it, and said to him openly, Do not be afraid; thou hast
only to believe, and she will recover.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` When he reached the house, he would not let anyone come in with
him, except Peter and James and John, and the child’s father and
mother.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` All were weeping and bewailing her; There is no need to weep, he
told them; she is not dead, she is asleep.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` And they laughed aloud at him, well knowing that she was dead.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` But he took her by the hand, and called aloud, Rise up, maiden;
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` and she rose up there and then with life restored to her. He
ordered that she should be given something to eat,
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` and warned her parents, who were beside themselves with wonder, to
let no one hear of what had befallen.✻
