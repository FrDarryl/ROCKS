"1" = ''':sup:`1` There were two of Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abiu, who took up their
censers and put coals and incense into them, to burn unhallowed fire in
the Lord’s presence,✻ not in accordance with his command;

"2" = ''':sup:`2` whereupon the Lord sent down fire which devoured them, and they died
there in the Lord’s presence.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And Moses told Aaron, The Lord gave us warning of this when he said:
I mean to vindicate my holiness among those who come near me, win
reverence in the eyes of the whole people. And with that, Aaron kept
silence.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Meanwhile, Moses summoned Misael and Elisaphan, sons of Oziel that
was Aaron’s uncle, and said to them, Go and remove the bodies of your
brethren from the tabernacle door, and carry them away from the camp.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So they went without more ado and took them up just as they lay
there, still clothed in their robes of linen; and they carried them
away as he bade them.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, Do not
bare your heads or rend your garments, on pain of death, and such
vengeance as may overtake the whole people; let your brethren, and all
the race of Israel bewail this fresh kindling of the Lord’s fire.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` You must not, on pain of death, leave the tabernacle door, with the
oil of your consecration still upon you. So they did as Moses bade
them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The Lord, too, said to Aaron,

"9" = ''':sup:`9` When you are for entering the tabernacle, thou and thy sons, drink
neither wine nor strong drink, on pain of death; such is the
commandment you must observe, age after age.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` It is your task to distinguish between what is holy and what is
profane, what is defiled and what is clean;

"11" = ''':sup:`11` and to teach the sons of Israel all these commandments of mine, the
Lord’s word to them through Moses.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now Moses said to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and
Ithamar, You must take up what is left of the bloodless sacrifice
offered to the Lord, and eat it, still unleavened, near the altar; it
is set apart for holy uses,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and on holy ground it must be eaten, as the share given to thee and
to thy sons in the Lord’s own offering; such was the Divine command.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The breast, too, that was held up in worship, and the shoulder that
was set apart, you must eat in a place that is clean of all defilement,
thou and thy sons and thy daughters, too, with thee. This share of the
welcome-offerings the sons of Israel bring is kept for thee and thy
children;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` priestly hands have lifted up, in the Lord’s presence, the shoulder
and the breast and the fat which was afterwards burnt on the altar, and
it is the Lord’s bidding that they should belong to thee and thy sons,
by right perpetual.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Meanwhile, when Moses went to look for the goat that was their
transgression-victim, he found its body all consumed by fire, and
angered by this, he asked Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s two surviving
sons,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Why did you not eat, on holy ground, this transgression-victim, all
holiness, which was handed over to you so that you might take the
faults of the people on yourselves, and make intercession for them in
the Lord’s presence?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Its blood had not been carried within the sanctuary; you should
have eaten it on holy ground, in obedience to the commandment that was
given me.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But Aaron’s answer was, Why, this very day transgression-victim and
burnt-sacrifice have been offered to the Lord, and thou seest what has
befallen me in spite of it. How could I find acceptance with the Lord
in eating my share of it, with a heart so mournful?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And with that, Moses was content.✻
