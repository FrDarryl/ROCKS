"1" = ''':sup:`1` We must leave on one side then, all discussion of our first lessons
in Christ, and pass on to our full growth; no need to lay the
foundations all over again, the change of heart which turns away from
lifeless observances, the faith which turns towards God,✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` instructions about the different kinds of baptism, about the laying
on of hands, about the resurrection of the dead, and our sentence in
eternity.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Such will be our plan, if God permits it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` We can do nothing for those who have received, once for all, their
enlightenment, who have tasted the heavenly gift, partaken of the Holy
Spirit,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` known, too, God’s word of comfort, and the powers that belong to a
future life,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and then fallen away. They cannot attain repentance through a second
renewal. Would they crucify the Son of God a second time, hold him up
to mockery a second time, for their own ends?✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` No, a piece of ground which has drunk in, again and again, the
showers which fell upon it, has God’s blessing on it, if it yields a
crop answering the needs of those who tilled it;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` if it bears thorns and thistles, it has lost its value; a curse
hangs over it, and it will feed the bonfire at last.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Beloved, of you we have better confidence, which does not stop short
of your salvation, even when we speak to you as we are speaking now.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` God is not an unjust God, that he should forget all you have done,
all the charity you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered,
and still minister, to the needs of his saints.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But our great longing is, to see you all shewing the same eagerness
right up to the end, looking forward to the fulfilment of your hope;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` listless no more, but followers of all those whose faith and
patience are to bring them into possession of the good things promised
them.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Such was Abraham. God made him a promise, and then took an oath (an
oath by himself, since he had no greater name to swear by),
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` in the words, More and more I will bless thee, more and more I will
give thee increase;✻

"15" = ''':sup:`15` whereupon Abraham waited patiently, and saw the promise fulfilled.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Men, since they have something greater than themselves to swear by,
will confirm their word by oath, which puts an end to all controversy;

"17" = ''':sup:`17` and God, in the same way, eager to convince the heirs of the
promise that his design was irrevocable, pledged himself by an oath.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
6:1-3 - The author exhorts Christians to advance toward spiritual
maturity by leaving behind elementary principles and seeking the full
knowledge of Christ. Maturity is necessary for a solid Christian life
6:4-6 - The author warns of the danger of apostasy, describing those
who fall away as those who reject God's grace after experiencing it.
6:9-12 - Despite the warning, the author expresses confidence in the
perseverance of his readers and exhorts them to imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit God’s promises (see also
6:13-20 - God's promise to Abraham is used as an example of a sure and
steadfast hope. The hope we have in Christ is an anchor for the soul,
1:2).
