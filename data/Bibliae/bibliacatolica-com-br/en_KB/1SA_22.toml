His brethren and all his father’s kindred followed him there;

debtors, the disaffected, and David became their leader, so that he had
some four hundred men at his heels.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` From Odollam, he went on to Maspha, in the domains of Moab, and
asked the king of Moab to let his father and mother dwell there, until
they should find out what fortune the Lord meant to send him;

'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` How is it that you are all in conspiracy against me, and none of you
will tell me the truth, even when my own son is in league with the son

errands, and fills so high a place in thy household?

"15" = ''':sup:`15` This was not the first time I had consulted the Lord for him. God
