hand.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It is for the elders of the nearest city to do what must be done.
They will choose out from the herd a heifer that has never borne yoke
or ploughed furrow,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and in some wild and rugged glen, that was never ploughed or sown,
this heifer must have its neck broken.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Priests must be there, of Levi’s race; these are the men whom the
Lord thy God has chosen to minister to him, and give their blessing in
his name, and also to decide between right and wrong, clean and
unclean.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the elders of this neighbouring city, close to the dead man,✻
will wash their hands over the heifer that lies slain in the glen,

witnessed the deed;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` be merciful, Lord, to Israel, the people thou hast claimed for

and pare her nails close,

"13" = ''':sup:`13` and lay aside the garb of a captive, that she wore till now. Let
her have a month, dwelling in thy house, to bewail the loss of her
father and mother; then thou mayest take her to thy bed and make her
thy wife.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But if, afterwards, she does not answer thy mood, she must go free;

no power to make the son of the loved wife his heir, in preference to
that other.

unmanageable; he pays no heed to our remonstrances, but must ever be
carousing, ever at his wantonness and his cups.

rid of this plague, and every Israelite that hears of it may be afraid
to do the like.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` When a man is guilty of a capital crime, and his sentence is to
hang on a gallows,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` his body must not be left to hang there on the gibbet, it must be
