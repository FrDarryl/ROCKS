"1" = ''':sup:`1` But now Israel broke its faith by turning the forfeited plunder to
their own use. Achan, a man of Juda, descended from Zare through Charmi
and Zabdi, took some of the plunder for himself, and God was angry with
the people of Israel.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` From Jericho, Josue sent a party of men over to Hai (which is close
by Bethaven, eastwards from Bethel), bidding them survey its territory;
and they, when they had finished their task at Hai,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` gave a confident report: There is no need for the whole people to
take part in the attack. Send two or three thousand men to overthrow
the city; it were idle to set a whole army toiling over a handful of
enemies.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So three thousand men went up to the assault and were soon put to
rout.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The men of Hai killed thirty-six of them, pursued them all the way
to Sabarim, and fell upon them as they fled down the slopes.Small
wonder if the people lost heart and their courage ebbed away like
water.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Josue himself rent his garments, and fell down, face to earth,
before the ark of God. There he lay till nightfall, and all the elders
of Israel with him, defiling their heads with dust.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Ah, Lord God, cried Josue, was it for this thou didst make the
passage of Jordan so easy for us, to put us at the mercy of the
Amorrhites, and compass our ruin? Better had we remained at our old
post beyond the Jordan.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` O Lord my God, that I should see Israel turn their backs before
their enemies!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Here are tidings will rally the Chanaanites and their neighbours to
whelm us, so that our very name will be forgotten among men; and thy
name, Lord? That great renown of thine?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But the Lord said to Josue, Rise up; why dost thou lie there, face
to ground?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Guilt rests on Israel; they have transgressed my covenant, by
taking forfeited plunder for their own use; it has been stolen away
secretly, and hidden among private goods.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` How should Israel withstand the enemy? Turn their backs they must
so long as the curse lies on them; until you make an end of the guilty
man, I will fight on your side no longer.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Rise up, and bid the people cleanse themselves; tell them that
to-morrow they must come into my presence undefiled. And give them this
message from the Lord God of Israel: Israelites, you are harbouring
forbidden spoil among you, and the guilty man must be destroyed before
you can stand against your enemies.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` In the morning you will come before me tribe by tribe; and the
tribe on which the lot falls will come before me clan by clan, until
one household of that clan, and one man of that household is convicted.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When he is convicted of such a crime, he and all that belongs to
him must be given to the flames; he has transgressed the Lord’s
covenant, and brought a curse on Israel.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So, when the next day dawned, Josue brought forward the tribes of
Israel one by one, and when Juda was chosen, the clans of Juda;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and when Zare was chosen, the families of Zare; and when Zabdi was
chosen, the household of Zabdi man by man.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So at last the choice fell upon Achan, son of Charmi, son of Zabdi,
son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And now Josue said to Achan, My son, accept the arbitrament of the
Lord God of Israel; own thy fault and tell me, without concealment,
what thou hast done.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Achan, in answer, told how he had sinned against the Lord God
of Israel, told every circumstance of his fault.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I saw among the plunder, said he, a fine scarlet cloak, and two
hundred pieces of silver, and a bar of gold that weighed fifty sicles;
and, coveting the possession of them, I buried them in the ground in
the middle of my tent, hiding the money with the rest.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Josue sent couriers to his tent, and there they found all he had
hidden, the money with the rest;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` they brought it back from the tent to Josue and the whole assembly
of Israel, and cast it down there in the Lord’s presence.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So Josue and the Israelites took Achan son of Zare to the valley of
Achor, with the money and the cloak and the bar of gold, and his sons
and daughters, his oxen, asses and sheep, his tent too with all that
was in it.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And there Josue said, Thou hast brought trouble on us, and now it
is the Lord’s turn to bring trouble on thee. And all the Israelites
stoned him to death, and the flames burned all that was his.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` They raised a great heap of stones over him, which stands there
yet, to mark the place where the Lord’s anger was appeased; and it is
called the Valley of Achor, Trouble, to this day.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
7:1 - Achan's sin in taking items destined for destruction brings
defeat to Israel at Ai. This emphasizes the importance of holiness and
obedience to God's Word, showing how individual sin can affect the
6:7).
7:2-5 - The defeat at Ai and the distrust it generated among the
Israelites demonstrate that victory is assured only by obedience to
God. Self-reliance can lead to downfall and disillusionment (see also
7:6-9 - Joshua's intercession, questioning God about the defeat,
highlights the importance of communicating with the Lord in times of
crisis. Prayer is an essential tool for seeking guidance and
7:10-13 - God reveals the cause of the defeat, showing that
disobedience brought a curse upon Israel. This highlights the need for
holiness and the seriousness of sin, reinforcing the need to rid
Peter 1:15-16).
7:19-26 - The judgment of Achan and the destruction of his family
highlight the gravity of sin and the need to restore the holiness of
God's people. This teaches about the consequences of sin and the
12:1-2).
