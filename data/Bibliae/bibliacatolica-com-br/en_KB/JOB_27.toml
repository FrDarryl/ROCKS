"1" = ''':sup:`1` And thus Job continued to lay bare his thought:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` As sure as he is a living God, he, the omnipotent, who so refuses me
justice, who makes my lot in life so bitter;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` while life is in me, while he still grants me breath,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` never shall these lips justify the wrong, never this tongue utter
the lie!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Gain your point with me you shall not; I will die sooner than
abandon my plea of innocence.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` That claim, once made, I will not forgo; not one act in all my life
bids conscience reproach me.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Count him a knave that is my enemy, every detractor of mine a friend
of wrong!✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` (What is the sinner’s hope worth after all his greedy getting, when
God takes the life away from him?✻ In that hour of need,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` his cry for reprieve will go unheard;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` he cannot go on for ever basking in the Almighty’s favour, calling
God to his aid.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now be God’s hand laid bare, now let me acknowledge openly the
counsels of omnipotence!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Not one of you but knows the truth of it already; yet one and all
you must be urging a false plea, without the need for it!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What spoil, after all, does God grant to the wicked? From his
almighty hand, what abiding possession does the man of violence
receive?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Sons beget he never so many, what avails it, when the sword
overtakes them, and their children in turn must go wanting bread,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` when the plague gives all the rest of his line their burial, and
never a widow to bemoan them?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` What avails it, to heap up silver like the sand, buy fine clothes,
too, and think such treasures cheap as dirt,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` if more upright men than he, more innocent than he, must have the
wearing of those clothes, share out that silver at last?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Light as the moth he builds; not so frail a shelter the
vineyard-watcher weaves about him.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Rich he is laid to rest, but nothing takes with him; rich he shall
wake no more.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Helpless in the flood, driven in darkness by the storm,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` carried off, as if sirocco or whirlwind had swept him away,

"22" = ''':sup:`22` he is routed before the pitiless onslaught,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` hands clapped in triumph, tongues hissing in derision as he goes.)

Notas de rodapé:
27:1-4 - Job reaffirms his integrity and determination not to stray
from righteousness. His stance is firm, and he declares that his
conscience does not accuse him. This reflects the importance of
27:5-6 - Job rejects the idea that he is a sinner, challenging his
friends to admit that he is righteous before God. He insists that his
integrity is a testimony against the accusations he has received,
27:7-10 - Job asserts that the wicked, who reject God, face a fate of
destruction. He contrasts his own fate with that of the unrighteous,
reinforcing the idea that those who trust in God will be vindicated
