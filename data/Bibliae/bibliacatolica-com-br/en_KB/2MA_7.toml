"1" = ''':sup:`1` Seven brothers there were, that lay under arrest, and their mother
with them; these too were tortured at the king’s command, to see if
whip and thong would not make them eat swine’s flesh, for all their
scruples.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And thus spoke out one of them in the name of the rest: Why dost
thou put us to the question? What secret wouldst thou learn? Of this be
sure, we had rather die than break the divine law given to our fathers.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The king, in a rage, would have fire-pan heated, and caldron of
bronze; heated they were,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and then he passed judgement upon this same spokesman. Tongue of him
should be cut out, scalp torn off, hands and feet mutilated, while
mother and brethren stood by to see it;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` then, so maimed, he was for the fire; they should roast him alive in
a caldron. Long time he suffered, and there stood the rest with their
mother, each heartening other to die bravely;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` God sees true, said they, and will not allow us to go uncomforted.
Did not Moses prophesy as much, even in his song of remonstrance, He
will comfort his servants?✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So died the first, and now the second must make sport for them. When
the hair was torn from his head and the skin with it, they asked, Would
he eat, or must his whole body pay for it, limb by limb?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he answered in good round Hebrew,✻ eat he would not; whereupon
he, in his turn, suffered like the first.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Ay, miscreant, he said with his last breath, of this present life it
lies in thy power to rob us; but he, who is ruler of the whole world,
he, for whose laws we perish, will raise us up again, and to life
everlasting.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And now they had their will with the third, who was no sooner
bidden than he put forth tongue and hands very courageously;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Heaven’s gift these be, he said, and for God’s law I make light
account of them, well assured he will give them back to me.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Well might they marvel, king and courtiers both, at one so young
that recked so little of his sufferings.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Such was the manner of his passing; the fourth, too, when with like
tortures they assailed him,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` died with these words on his lips: Man’s sentence of death, what
matters it, so there be hope in God, that shall raise up the dead? For
thee, resurrection to new life shall be none.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And when the fifth was put to the question, he looked Antiochus in
the face, thus warning him:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Mortal, at thy own whim free to govern thy fellow men, think not
God has abandoned this race of ours!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Wait but a little, and good proof thou shalt have of his sovereign
power, such torment thee and thine awaits.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So they came to the sixth, and this was his dying utterance: Never
flatter thyself with vain hope; speed we amiss, it was our own doing,
that sinned against our God. Strange be his dealings with us,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` yet think not thou to defy God unpunished.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And here was the greatest marvel of all, by honest folk ever to be
kept in mind, that the mother of seven children should be content to
lose them all in one day, for the hope she had in God’s mercy.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` What generosity of mind was this, that could temper her womanly
feelings with a man’s thoughts! One by one, in the speech of her own
country, she put heart into them;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Into this womb you came, she told them, who knows how? Not I
quickened, not I the breath of life gave you, nor fashioned the bodies
of you one by one!
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Man’s birth, and the origin of all things, he devised who is the
whole world’s Maker; and shall he not mercifully give the breath of
life back to you, that for his law’s sake hold your lives so cheap?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` What should Antiochus do? Here was defiance of his authority, here
were tones of remonstrance that liked him little. The youngest son
lived yet; for him, what encouragement, what royal assurances of wealth
and happiness! Would he but leave the law of his fathers, he should be
the king’s friend, and have weighty matters entrusted to him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But yield the boy would not; till at last the king beckoned the
mother apart; mother of son should be the saviour yet.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Much ado he had to win her, but she agreed at last, counsel her son
she would.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And a fine trick she played on the bloodthirsty tyrant, leaning
over her son and counselling him in her own native speech, to this
effect: Nine months in the womb I bore thee, three years at the breast
fed thee, reared thee to be what thou art;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and now, my son, this boon grant me. Look round at heaven and earth
and all they contain; bethink thee that of all this, and mankind too,
God made out of nothing.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Of this butcher have thou no fear; claim rightful share among thy
brethren in yonder inheritance of death; so shall the divine mercy give
me back all my sons at once.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Before ever she had finished speaking, the boy cried out, What
dallying is this? To the king’s law I own no allegiance; rule I live by
is the law we had through Moses.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Arch-enemy of the Jewish race, thinkest thou to escape from God’s
hand?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Grievously if we suffer, grievously we have sinned;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` chides he for a little, the Lord our God, he does but school, does
but correct us; to us, his worshippers, he will be reconciled again.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But thou, miserable wretch, viler on earth is none, wouldst thou
vent thy rage on those worshippers of his, and flatter thyself with
vain hopes none the less?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Trust me, thou shalt yet abide his judgement, who is God almighty
and all-seeing.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Brief pains, that under his warrant have seised my brethren of
eternal life! And shalt not thou, by his sentence, pay the deserved
penalty of thy pride?
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` As my brethren, so I for our country’s laws both soul and body
forfeit; my prayer is, God will early relent towards this nation, while
thou dost learn, under the lash of his torments, that he alone is God.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And may the divine anger, that has justly fallen on our race, with
me and these others be laid to rest!
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` No wonder if this last, that so baffled the king’s rage, was more
barbarously used than all the others;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` yet kept he ever his confidence in the Lord, and made a clean end
of it.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And at length, when all her sons were gone, it was the mother’s
turn to die.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Enough! Of idolatrous sacrifice and inhuman cruelty you shall hear
no more.
'''
