"1" = ''':sup:`1` Up, the Lord said to me, and get thee a jar of earthenware;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` take it to the valley of Ben-Ennom, close to the Earthenware Gate,
with elders of the people and some of the older priests for thy
company; there prophesy as I bid thee.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To the dynasty of Juda, to all the citizens of Jerusalem, give this
message from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I mean to bring such
calamity on this place, as shall ring in the ears of all that hear it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The place that once was mine, now alienated by the rebels that dwell
there; to alien gods they never knew, no fathers of theirs, no kings of
Juda ever knew, they have done sacrifice in this place, drenching it
with the blood of the innocent.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Here the gods of the country-side must have their hill-shrines, and
children must be burnt as a sacrifice in their honour; a rite not of my
prescribing, or enjoining, or imagining.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And now, the Lord says, a time is coming when it will no more be
called Topheth, or the Valley of Ben-Ennom; it will be called the
Valley of the Slain.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` In this valley all the hopes of Juda and Jerusalem shall be poured
away; at the sword’s point they shall meet their enemy and fall into
pitiless hands, and I will give leave to bird in air, beast on earth,
to prey on the carrion of them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` A thing of horror and scorn this city shall be; no passer-by but
will shudder at it, or hiss derision at the memory of its sufferings.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Nay, a pitiless enemy shall beleaguer them with so hard a siege,
that I will leave them no food save the flesh of son and daughter; man
shall eat man.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then break that jar of thine, for all thy company to see,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and give them this message from the Lord of hosts: Broken to pieces
you shall be, nation and city, like yonder thing of clay that is past
all repairing; men will be finding room for their dead in Topheth,
because other burying-ground is none.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Such, the Lord says, is the doom I have pronounced on city and
citizens; Jerusalem itself shall be a Topheth,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` all the houses in it, and yonder palace where the kings of Juda
reigned, as Topheth unclean; it was there, on the roof-tops, they
sacrificed to all the host of heaven, and made offering to alien gods.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` His errand at Topheth done, Jeremias took his stand in the temple
courts, and gave the people this message from the Lord God of Israel:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` All these threats against Jerusalem and her daughter cities I mean
to perform; the punishment of a yoke refused, a call unheeded.
