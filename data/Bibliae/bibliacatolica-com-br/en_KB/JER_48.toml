"1" = ''':sup:`1` And thus to Moab speaks the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel. Alas
for Nabo, spoiled and shamed, for Cariathaim taken, the high fortress
humbled, a prey to alarms!
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For Moab, scant triumph; against Hesebon there are plots a-brewing,
Away with it, a nation let it be no more! Silence for thee, a long
silence; the sword is at thy heels.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` From Oronaim the cry goes up, rack and ruin everywhere;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Moab lies crushed, let Segor echo the cry!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Weep they and wail, that climb the slopes of Luith; all the way down
from Oronaim their foes may hear it, the cry of desolation.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Fly he must that would escape with life, stripped though he be as
the desert tamarisk.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Ill reposed that confidence in ramparts of thine, stores of thine;
taken thou shalt be like the rest, and Chamos go into exile, all his
priests and all his votary chiefs with him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Of all thy cities, none shall be safe from the spoiler’s entry;
wasted thy valleys shall be, swept bare the hill-sides; the Lord
decrees it.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Weave a coronal✻ for Moab; in the flower of her pride she goes into
exile, and all her cities lie desolate, none to dwell there.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Cursed the man who goes about the Lord’s work grudgingly, nor with
blood stains his sword!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Since those first days of his, ever was Moab too rich; he, that
knew not exile, is like a wine that has settled on its lees, never
decanted; tang and reek of it were never lost;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` a time is coming now, the Lord says, when I mean to send certain
stewards of mine that shall tilt those jars; draw wine, drain goblet,
and break jar to pieces!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Chamos will play Moab false, as Bethel played Israel false, when
Israel trusted in its sanctuary.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Ay, boast on of your bravery, tell us you are warriors all!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Yet Moab is laid waste, its townships aflame, all the flower of its
chivalry gone to their death; so that king decrees, whose name is the
Lord of hosts.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Not long delayed, Moab’s last hour; runs on swift feet his
calamity.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Mourn with him, you that are his neighbours, you that are his
familiars; so trusty a rod broken, a staff so fair.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Poor maid of Dibon, come down from thy splendour and sit on the
parched ground; the spoiler of Moab has scaled thy heights, dismantled
thy walls;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` poor maid of Aroer, by the wayside linger and look around thee; ask
of the fugitives, How went the day?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Alas, Moab’s hope is lost; Moab lies conquered. Loud be the cry of
lament in Arnon, that tells of fields laid waste;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` doom on the hill-country, on Helon, Jasa, and Mephaath,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Dibon, Nabo, and Beth-Deblathaim,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Cariathaim, Beth-gamul, Bethmaon,

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Carioth, and Bosra, and all the cities of Moab, far and near.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Blunted now is that horn, the Lord says, crushed that strong arm!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Senseless let him fall, that once for the divine power vaunted
himself a match; a laughing-stock let him be, that once, vomiting over
his wine, clapped hands
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` in derision to make a laughing-stock of Israel! An interloper thou
didst call him, and now, for this ill speaking of thine, thyself shalt
be cast into exile.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Leave your cities, Moabites, and take to the hills; make the dove
your model, that ever at the outermost edge of cave will build her
nest.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The boasting of Moab has long been in our ears,✻ as it was ever
boastful; proud, scornful, boastful Moab, with head so high in air!
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Well I know, the Lord says, those high pretensions of hers, that
have no strength to warrant them, those dreams that never come true!
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So, from one end of Moab to the other, there is dole and dirge,
mournful hearing for the men behind those walls of hardened brick.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Jazer laments for thee, vineyard of Sabama, and with Jazer I too
will mourn; thy shoots reached from Jazer itself to the Dead Sea and
beyond; now, harvest of thine and vintage of thine the spoiler has
overrun.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` From the garden-lands of Moab joy and triumph have died away; all
the presses I have emptied of their wine, no vintage-song, no treading
the grapes as of old.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The dirge goes up from Hesebon, from Eleale and Jasa; goes up all
the way from Segor to Oronaim, like the lowing of heifer full-grown;
foul run the waters of Nemrim.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` None will I leave in Moab, the Lord says, to worship at the
hill-shrines, or do sacrifice to its gods.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For Moab my heart wails like the wailing of flutes, wailing of
flutes for those brick-walled cities of hers; too high she aimed, and
see, they lie in ruins.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Every head is shorn, every beard shaved in mourning; with bound✻
hands men go, sackcloth on their backs.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Roof-top and street in Moab is none but echoes with grief; I have
cast Moab away, the Lord says, like a jar past mending.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Lament for Moab in defeat, bowed heads for Moab’s shame! A
laughing-stock it will be and a by-word for all its neighbours.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` An eagle’s flight yonder conqueror has, the Lord says, and will
sweep down on Moab too.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Now Carioth✻ is lost, and all the strongholds taken; cowed as
woman’s heart in child-bearing are those warrior hearts;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Moab, that set the Lord at defiance, shall be a people no more.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Terror in front of its people, the Lord says, trap and toil behind
them;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` from terror flee thou, into trap fall thou; from the trap free
thee, toils shall fasten thee. Such shall be my year of reckoning with
the men of Moab, the Lord says.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` From the toils escaped, who turns to Hesebon for shelter? Helpless
he stands; such a fire comes out from Hesebon, all Seon’s capital
aflame, till cheek and head of blustering Moab are consumed.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Alas, Moab, alas, people of Chamos, for thy undoing! Gone into
exile now thy sons and daughters!✻
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Yet a time shall come at last, the Lord says, when her lot shall be
reversed.Thus far the doom of Moab.
