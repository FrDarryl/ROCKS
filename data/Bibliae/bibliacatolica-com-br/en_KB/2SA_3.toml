"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was a long struggle between Saul’s line and David’s; but ever the
fortunes and power of David grew, while the cause of Saul became daily
weaker.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Six sons were born to David, there in Hebron; Amnon, his first-born,
by Achinoam of Jezrahel,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` then Cheleab, by Abigail, that had been Nabal’s wife at Carmel, then
Absalom, by Maacha, daughter to Tholmai, king of Gessur.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The fourth was Adonias, son of Haggith, the fifth Saphathia, son of
Abital,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` the sixth Jethraam, that David’s wife Egla bore him; of all these
Hebron was the birth-place.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` As long as war lasted between the two dynasties, Abner the son of
Ner was the head of Saul’s party.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Saul had left a concubine, Respha the daughter of Aia; and of
her Isboseth said to Abner,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` What, wouldst thou mate with my father’s concubine? And he, greatly
angered by Isboseth’s words, cried out, I have made all Juda shun me
like a carrion-dog, by befriending the line of thy father Saul, his
kindred and his court, instead of giving thee up to David; and am I to
be called to account this day over a woman?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` God punish Abner as he deserves and more than he deserves, if I do
not fulfil the promise which the Lord made to David;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the kingship shall be taken away from Saul’s line, and David shall
reign over Israel and Juda alike, from Dan to Bersabee!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Never a word did Isboseth say in answer, so greatly did he fear
him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Abner sent a message to David, claiming that the land lay in
his own power; League thyself with me, the message ran, and I will help
thee, and reduce all Israel to thy obedience.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And David answered, Well said; I am ready to make a league with
thee, but one thing first. Thou canst not be admitted to my presence
unless thou bringest Michol, Saul’s daughter, with thee; so only shalt
thou find audience.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` At the same time, he sent a message to Isboseth, that was heir to
king Saul, Give me back my wife Michol, the bride I won with the
foreskins of a hundred Philistines.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So Isboseth sent and had her taken away from her husband Phaltiel,
son of Lais,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` who followed her, weeping, all the way to Bahurim. But Abner bade
him turn and go back, and go back he did.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Meanwhile, Abner sent the word round among the elders of Israel, It
was but yesterday you were eager to have David for your king.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It is time now, to fulfil the promise the Lord made to David; by
David’s hand I will rid my people Israel of the Philistines, and of all
their enemies.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Even among the men of Benjamin Abner sent the word out. Then he
went to tell David, at Hebron, of the resolve made by Israel, and by
the tribe of Benjamin at large.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He came to Hebron with twenty men, and there David made a feast for
him and his companions.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And now, said Abner, I will go and rally all Israel to thy cause,
my lord king. By this league of ours, they shall be thy subjects, loyal
to thy will. So David took leave of him, and he went on his way in
peace.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Soon David’s men, with Joab at their head, came home from an attack
on the freebooters, loaded with spoil. They did not find Abner in
Hebron; David had but now sent him on his way in peace;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` they came too late, Joab and his men. But Joab was told how Abner,
son of Ner, had visited the king, and of their friendly parting;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` so he went at once into the royal presence, and cried, What is
this? Abner with thee, and thou hast let him slip through thy hands,
gone, free as air!
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Dost thou know Abner so little? He did but come here to play thee
false, spying upon thy comings and goings, learning of all thou dost.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And Joab left the royal presence to send messengers after Abner,
summoning him back, without David’s knowledge, from the Pool of Sira.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` No sooner had Abner come back to Hebron than Joab took him aside,
there in the gates, under pretence of speaking with him, and smote him
in the groin, avenging by that death the death of his brother Asael.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` It was all over when David heard of it, and he cried, Never shall I
or my kingdom be held answerable for Abner’s death!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` On Joab’s head let the guilt fall, and on all his line; let the
line of Joab never want a man that has a running at the reins, or is a
leper, or works at the distaff like a woman, or falls in battle, or
begs his bread.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus Joab and his brother Abisai murdered Abner, who had slain
their brother Asael in the fighting at Gabaon.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` As for David, he bade Joab and his men tear their garments and put
on sackcloth, and go mourning at Abner’s funeral; he himself followed
the bier,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and wept aloud over Abner’s tomb at Hebron, where they buried him;
all the people, too, were in tears.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And this was the dirge with which he lamented him: Died Abner as
the ignoble die?✻
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` No bond tied thy hands, no gyves thy feet; thou didst fall as men
fall when cruel wrong assails them. And all the people took up the
refrain as they mourned.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then, while it was still full day, they came together to eat, and
would have David eat with them; but he took an oath, The Lord punish me
as I deserve, and more than I deserve, if I taste bread or any other
food before set of sun!
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` This all the folk heard, and more than ever they applauded the
king’s doings;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` among all that multitude, and in all Israel, there was not a man
that blamed David for the slaying of Abner, son of Ner.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Past all doubt, said the king to his servants, Israel has lost,
this day, the greatest of its chieftains.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Alas, they have anointed a weakling to be their king; not mine to
curb these sons of Sarvia. May the Lord punish the wrong-doer for the
wrong done!
