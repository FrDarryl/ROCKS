"1" = ''':sup:`1` Word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, turn thy regard now towards Gog, Magog’s country, that
has the lordship of Mosoch and Thubal, and prophesy its doom.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This be thy message to it from the Lord God: Have at thee, Gog, that
hast the lordship of Mosoch and Thubal!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Trust me, I will turn thee about this way and that, bridle those
jaws of thine! I will bring thee out to battle, with all thy army; with
horses and mailed cavalry, with a great company that ply spear and
shield and sword.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Persians shall be there, and Ethiopians, and Libyans, all with
shield and helmet,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Gomer with his hordes, the men of Thogorma from the northern
fastnesses, mustered in full strength; what an array thou hast about
thee!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now hold thyself in readiness, marshal thy own strength and the
hordes that follow thee; thine is the leadership.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Long hence thy turn shall come; long years must pass before thou
dost march on Israel; a land, now, recovered from its blood-letting;
its hills, desolate till now, are repeopled with exiles from many
shores, come back to dwell there in security.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Storm never rose so suddenly, cloud-wrack never darkened it so
fearsomely, as thou with that host of thine, those confederate hordes.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` What thoughts will be in thy heart that day, the Lord God says,
what foul design will be a-brewing?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Why, thou wilt think to march on a land unfortified, a people
dwelling free from all alarms, that walls about them have none, bolt
nor bar to shut them in;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` spoil for thy spoiling, plunder for thy plundering. Easily enough
they are like to fall into thy hand, the ruins so lately rebuilt; the
men restored from exile, that hold but the heart of the country,✻ and
are already enriched!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Small wonder if the traders of Saba, Dedan and Tharsis, ravenous
lions all, would know whether it is plunder thy heart is set on? Such a
muster of men, it can but mean spoil; silver and gold to rifle, stock
and stuff to carry away, ay, there is spoil behind this, and spoil
worth the taking!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Prophesy, then, son of man, and make known to Gog this divine
message: None better ware of it than thou, when my people of Israel is
living at peace, free from alarms!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then it is thou wilt come down from those northern fastnesses, with
thy hordes about thee, thy troops of cavalry, a great muster, an army
irresistible,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` sweeping down on my people of Israel like a cloud that overshadows
the land. Offspring of that later age, thou shalt march on yonder land
of mine, so that in Gog’s doom my power may be vindicated, and the
heathen may learn what I am.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Long years ago, the Lord God says, there were servants of mine that
foresaw my will concerning thee, and even then warned Israel, in my
name, of thy coming.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When Gog marches against Israel, the Lord God says, my indignation
will contain itself no longer;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` jealous love and fierce anger of mine, I swear it, shall throw all
the land of Israel into commotion.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Fish in sea, bird in air, beast on earth and all the creeping
things of earth shall tremble at my presence, and the world of men,
too, shall tremble; mountains be overthrown, defences totter, walls
come toppling to the ground.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` All through this hill-country of mine my word shall run, The sword!
And with that, the Lord says, friend shall turn his sword against
friend;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` ordeal they shall have of pestilence and of blood-letting, of
lashing storm and great hail-stones; fire and brimstone I will rain
down upon them, all that great army and the hordes that follow with it.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` My greatness, my holiness, shall then be displayed for a world of
nations to see, and they will recognize my power at last.
