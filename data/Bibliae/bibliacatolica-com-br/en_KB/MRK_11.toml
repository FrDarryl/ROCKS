"1" = ''':sup:`1` When they were approaching Jerusalem, and Bethany, which is close to
mount Olivet, he sent two of his disciples on an errand:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Go into the village that faces you, he told them, and the first
thing you will find there upon entering will be a colt tethered, one on
which no man has ever ridden; untie it, and bring it to me.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And if anyone asks you, Why are you doing that? tell him, the Lord
has need of it, and he will let you have it without more ado.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So they went, and found the colt tethered before a door at the
entrance; and they untied it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Some of the bystanders asked them, What are you doing, untying the
colt?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And they answered them as Jesus had bidden, and were allowed to take
it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So they brought the colt to Jesus, and saddled it with their
garments, and he mounted it.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Many of them spread their garments in the way, and others strewed
the way with leaves they had cut down from the trees.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And those who went before him and followed after him cried aloud,
Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` blessed is the kingdom of our father David which is coming to us;
Hosanna in heaven above.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So he came to Jerusalem, and went into the temple, where he
surveyed all that was about him, and then, for the hour was already
late, went out, with the twelve, to Bethany.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When they had left Bethany next day, he was hungry;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and, observing a fig-tree some way off with its leaves out, he went
up to see if he could find anything on it. But when he reached it, he
found leaves and nothing else; it was not the right season for figs.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he said to it aloud, in the hearing of his disciples; Let no
man ever eat fruit of thine hereafter.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So they came to Jerusalem. And there Jesus went into the temple,
and began driving out those who sold and bought in the temple, and
overthrew the tables of the bankers, and the chairs of the
pigeon-sellers;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` nor would he allow anyone to carry his wares through the temple.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And this was the admonition he gave them, Is it not written, My
house shall be known among all the nations for a house of prayer?
Whereas you have made it into a den of thieves.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The chief priests and scribes heard of this, and looked for some
means of making away with him; they were afraid of him, because all the
multitude was so full of admiration at his teaching.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He left the city at evening,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and next morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree withered
from its roots.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Peter had not forgotten; Master, he said, look at the fig-tree
which thou didst curse; it has withered away.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Jesus answered them, Have faith in God.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` I promise you, if anyone says to this mountain, Remove, and be cast
into the sea, and has no hesitation in his heart, but is sure that what
he says is to come about, his wish will be granted him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` I tell you, then, when you ask for anything in prayer, you have
only to believe that it is yours, and it will be granted you.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When you stand praying, forgive whatever wrong any man has done
you; so that your Father who is in heaven may forgive you your
transgressions;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` if you do not forgive, your Father who is in heaven will not
forgive your transgressions either.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So they came back to Jerusalem. And as he was walking about in the
temple, the chief priests and scribes and elders came to him
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and asked him, What is the authority by which thou doest these
things, and who gave thee this authority to do them?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus answered them, I too have a question to ask; if you can tell
me the answer, I will tell you in return what is the authority by which
I do these things.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Whence did John’s baptism come, from heaven or from men?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Whereupon they cast about in their minds; If we tell him it was
from heaven, they said, he will ask us, Then why did you not believe
him?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And if we say it was from men, we have reason to be afraid of the
people; for the people all looked upon John as a prophet indeed.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And they answered Jesus, We cannot tell. Jesus answered them, And
you will not learn from me what is the authority by which I do these
things.✻

Notas de rodapé:
11:1-11 - Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem is a fulfillment of
messianic prophecies, showing that He is the promised King. The crowd's
reaction reflects their recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, but it
also points to the mistaken expectations of a political leader (see
11:12-14 - Jesus curses the fig tree, symbolizing judgment on religious
hypocrisy. The fruitless fig tree represents those who outwardly appear

against religious corruption. He teaches that God's house is a place of
prayer and worship, not of commerce, revealing the need for true

forgiveness. He reveals that effective prayer is linked to genuine
