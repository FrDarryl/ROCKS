"1" = ''':sup:`1` What need for man to ask questions that are beyond his scope? There
is no knowing how best his life should be spent, this brief pilgrimage
that passes like a shadow, and is gone. And what will befall after his
death, in this world beneath the sun, who can tell?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There is no embalming like a good name left behind; man’s true
birthday is the day of his death.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Better a visit paid where men mourn, than where they feast; it will
put thee in mind of the end that awaits us all, admonish the living
with the foreknowledge of death.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Frown ere thou smile; the downcast look betokens a chastened heart.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Sadness, a home for the wise man’s thoughts, mirth for the fool’s.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Better receive a wise man’s rebuke, than hear thy praises sung by
fools.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Loud but not long the thorns crackle under the pot, and fools make
merry; for them, too, frustration.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Oppression bewilders even a wise man’s wits, and undermines his
courage.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Speech may end fair, that foul began; patience is better than a
proud heart.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Never be quick to take offence; it is a fool’s heart that harbours
grudges.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Never ask why the old times were better than ours; a fool’s
question.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Great worth has wisdom matched with good endowment; more advantage
it shall bring thee than all the rest, here under the sun.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Wealth befriends whom wisdom befriends; better still, who learns
wisdom wins life.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Mark well God’s doings; where he looks askance, none may set the
crooked straight.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Come good times, accept the good they bring; come evil, let them
never take thee unawares; bethink thee, that God has balanced these
against those, and will have no man repine over his lot.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` In my days of baffled enquiry, I have seen pious men ruined for all
their piety, and evil-doers live long in all their wickedness.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Why then, do not set too much store by piety, nor play the wise man
to excess, if thou wouldst not be bewildered over thy lot.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Yet plunge not deep in evil-doing; folly eschew; else thou shalt
perish before thy time.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` To piety thou must needs cling, yet live by that other caution too;
fear God, and thou hast left no duty unfulfilled.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Wisdom is a surer ally than ten city magistrates;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` there is no man on earth so exact over his duties that he does ever
the right, never commits a fault.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The chance words men utter, heed but little; how if thou shouldst
hear thy own servant speaking ill of thee?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thy own conscience will tell thee how often thou too hast spoken
ill of other men.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thus, by the touchstone of my wisdom, I would test all things;
Wisdom, cried I, I must have; yet all the while she withdrew from me,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` further away than ever. Deep, deep is her secret; who shall read
it?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Here is a mind that has passed the whole world of things in review,
examining everything, weighing everything, so as to have a wise
estimation of them, eager to understand the fool’s rebelliousness, the
false calculations of rash souls.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And this I have ascertained; death itself is not so cruel as
woman’s heart that wheedles and beguiles, as woman’s clutches that
release their captive never. God’s friends escape her; of sinners she
makes an easy prey.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` I weighed this against that (he, the Spokesman, tells us), and the
sum of my enquiry was this.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` One thing I ever longed to find, and found never, a true woman. One
true man I might find among a thousand, but a woman never.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Of this, beyond all else, I have satisfied myself; man’s nature was
simple enough when God made him, and these endless questions are of his
own devising.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The wise man, there is none like him. O for one who should read the
riddle!

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
7:1-2 - A good name is more valuable than great riches. Reflection on
death is a central theme of wisdom, reminding us of the importance of
90:12).
7:5-6 - Listening to the rebuke of a wise man is more profitable than
listening to the insincere praise of fools. This reflects the need for
humility and the pursuit of correction rather than superficial
7:9-10 - Patience is a virtue, while rash anger is foolishness.
Furthermore, nostalgia for the "good old days" can be a way of avoiding
07:14 - In good times and bad, we must trust in God's sovereignty. Joy
and adversity are part of God's plan, and both teach us to depend on
07:20 - The author acknowledges that there is no righteous man who
never sins. Everyone needs God's grace and forgiveness, a central truth
