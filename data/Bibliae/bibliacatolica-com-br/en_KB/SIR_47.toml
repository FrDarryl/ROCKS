"1" = ''':sup:`1` Among prophets, Nathan was the next to arise, and it was then the
reign of David began.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Only the fat from the sacrifice, only David out of all Israel; the
Lord must have ever the best!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Here was one that would use lion or bear as playthings for his
sport, tussle with them as if they had been yearling lambs. Such was
his boyhood;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and who but he should save the honour of his people, by slaying the
giant?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He had but to lift his hand, and the stone aimed from his sling
brought low the pride of Goliath;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` prayer to the Lord, the Almighty, gave him the mastery over a great
warrior, and retrieved the fortunes of his race.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Ere long, they had given him the title, Slayer of ten thousand, and
sang his praises, blessing the Lord’s name; kingly honours they
accorded him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He it was that laid their enemies low all about them, extirpating,
to this day, the malice of the Philistines, shattering their power for
ever.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Yet there was no feat of David’s but made him thank the most High,
the most Holy, and to him give the glory;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` still with all his heart he praised the Master he loved so well,
the God who had created him and endowed him with strength to meet his
enemies.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He would have musicians wait around the altar, and rouse sweet
echoes with their chant;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` feast-days should be kept with splendour, times and seasons duly
observed, all his life long; morning after morning the Lord’s holy name
should be praised, God should receive his full tribute of worship.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So it was that the Lord pardoned his sins, and bade him carry his
head high evermore; his by right was the kingship, and the proud throne
of Israel.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` To a wise son of his that throne passed; for David’s sake all the
threats of the enemy were stilled,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and Solomon might reign undisturbed. If God gave him mastery all
around, it was because he would have a temple built in his honour, to
be his sanctuary for all time. Ah, Solomon, how well schooled in thy
youth!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Deep as a river flowed thy wisdom; thy ambition it was to lay bare
all the secrets of earth;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` full scope thou wouldst have for riddle and proverb. Even to the
distant isles thy renown spread, and everywhere thy peaceful reign made
thee beloved.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The whole earth stood in awe of song and proverb and parable and
interpretation of thine;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` in awe, too, of the name of the Lord God, who is known among men as
the God of Israel.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Gold thou didst amass in such plenty, as it had been only bronze;
silver was abundant in thy domains as lead.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Yet women bowed thee to their will; of body’s appetites thou
wouldst brook no restraint,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and thus thy renown was tarnished with the gendering of a breed
unhallowed. So it was that vengeance fell upon thy children, that must
rue thy folly in after times;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` the kingdom divided, and in Ephraim a rebel dynasty exercising
dominion, through thy fault.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Yet God is ever merciful; his own design he will not mar
fruitlessly, nor undo; should he destroy it root and branch, the
posterity of his chosen servant? Should the man that so loved him have
begotten sons in vain?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Jacob must have a stock to breed from; the root of David should
burgeon yet.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Solomon once laid to rest with his fathers, what heirs left he?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` A man of his own blood, born to infatuate a nation,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` insensate Roboam, whose ill counsel drove the people to rebellion;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and that other, Jeroboam son of Nabat, who taught Israel to sin.
All Ephraim followed the example of his misdoing; high rose the tide of
their sins,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` till it swept them away altogether from their own country.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` For all this wickedness of theirs God held them to account, waiting
till the time should come for punishing them, and purging them of their
guilt.
