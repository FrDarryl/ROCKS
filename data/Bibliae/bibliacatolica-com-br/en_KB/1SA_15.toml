"1" = ''':sup:`1` But Samuel reminded Saul, It was the Lord that gave me commission to
anoint thee king of his people Israel; to his voice thou must needs
listen.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And this is the message that comes to thee from the Lord of hosts: I
have not forgotten how Amalec treated the Israelites, standing in their
path when they were on the way here from Egypt.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This, then, is thy errand, to destroy Amalec and all his domains,
granting no pardon, coveting no plunder, but slaying man and woman,
child and infant at the breast, camel and ass.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Whereupon Saul summoned all his men to arms, and counted their
muster as closely as a shepherd counts his lambs; two hundred thousand
warriors, besides ten thousand from Juda.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` With these, Saul marched to Amalec’s capital, and laid an ambush in
the ravine there;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but first of all he warned the Cinites, Up, move your camping ground
clear of the Amalecites; I would not involve you in their ruin; the men
of Israel, on their way here from Egypt, had nothing but kindness from
you. So the Cinites separated from Amalec,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and Saul routed the Amalecites, driving them before him all the way
from Hevila to Sur, on the confines of Egypt.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He captured Agag, the Amalecite king, but although he put all the
common folk to the sword,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` he and his army spared Agag; spared, too, the best of the flocks and
herds, the choicest garments, the fattest rams; they would not destroy
anything that was precious. All that was mean and worthless they
destroyed readily enough.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the Lord’s word came to Samuel,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I repent, now, of having made Saul king of Israel; he has played me
false, and left my command unfulfilled. At this, Samuel was greatly
moved, and all night long he pleaded with the Lord.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` At early dawn he rose up, resolved to find Saul that same morning;
Saul, he was told, upon reaching the town of Carmel,✻ had set up a
monument there in his own honour, but had passed on now and made his
way to Galgala. When Samuel reached it, he found Saul offering the Lord
burnt-sacrifice, out of the first-fruits of the plunder taken from
Amalec.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The Lord’s blessing on thee, was Saul’s greeting to him; I have
fulfilled the divine command.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And this bleating of sheep, Samuel asked, that comes to my ears,
this lowing of oxen that I hear?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Why, answered Saul, these are what they brought back from Amalec;
my men saved the best out of flock and herd, to be offered in sacrifice
to the Lord; all the rest we have destroyed.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` May I tell thee, asked Samuel, the message the Lord has given me in
the night? and when Saul bade him speak out,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` he went on, It was little conceit thou hadst of thyself, when the
tribes of Israel were committed to thy leadership. And the Lord
anointed thee king of Israel,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and sent thee on an errand; Up, he said, destroy the sinful men of
Amalec, smiting them down till none is left.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` How is it thou didst not obey the Lord’s command? Why didst thou
fall to plundering, in defiance of the Lord’s will?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Nay, protested Saul, obey the Lord I did; I went where the Lord’s
errand took me, and brought back Agag, king of Amalec, in chains, and
destroyed Amalec utterly.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` If my men carried off sheep and oxen, these were but first-fruits
that were saved from the slaughter of all the rest, to be offered up to
the Lord their God here in Galgala.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` What, said Samuel, thinkest thou the Lord’s favour can be won by
offering him sacrifice and victim, instead of obeying his divine will?
The Lord loves obedience better than any sacrifice, the attentive ear
better than the fat of rams.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Rebellion is sin as witchcraft is sin, all one with idolatry is the
unsubmissive heart. Thou hast revoked thy loyalty to the Lord, and he
thy kingship.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then Saul confessed to Samuel, I have sinned; I have transgressed
the Lord’s will and thy command; I was afraid of my own people, and
humoured their desire.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Grant that sin forgiveness; let me have thy company, while I go
back to pay the Lord worship.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Nay, answered Samuel, thou shalt have no company of mine; the Lord
has revoked thy kingship over Israel, since thou hast revoked thy
loyalty to him.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` With that, Samuel turned to go, and the other caught him by the
border of his cloak, which tore in his hand.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` This day, Samuel told him, the Lord has torn away the kingship of
Israel from thee, and given it to another and a better man than
thyself.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He who wins victories for Israel does not spare, does not relent;
not his to alter his purpose like mortal men.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But Saul still pleaded with him, Guilty though I be, at least give
me countenance before the elders of my people and before the men of
Israel, by bearing me company as I go to worship.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Thereupon Samuel turned back and went with him, and worship he did.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then Samuel would have Agag, king of Amalec, brought into his
presence; and he was brought in, gross of body and trembling with fear;
A bitter parting, said he, is this of death.✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But Samuel told him, Many a woman that sword of thine has made
childless, and now a childless woman thy own mother shall be; and he
cut Agag to pieces, there in the Lord’s presence at Galgala.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` So Samuel went back to Ramatha, and Saul to his home at Gabaa,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` nor did Samuel, long as he lived, meet Saul again. But ever he
lamented over him, that the Lord should have made him king of Israel,
and afterwards revoked his kingship.

Notas de rodapé:
15:1-3 - God, through Samuel, commands Saul to completely destroy the
Amalekites, a nation that was an enemy of Israel. This is a clear
command that tests Saul's complete obedience to God (see also
15:9-11 - Saul and the people disobey God by sparing King Agag and the
best of their flocks. This reveals Saul's failure to follow God's
commands completely, resulting in the rejection of his kingship (see
15:22-23 - Samuel confronts Saul, saying that “to obey is better than
sacrifice.” The central lesson here is that God values obedience and
submission to His will more than any external ritual (see also
15:24-26 - Saul confesses his sin, but his motivation is fear of the
people rather than genuine repentance. Samuel reaffirms that God has
rejected him as king, establishing that a leader's heart is more
Corinthians 7:10).
15:32-33 - Samuel executes King Agag, completing the order Saul failed
to carry out. This underscores Samuel's zeal for God's justice and the
