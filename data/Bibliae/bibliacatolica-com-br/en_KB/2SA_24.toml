"1" = ''':sup:`1` But still the Lord’s vengeance threatened Israel; and now it was
through David he disturbed their peace, with a design for registering
Israel and Juda.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The king said to Joab, the chief of his army, Go through all the
tribes of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, and make a muster-roll of the
people, so that I may know the full tale of them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Why, said Joab, my prayer is that the Lord may increase yet more the
number of the people, great as it is, and that thou mayest live to see
it a hundred times as great! But what is it my lord the king means by
this design?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But all that Joab and the captains of the army could say might not
thwart the king’s will; so Joab and the other commanders left the
king’s presence to make a register of Israel.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They crossed the Jordan, and reached Aroer, on the right side of the
city that stands in the vale of Gad;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` then they passed by way of Jazer into Galaad to the plain country of
Hodsi, and so reached the woodlands of Dan. Thence they turned towards
Sidon,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` passed close to the walls of Tyre, and all along the country that
was still held by Chanaanite and Hevite, and came at last to the
southern end of Juda, at Bersabee.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So they made their review of the whole country, and returned to
Jerusalem after nine months’ and twenty days’ absence.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Joab gave in the register to the king; it proved that there were
eight hundred thousand warriors that bore arms in Israel, and five
hundred thousand in Juda.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But, now the count of Israel had been made, David’s heart
reproached him. And he confessed to the Lord, I have sinned greatly in
what I have done; Lord, give my sin quittance; I have played a fool’s
part.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And by the time he rose next morning, the word of the Lord had come
to the prophet Gad, that was David’s seer,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Go and give David this message from the Lord; he is given a
threefold choice, and he must choose his own punishment among the
three.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Gad went to David with the message: Wilt thou have seven years
of famine in thy country, or three months of flight from the pursuit of
thy enemies, or three days in which thy country is smitten with plague?
Think well, and tell me what answer I shall make to him whose word I
bear thee.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am hard pressed on all sides, David told him; but it is better to
fall into the hands of the Lord, so rich is he in mercy, than into the
hands of men.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel, from that morning till the
time he had appointed; and it raged all the way from Dan to Bersabee,
till seventy thousand men had perished.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But when the angel of the Lord was stretching out his hand over
Jerusalem, to bring destruction on it, the Lord was moved with pity
over their calamity, and said to the angel who was smiting the people
down, It is enough, stay thy hand. The angel of the Lord stood close,
then, to the threshing-floor of Areuna the Jebusite.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` David, when he saw how the angel was smiting the people down, had
said to the Lord, The sin is mine, the fault is mine; these poor sheep
of mine, what wrong have they done? Nay, turn thy hand against me, and
my own father’s race!
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then Gad brought David the message, Go up to the threshing-floor of
Areuna the Jebusite, and build an altar there.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So David went up, in obedience to the command which the Lord had
given him through Gad;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and when Areuna looked round, to see the king and the king’s
servants coming towards him,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` he came forward, bowing down with his face to the ground to do the
king reverence. What would my lord king with his servant? he asked. And
David said, I have come to buy thy threshing-floor; I must build an
altar here to the Lord, to put an end to the mortality which goes
unhindered among the people.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then Areuna answered, Let the king’s grace take all he needs for
his offering; here are sheep for a burnt-sacrifice, here is the waggon,
and the yoke my oxen bear, for kindling-wood.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` All this is Areuna’s royal gift to the king.✻ And may the Lord,
Areuna added, grant thy prayer.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But the king would not let him have his will; Nay, said he, I must
buy it from thee; the victims I offer to the Lord my God must not be
procured without cost. So David bought threshing-floor and ox-team for
fifty silver pieces;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` there he built an altar to the Lord, and there he brought
burnt-sacrifice and welcome-offering. So the land was received back
into the Lord’s favour, and the plague disappeared from Israel.

Notas de rodapé:
24:1-4 - God's anger leads David to take a census of Israel,
demonstrating his trust in numbers rather than in God. This reminds us
of the importance of depending on the Lord in all decisions, rather
24:5-9 - The census reveals the extent of David's people, but it also
provokes God's judgment. This situation illustrates the consequences of
24:10-15 - David confesses his sin after receiving God's punishment,
demonstrating the importance of repentance. Humility and acknowledging
wrongdoing are crucial to restoring a relationship with God (see also
24:16-17 - David's vision of the angel of death is a reminder of divine
justice. He intercedes for the people, reflecting the leader's role as
5:16).
24:18-25 - The construction of the altar at Araunah emphasizes the
importance of sacrifice and worship. Araunah's donation is an example
of generosity, but David insists on paying, showing that true sacrifice
must cost something. This teaches us the importance of giving with a
