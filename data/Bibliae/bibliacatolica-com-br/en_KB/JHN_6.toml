"1" = ''':sup:`1` After this, Jesus retired across the sea of Galilee, or Tiberias,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and there was a great multitude following him; they had seen the
miracles he performed over the sick.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So Jesus went up on to the hill-side, and there sat down with his
disciples.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` It was nearly the time of the Jews’ great feast, the paschal feast.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great multitude had
gathered round him, Jesus said to Philip, Whence are we to buy bread
for these folk to eat?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In saying this, he was putting him to the test; he himself knew well
enough what he meant to do.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Philip answered him, Two hundred silver pieces would not buy enough
bread for them, even to give each a little.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` One of his disciples (it was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother) said to
him,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` There is a boy here, who has five barley loaves and two fishes; but
what is that among so many?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Jesus said, Make the men sit down. There was no lack of grass
where they were; so the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Jesus took the loaves, and gave thanks, and distributed them to
the company, and a share of the fishes too, as much as they had a mind
for.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then, when they had all had enough, he told his disciples, Gather
up the broken pieces that are left over, so that nothing may be wasted.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And when they gathered them up, they filled twelve baskets with the
broken pieces left over by those who had eaten.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When they saw the miracle Jesus had done, these men began to say,
Beyond doubt, this is the prophet who is to come into the world.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Knowing, then, that they meant to come and carry him off, so as to
make a king of him, Jesus once again withdrew on to the hill-side all
alone.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` His disciples, when evening came on, went down to the lake,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and there, embarking on the boat, they began to cross the water to
Capharnaum. Darkness had fallen, and Jesus had not yet come back to
them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Meanwhile there was a strong wind blowing, and the sea was
beginning to grow rough.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And now they had rowed some twenty-five or thirty furlongs, when
they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and already drawing near to the
boat. They were terrified:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` but he said to them, It is myself; do not be afraid.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then they took him on board willingly enough; and all at once their
boat reached the land they were making for.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Next morning, the multitude was still waiting on the opposite
shore. They had seen that there was only one boat there, and that Jesus
did not embark with his disciples on this boat, but left his disciples
to go back alone.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But now, since other boats from Tiberias had put in near the place
where they ate the loaves when the Lord gave thanks over them,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` the multitude, finding neither Jesus nor his disciples there,
embarked on these boats in their turn, and went back to Capharnaum to
look for Jesus.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And when they found that he had crossed the lake, they asked him,
Master, when didst thou make thy way here?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Jesus answered them, Believe me, if you are looking for me now, it
is not because of the miracles you have seen; it is because you were
fed with the loaves, and had your fill.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` You should not work to earn food which perishes in the using. Work
to earn food which affords, continually, eternal life, such food as the
Son of Man will give you; God, the Father, has authorized him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` What shall we do, then, they asked him, so as to work in God’s
service?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus answered them, This is the service God asks of you, to
believe in the Man whom he has sent.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So they said to him, Why then, what miracle canst thou do? We must
see it before we trust thee; what canst thou effect?✻
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Our fathers had manna to eat in the desert; as the scripture says,
He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.✻
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Jesus said to them, Believe me when I tell you this; the bread that
comes from heaven is not what Moses gave you. The real bread from
heaven is given only by my Father.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` God’s gift of bread comes down from heaven and gives life to the
whole world.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then, Lord, they said, give us this bread all the while.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But Jesus told them, It is I who am the bread of life; he who comes
to me will never be hungry, he who has faith in me will never know
thirst.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` (But you, as I have told you, though you have seen me, do not
believe in me.)✻
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` All that the Father has entrusted to me will come to me, and him
who comes to me I will never cast out.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` It is the will of him who sent me, not my own will, that I have
come down from heaven to do;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` and he who sent me would have me keep without loss, and raise up at
the last day, all he has entrusted to me.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Yes, this is the will of him who sent me, that all those who
believe in the Son when they see him should enjoy eternal life; I am to
raise them up at the last day.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` The Jews were by now complaining of his saying, I am myself the
bread which has come down from heaven.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Is not this Jesus, they said, the son of Joseph, whose father and
mother are well known to us? What does he mean by saying, I have come
down from heaven?✻
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Jesus answered them, Do not whisper thus to one another.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Nobody can come to me without being attracted towards me by the
Father who sent me, so that I can raise him up at the last day.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` It is written in the book of the prophets, And they shall all have
the Lord for their teacher;✻ everyone who listens to the Father and
learns, comes to me.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` (Not that anyone has seen the Father, except him who comes from
God; he alone has seen the Father.)
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Believe me when I tell you this; the man who has faith in me enjoys
eternal life.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` It is I who am the bread of life.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Your fathers, who ate manna in the desert, died none the less;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` the bread which comes down from heaven is such that he who eats of
it never dies.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` I myself am the living bread that has come down from heaven.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` If anyone eats of this bread, he shall live for ever. And now, what
is this bread which I am to give? It is my flesh, given for the life of
the world.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Then the Jews fell to disputing with one another, How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Whereupon Jesus said to them, Believe me when I tell you this; you
can have no life in yourselves, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of
Man, and drink his blood.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` The man who eats my flesh and drinks my blood enjoys eternal life,
and I will raise him up at the last day.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` My flesh is real food, my blood is real drink.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, lives continually in me,
and I in him.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` As I live because of the Father, the living Father who has sent me,
so he who eats me will live, in his turn, because of me.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Such is the bread which has come down from heaven; it is not as it
was with your fathers, who ate manna and died none the less; the man
who eats this bread will live eternally.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` He said all this while he was teaching in the synagogue, at
Capharnaum.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And there were many of his disciples who said, when they heard it,
This is strange talk, who can be expected to listen to it?
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` But Jesus, inwardly aware that his disciples were complaining over
it, said to them, Does this try your faith?
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` What will you make of it, if you see the Son of Man ascending to
the place where he was before?
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` Only the spirit gives life; the flesh is of no avail; and the words
I have been speaking to you are spirit, and life.✻
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` But there are some, even among you, who do not believe. Jesus knew
from the first which were those who did not believe, and which of them
was to betray him.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` And he went on to say, That is what I meant when I told you that
nobody can come to me unless he has received the gift from my Father.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` After this, many of his disciples went back to their old ways, and
walked no more in his company.
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` Whereupon Jesus said to the twelve, Would you, too, go away?
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom should we go? Thy words are
the words of eternal life;
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` we have learned to believe, and are assured that thou art the
Christ, the Son of God.✻
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen all twelve of you? And one
of you is a devil.
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` He was speaking of Judas son of Simon, the Iscariot, who was one of
the twelve, and was to betray him.
