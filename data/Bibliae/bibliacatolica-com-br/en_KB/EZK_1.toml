"1" = ''':sup:`1` Thirty years had passed;✻ it was the fifth day of the fourth month,
and I was sharing the lot of the exiles by the river Chobar, when
heaven opened, and I saw a vision of God.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The fifth day of the month, and the fifth year since king Joachin
was banished.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To the priest Ezechiel, son of Buzi, the divine word came; there in
the Chaldaean land, by the river Chobar, the power of the Lord could
reach him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I looked round me, to find that a storm-wind had sprung up from the
north, driving a great cloud before it; and this cloud had fire caught
up in it, that fringed it with radiance. And there in the heart of it,
in the very heart of the fire, was a glow like amber,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` that enclosed four living figures. These were human in appearance,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but each had four faces, and two pairs of wings.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Either leg was straight-formed, yet ended in a calf’s hoof; they
sparkled like red-hot bronze.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` On each of the four sides, human arms shewed beneath the wings;
faces and wings looked outwards four ways.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Wings of each were held touching wings of other; and when they
moved, they did not turn round, but each kept an onward course.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` As for the appearance of their faces, each had the face of a man,
yet each of the four looked like a lion when seen from the right, like
an ox when seen from the left, like an eagle when seen from above.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So much for their faces; each had two wings spread out above him,
those two which met his neighbours’ wings; with the other two he veiled
his body.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Each of them marched straight forward, following the movement of a
divine impulse, never swerving as he marched.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` There was that, too, in the appearance of the living figures which
put me in mind of flaming coals, or of torches; that was what I saw
going to and fro in the midst of the living figures, a glow as of fire,
and from this glow lightning came out.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So the living creatures came and went, vivid as lightning-flashes.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And as I watched the living figures, all at once wheels appeared
close to them, one at each of the four sides,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` of strange colour and form. All four were alike, the colour of
aquamarine,✻ and each looked like a wheel within a wheel.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Moved they, it was ever one of the four ways the living figures
looked; and they did not turn round in moving.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` As for their size, their height was terrible to look upon; and the
whole frame of them, all round, was full of eyes.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Onward the wheels moved, when the living figures moved onward, at
their side; rose above the earth when the living figures rose above it.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` They too had a living impulse in them, they too, whenever that
impulse stirred them, must rise up and follow the way it went;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` with the living figures, whose vital impulse they shared, the
wheels too moved, and halted, and rose.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Over the living figures a vault seemed to rise, like a sheet of
dazzling crystal resting on their heads;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` under this vault each held two wings erect to meet his neighbour’s.
Each had two turned upwards to overshadow him, and two turned downwards
to veil his body.✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When they moved, the sound of their wings reached me, loud as
waters in flood or thunders from on high,✻ incessant as the hum of a
great throng or an armed camp; only when they came to rest did they
lower their wings.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` A voice would come from the firmament over their heads; then they
would halt, then they would lower their wings.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Above this vault that rested on them, sapphire blue towered up into
the form of a throne, nor did that throne seem to be empty; a shape was
there above it, as of one enthroned,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and all about him it was filled with amber-coloured flame. Upwards
from his loins, downwards from his loins, an arch of light seemed to
shine,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` like rainbow among the clouds on a day of storm; there was
brightness all about him.
