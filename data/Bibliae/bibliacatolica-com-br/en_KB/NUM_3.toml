"1" = ''':sup:`1` Aaron and Moses had already sons to succeed them at the time when
the Lord spoke to Moses on Sinai;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and these were the names of Aaron’s sons, Nadab, his first-born,
then Abiu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` All these sons of Aaron were anointed priests, their hands enriched
and consecrated for priestly duties,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` but Nadab and Abiu, who offered unhallowed fire in the Lord’s
presence, died there in the desert of Sinai without issue; it was only
Eleazar and Ithamar that performed the duties of the priesthood now,
under the eye of Aaron their father.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now the Lord gave Moses this command,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Dedicate the tribe of Levi to me, and bid them wait on the pleasure
of Aaron, the high priest; doing him service and keeping watch,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` carrying out the duties that belong to public worship before the
tabernacle,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` keeping safe, too, the appurtenances of the tabernacle, and
attending to its needs.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Thou shalt put the Levites at the disposal of
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Aaron and his sons, to whom the Israelites have assigned them; but
it is to Aaron and his sons that thou wilt entrust the priestly office.
No one else must minister there, on pain of death.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` This, too, the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Among all the sons of Israel, I have singled out the Levites to be
my own, in lieu of those first-born Israelites that handsel the womb;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` all first-born things belong to me. Ever since I smote the
first-born in the land of Egypt, I have claimed the eldest birth,
whether of man or of beast, as forfeit; forfeit to me, the Lord.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And while they were still in the desert of Sinai, the Lord bade
Moses
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` register the sons of Levi by their households and their families,
all of them that were more than a month old.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So Moses made a register, as the Lord had bidden him;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` giving the names of Levi’s sons in their order, Gerson, Caath and
Merari;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` then the sons of Gerson, Lebni and Semei,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` the sons of Caath, Amram, Jessar, Hebron and Oziel
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and the sons of Merari, Moholi and Musi.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The two families that came down from Gerson through Lebni and Semei
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` amounting to seven thousand five hundred males, above the age of a
month;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` these were to encamp behind the tabernacle, to the west,

"24" = ''':sup:`24` under Eliasaph the son of Lael.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The parts of the tabernacle which were to be in their charge
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` were the tent itself and its canopy, and the screen stretched over
the doorway by which the tabernacle was entered; the curtains for the
court, and the hanging at the entrance to the court, with all that
belongs to the service of the altar;✻ the tabernacle ropes, too, and
its appurtenances in general.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The race of Caath, comprising the families that were named after
Amram, Jesaar, Hebron and Oziel,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` which counted eight thousand six hundred males above a month old,
were in charge of the sanctuary.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` They were to encamp south of it,

"30" = ''':sup:`30` under Elisaphan the son of Oziel,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and have the keeping of the ark, the table, the lamp-stand, the
altars, the vessels for worship in the sanctuary, the veil, and all
other such furniture.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` These guardians of the sanctuary had the chief of all the Levites
at their head, Eleazar, son of the high priest Aaron.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The two families of Merari’s line, named after Moholi and Musi,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` counting six thousand two hundred males above a month old,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` were to encamp on the north, under Suriel the son of Abihaiel.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` They were to guard the frames and poles of the tabernacle, the
posts with their sockets, and all that went with such an office;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` the posts of the outer court, too, with their sockets, the pegs and
the ropes.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` In front of the tabernacle, that is, on the east, Moses and Aaron
were to encamp with their sons, keeping guard over the sanctuary in the
midst of the Israelite people; it was death for any other to come near
it.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The whole strength of the Levites, all the families registered at
the Lord’s command by Moses and Aaron, was twenty-two thousand males
above a month old.✻
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And now the Lord said to Moses, Count up all the male first-born in
Israel who are more than a month old, and find their number.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` I must have a Levite for every male in Israel; it is the Lord’s
due. And they must have cattle to match in number all the first-born
cattle the Israelites possess.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` So Moses counted the first-born of Israel, as the Lord bade him,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` and found that there were twenty-two thousand two hundred and
seventy-three such persons.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Set apart the Levites to be my own, instead of the first-born
Israelites, and the cattle of the Levites to be mine, instead of the
first-born cattle; it is the Lord’s due.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Meanwhile, here are two hundred and seventy-three first-born who
have no Levites to match their number; for these, ransom must be paid.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Claim five silver pieces, by sanctuary reckoning, for each of them,
(the silver piece is worth twenty pence),
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` and pay the money to Aaron and his sons, as the ransom for the
first-born who are left over.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` So Moses took ransom for those who were left out of the count when
the Levites stood as ransom
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` for the first-born sons of Israel, a thousand three hundred and
sixty-five silver pieces by sanctuary reckoning;
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` and these he paid over to Aaron and his sons as the Lord had bidden
him.

Notas de rodapé:
3:1-4 - Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, died while offering unholy fire
before the Lord. This tragedy reinforces the seriousness of God's
holiness and the care required when serving Him in the Tabernacle (see
3:5-10 - God sets apart the tribe of Levi to serve in the Tabernacle,
replacing the firstborn of Israel. This demonstrates the idea of
3:11-13 - God claims the Levites as His own in exchange for the
consecration of the firstborn, recalling Israel's deliverance from
Egypt. This act of consecration symbolizes God's redemptive power and
Corinthians 6:19-20).
3:14-20 - Moses takes a census of the Levites at God's command,
reinforcing the importance of structure and organization in divine
service. The Levites are numbered from one month old and older,
3:40-51 - The Levites are set apart in exchange for the firstborn of
Israel, and a ransom payment is made. This act symbolizes redemption
and the importance of substitution as a spiritual principle (see also
