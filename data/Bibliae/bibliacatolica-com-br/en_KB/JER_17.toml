of diamond had graven it with their hearts for tablet, or upon the rim
of their altars;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` indelible, while there are sons of theirs to remember where altar
stood once and sacred tree, shrine in the thick forest, shrine on the
high hills;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` to offer sacrifice even yet in the open country-side. All the riches
and treasures of thy land shall be destroyed, all its hill-shrines,✻ in
punishment for all its guilt.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Lost to thee, the home that once I gave thee; in a land thou knowest
not thou shalt be the slave of thy enemies; the fire of anger thou hast
kindled in me can never be quenched.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Cursed shall he be, the Lord says, that puts his trust in man, and
will have flesh and blood to aid him, his thoughts far from God.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Never shall the sight of better times greet him; forlorn as some
bush of tamarisk out in the desert, he dwells in a parched waste, the
salt plains for all his company.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Blessed shall he be that puts his trust in the Lord, makes the Lord
his refuge.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Not more favoured is tree planted by the water’s edge, that pushes
out its roots to catch the moisture, and defies the summer heat; its
green leaves careless of the drought, its fruit unfailing.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` There is no riddle like the twists of the heart; who shall master
them?✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Who but I, the Lord, that can see into man’s heart, and read his
inmost thoughts, to every life awarding what its doings have earned?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Partridge that fosters a brood not its own is fit emblem for the
man that wins riches unjustly; when life is but half done, he must take
leave of them, a fool to the last.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Where from the first supreme majesty sits enthroned, there lies our
sanctuary;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` thou, Lord, art Israel’s hope; the men who forsake thee will be
disappointed, the men who swerve from thy paths will be names written
in sand; have they not forsaken that Lord who is the fountain of living
water?

"14" = ''':sup:`14` If I am to be healed, it is thou, Lord, must heal me; if I am to
find deliverance, it is thou must deliver me; thou art all my boast.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` What has become of the Lord’s threat? (so men taunt me), we are
waiting to see it accomplished!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But this was no hasty word of mine, I did but lead where thou
leddest; it was no wish of mine that calamity should befall mankind;✻
no word I uttered but had the warrant of thy scrutiny.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Not for me thy terrors; the day of affliction is coming, but I
shall find refuge in thee.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They must be abashed, and I vindicated; they must cower, while I
stand confident. It is on them the day of affliction will fall; reward
them, then, with twofold hurt for the hurt they did.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` The Lord bade me go and take my stand at the People’s Gate, where
the kings of Juda passed to and fro; and then, in turn, at the other
gates of Jerusalem.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` This was to be my message from the Lord to king and people of Juda,
to every citizen of Jerusalem that used those gates:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` No more, on peril of your lives, shoulder those packs of yours and
carry them through Jerusalem gates on the sabbath day.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Never a load must leave your houses, nor any work be done, on the
sabbath; this was the command I gave to your fathers,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` only they would not listen or pay heed, chafed under the yoke of
discipline and refused to obey me.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And you, the Lord says, will you obey? Rid these gateways of their
sabbath burdens, keep the sabbath holy by resting from work,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and your kings and princes, David’s own heirs, shall still go
riding through them, with horses and chariots, with their retinue of
nobles, with the men of Juda and Jerusalem’s citizens in their train.
Evermore your city shall be populous;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` from the townships of Juda, from your own country-side, from
Benjamin, from plain and hill and the waste lands of the south, men
shall come with burnt-sacrifice and victim and bloodless offering and
incense to enrich the Lord’s temple.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Refuse to keep the sabbath holy, profane it with burdens borne and
burdens admitted through the gates, and I will set those gates in a
blaze that shall burn down all Jerusalem ere you can quench it.

Notas de rodapé:
17:1-4 - Judah's sin is deeply rooted, and disobedience to the Lord
brings a curse. The reference to a "deceitful heart" illustrates the
corrupt nature of the people and their separation from God as their
17:5-8 - The blessedness of those who trust in the Lord is contrasted
with the curse of those who trust in man. Trust in God is the key to a

human heart demands divine intervention for purification and salvation
17:14-18 - Jeremiah cries out for healing, asking God to intervene to

17:19-27 - Jeremiah is instructed to proclaim the Sabbath as a sign of
obedience to the Lord. Sabbath observance was not just a ritual
practice, but a reflection of commitment to God and His law (see also
