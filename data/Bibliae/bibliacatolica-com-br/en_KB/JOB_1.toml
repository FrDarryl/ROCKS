turn; at such times they would send for their three sisters to eat and
drink beside them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And ever when their week of feasting was over, Job would send for
them,✻ and have them rid of all defilement; next morning, it was his
first care to offer burnt-sacrifice for each of them. Who knows,
thought he, but they may have committed some fault, these children of
mine? Who knows but they may have slighted God in their secret
thoughts? Never would he let the day pass without burnt-sacrifice.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` One day, when the heavenly powers stood waiting upon the Lord’s

"7" = ''':sup:`7` the Lord asked him, where he had been? Roaming about the earth, said
he, to and fro about the earth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Why then, the Lord said, thou hast seen a servant of mine called
Job. Here is a true man, an honest man, none like him on earth; ever he
fears his God, and keeps far from wrong-doing.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Job fears his God, the Enemy answered, and loses nothing by it.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Sheltered his life by thy protection, sheltered his home, his
property; thy blessing on all he undertakes; worldly goods that still
go on increasing; he loses nothing.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` One little touch of thy hand, assailing all that wealth of his!
Then see how he will turn and blaspheme thee.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Be it so, the Lord answered; with all his possessions do what thou
wilt, so thou leave himself unharmed. And with that, the Enemy left the
Lord’s presence, and withdrew.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And now it was the turn of Job’s children to sit over their
feasting and their wine at the house of the eldest brother.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` That day, a messenger brought Job news of his oxen and asses. The
oxen were a-ploughing, said he, and the asses grazing near them,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` when on a sudden a band of Sabæans swept down on them, and carried
all away. As for thy men, the Sabæans put them to the sword, and none
lives to tell the tale but I.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Even as he spoke, another messenger came in with news of the sheep,
how God’s lightning had fallen, devouring sheep and shepherd, so that

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And before this one had finished his story, a fourth messenger came
in. I come, said he, from thy eldest son’s house, where but now thy
sons and daughters sat at their feasting and their wine.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` All on a sudden, came a tempestuous wind from across the desert,
and beat so on every corner of the house that it fell in, crushing thy
children to death amid the ruins of it; none lives to tell the tale but
I.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then rose up Job, and rent his garments about him; and he shaved
his head bare, and fell down to earth to do reverence.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Naked I came, said he, when I left my mother’s womb, and whence I
came, naked I must go. The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; nothing
is here befallen but what was the Lord’s will; blessed be the name of
the Lord.✻

"22" = ''':sup:`22` In all this, Job guarded his lips well, nor challenged with human
folly God’s wisdom.✻
