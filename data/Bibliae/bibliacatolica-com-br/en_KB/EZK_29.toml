[29]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was the tenth year of Sedecias, on the eleventh day of its tenth
month, when word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, turn thy regard towards Pharao, king of Egypt, and
prophesy his and all Egypt’s doom.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This message give him from the Lord God: Have at thee, Pharao, king
of Egypt, great dragon that liest couched between thy streams, boasting
that yonder river is thy own, thou art a god, self-created!✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Trust me, I will bridle those jaws of thine, and all the fish in thy
river I will fasten to thy scales! Out of the river, fish clinging to
scales, I will drag thee,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and leave thee aground in the desert, and thy fish too. None shall
go out to search for thy corpse, or bring it home; carrion it shall be
for beast on earth, for bird in heaven,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and all the citizens of Egypt shall learn my power. This, because
thou didst prove a staff of cane to the men of Israel;✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` grasped they that staff, it splintered, and there was an arm
wounded; leaned they on it, it broke, and their strength gave way under
them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This doom, then, the Lord God pronounces: For thee, the sword; man
nor beast will I spare in thee;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` a lonely desert thou shalt be, till thou hast learned what my power
is, thou that wouldst be river’s lord and river’s maker.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Out upon thee, out upon those streams of thine; a desert Egypt
shall be, devastated by the sword, from Syene’s tower to the marches of
Ethiopia;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` man nor beast shall set foot in it till it has lain forty years
desolate.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Land of Egypt shall be as the desert lands are, cities of Egypt as
the ruined cities are, for forty years uninhabited; and the men of
Egypt shall be scattered wide as earth among the nations.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` This too: At the end of forty years I will bring the Egyptians back
from their countries of exile,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` restore them from banishment, and in Phatures, the land of their
birth, give them a home once more; there they shall be a kingdom of
little account.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Least of the kingdoms Egypt shall be, no more hold up its head
among the nations, too weak for empire now.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` No more shall it raise hopes among the men of Israel, and bring
upon them the guilt of finding a refuge there; they shall learn that I,
the Lord, am their God.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It was on the first day of the twenty-seventh year✻ that word came
to me from the Lord:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Son of man, here is great drudgery king Nabuchodonosor of Babylon
has given his men in the assault upon Tyre; every head worn bald, every
shoulder smooth, by the burdens they carried! A thankless service it
was they did me there, he and his army;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` but now, says the Lord God, I will make use of Egypt to pay
Nabuchodonosor his wages; all its great wealth he shall have, spoil for
his spoiling, plunder for his plundering, and so his men shall have
their reward.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He has fought my battles, and Egypt shall be his recompense, the
Lord God says.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When that day comes, new life shall spring from the stock of
Israel, and to the men of Israel thou shalt speak with unhampered
utterance, to attest my divine power.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
29:1-2 - God's judgment on Egypt is announced, with a vision of a proud
nation brought low. Egypt, which considered itself self-sufficient,
will see its downfall, demonstrating that all trust in human strength
29:3-5 - God declares that Pharaoh, king of Egypt, will be defeated and
cast into the wilderness, representing the loss of power and influence.
The metaphor of the crocodile in the water symbolizes Pharaoh and the
fall of his nation, demonstrating the fragility of human empires before
29:6-9 - Egypt will be abandoned, and her cities will be desolate, like
a nation no longer honored. This reveals God's justice against the
nations that rebel against Him, and the desolation is a reflection of
29:10-12 - The land of Egypt will be desolate for 40 years, and the
surrounding nations will be shaken by its fall. This emphasizes the
totality of divine judgment, which will affect every aspect of Egyptian
29:13-16 - After 40 years of desolation, God promises to restore Egypt,
but it will no longer be a great power. This reflects God's mercy,
which offers restoration, though Egypt's glory will never be the same
