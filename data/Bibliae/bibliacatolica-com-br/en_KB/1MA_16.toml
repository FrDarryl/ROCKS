"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was not long before John came up from Gazara, to tell his father
Simon how ill Cendebaeus was using their fellow-countrymen.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And at that, Simon must have his two elder sons present, Judas and
John both, and made the command over to them. Still young we were, he
said, I and my brothers and my father’s kin, when we began that war on
Israel’s enemies which is being fought yet; under our banners once and
again came victory, and the day was saved for Israel.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I am an old man now, and it is yours to do what I and brother of
mine did; march out, fight in our people’s cause, and heaven’s aid be
with you!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Twenty thousand warriors John✻ chose out from the rest, and cavalry
to support them, and away they went to fight Cendebaeus. That night
they spent at Modin,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and on the morrow, when they left it for the valley, what a huge
array was this, both of horse and foot, encountering them! And a
mountain torrent flowed in between.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When John brought his army to the opposite bank, and found his men
had little stomach for the crossing, he made the passage first, leaving
the rest to follow at his heels;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` then drew them up by companies, with the cavalry in between, so
greatly did the enemy’s cavalry outnumber them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And now the sacred trumpets sounded the charge; fled Cendebaeus,
fled his army at their onslaught, and many were left dead on the field;
for the rest, they were fain to take refuge behind their walls again.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` John went in pursuit, for all his brother Judas had been wounded in
the battle, and chased them as far as the walls of Cedron … which he
had fortified.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Nor might they find shelter in the strongholds of the Azotus
territory; he burnt these to the ground; a toll of two thousand men he
had taken before he returned victorious to Judaea.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Turn we now to Ptolemy, son of Abobus, that was in charge of all
Jericho plain, and had a purse well lined with silver and gold;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` was he not the son-in-law of a high priest?✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But higher still his ambition ran; he would make himself master of
the whole country; murder he plotted for Simon and his sons together.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It was in Sabath, the eleventh month, of the hundred and
seventy-seventh year, that Simon came down to Jericho, as ever he
visited all the cities of Judaea in his great care for them; and his
sons Mattathias and Judas went with him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And there, in a castle he had built for himself, Doch is the name
of it, the son of Abobus gave them treacherous welcome. A great feast
he made, but he had men waiting in readiness,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and with these, when Simon and his sons had drunk deep, he took
arms, broke into the banqueting-chamber, and slew both father and sons,
with certain of their retinue.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Never saw Israel so treacherous a deed, or good service so ill
rewarded.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` News of all this was sent by Ptolemy to the king, and in writing;
his plea was, an army should be sent out in support of him, and the
country, with all its cities and all the tribute that came from them,
given into his charge.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Others of his men he despatched to Gazara; John must be put to
death, he wrote, and for the captains, they should have silver and gold
and good recompense, would they but rally to his side;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` others again were to take possession of Jerusalem, and of the
temple hill.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But too late; a messenger had reached John at Gazara, telling him
his father and brothers were dead, and himself too marked down for
slaughter;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` whereupon he took alarm in good earnest; their murderous errand
known, he seized his executioners and made an end of them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` What else John did, and how fought he, brave deeds done, and strong
walls built, and all his history,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` you may read in the annals of his time, that were kept faithfully
since the day when he succeeded his father as high priest.
