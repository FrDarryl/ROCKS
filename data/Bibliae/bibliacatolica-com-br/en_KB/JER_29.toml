plant yourselves gardens of your own to support you,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` wive and gender, and of your sons and daughters wed man with maid,
maid with man, to breed sons and daughters in their turn; grow
numerous, that are now so few, there in your land of exile.

Never allow prophet and soothsayer that are of your company to mislead
you; his dreams let the dreamer abandon;

good earnest.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Find me you shall, the Lord says, and your sentence of exile shall

prophecy among you, there in Babylon.
'''

who dwell here now, instead of sharing your exile, this is the divine
sentence:
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I mean to plague them, says the Lord of hosts, with sword and
famine and pestilence; of no more account will I make them than a
basket of foul figs, so foul there is no eating them.

they shall be to all the kingdoms of the world, a name to curse by, a
thing of wonder and of scorn, a laughing-stock among all the countries
I have appointed for their banishment.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` All this, because they would not listen to any word of mine, the
Lord says; early to their doors I sent the prophets that were servants
of mine, I, your Lord, and could get no hearing.
'''

into exile at Babylon.

Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and that punishment you shall witness
for yourselves.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Wherever exiles from Juda are found in the Chaldaean country, this
shall be the curse they use: Such doom the Lord give thee as he gave to
Sedecias and Achab, that the king of Babylon roasted over a fire!
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` This is great shame they have brought on Israel, bedding with their
neighbours’ wives, and uttering in my name counterfeit prophecies that

'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, about the letter he sent

still?
'''

telling us our exile shall be long; we must build ourselves houses to
dwell in, we must plant gardens to support us!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` This letter was read aloud to Jeremias by the high priest;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and then it was that the Lord’s word came to Jeremias,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` with a message he must send to the exiles: This doom the Lord
utters against Semeias of Nehelam. Would he prophesy in my name, a man

"32" = ''':sup:`32` I will call Semeias of Nehelam to account for it, the Lord says,
and his children after him. Man of his race there shall be none
surviving among this people of mine, the Lord says, to see my bounty
bestowed on it. Against me, the Lord, he has used the language of
rebellion.
