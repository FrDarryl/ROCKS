tribe of Dan; and I have inspired the hearts of all the craftsmen with
skill to carry out the commands which I have given thee.

Notas de rodapé:
31:1-6 - God chooses Bezalel and Oholiab and empowers them with the
Holy Spirit to build the Tabernacle. This choice shows how God empowers
31:7-11 - The list of sacred items to be made by Bezalel and Oholiab

Tabernacle has a specific purpose, symbolizing God's order and care in
31:12-17 - The commandment to keep the Sabbath is reaffirmed as a
perpetual sign between God and Israel. The Sabbath is a reminder of
God's covenant and rest after creation, and its observance reflects the
20:12).
31:18:00 - God gives Moses the tablets of stone containing the Ten
Commandments, written with the finger of God. These tablets are a
symbol of God's Law and God's covenant with Israel (see also
