"1" = ''':sup:`1` Five days later the high priest Ananias came down, accompanied by
some of the elders and by an advocate named Tertullus; these appeared
before the governor against Paul.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So, when Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began his indictment
thus. Such is the peace thou hast enabled us to enjoy, so many wrongs
have been righted for us through thy wisdom,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` that always and everywhere, most noble Felix, we are ready to
acknowledge it with grateful hearts.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But I must not weary thee with more of this; what we ask of thy
courtesy is no more than a brief audience.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Here is a man who is known to us as a pestilent mover of sedition
among Jews all over the world, a ringleader of the sect of the
Nazarenes,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` who has not scrupled to attempt a violation of the temple. We
arrested him, and had intended to try him according to our own law,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` when the captain, Lysias, came and took him out of our hands, with
great violence,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and insisted that his accusers must appear before thee. Interrogate
him thyself, and thou wilt be able to learn the truth about all the
accusations we bring against him.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the Jews, for their part, supported the indictment, alleging
that all this was the truth.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then the governor made a sign to bid Paul speak, and he answered, I
am the more emboldened to make my defence, because I know well that
thou hast been a judge over this nation for many years.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thou hast the means of assuring thyself that it is only twelve days
since I came up to Jerusalem, to worship there.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` They have never found me raising controversy, or bringing a crowd
together, either in the temple, or in the synagogues, or in the open
city;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` nor can they produce any proof of the charges they bring against
me.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But this I admit to thee, that in worshipping God, my Father, I
follow what we call the way, and they call a sect. I put my trust in
all that is written in the law and the prophets,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` sharing before God the hope they have too, that the dead will rise
again, both just and unjust.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` To that end I, like them, am at pains to keep my conscience clear
of offence towards God or man, at all times.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` After some years’ absence I came up to bring alms to the men of my
own race, and certain offerings.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It was when I had just made these offerings and had been purified
in the temple, that I was found there, no crowd about me, no rioting,
by whom?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` By some Jews from Asia, who ought to be here, standing in thy
presence, if they had any quarrel with me.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` In default of that, it is for those who are here to give their own
account of what blame they found in me, when I stood before the
Council;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` unless it were over one single utterance, when I cried out,
standing there among them, If I am on my trial before you to-day, it is
because of the resurrection of the dead.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Felix, who had full information about this way, reserved judgement;
I will give you a hearing, he said, when Lysias, the captain, has come
down here.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And he gave orders to the centurion that Paul was to be kept
safely, but left at his ease, and that any of his friends should be
given liberty to minister to him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And some days afterwards, when Felix was there with his wife
Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and listened to his
message about faith in Jesus Christ.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When he spoke of justice, and continence, and of the judgement that
is to come, Felix was terrified; No more of this for the present, he
said, I will send for thee when I can find leisure.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` At the same time, he hoped that Paul would offer him a bribe, and
for that reason sent for him often, and courted his company.✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So two years passed; then Porcius Festus came as successor to
Felix; and Felix, who wished to ingratiate himself with the Jews, left
Paul in prison.
