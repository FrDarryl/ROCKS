"1" = ''':sup:`1` Rachel, meanwhile, when she found she remained barren, looked with
envy on her sister; Thou must needs give me children, said she to her
husband, or it will be my death.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` What, answered Jacob, angry at her mood, Must I stand in the place
of God to thee? It is he that has denied thee motherhood.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Here is Bala, she said, my maid-servant; get her with child instead,
and it shall be born on my knees; thus, through her means, I shall have
a family of my own.✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So she gave him Bala as his mate;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and Bala, got with child by Rachel’s husband, bore a son.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Whereupon Rachel said, God has pronounced judgement for me, and
listened to my plea, by giving me a son; and she called the boy Dan, as
if she would say, He has pronounced judgement.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Afterwards Bala conceived again and bore a second son;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` of him Rachel said, God has matched me like a wrestler against my
sister, and I have won the bout, so she called him Nephthali,
Wrestling.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Lia, too, finding that she was not having any more children, gave
her maid-servant Zelpha to her husband for his mate;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and when Zelpha conceived and bore a son,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Lia said, Good fortune has come to me, and called the boy Gad,
Fortune.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Zelpha, too, bore Jacob a second son,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and Lia said, Here is a blessing for me; women must needs call me
blessed now; so she gave him the name of Aser, Blessedness.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Once, at the time of the wheat harvest, Ruben went out and found
some mandrakes, which he brought back to his mother Lia;✻ and Rachel
said to Lia, Give me some of the fruit thy son has found.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What, answered she, art thou not content with stealing my husband
from me? Must thou have my son’s mandrake fruit as well? And Rachel
said, Jacob shall sleep with thee to-night, if I may have some of thy
son’s mandrake-fruit.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So, when Jacob came back from work at evening, Lia went out to meet
him; Thou art to share my bed to-night, she told him; I have paid thy
hire with the mandrake fruit which my son found. So he slept with her
that night;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and now God listened to her prayers, so that she conceived again
and bore a fifth son.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Whereupon she said, God has paid me too my hire, for the
maid-servant I lent to my husband, and she called the boy Issachar,
Reward.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And again Lia conceived, and bore a sixth son;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` This is a fair dowry, she said, God has endowed me with; once more
my husband will dwell with me, now that I have borne him six sons; and
she called the boy Zabulon, Dwelling.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` She had one more child after this, a daughter called Dina.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Meanwhile, the Lord had not forgotten Rachel; her prayer was
answered, and she, too, had issue.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When she conceived and bore a son, her thought was, God has taken
away my disgrace.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And she called him Joseph, Increase; If only, she thought, God
would increase my household with another son.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` After Joseph’s birth, Jacob said to his father-in-law, Give me
leave to go back home, to my own country.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when I go, let me take with me the wives and the children I
have earned in thy service; how hard I have worked for thee, none knows
better than thou.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Let me ask a favour of thee, said Laban. Proof needs none that it
is for thy sake God has made me prosper so.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Work for me still, and name thy own hire.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` None knows better than thou, answered Jacob, how hard I have worked
for thee, and how these herds of thine have increased under my care.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It was little enough thou hadst before I came to thy house, and now
thou hast become rich; the Lord has blessed thee from the day when I
came hither. Now it is time that I should think of my own household
too.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` What shall I give thee? Laban asked. Give me nothing, said he; but
I will consent to feed and tend thy herds still on this condition.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Go round all thy flocks, now, and remove from them every sheep that
is speckled, or has a blotched fleece. And the hire thou art to pay me
shall be all the lambs that are born, even so, grey or spotted or
speckled; and so with the kids.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So, later, when our agreement is fulfilled, my honesty shall be on
its trial; if I keep for myself any beast except those which are
speckled or spotted or grey, whether it be lamb or kid, call me a
thief.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Thy request, said Laban, is granted;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and, that same day, he set aside she-goats and ewes, he-goats and
rams, that were speckled and spotted; all those, too, that were of one
colour, white (among the goats) or black (among the sheep);✻ and these
he gave in charge of his own sons.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he put a distance of three days’ journey between himself and
his son-in-law.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Jacob, then, left in charge of the rest of the flocks, did this. He
took green branches of poplar, and almond, and plane, and partly peeled
them; so that (now the bark had gone) the white shewed through where
they had been stripped, whereas the parts he had left untouched
remained green; everywhere the colour was varied.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` These branches he fitted into the troughs where his flocks were
watered, so that when they came to drink, they should have these
speckled branches before their eyes, and the dams would conceive in
full view of them.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Looking at the branches at the very heat of their coupling, the
dams bore spotted and speckled and piebald young.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` There, then, were the two flocks divided, and there were Jacob’s
branches set up before the very eyes of the rams. All the white (sheep)
and all the black (goats) were to be Laban’s, the rest Jacob’s, when
the flocks were sorted afresh.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And this was his plan; at the earlier breeding-season he fitted the
branches into the troughs, before the eyes of ram and ewe, so that the
dams might be looking at them when they conceived;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` but when the later breeding happened, and the time for conceiving
was at an end, he put the branches there no longer. So all the
late-bred (weaklings) belonged to Laban, and all the (strong)
early-bred belonged to Jacob.✻
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Thus he became rich beyond measure; many were the herds, the
men-servants and maid-servants, the camels and asses that were his.✻
