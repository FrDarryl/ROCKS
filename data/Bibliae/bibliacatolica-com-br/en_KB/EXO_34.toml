"1" = ''':sup:`1` After this the Lord said to him, Carve two tablets of stone, like
those others, and I will write on them the same words as I wrote on the
tablets thou didst break.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Be ready to come up on to mount Sinai in the morning, and there thou
shalt stand before me on the mountain top.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` No one else is to climb up with thee, no one else is to be in sight
on any part of the mountain; even the cattle and the sheep must not be
allowed to graze within view.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Moses carved two tablets of stone, like the others; and he rose
at dawn and went up mount Sinai at the Lord’s bidding, with the tablets
in his hand.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The Lord came down to meet him, hidden in cloud, and Moses stood
with him there, calling on the Lord’s name.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Thus the Lord passed by, and he cried out, It is the Lord God, the
ruler of all things, the merciful, the gracious; slow to take
vengeance, rich in kindness, faithful to his promises.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He is true to his promise of mercy a thousand times over; shame or
sin or guilt is none but he forgives it; yet, before him, none can
claim innocence in his own right, and when he punishes, the son must
make amends for the father’s guilt, to the third and the fourth
generation.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then, without more ado, Moses fell prostrate with his face to the
ground in worship.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Lord, he said, if thou dost look on me with favour, I entreat thee
to go with us on our journey, stiff-necked as this people is; guilt of
our sins do thou pardon, and keep us for thy own.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the Lord answered, Here is my covenant, to which I am pledged.
In the presence of you all I will do such marvels as were never yet
seen on earth by any nation; the people among whom thou dwellest shall
see for themselves what the Lord can do, and be terrified at the sight.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thy part is to keep all the commandments I am now giving thee.When
I dispossess Amorrhite, Chanaanite, Hethite, Pherezite, Hevite and
Jebusite at thy coming,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` make no treaty of friendship with any inhabitant of the land, or it
will be thy ruin;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` destroy their altars, break their images, cut down their forest
shrines.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Never pay worship to any alien god; the very name of the Lord
bespeaks jealous love, he will endure no rival.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do not ally yourselves, then, with those who dwell there; those
faithless hearts will be set on their own gods, and when they do
sacrifice to their idols, someone will bid thee come and feast upon the
meat so offered.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Nor must thou find wives for thy sons among their daughters;
faithless themselves, they will make thy sons, too, faithless, and
worshippers of their own gods.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Cast no metal to make thyself idols.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Observe the feast of unleavened bread. For seven days, in the first
month of spring, thou shalt eat thy bread without leaven, as I bade
thee; it was in that spring month thou didst escape from Egypt.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The first male thing that comes from every womb is forfeit to me;
every such living thing, be it ox or ass, is mine by right.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When an ass has her first foal, thou shalt offer a sheep in payment
of its ransom; or, if thou hast no mind to ransom it, let it be killed.
The first-born of thy own sons thou must ransom, presenting thyself
before me with an offering.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thou hast six days to work in; on the seventh, both ploughing and
reaping must cease.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Thou shalt keep the feast of the seven weeks, with the first-fruits
of thy wheat harvest, and another feast at the end of the year, when
all is gathered in.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thrice in the year all thy men folk shall present themselves before
the Lord, the almighty God of Israel.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And so, when I have dispossessed the nations at thy coming, and
given thee wide lands to dwell in, three times a year present thyself
before the Lord thy God, and thy lands none shall invade by treachery.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When thou offerest living things in sacrifice to me, the bread that
goes with them shall not be leavened, nor shalt thou leave any of the
paschal victim till the morrow.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Bring the first-fruits of thy land as an offering to the house of
the Lord thy God. Seething a kid in its dam’s milk is a rite forbidden
thee.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then the Lord said to Moses, Put these words in writing, as terms
of the covenant I am making with thee and with Israel.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So, for forty days and nights, without food or drink, he remained
there with the Lord; and he wrote down on the tablets the ten precepts
of the covenant.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Moses came down, after this, from Mount Sinai, bearing with him the
two tablets on which the law was written; and his face, although he did
not know it, was all radiant✻ after the meeting at which he had held
speech with God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The sight of that radiance made Aaron and the sons of Israel shrink
from all near approach to him;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` he must call out to Aaron and the leaders of the people before they
would gather round him. To these he spoke first;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` then all the Israelites came to greet him, and he passed on to them
all the commands he had received on mount Sinai.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` When he had finished speaking, he put a veil over his face,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` which he only laid aside when he went into the Lord’s presence and
had speech with him. Afterwards he would come out, and tell the
Israelites what commands had been given him;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` so they saw his face, as he came out, still radiant, but always,
when he spoke to them, he veiled his face as before.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
34:1-4 - God commands Moses to go up Mount Sinai with new tablets to
rewrite the commandments after the incident with the golden calf. This
symbolizes forgiveness and the renewal of the covenant between God and
34:5-7 - God reveals himself to Moses as merciful, compassionate, and
slow to anger, but just in executing wickedness. This passage is
34:10:00 - God reaffirms His covenant with Israel, promising wonders
never before seen. This covenant renews the promises made to Abraham
and reiterates Israel's calling as the chosen people (see also
34:14:00 - God commands Israel not to make treaties with the peoples of
the land and not to destroy their altars, for He is a jealous God. This
demonstrates the exclusivity of God's worship and separation from sin
34:29-35 - When Moses comes down from the mountain, his face shines
from having been in God's presence. The glow on Moses' face symbolizes
the spiritual transformation that occurs through being in communion
