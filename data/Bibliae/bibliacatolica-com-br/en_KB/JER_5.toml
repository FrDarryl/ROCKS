"1" = ''':sup:`1` Go the rounds of Jerusalem, search the streets of it with hue and
cry; and if you find one man there that faithfully does his duty, and
keeps troth, then the city shall be pardoned.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Nay, though they call on the living God to be their witness, they
forswear themselves none the less.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` On faithfulness, Lord, thy eyes are set. And these, when thou
smitest them, are unrepentant still; when thou crushest them to earth,
will not heed reproof; brows are theirs unyielding as rock, and return
they will not.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But indeed, thought I, perhaps they are poor men and foolish, that
have never learnt the divine command, or what their God requires of
them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I will go and have speech with the men of rank; what the divine
command is, what their God requires of them, these will surely know.
And these I found conspiring, as none other, to throw off the yoke, to
break through their bonds.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` What wonder if they are attacked and despoiled by robbers, that
leave the woods at night-time, stealthily as lion or wolf or prowling
leopard, to beleaguer their towns and catch all who venture forth? So
many their rebellions, so obstinate their defiance!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For all this, how should I pardon thee? Thy sons have deserted me,
by gods that are no gods their vows are taken; full-fed with my bounty,
they left their wedded troth, to wanton in the bower of a mistress;

"9" = ''':sup:`9` What, shall I let all this pass me by, the Lord says; shall I not
take my fill of vengeance against such a nation as this?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Scale those ramparts, and fall to pillage, not taking full toll
even yet; root out the slips of yonder vine, the Lord will not claim
them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Obstinately they have defied me, the Lord says, Israel and Juda
both;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` they disown me; Nay, they tell one another, this is none of his
doing, harm shall never befall us, we shall have neither slaughter nor
famine here;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` the prophets did but waste breath, no word of revelation made to
them; on their own heads be it!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Vain words; but not vainly the Lord, the God of hosts, has spoken;
flaming words of his he has entrusted to my lips, and fuel this people
shall be for their devouring.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` A nation from far away I am summoning, even now, Israel, to the
attack; a warlike nation, of ancient lineage, whose very tongue shall
be strange to thee, no word of it well understood;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` greedily as the tomb their quivers gape, and they are warriors all.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They shall rob thee of harvest and of food, rob thee of son and
daughter, rob thee of flock and herd, rob thee of vine and fig-tree;
and all the strongholds, wherein thy hope lies, at the sword’s point
shall be overthrown.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Yet even then, the Lord says, I will not take full toll of thee.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Ask you why the Lord has so much misused you, this is to be my
answer: Did you not forsake me, to worship alien gods in your own land?
Alien gods you shall worship in an alien land, for your punishment.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` To Israel’s race proclaim it, for all Juda to hear,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Listen, foolish folk and unperceiving, with sightless eyes, ears
that had as well been deaf!
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Have you no fear of me, the Lord says, will you stand unmoved in my
presence? Was it not I gave the sea its frontier of sand, by my eternal
decree inviolate? Vainly the waves boil and toss, they cannot pass
beyond it.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` A faithless heart, a rebellious heart this people of mine has; in a
moment they swerve aside from the path, and are gone;

"24" = ''':sup:`24` never a thought of reverence for the Lord their God, who gives them
autumn and spring rains when the time comes, and secures them a full
harvest.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It is your wrong-doing that has altered their course; to guilt such
as yours, blessings are denied.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Godless men there are among my people that lie in wait like any
fowler, but noose and trap of theirs is set to catch men.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Never was cage so full of birds, as their homes of wealth ill
gotten; men of power and riches,
