"1" = ''':sup:`1` And once more he went into a synagogue; and there was a man there
who had one of his hands withered;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and they were watching him, to see whether he would do a work of
healing on the sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring
against him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So he said to the man who had his hand withered, Rise up, and come
forward.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then he said to them, Which is right, to do good on the sabbath day,
or to do harm? To save life, or to make away with it? And they sat
there in silence.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And he looked round on them in anger, grieved at the hardness of
their hearts, and said to the man, Stretch out thy hand. He stretched
it out, and his hand was restored to him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then the Pharisees went out, and at once began plotting with those
who were of Herod’s party to make away with him.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Jesus withdrew, with his disciples, towards the sea; and great
crowds followed him from Galilee, and from Judaea,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and
those who lived about Tyre and Sidon, hearing of all that he did, came
in great numbers to him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So he told his disciples to keep a boat ready at need because of the
multitude, for fear they should press on him too close;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` for he did many works of healing, so that all those who were
visited with suffering thrust themselves upon him, to touch him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The unclean spirits, too, whenever they saw him, used to fall at
his feet and cry out,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thou art the Son of God; and he would give them a strict charge not
to make him known.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then he went up on to the mountain-side, and called to him those
whom it pleased him to call; so these came to him,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and he appointed twelve to be his companions, and to go out
preaching at his command,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` with power to cure diseases and to cast out devils.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` To Simon he gave the fresh name of Peter;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` to James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, he gave the fresh
name of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The others were Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew,
and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the
Cananean;✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and Judas Iscariot, the traitor.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And now they came into a house, and once more the multitude
gathered so that they had no room even to sit and eat.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When word came to those who were nearest him, they went out to
restrain him; they said, He must be mad.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He is
possessed by Beelzebub; it is through the prince of the devils that he
casts the devils out.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So he called them to him, and spoke to them in parables; How can it
be Satan who casts Satan out?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Why, if a kingdom is at war with itself, that kingdom cannot stand
firm,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and if a household is at war with itself, that household cannot
stand firm;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` if Satan, then, has risen up in arms against Satan, he is at war
with himself; he cannot stand firm; his end has come.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` No one can enter into a strong man’s house and plunder his goods,
without first making the strong man his prisoner; then he can plunder
his house at will.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Believe me, there is pardon for all the other sins of mankind and
the blasphemies they utter;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` but if a man blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, there is no pardon
for him in all eternity; he is guilty of a sin which is eternal.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` This was because they were saying, He has an unclean spirit.✻
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then his mother and his brethren came and sent a message to him,
calling him to them, while they stood without.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` There was a multitude sitting round him when they told him, Here
are thy mother and thy brethren without, looking for thee.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And he answered them, Who is a mother, who are brethren, to me?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then he looked about at those who were sitting around him, and
said, Here are my mother and my brethren!
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` If anyone does the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and
mother.✻

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
3:1-6 - The healing of a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath defies
legal and religious norms, showing that Jesus prioritizes the
restoration of human life over tradition. The Pharisees' reaction
reveals the hardness of their hearts in the face of God's mercy (see
3:7-12 - The crowd follows Jesus because of the miracles He performs,
but He instructs them not to reveal His identity. This indicates that,
while the healings confirm His authority, Jesus wants to focus on His
3:13-19 - Jesus chooses the twelve apostles, establishing a leadership
that will continue His mission on earth. This moment underscores the
importance of divine choice in the formation of the Christian community
6:12-16).
3:20-30 - Jesus is accused of being possessed by Beelzebub, but He
refutes this accusation, explaining that His power comes from God. He
teaches that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is unforgivable,
emphasizing the gravity of the sin of rejecting God's Spirit (see also
3:31-35 - Jesus redefines family ties, saying that those who do God's
will are His true brothers and sisters. This underscores the importance
of obedience to God as the foundation for our relationship with Him and
8:19-21).
