"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the first year of the Babylonian king Baltassar, Daniel had a
dream; sleep he might, but still his thoughts were busy. The substance
of this dream he put on record, giving no more than the sum of it, in
these words following.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Night came, and brought with it a vision for my seeing. All the
winds of heaven, I thought, did battle over the wide sea,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and out of it came four great beasts, each of them different from
the last.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` A lioness the first seemed, that yet had eagle’s wings; but as I
watched, these wings were plucked, and with that it rose up from the
ground, standing on its feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to
it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then rose up another by its side, this one like a bear; three rows
of teeth it had in its mouth, and a summons came to it, great part of
mankind it should devour.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` What saw I next? A leopard it seemed, yet had a bird’s wings, four
of them, on its back, and four heads; this beast it was that now
attained dominion.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But still I dreamed on, and a fourth beast saw at last, fiercer, and
stranger, and more powerful yet. It had great teeth of iron, ready to
crush and to devour, and ever what these spared it would trample down
with its feet; match it those others might not; and out of its head
grew ten horns.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Even as I watched them, a new horn grew up in the midst of the
others, and three of them must be plucked away to make room for it;
eyes it had, this new horn, like a man’s eyes, and a mouth that talked
very boastfully.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` While I still watched, there were judgement-thrones a-setting; and
one took his seat there crowned with age. White as snow his garments
were, his hair could match unsullied wool for whiteness; his throne all
of flame, the wheels under it glancing fire;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and ever from his presence a stream of fire came rushing onward. A
thousand thousand they were that waited on his bidding, and for every
one of these, a thousand others were standing there before him. Assize
should be held now, and the records lay open.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And still I watched, to see what would become of the boasts yonder
horn had made; and all at once I was aware the beast itself had been
slain, and even the carcase of it had vanished, handed over to the
flames;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` nor might those other beasts enjoy power any longer, though life
they should enjoy for a while, until their turn came.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then I saw in my dream, how one came riding on the clouds of
heaven, that was yet a son of man; came to where the Judge sat, crowned
with age, and was ushered into his presence.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` With that, power was given him, and glory, and sovereignty; obey
him all must, men of every race and tribe and tongue; such a reign as
his lasts for ever, such power as his the ages cannot diminish.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` By this, Daniel wrote, my heart was ill at ease; a dread sight it
was, and as I dreamed, my thoughts bewildered me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So I drew closer to one that stood by, and asked to know the truth
of all that had gone forward; he it was that read the riddle for me,
and thus he unravelled it:
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It is but earthly kingdoms they betoken, these four great beasts
thou hast seen;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` the servants of the most high God shall have dominion yet; theirs
it shall be for ever and for evermore.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But I was minded to know the truth more fully; what was the fourth
beast, so different from all the rest, so dreadful; why must it have
teeth and claws of iron, to crush and to devour, to trample on what was
left?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` What of the ten horns on its head, and that other, before which
three of them fell, the horn that had eyes, and a mouth to boast with,
and grew greater than the rest?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` This horn it was I saw doing battle against the servants of the
most High, and getting the better of them,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` until the Judge appeared, crowned with age, to give them redress,
and their turn came to have dominion.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And his answer was, this fourth beast was the fourth of those
earthly kingdoms, and the greatest of them all, to crush and devour and
trample down a whole world.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Ten kings be the ten horns of that kingdom, and after these another
shall rise, more poweful yet, and three of them shall bite the dust.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Boastfully he shall challenge the most High, and do his servants
despite; calendar and ordinance he shall think to set aside; for a
space of time, and for twice as long, and for half as long,✻ he must
needs have his way.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then assize shall be held on him, and all his power be taken away,
crushed down and forgotten for ever.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then what royalty, what empire, what earth-embracing dominion shall
be theirs, the people set apart for the most High! Sovereignty
everlasting; no monarch but must bow to its yoke.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So ended the revelation made to Daniel. Bewildered my thoughts
were, and my cheek pale, but I kept the memory of it faithfully in my
heart.
