"1" = ''':sup:`1` Rich and renowned, Josaphat had allied his house by marriage with
the house of Achab;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and now, when some years had passed, he went to visit him at
Samaria. Many a ram, many a bullock did Achab slaughter to make him and
his retinue welcome; then he had a plan to put before him, that they
should march against Ramoth-Galaad.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And what answer made Josaphat, king of Juda, when Achab, king of
Israel, proposed that they should attack Ramoth-Galaad together? Thou
and I, said he, are all at one; my army is all thine, we will stand at
thy side in battle.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But he would have Achab consult the Lord first.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So Achab sent for his prophets, four hundred in number, and asked
whether they should attack Ramoth-Galaad or let it be? Go to the
attack, they said; the Lord means to make the king’s grace master of
it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But still Josaphat asked whether there was no prophet of the Lord to
be found, so that they could make enquiry through him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why yes, the king of Israel told him, there is one man through whom
we might ask for the Lord’s counsel; yet is he no friend of mine, still
he will be prophesying that ill fortune is to befall me, never good;
Michaeas is his name, the son of Jemla. Nay, my lord king, said
Josaphat, think better of it.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So Achab summoned one of his chamberlains, and bade him fetch
Michaeas the son of Jemla with all speed.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` There sat the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda, each on his
throne, in all their royal state, in an open space by the gate of
Samaria; and there in their presence all the prophets said their say.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` One of them, Sedecias the son of Chanaana, had provided himself
with a pair of horns fashioned in iron; With these, he said, thou shalt
toss Syria about, till thou hast made an end of it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And all the prophets had the same word for him; Go and attack
Ramoth-Galaad, they told him, and a blessing on thy journey! The Lord
means to make the king’s grace master of it.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So the messenger who went to summon Michaeas told him, Here are all
the prophets bidding the king good speed, like one man; pray join thy
voice to theirs, and prophesy good fortune.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nay, answered he, as the Lord is a living God, the word I speak
shall be the word he gives me.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So he came into the king’s presence, and when he was asked whether
it were better to attack Ramoth-Galaad, or to let it be, he answered,
Go to the attack; all shall be well with you, and your enemies shall be
at your mercy.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What, cried Achab, shall I never cease adjuring thee in the Lord’s
name to tell me only the truth?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Listen then, said he; I had a vision of all Israel straying over
the mountains like sheep that had no shepherd, and the Lord’s word
came, They have no master now; let them disperse to their homes in
peace.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` (It is as I told thee, Achab said to Josaphat; still he prophesies
ill fortune, never good.)
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then Michaeas went on, Here is a message to thee from the Lord. I
had a vision of the Lord sitting on his throne, with all the host of
heaven waiting on his pleasure, to right and left.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the Lord said, Who is to beguile Achab, king of Israel, so that
he will march to Ramoth-Galaad, and there meet his fall? One said this,
one that;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` till at last a spirit came forward and stood in the Lord’s
presence, offering to beguile Achab. And how wilt thou beguile him? the
Lord asked.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I will go abroad, said he, and on the lips of all his prophets I
will make myself an influence to deceive. Deceive them thou shalt, the
Lord said, and have thy way with them; go abroad, then, and carry out
thy errand.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And now, see what a lying influence the Lord has spread among these
prophets of thine! For indeed the Lord has determined on thy ruin.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` At that, Sedecias son of Chanaana went up and gave Michaeas a blow
on the cheek; Has the spirit of the Lord passed me by, he asked, and
spoken to none but thee?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Michaeas only answered, Thou shalt live to see the day when
thou must needs take refuge in an inner room, to hide there.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then the king of Israel gave his orders; Take Michaeas hence, said
he, and put him in the charge of Amon, the city governor, and of Joas,
son of Amelech.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And give them this royal command of mine, that they are to imprison
him, and give him scant allowance of food and drink, till I come back
safe and sound.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Come thou back safe and sound, Michaeas said, and mine was no
message from the Lord. Witness my words, all you that stand here!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, marched out to
attack Ramoth-Galaad.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Achab said he himself would go into battle in disguise; let
Josaphat, meanwhile, wear his royal robes. So none knew the king of
Israel by his array, when he went into battle.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` To all the captains of his cavalry the king of Syria had given the
same orders: Press for no other mark, high or low, but the king of
Israel himself.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And these, upon sight of Josaphat, cried out that this was the king
of Israel, so that armed men surrounded him on all sides; but he cried
out to the Lord, who brought him succour, and turned aside their
attack.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then, seeing that this was not the king of Israel, the captains of
the cavalry let him be.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` It was an archer, letting fly a shaft at haphazard, that gave Achab
a chance wound; it fell between neck and shoulder-blades, and Achab
bade his charioteer wheel about, and carry him away from the fight,
wounded as he was.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` With night, the battle came to an end; all day, the king of Israel
had stood upright in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and did not die
till evening.✻
