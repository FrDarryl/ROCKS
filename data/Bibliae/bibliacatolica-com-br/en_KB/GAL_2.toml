"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then, after an interval of fourteen years, once again I went up to
Jerusalem with Barnabas; and Titus also accompanied me.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I went up in obedience to a revelation, and there I communicated to
them (only in private, to men of repute) the gospel I always preach
among the Gentiles; was it possible that the course I had taken and was
taking was useless?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And it is not even true to say that they insisted on my companion
Titus, who was a Greek, being circumcised;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` we were only thinking of those false brethren who had insinuated
themselves into our company so as to spy on the liberty which we enjoy
in Christ Jesus, meaning to make slaves of us.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` To these we did not give ground for a moment by way of obedience; we
were resolved that the true principles of the gospel should remain
undisturbed in your possession.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But as for what I owe to those who were of some repute—it matters
little to me who or what they were, God makes no distinction between
man and man—these men of repute, I say, had nothing to communicate to
me.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` On the contrary, those who were reputed to be the main support of
the Church, James and Cephas and John, saw plainly that I was
commissioned to preach to the uncircumcised, as Peter was to the
circumcised;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he whose power had enabled Peter to become the apostle of the
circumcised, had enabled me to become the apostle of the Gentiles.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And so, recognizing the grace God had given me, they joined their
right hands in fellowship with Barnabas and myself; the Gentiles were
to be our province, the circumcised theirs.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Only we were to remember the poor; which was the very thing I had
set myself to do.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Afterwards, when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him openly; he
stood self-condemned.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He had been eating with the Gentiles, until we were visited by
certain delegates from James; but when these came, he began to draw
back and hold himself aloof, overawed by the supporters of
circumcision.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The rest of the Jews were no less false to their principles;
Barnabas himself was carried away by their insincerity.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So, when I found that they were not following the true path of the
gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, Since thou, who art a
born Jew, dost follow the Gentile, not the Jewish way of life, by what
right dost thou bind the Gentiles to live like Jews?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` We are Jews by right of nature, we do not come from the guilty
stock of the Gentiles;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` yet we found out that it is through faith in Jesus Christ, not by
obeying the law, that a man is justified. We, like anyone else, had to
learn to believe in Jesus Christ, so that we might be justified by
faith in Christ, not by observance of the law. Observance of the law
cannot win acceptance for a single human creature.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` By putting our hopes of justification in Christ, we took our rank
as guilty creatures like the rest. Does that mean that Christ brings us
guilt? That is not to be thought of;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` do I put myself in the wrong, when I destroy and then rebuild?✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Through the law, my old self has become dead to the law, so that I
may live to God; with Christ I hang upon the cross,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and yet I am alive; or rather, not I; it is Christ that lives in
me. True, I am living, here and now, this mortal life; but my real life
is the faith I have in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I do not spurn the grace of God. If we can be justified through the
law, then Christ’s death was needless.

Notas de rodapé:
2:11-14 - Paul publicly confronts Peter for his hypocrisy regarding the
separation between Jews and Gentiles. This event highlights the
importance of integrity and consistency in Christian practice (see also
02:16 - Paul teaches that no one can be justified by the works of the
law, but by faith in Christ. Justification by faith is a central theme
of the gospel, which frees believers from the works of the law to
2:19-20 - Paul explains that he died to the law so that he could live
for God. He emphasizes the Christian's identity with Christ on the
02:21 - Paul asserts that God's grace cannot be nullified, for if
salvation were possible through the law, Christ would have died in
vain. This emphasizes Christ's sacrifice as central to salvation (see
