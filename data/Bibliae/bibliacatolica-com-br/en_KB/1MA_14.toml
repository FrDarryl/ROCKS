"1" = ''':sup:`1` The year following, what must Demetrius do but muster his army and
betake himself to Media, where he would raise levies for the war
against Tryphon?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When Arsaces, king of the Medes and Persians, had news of it, he
gave orders to one of his chieftains, the invader must be taken alive
and brought into his presence.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The order was obeyed; the Syrian king, routed and captured, was
brought before Arsaces, who put him safely in prison.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Thus, during Simon’s days, the whole land of Juda was at peace. Ever
his people’s good sought he, and ever by willing hearts was obeyed and
honoured.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` With great state he took possession of Joppe as a harbour,✻ and so
found access to the islands out at sea.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` How wide spread he the frontiers of Israel, how firmly held its
possessions,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` captured how many of its foes! Gazara and Bethsura he won, ay, and
the Citadel itself, ridding it of all defilement; there was no
resisting his power.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` In his day, every man farmed his own lands in security, soil of Juda
yielded its crops, and the trees their fruit;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` sat old men in the market-place, busy over the common weal, and
young men wore the livery of their glorious campaigning.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Never a city but he furnished it with store of provisions; a
bulwark each of them should be of sturdy defence. What wonder if the
story of his renown was noised to the world’s end?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Such peaceful times brought he to his country, when all Israel kept
high holiday,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` every man with his own vine and fig-tree for shade, and enemy was
none to daunt them;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` domestic malice undone, foreign tyranny shattered all around!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Among his own folk, what comfort he gave the friendless, how
scrutinized the law, what short work made of traitor and malcontent;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` how adorned the sanctuary, how increased the number of its
treasures!
'''

'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When they learned that his brother Simon had been made high priest
instead, master now of the land and all its cities,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` they wrote to him on tablets made of bronze, to renew the treaty of
friendship they had with his brethren, Judas and Jonathan, before him;✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and their letters were read out before the whole assembly at
Jerusalem. The Spartans wrote in these words following:

'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Welcome news your ambassadors have brought us, of fame and credit
and prosperity you enjoy.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And their errand stands recorded in our public annals; how Numenius
son of Antiochus and Antipater son of Jason came on the Jews’ part to
renew our old treaty of friendship with you;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` how the people resolved to give them fair greeting, and to lay up a
copy of their report in the public archives, that should preserve the
memory of it among the Spartan people; and how an account of all this
was sent to the high priest Simon.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Numenius was sent on a further mission to Rome, bearing a great
target of gold, a thousand minas in weight, to renew the alliance
there. And when all this reached the ears of the people …✻

and to his sons?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Here was one that had restored the fortunes of his race, and rid
Israel of its foes. So they gave him exemption from public burdens, and

the hundred and seventy-second year of the Greek empire, the third of
Simon’s high priesthood,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` there was a high assembly held at Saramel✻ of priests and people,
clan-chiefs and elders of the whole nation, that had before them these
considerations following. All through the long wars of our country,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Simon and his brethren, sons of Mattathias, of Jarib’s clan, put
their lives in peril, and fought for law and sanctuary against the
common enemy, much glory winning for their own nation.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` When Jonathan, that had rallied the people and been their high
priest, became a part of his race,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` enemies thought to invade the country and crush the power of it,
violate its holy places;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and Simon it was withstood them. Champion of his people’s cause,
much he spent to arm its warriors, and furnish them with pay.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Juda’s cities he fortified, and others besides; Bethsura on the
frontiers, once a stronghold of the enemy, garrisoned now by Jews,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Joppe on the sea-coast, and Gazara in the Azotus region; Gazara,
too, once hostile, with Jewish troops manned he, and in each town made
provision for repairs to be done.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The people, seeing him so loyal a lover of his country’s renown,
made him their ruler and high priest; no less was due to such exploits,
public service so faithfully done, such constant ambition for his
people’s honour.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` In his days it was, and by his means, the land was rid at last of
Gentile intruders; not least the garrison of David’s own Keep at
Jerusalem, that by their sallying out profaned the sacred precincts,
and much defiled their purity;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` a Jewish garrison he set there, to guard both city and
country-side, and built Jerusalem walls yet higher.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` High priesthood of his, king Demetrius must needs acknowledge,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` bestowing on him the title of king’s friend, and loading him with
honours. What could he do else?
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Here was Rome itself greeting the Jewish folk as allies, good
friends, and kinsmen, welcoming the envoys of Simon with civic state.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Here were the Jews, priests and people both, agreed that he should
rule them, granting him the high priesthood✻ by right inalienable,
until true prophet they should have once more.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Their ruler he should be, and guardian of their temple; appoint
officer and magistrate, master of ordnance and captain of garrison,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` and have charge of the sanctuary besides. Him all must obey, in his
name deeds be drawn up, all the country through; of purple and gold
should be his vesture.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Of the rest, both priests and people, none should retrench these
privileges, nor gainsay Simon’s will, nor convoke assembly in the
country without him; garment of purple, buckle of gold none should
wear;
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` nor any man defy or void this edict, but at his peril.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` The people’s pleasure it was to ennoble Simon after this sort;
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` and Simon, he would not say them nay; high priest, and of priests
and people leader, governor and champion, he would be henceforward.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` So they had the decree inscribed on tablets of bronze, and set up
plain to view in the temple precincts;
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` and a copy of it they put by in the treasury, in the safe keeping
of Simon and his heirs.✻
