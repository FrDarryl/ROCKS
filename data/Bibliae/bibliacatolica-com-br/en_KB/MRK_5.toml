Gerasenes.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And as soon as he had disembarked, a man possessed by an unclean
spirit came out of the rock tombs to meet him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This man made his dwelling among the tombs, and nobody could keep
him bound any longer, even with chains.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He had been bound with fetters and chains often before, but had torn
the chains apart and broken the fetters, and nobody had the strength to
control him.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thus he spent all his time, night and day, among the tombs and the
hills, crying aloud and cutting himself with stones.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When he saw Jesus from far off, he ran up and fell at his feet,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and cried with a loud voice, Why dost thou meddle with me, Jesus,
Son of the most high God? I adjure thee in God’s name, do not torment
me
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` (for he was saying, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit).
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then he asked him, What is thy name? The spirit told him, My name is
Legion; there are many of us,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and it was full of entreaties that he would not send them away out
of the country.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` There, at the foot of the mountain, was a great herd of swine
feeding;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and the devils entreated him, Send us into the swine, let us make
our lodging there.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` With that, Jesus gave them leave; and the unclean spirits came out,
and went into the swine; whereupon the herd rushed down at full speed
into the sea, some two thousand in number, and the sea drowned them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The swineherds fled, and told their news in the city and in the
country-side; so that they came out to see what had befallen;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and when they reached Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting
there, clothed and restored to his wits, and they were overcome with
fear.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then those who had seen it told them the story of the possessed
man, and what had happened to the swine.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Whereupon they began entreating him to leave their country.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So he embarked on the boat; and as he did so the man who had been
possessed was eager to go with him,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` but Jesus would not give him leave; Go home to thy friends, he
said, and tell them all that the Lord has done for thee, and what great
mercy he shewed thee.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So he went back and began to spread word in Decapolis of what Jesus
had done for him; and all wondered at it.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Jesus went back by boat across the sea, and a great multitude
gathered about him; and while he was still by the sea,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` one of the rulers of the synagogue came up, Jairus by name, and
fell down at his feet when he saw him,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` pleading for his aid. My daughter, he said, is at the point of
death; come and lay thy hand on her, that so she may recover, and live.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So he turned aside with him, and a great multitude followed him,
and pressed close upon him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And now a woman who for twelve years had had an issue of blood,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and had undergone much from many physicians, spending all she had
on them, and no better for it, but rather grown worse,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` came up behind Jesus in the crowd (for she had been told of him),
and touched his cloak;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` If I can even touch his cloak, she said to herself, I shall be
healed.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And immediately the source of the bleeding dried up, and she felt
in her body that she had been cured of her affliction.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Jesus thereupon, inwardly aware of the power that had proceeded
from him, turned back towards the multitude and asked, Who touched my
garments?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` His disciples said to him, Canst thou see the multitude pressing so
close about thee, and ask, Who touched me?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But he looked round him to catch sight of the woman who had done
this.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And now the woman, trembling with fear, since she recognized what
had befallen her, came and fell at his feet, and told him the whole
truth.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Whereupon Jesus said to her, My daughter, thy faith has brought
thee recovery; go in peace, and be rid of thy affliction.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` While he was yet speaking, messengers came from the ruler’s house
to say, Thy daughter is dead; why dost thou trouble the Master any
longer?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Jesus heard the word said, and told the ruler of the synagogue, No
need to fear; thou hast only to believe.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And now he would not let anyone follow him, except Peter and James
and James’ brother John;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and so they came to the ruler’s house, where he found a great stir,
and much weeping and lamentation.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And he went in and said to them, What is this stir, this weeping?
The child is not dead, she is asleep.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` They laughed aloud at him; but he sent them all out, and, taking
the child’s father and mother and his own companions with him, went in
to where the child lay.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then he took hold of the child’s hand, and said to her, Talitha,
cumi, which means, Maiden, I say to thee, rise up.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And the girl stood up immediately, and began to walk; she was
twelve years old. And they were beside themselves with wonder.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Then he laid a strict charge on them to let nobody hear of this,
and ordered that she should be given something to eat.✻

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-20 - The healing of the demon-possessed man of Gerasa demonstrates
Jesus' power over the forces of evil. He not only frees the man from
demonic oppression, but also reveals His divine authority and
2:15).
5:21-24 - The story of Jairus, a synagogue leader, reveals the faith
that seeks Jesus in the face of adversity. Even facing his daughter's
imminent death, Jairus believes that Jesus can heal her, showing that
faith in Christ is the key to spiritual and physical healing (see also
5:25-34 - The healing of the woman with the issue of blood is an
example of persistent faith. Even without Jesus' direct consent, her
faith leads her to touch His garment, resulting in her healing. Jesus
emphasizes the importance of personal faith and an intimate connection
5:15).
5:35-43 - Jesus raises Jairus' daughter from the dead, demonstrating
His power over death. This miracle reveals not only Jesus' power to
heal, but also His authority over life and death, offering hope to
