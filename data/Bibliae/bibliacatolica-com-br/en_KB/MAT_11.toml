than he.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Ever since John the Baptist’s time, the kingdom of heaven has
opened to force; and the forceful are even now making it their prize;

the day of judgement than with you.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And thou, Capharnaum, dost thou hope to be lifted up high as

"24" = ''':sup:`24` And I say this, that it shall go less hard with the country of
Sodom at the day of judgement than with thee.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` My Father has entrusted everything into my hands; none knows the
Son truly except the Father, and none knows the Father truly except the
Son, and those to whom it is the Son’s good pleasure to reveal him.
