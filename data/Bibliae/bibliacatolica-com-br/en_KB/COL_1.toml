'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Grace be yours and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ. We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
continually in our prayers for you,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` when we are told of your faith in Jesus Christ, and the love which
you shew to all the saints;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` such hope have you of what awaits you in heaven. Hope was the lesson
you learned from that truth-giving message of the Gospel
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` which has reached you, which now bears fruit and thrives in you, as
it does all the world over, since the day when you heard of God’s grace
and recognized it for what it is.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Your teacher was Epaphras, for us, a well-loved fellow bondsman, and
for you a loyal minister of Jesus Christ;✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and it is he who has told us of this love which you cherish in the
Spirit.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So, ever since the news reached us, we have been praying for you in
return, unceasingly. Our prayer is, that you may be filled with that
closer knowledge of God’s will which brings all wisdom and all
spiritual insight with it.

'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` In the Son of God, in his blood, we find the redemption that sets
us free from our sins.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He is the true likeness of the God we cannot see; his is that first
birth which precedes every act of creation.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Yes, in him all created things took their being, heavenly and
earthly, visible and invisible; what are thrones and dominions, what
are princedoms and powers? They were all created through him and in
him;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` he takes precedency of all, and in him all subsist.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He too is that head whose body is the Church; it begins with him,
since his was the first birth out of death; thus in every way the
primacy was to become his.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` It was God’s good pleasure to let all completeness dwell in him,✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and through him to win back all things, whether on earth or in
heaven, into union with himself, making peace with them through his
blood, shed on the cross.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` You, too, were once estranged from him; your minds were alienated
from him by a life of sin;

his death, and so to bring you into his presence, holy, and spotless,
and unreproved.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But that means that you must be true to your faith, grounded in it,
firmly established in it; nothing must shift you away from the hope you
found in the gospel you once listened to. It is a gospel which has been
preached to all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have been brought
into its service.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Even as I write, I am glad of my sufferings on your behalf, as, in
this mortal frame of mine, I help to pay off the debt which the
afflictions of Christ still leave to be paid, for the sake of his body,
the Church.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When I entered its service I received a commission from God for the
benefit of you Gentiles, to complete the preaching of his word among
you.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` This was the secret that had been hidden from all the ages and
generations of the past; now, he has revealed it to his saints,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` wishing to make known the manifold splendour of this secret among
the Gentiles—Christ among you, your hope of glory.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Him, then, we proclaim, warning every human being and instructing
every human being as wisely as we may, so as to exhibit every human
being perfect in Christ Jesus.
