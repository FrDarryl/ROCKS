'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Is he one who never feasted at mountain-shrines, or looked for help

neighbour’s sheets or had commerce with a woman when she was defiled?

judge honestly between man and man?

murderer; lends himself to any of those practices
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` which his father ever shunned?✻ At hill-shrine eats he, neighbour’s
wife wrongs he,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` the friendless poor oppresses; gets him ill gains, withholds the
pledge, betakes himself to false god and foul rite;

'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Son of his, in turn, warned by such a father’s doom, forswears that
ill example.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Not for him the hill-feast, the false gods of the country-side, the
adulterous bed;

feeds he the hungry, clothes the naked,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and keeps clear of oppression, and usury, and extortion; what of

"24" = ''':sup:`24` It may be the innocent man will lose his innocence, and begin to
live as foul a life as that other in his wickedness; if so, shall he be
spared? No, all his upright life shall be forgotten; a traitor, shall
he not die in his treachery, a sinner in his sins?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And yet you say, The Lord is inconsiderate in his dealings! Listen,
sons of Israel; it is your dealings that are inconsiderate, not mine.
'''

God says. Come back, and make amends for all this guilt of yours, that

Notas de rodapé:
18:1-4 - God declares that each person will be held accountable for
their own actions. This principle of individual responsibility
contrasts with the idea of inherited guilt and teaches that everyone
has the opportunity to repent and change (see also Deuteronomy 24:16
18:5-9 - The righteous who live according to God's righteousness are
blessed. This reaffirms that God's righteousness is based on personal
choices and not on family inheritance or social status (see also
18:10-13 - The condemnation of the wicked son shows that God judges
personal righteousness, not that of others. The practice of wickedness
18:14-17 - The wicked man's change of heart, who repents and turns to
righteousness, is accepted by God. This highlights God's mercy and the
18:30-32 - God calls the people of Israel to repentance. Spiritual
death can be avoided through transformation, for God does not delight
in the death of the wicked, but desires all to be saved (see also
