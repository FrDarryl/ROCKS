[12]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` If we are to boast (although boasting is out of place), I will go on
to the visions and revelations the Lord has granted me.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There is a man I know who was carried out of himself in Christ,
fourteen years since; was his spirit in his body? I cannot tell. Was it
apart from his body? I cannot tell; God knows. This man, at least, was
carried up into the third heaven.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I can only tell you that this man, with his spirit in his body, or
with his spirit apart from his body, God knows which, not I,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` was carried up into Paradise, and heard mysteries which man is not
allowed to utter.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` That is the man about whom I will boast; I will not boast about
myself, except to tell you of my humiliations.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` It would not be vanity, if I had a mind to boast about such a man as
that; I should only be telling the truth. But I will spare you the
telling of it; I have no mind that anybody should think of me except as
he sees me, as he hears me talking to him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And indeed, for fear that these surpassing revelations should make
me proud, I was given a sting to distress my outward nature, an angel
of Satan sent to rebuff me.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Three times it made me entreat the Lord to rid me of it;✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but he told me, My grace is enough for thee; my strength finds its
full scope in thy weakness. More than ever, then, I delight to boast of
the weaknesses that humiliate me, so that the strength of Christ may
enshrine itself in me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I am well content with these humiliations of mine, with the
insults, the hardships, the persecutions, the times of difficulty I
undergo for Christ; when I am weakest, then I am strongest of all.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I have given way to vanity; it was you that drove me to it; you
ought to have given me credentials, instead of asking for them. No, I
have done no less than the very greatest of the apostles, worthless as
I am;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I have earned the character of apostleship among you, by all the
trials I have undergone, by signs and wonders and deeds of miracle.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What injustice did I do you, as compared with the other churches,
except that to you, of my own choice, I refused to make myself a
burden? Forgive me, if I wronged you there.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` This is the third time I have made preparations for visiting you,✻
and I do not intend to cripple you with expenses: what I claim is
yourselves, not anything you can give; it is the parents that should
save for their children, not the children for their parents.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For my own part, I will gladly spend and be spent on your souls’
behalf, though you should love me too little for loving you too well.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Ah, you say, that may be; I did not lay any charge on you myself,
but I preyed upon you by roundabout means, like the knave I am.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` What, those envoys I sent you, did I take advantage of you through
any of them?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` I asked Titus to visit you, and there was the brother I sent with
him; did Titus take any advantage of you? Did we not all follow the
same course, and in the same spirit?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You have been telling one another, all this while, that we are
defending our conduct to you. Rather, we have been uttering our
thoughts as in God’s presence, in Christ; yet always, beloved, so as to
build up your faith.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I have the fear that perhaps, when I reach you, I shall find in you
unwelcome hosts, and you in me an unwelcome visitor; that there will be
dissension, rivalry, ill humour, factiousness, backbiting, gossip,
self-conceit, disharmony.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I have the fear that on this new visit God has humiliation in store
for me when we meet; that I shall have tears to shed over many of you,
sinners of old and still unrepentant, with a tale of impure,
adulterous, and wanton living.

12:7-10 - Paul speaks of the "thorn in the flesh," showing that human
weakness is a channel for God's power. God uses our limitations to
demonstrate His grace and strength. Dependence on God is the
