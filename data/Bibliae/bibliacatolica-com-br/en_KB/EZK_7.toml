"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then the Lord’s word came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And thou, son of man …✻ A message to the land of Israel from the
Lord God! For this land, for every corner of it, here is doom, here is
doom.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Doom for thee at last; I mean to wreak vengeance on thee, pass
sentence on thy evil life, bring home to thee thy foul deeds.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Nor shall my eye melt with pity; I will not spare. All thy evil life
brought home to thee, all thy foul deeds confronting thee; who shall
doubt that it comes from the Lord?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The blow, the first blow has fallen, says the Lord God;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` all is over now, all is over; the day dawns, and for thee doom comes
with day.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Dwellers in the land, this is the end of you; your time is up, your
day has come; a day when your mountains shall echo with tumult, not
with harvest-home.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Close at hand, now, I will rain down my vengeance upon you, give my
anger full play, no crime unjudged, no weight of punishment unborne.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Never shall my eye melt with pity for thee; all thy evil life shall
be accounted for, all thy foul deeds brought to light; and none shall
doubt that I, the Lord, punish.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` It has come, the day has come; the wheel full circle,✻ the branch
in full bloom, pride bears its harvest.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Violence has grown up into a shoot of rebellion … and not by their
means, not through clamouring multitude of theirs; rest they shall have
none.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The time is up, the day of reckoning come; who buys now, of his
purchase shall have no joy, who sells now, shall not feel his loss; the
Lord’s vengeance will overtake the whole throng of citizens alike;✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` alas! here is property alienated for ever, though buyer and seller
count among the living yet. The vision is for the whole throng of
citizens; there is no reversing it; never a man of that guilty race
shall survive.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Sound the trumpet there, rally all to arms! But none goes out to
war; on the whole throng of citizens my vengeance has fallen;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` sword without, pestilence and famine within; sword for the
straggler, pestilence and famine for the besieged.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Fugitives there shall be that make good their flight, but these
must take to the mountains, fluttered as the doves that haunt their
ravines, sinners all;

"17" = ''':sup:`17` hands that hang listless, knees weak as water.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` See where men go clad in sackcloth, trembling in every limb, with
downcast faces, and their heads shorn!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` See where they cast their silver out of doors, their gold on to the
dung-hill; how should precious metal speed them in this day of the
Lord’s vengeance? Hunger it sates not, belly it fills not; and this,
all the while, was the very occasion of their guilt!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Did they not pride themselves on the beauty of their workmanship,
was it not from this they made images of their detestable false gods?
And now there it lies, all defilement!

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Now I am giving it over to strangers for spoil; the vilest of
earth’s inhabitants shall plunder it.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Still my eyes shall be averted, while my own treasure-chamber is
broken open, while the enemy’s pursuivants enter and profane it.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Make short work of it,✻ a land where innocent lives are forfeit, a
nest of wrong!
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The very refuse of the heathen I will summon to dispossess them of
their homes, to be masters of their holy places, that proud boast of
theirs✻ now for ever silenced.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Days of despair, when they will look about them for a respite, and
respite shall be none!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Fresh anxieties still, and fresh alarms; vainly they ask the
prophet for revelation; tradition among the priests, counsel among the
elders is none.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Mourns king, princes go covered with dismay, numb with despair the
common folk; ill they shall fare, that ill did, cruelly be judged, that
were cruel judges; they shall know what manner of God they serve.
