"1" = ''':sup:`1` Make charity your aim, the spiritual gifts your aspiration; and, by
preference, the gift of prophecy.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The man who talks in a strange tongue is talking to God, not to men;
nobody understands him, he is holding mysterious converse with his own
spirit;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` whereas the prophet speaks to edify, to encourage, to comfort his
fellow men.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` By talking in a strange tongue, a man may strengthen his own faith;
by prophesying he can strengthen the faith of the church.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I would gladly see you all speaking with strange tongues, but I
would rather you should prophesy, because the prophet ranks higher than
the man who speaks with strange tongues. It would be different if he
could translate them, to strengthen the faith of the church;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but as things are, brethren, what good can I do you by coming and
talking to you in strange languages, instead of addressing you with a
revelation, or a manifestation of inner knowledge, or a prophecy, or
words of instruction?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Senseless things may be vocal, a flute, for example, or a harp; but
even with these, there must be distinctions between the sounds they
give, or how can we recognize what melody flute or harp is playing?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` If a trumpet, for that matter, gives out an uncertain note, who will
arm himself for battle?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So it is with you; how can it be known what your message is, if you
speak in a language whose accents cannot be understood? Your words will
fall on empty air.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` No doubt all these different languages exist somewhere in the
world, and each of them has its significance;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but if I cannot understand what the language means, the effect is
that I am a foreigner to the man who is speaking, and he is a foreigner
to me.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So the case stands with you. Since you have set your hearts on
spiritual gifts, ask for them in abundant measure, but only so as to
strengthen the faith of the church;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` the man who can speak in a strange tongue should pray for the power
to interpret it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` If I use a strange tongue when I offer prayer, my spirit is
praying, but my mind reaps no advantage from it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What, then, is my drift? Why, I mean to use mind as well as spirit
when I offer prayer, use mind as well as spirit when I sing psalms.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If thou dost pronounce a blessing in this spiritual fashion, how
can one who takes his place among the uninstructed say Amen to thy
thanksgiving? He cannot tell what thou art saying.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thou, true enough, art duly giving thanks, but the other’s faith is
not strengthened.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thank God, I can speak any of the tongues you use;✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` but in the church, I would rather speak five words which my mind
utters, for your instruction, than ten thousand in a strange tongue.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Brethren, do not be content to think childish thoughts; keep the
innocence of children, with the thoughts of grown men.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` We read in the law, I will speak to this people with an unknown
tongue, with the lips of strangers, and even so they will not listen to
me, says the Lord.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Thus talking with a strange tongue is a sign given to unbelievers,
not to the faithful; whereas prophecy is meant for the faithful, not
for unbelievers.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And now, what will happen if the uninstructed or the unbelievers
come in when the whole church has met together, and find everyone
speaking with strange tongues at once? Will they not say you are mad?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Whereas, if some unbeliever or some uninstructed person comes in
when all alike are prophesying, everyone will read his thoughts,
everyone will scrutinize him,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` all that is kept hidden in his heart will be revealed; and so he
will fall on his face and worship God, publicly confessing that God is
indeed among you.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` What am I urging, then, brethren? Why, when you meet together, each
of you with a psalm to sing, or some doctrine to impart, or a
revelation to give, or ready to speak in strange tongues, or to
interpret them, see that all is done to your spiritual advantage.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` If there is speaking with strange tongues, do not let more than two
speak, or three at the most; let each take his turn, with someone to
interpret for him,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and if he can find nobody to interpret, let him be silent in the
church, conversing with his own spirit and with God.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` As for the prophets, let two or three of them speak, while the rest
sit in judgement on their prophecies.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` If some revelation comes to another who is sitting by, let him who
spoke first keep silence;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` there is room for you all to prophesy one by one, so that the whole
company may receive instruction and comfort;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and it is for the prophets to exercise control over their own
spiritual gifts.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` God is the author of peace, not of disorder; such is the teaching I
give in all the churches of the saints.✻
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And women are to be silent in the churches; utterance is not
permitted to them; let them keep their rank, as the law tells them:
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` if they have any question to raise, let them ask their husbands at
home. That a woman should make her voice heard in the church is not
seemly.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Tell me, was it from you that God’s word was sent out? Are you the
only people it has reached?
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` If anybody claims to be a prophet, or to have spiritual gifts, let
him prove it by recognizing that this message of mine to you is God’s
commandment.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If he does not recognize it, he himself shall receive no
recognition.✻
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Set your hearts, then, brethren, on prophesying; and as for
speaking with strange tongues, do not interfere with it.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Only let us have everything done suitably, and with right order.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
14:1-5 - Paul exhorts us to pursue love and desire spiritual gifts,
especially the gift of prophecy, which builds up the church. The
purpose of the gifts is always to build up and strengthen the Christian
14:6-19 - Paul compares speaking in tongues to prophecy, emphasizing
that while the gift of tongues edifies the individual, prophecy edifies
the entire church. Love must always be the criterion for using
14:20-25 - The purpose of tongues is for signs to unbelievers, while
prophecy edifies the church. Paul teaches that the use of the gifts
should be ordered and focused on collective edification (see also
14:26-33 - Paul gives guidance on order in worship, emphasizing that
everything should be done in an edifying manner, without confusion.
Peace and edification should be the primary goal of any Christian
