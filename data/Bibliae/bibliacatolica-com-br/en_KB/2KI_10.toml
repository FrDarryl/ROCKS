"1" = ''':sup:`1` Over in Samaria, Achab had still seventy male descendants to his
name. So Jehu dispatched a letter to the chiefs and elders there, and
to those who had the young princes in their charge; these were the
terms of it:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Here is work to be done when this letter reaches you. You have the
royal family among you; chariots and horses, strongholds and weapons of
war, are at your disposal.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Why then, you must pick out the likeliest among the princes,
whichever enjoys your favour most, and put him on his father’s throne;
then take up arms in the royal cause, and do battle.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` At this, they were thrown into consternation; here were two kings
swept away by Jehu’s onset, and what resistance could they hope to
offer him?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So all of them, guardians of the princes, chieftains and elders,
sent word to Jehu, We are thy servants, awaiting thy commands; it is
not for us to set up a king; do what is thy pleasure.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And this was the second letter he sent them, If you are loyal lieges
of mine, cut off the heads of the princes, and bring them to me at
Jezrahel this time to-morrow. These leading men of the city had the
seventy princes in their keeping,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and when the letter reached them, they killed all seventy, and sent
back their heads in baskets to Jehu at Jezrahel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He, when news came to him that the princes’ heads had been brought
there, would have them left in two heaps at the city gate till morning,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` then, at dawn, he went out and confronted the people. You are
without bias, he said to them; tell me, if I conspired against my
master, who is to blame for the death of all these?✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You see for yourselves that no word of the Lord’s curse upon the
house of Achab has missed the mark; what the Lord prophesied through
his servant Elias, he has here fulfilled.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then Jehu put to death all that was left of Achab’s race in
Jezrahel, with all that had been nobles, courtiers and priests in his
reign, till no trace of him was left.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then he made his way to Samaria; and when he reached the shepherds’
lodging by the road side,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` he fell in with some of Ochozias’ kindred, that had been king of
Juda. And when he asked who they were, and they told him kinsmen of
Ochozias, that were on their way to greet the sons and brothers of the
king,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` he gave orders for their arrest. So they were seized as prisoners,
forty-two of them in all, and their throats were cut over the pool by
the shepherds’ lodging; not one of them was left alive.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Passing on thence, he met Jonadab, son of Rechab, coming to greet
him, and gave him welcome. Is thy heart true to me, he asked, as mine
to thee? And when he learned that it was so, Give me thy hand, and
lifted him up, by his outstretched hand, into the chariot.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Come with me, he said, and witness my zeal in the Lord’s cause. So,
in his own chariot,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` he brought Jonadab to Samaria. And all of Achab’s household that
were left in Samaria he destroyed to a man, so fulfilling that curse
which the Lord pronounced through Elias.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Next, Jehu called a general assembly of the people, and told them,
It was but scant worship Achab paid to Baal; Jehu means to pay him
greater worship yet.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Summon me all Baal’s prophets, all his worshippers, all his
priests; at this great sacrifice I mean to offer Baal, none must be
absent; it is death to the man whose place is found empty. All this was
but a design Jehu had in hand, for destroying Baal’s worshippers.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So he would have a solemn feast proclaimed in Baal’s honour, and
this summons of his
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` went out all through the confines of Israel; all Baal’s worshippers
came in answer to it, not a man was left behind. And all made their way
into Baal’s temple, till it was full from end to end.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then Jehu bade the wardrobe-keepers bring out garments for all
Baal’s votaries, and when these had been brought,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` he and Jonadab the son of Rechab went into Baal’s temple, and bade
the worshippers look well to it that none of the Lord’s servants were
among them, only the followers of Baal.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And where they had entered, there was offering and burnt-sacrifice
to be made. Without, Jehu had posted eighty men, telling them, If you
let any of my quarry slip through your hands, it shall be life for
life.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And now, when the burnt-sacrifice was done, he gave orders to his
bodyguard and his officers to go in and make an end of them; not one
must escape. So these, his bodyguard and his captains, put them to the
sword. Then they went to the Keep of Beth-baal,✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and took out Baal’s statue from the temple, to burn it,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and crush it to pieces. As for Baal’s temple, they pulled it down,
and made it a house of easement, as it is to this day.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Thus Jehu abolished the worship of Baal in Israel.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Yet he would not forgo the sins of Jeroboam son of Nabat, that
taught Israel to sin; at Bethel and at Dan the golden calves had their
worship still.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For thy zeal in doing my will, the Lord told him, for carrying out
my just decrees against the line of Achab, I will let thy heirs keep
the throne of Israel up to the fourth generation;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and still this Jehu was too careless to follow the law of Israel’s
God with his whole heart, by abandoning the sins of Jeroboam, that
taught Israel to sin!
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` It was in his days that the Lord began to grow aweary of Israel;
and Hazael struck at all their frontiers,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` where these lay east of the Jordan, Galaad, and Gad, and Ruben, and
Manasses, and Aroer on the river Arnon, the whole territory of Galaad
and Basan.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` What else Jehu did, all his history and the record of his great
deeds, is to be found in the Annals of the kings of Israel.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And at last he was laid to rest with his fathers at Samaria, and
the throne passed to his son Joachaz;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` he had reigned over Israel, there in Samaria, for twenty-eight
years.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
10:1-3 - Jehu writes to the leaders of Jezreel, challenging them to
defend Ahab's dynasty. Their response demonstrates both fear and
recognition of Jehu's power, revealing how divine authority is
21:30).
10:6-11 - Ahab's seventy sons are killed, fulfilling God's judgment on
his house. This purging of Ahab's dynasty symbolizes Israel's
purification from idolatry and corruption (see also 1 Kings 21:29 and 2
Kings 9:8).
10:15-17 - Jehu finds Jehonadab and invites him to join him in his
mission to destroy the house of Ahab. This reflects the alliance of
righteous men to accomplish God's purpose of justice in Israel (see
10:18-27 - Jehu destroys the worshippers of Baal, eliminating the
priests and tearing down the temple of Baal. This marks the partial
restoration of the worship of the Lord in Israel, although Jehu did not
12:28-30).
10:30-31 - God promises Jehu a long dynasty for his partial obedience
in destroying the house of Ahab, but Jehu does not fully walk in God's
ways. This highlights the need for complete obedience to experience
