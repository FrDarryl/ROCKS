"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now, what must Simon do, the same that had drawn men’s eyes to
his country with stories of treasure, but fall to slandering Onias?
Onias it was, by his way of it, had egged Heliodorus on,✻ and been the
author of the mischief.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So true a patriot, that well loved his race, well guarded the divine
law, and he must be branded with the name of traitor!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The feud grew worse, till at last there were murders done, and
Simon’s faction answerable for it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Here was the public peace much endangered; here was Apollonius, the
governor of Coelesyria and Phoenice, adding fuel to the flame of
Simon’s malice;✻ what marvel if Onias had recourse to the king?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Little enough it liked him to bring an ill name on his
fellow-citizens; yet common good of the Jewish folk he must needs have
in mind;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` how should quiet times return, or Simon’s madness be cooled, unless
the king took order in the matter?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But king Seleucus was done with life now, and the throne passed to
Antiochus, called the Illustrious. And here was a brother Onias had,
called Jason, that coveted the office of high priest.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This Jason went to the new king, and made him an offer of three
hundred and sixty talents of silver out of its revenue, besides eighty
from other incomings.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Let leave be granted him to set up a game-place for the training of
youth, and enrol the men of Jerusalem as citizens of Antioch, he would
give his bond for a hundred and fifty more.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` To this the king assented; high priest he became, and straightway
set about perverting his fellow-countrymen to the Gentile way of
living.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Till now, the Jews had followed their own customs, by grace of a
royal privilege; it was John that won it for them, father of that
Eupolemus, who afterwards went in embassage to Rome, to make a treaty
of alliance. But Jason would abrogate these customs; common right
should be none, and great wrong should find acceptance instead.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This game-place of his he did not scruple to set up in the very
shadow of the Citadel, and debauch✻ all that was noblest of Judaea’s
youth.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Mischief in the bud, think you, when such alien Gentile ways came
in? Nay, here was flower and fruit of it; and all through the
unexampled villainy of one man, this Jason, that high priest was none,
but rather an arch-traitor.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Why, the priests themselves had no more stomach for serving the
altar; temple scorned, and sacrifice unheeded, off they went to the
wrestling-ground, there to enter their names and win unhallowed prizes,
soon as ever the first quoit was thrown!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What glory their fathers had handed down to them! And fame such as
the Greeks covet was all their ambition now.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Alas, here was a perilous contest awaiting them; Greek fashions
they would follow, and Greeks would be, that ere long should have
Greeks for their enemies, ay, and conquerors.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` There is no breaking God’s laws without paying the price; time will
show that.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When the quinquennial games were being held at Tyre, in the king’s
presence,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` this vile Jason it was sent some of his wretches✻ with a gift of
three hundred silver pieces to do honour to Hercules. True it is, the
bearers of them asked they should not be spent on sacrifice, but on
some other need that was more befitting;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` yet Jason’s meaning was, Hercules should have them, and if they
went to the building of the fleet, it was thanks to Jason’s envoys.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Afterwards, Apollonius the son of Menestheus was despatched to
Egypt, for the enthroning of king Ptolemy Philometor. Well Antiochus
knew that he was disaffected towards the royal policy, and there was
his own safety to be considered … He passed on to Joppe, and so to
Jerusalem,✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` where Jason and the whole city welcomed him in state, with carrying
of torches and great huzza’ing. And so he led his army back to
Phoenice.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Three years later, Jason would send to the king certain moneys,
together with a report on affairs of moment; and for this errand he
chose Menelaus, brother to that Simon we have before mentioned.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Access thus gained to the king’s person, Menelaus was careful to
flatter his self-conceit; then, outbidding Jason by three hundred
talents of silver, diverted the high-priestly succession to himself.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Back he came to Jerusalem, with the royal warrant to maintain him,
yet all unworthy, with a tyrant’s cruel heart, more wild beast than
high priest.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Thus was Jason supplanted, that had supplanted his own brother, and
was driven to take refuge in the Ammonite country;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` as for Menelaus, he got the office he coveted, but never a penny
paid the king of all he had promised, however urgent Sostratus might
be, that was in command of the citadel.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` For all exaction of tribute this fellow was answerable; and so it
fell out that both of them were summoned to court,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Menelaus leaving his high priesthood to his own brother,
Lysimachus, and for Sostratus … he became governor of Cyprus.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It befell at this very time that the men of Tharsus and Mallus made
an insurrection; so little it liked them that a gift should be made of
their cities to Antiochis, the king’s paramour.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Post-haste the king went off to appease them, leaving one of his
courtiers, Andronicus, to be viceroy.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Here was Menelaus’ opportunity; he had gold ornaments with him,
that he had stolen out of the temple, and now, giving some of these as
a present to Andronicus, he sold the rest at Tyre and other cities in
the neighbourhood.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Of these doings, one man had clear proof, and thereupon denounced
him: Onias, that had now taken refuge in Daphne sanctuary, close by
Antioch.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` What did Menelaus? He gained the ear of Andronicus and demanded
that Onias should pay for it with his life. So the viceroy himself paid
Onias a visit, swore friendship and overcame his suspicions; then, when
he had left sanctuary, without scruple of conscience put him to death.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Here was great matter of indignation, and not among the Jews only;
the very heathen took it amiss, so great a man should meet so unworthy
an end.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` No sooner was the king back from Cilicia than the citizens of
Antioch, Jew and Gentile both, assailed him with complaints about the
murder of an innocent man;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` whereat Antiochus himself was heartily grieved, ay, and moved to
tears of pity, such memories he had of Onias’ well-ordered, honourable
life.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Anon he fell into a rage, stripped Andronicus of his purple, and
would have him led away all through the streets, till he reached the
very spot where he had lifted his impious hand against Onias. There the
sacrilegious wretch perished, by the divine vengeance worthily
requited.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Meanwhile, word had gone abroad at Jerusalem, how Lysimachus was
ever robbing the temple, by Menelaus’ contrivance. Great store of gold
was lost already; but now there was a rising of the common folk against
Lysimachus,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` whose numbers and their rage increasing, he was fain to put some
three thousand men under arms, with one Tyrannus at their head, that
was far gone in years, and no less in folly. Lysimachus it was that
first resorted to violence;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` but the rabble, when they saw what he would be at, caught up stones
or stout clubs for the attack, and some of them pelted him with
cinders.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` When they had wounded some of his retinue, and felled others to
earth, the rest took to their heels; and there, close beside the
treasury, this robber of the temple was done to death.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And next, they must implead Menelaus himself on the same charge.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Three envoys from the council of elders brought the whole matter
before the king, when he visited Tyre,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` and Menelaus was as good as lost. What did he? With the promise of
a great bribe he secured the good word of Ptolemy, son of Dorymenes;✻
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Ptolemy it was waylaid the king, as he rested from the heat in a
covered walk of his, and put him from his purpose.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So now Menelaus, that was at the root of all the mischief, must go
scot free, and his unhappy accusers, that might have cleared themselves
easily enough before a court of bloodthirsty Scythians,✻ with their
lives must pay for it.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Here were men come to plead for their own city, their own people,
their own temple treasures, and must they be hurried off to undeserved
punishment?
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Even the Tyrians thought shame of it, and in princely fashion gave
them burial.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` So, through the avarice of the great, throve Menelaus still, and
his wickedness went from bad to worse, to his countrymen’s undoing.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
4:7-10 - Under the rule of Antiochus Epiphanes, Jason bribes the king
to become high priest, illustrating the corruption of religious
leadership. The exchange of spiritual values for political interests
4:11-13 - Jason promotes Hellenistic culture, leading the people away
from God's Law. The Jews' adoption of pagan practices demonstrates the
struggle between faithfulness to God and external cultural influence
4:14-17 - The neglect of the temple and worship by the priests reveals
internal apostasy. This reflects how religious corruption can lead to
the destruction of the faith and identity of God's people (see also
4:23-26 - Menelaus replaces Jason as high priest through further
bribery. This cycle of betrayal and corruption shows the fragility of
leadership without true reverence for God (see also 1 Kings 21:1-16 and
4:32-35 - Onias is murdered on Menelaus' orders, reflecting the
violence that arises when leadership is corrupted. Innocent blood cries
23:35).
