by giving false witness in their favour.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Never must thou follow with the crowd in doing wrong, or be swayed
by many voices so as to give false judgement;

poorer neighbours food; all that is left, the wild beasts may eat. And
thou shalt do the like with thy vineyard and thy oliveyard.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For six days together thou shalt do the tasks thou hast to do, and
on the seventh leave off working; so shall ox and ass of thine have
rest, home-born slave and alien that works for thee revive their
spirits.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Observe all these commandments of mine, and never take an oath by
the names of alien gods, or let such names be heard on your lips.

my victims unconsumed till the morrow.
'''

thy way, and lead thee to the place I have made ready for thee.

him with neglect. He will not overlook thy faults, and in him dwells
the power of my name.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` If thou wilt listen to his warnings, and do all I bid thee, then
thy enemies shall find an enemy in me, and those who shew thee no mercy

Jebusite; and all these I will destroy.

customs; sweep them away, and break down their monuments.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` All your loyalty must be for the Lord your God. So I will enrich
thee with the bread and the water thou needest, and keep sickness far

"26" = ''':sup:`26` there shall be no unfruitfulness in thy land, no barrenness; and I
will grant thee a full span of days.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` I mean to make the fear of me go in front of thee, bringing
destruction upon the whole people thou goest to meet; all thy enemies
shall turn their backs before thee.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` I will send in hornets first, to make cowards of Hevite and
Chanaanite and Hethite before ever thou goest in.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Only I will not drive them out before thee all in one year; that
would make a wilderness of the land, and the wild beasts in it would
multiply, to thy harm.
