[20]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` One day, as he taught the people and preached to them in the temple,
the chief priests and scribes, with the elders, came up
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and said to him, Tell us, What is the authority by which thou doest
these things, and who gave thee this authority?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Jesus answered them, I too have a question to ask; you must tell me
this,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Whence did John’s baptism come, from heaven or from men?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Whereupon they cast about in their minds; If we tell him it was from
heaven, they said, he will ask, Then why did you not believe him?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And if we say it was from men, all the people will be ready to stone
us; they will have it that John was a prophet.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So they answered that they could not tell whence it came.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Jesus said to them, And you will not learn from me what is the
authority by which I do these things.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And now he took occasion to tell the people this parable; There was
a man who planted a vineyard, and let it out to some vine-dressers,
while he went away to spend a long time abroad.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when the season came, he sent one of his servants on an errand
to the vine-dressers, bidding them pay him his share of the vineyard’s
revenues. Whereupon the vine-dressers beat him, and sent him away
empty-handed.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then he sent another servant; and him too they sent away
empty-handed, beating him first, and insulting him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then he sent a third; and they drove him away wounded, like the
others.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So the owner of the vineyard said, What am I to do? I will send my
well-beloved son, perhaps they will have reverence for him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But the vine-dressers, on seeing him, debated thus among
themselves; This is the heir, let us kill him, so that his inheritance
may pass into our hands.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they thrust him out of the vineyard and killed him. And now,
what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He will come and make an end of those vine-dressers, and give his
vineyard to others. God forbid, they said, when they heard that.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But he fastened his eyes on them, and said, Why then, what is the
meaning of those words which have been written, The very stone which
the builders rejected has become the chief stone at the corner?✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` If ever a man falls against that stone, he will break his bones; if
it falls upon him, it will grind him to powder.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` At this, the chief priests and scribes would gladly have laid hands
on him there and then, but they were afraid of the people. They saw
clearly that this parable of his was aimed at them.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And so, watching for their opportunity, they sent agents of their
own, who pretended to be men of honest purpose, to fasten on his words;
then they would hand him over to the supreme authority of the governor.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` These put a question to him; Master, they said, we know that thou
art direct in thy talk and thy teaching; thou makest no distinction
between man and man, but teachest the way of God in all sincerity.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Is it right that we should pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And he, aware of their malice, said to them, Why do you thus put me
to the test?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Shew me a silver piece. Whose likeness, whose name does it bear
inscribed on it? When they answered, Caesar’s,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` he told them, Why then, give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and
to God what is God’s.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And they said no more; they were full of admiration at his answer,
finding no means of discrediting his words in the eyes of the people.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then he was approached with a question by some of the Sadducees,
men who deny the resurrection;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Master, they said, Moses prescribed for us, If a man has a married
brother who dies without issue, the surviving brother must marry the
widow, and beget children in the dead brother’s name.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` There were seven brethren, the first of whom married a wife, and
died without issue.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So the next took her, and also died without issue,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` then the third, and so with all the seven; they left no children
when they died,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and the woman herself died last of all.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And now, when the dead rise again, which of these will be her
husband, since she was wife to all seven?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus told them, The children of this world marry and are given in
marriage;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` but those who are found worthy to attain that other world, and
resurrection from the dead, take neither wife nor husband;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` mortal no longer, they will be as the angels in heaven are,
children of God, now that the resurrection has given them birth.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` But as for the dead rising again, Moses himself has told you of it
in the passage about the burning bush, where he calls the Lord the God
of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.✻
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` It is of living men, not of dead men, that he is the God; for him,
all men are alive.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` At this, some of the scribes answered, Master, thou hast spoken
well;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` no one dared to try him with further questions.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then he said to them, What do they mean by saying that Christ is
the son of David?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Why, David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my
Master, sit on my right hand✻
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` while I make thy enemies a footstool under thy feet.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Thus David calls Christ his Master; how can he also be his son?✻
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And he said to his disciples, in the hearing of all the people:
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Beware of the scribes, who enjoy walking in long robes, and love to
have their hands kissed in the market-place, and to take the first
seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts;
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` who swallow up the property of widows, under cover of their long
prayers; their sentence will be all the heavier for that.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
20:1-8 - Jesus' authority is questioned by the religious leaders, but
He responds wisely, defying their attempts to trap Him in theological
traps. This demonstrates the divine supremacy of Christ's authority
20:9-19 - The parable of the wicked tenants shows the religious
leaders' rejection of the Messiah and the judgment that will come upon
them. The parable reveals that the Kingdom of God will be given to
another people who produce fruits of righteousness (see also
20:20-26 - Jesus wisely answers the question about paying taxes to
Caesar by highlighting the distinction between civil and spiritual
obligations. He teaches that we should render to God what is God's, and

about marriage in the resurrection, but He teaches them that in the
afterlife there is no marriage, but the righteous will be like angels

David's son, challenging their beliefs about the role of the Christ. He
also warns against the hypocrisy of religious leaders, emphasizing that
