hail-storm, like a destroying whirlwind, like a swift flood that rises
and spreads out over the plain.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Trodden under foot it shall lie, the crown that was drunken
Ephraim’s boast;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` that flower, whose brief bloom once delighted him, shall look down

ere autumn brings the harvest, no sooner seen than plucked and eaten by
the first that passes by!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But the Lord has his own people still left him; to these he shall be
a crown to boast of, a garland of pride;

"6" = ''':sup:`6` his the justice inspires them when they sit in judgement; his the
courage that rallies them when they fall back, fighting, to the gates.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` What, these too? These too fuddled with wine, bemused with their
revelling? High revel they hold, priest and prophet together, till all

the true seer goes unrecognized, if justice is forgotten?

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Here is stammering speech, here is outlandish talk for our folk to
listen to!

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Yet he did but counsel rest and repose; rest none other, repose
none other, than to give respite to a weary nation. And listen they
would not;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` to them, the Lord’s message was all Pass the word on, pass the word
on, Wait a while yet, wait a while yet, A word with you, here, and a
word with you, there! And so they will go on their way, to stumble
backwards and break their bones, to fall into a trap and lie there
caught.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Hear the Lord’s word, then, you mockers, that bear rule over my
people in Jerusalem.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Did you think to make terms with death, enter into alliance with
the grave itself, that the flood of ruin should pass you by, so
confident in your vain hopes, so armed with illusion?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` A message to you, then, from the Lord God, See, I am laying a stone
in the foundations of Sion that has been tested and found true, a
corner-stone, a stone of worth, built into the foundations themselves.✻
Hurry to and fro who will; faith knows better.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` You shall have justice dealt out to you by weight, your sentence
shall be strictly measured; shattered, the vain hopes, as by a storm of
hail, buried the illusion as by a deluge.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Hold they shall not, your terms with death, your compact with the
grave; when the flood of ruin sweeps past, it shall leave you
prostrate.

space of a day and a night, and the very alarm of it will make you
understand the revelation at last.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Too narrow a bed, and one or the other must fall out; a short cloak
is no covering for two.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Who stands there? None other than the Lord himself, as he stood
once on the mountain of Disruption,✻ vengeful still, as when he stood
in the valley at Gabaon; but now, his own purpose to achieve, he lends
himself to the purpose of another, now his will is, to let the alien
have his will.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Mock, then, no more, if you would not see your chains riveted
tighter; the Lord God of hosts is my witness, he means to make a short
and sharp reckoning with the whole earth.
