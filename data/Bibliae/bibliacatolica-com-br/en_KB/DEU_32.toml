"1" = ''':sup:`1` Listen, you heavens, while I have my say; earth, be attentive to the
words I utter;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` here is teaching big with import as the rain, here are warnings that
must soak in like the dew, wholesome as showers are to the grass, as
moisture to the growing crops.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The renown of the Lord shall be my theme; to our God belongs
majesty;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the God who shelters us, how perfect is all he does, how right are
all his dealings! God, faithful and unerring, God, holy and just!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And these, his sons, are lost to him, his sons no longer in their
defilement; a generation of false aims and rebellious will.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` What, reckless still, inconsiderate still! Is this the return thou
wouldst make to that father who calls thee his own, that creator who
fashioned thee?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Cast thy mind back to old days; nay, trace the record of each
succeeding generation; ask thy father what news he has to tell, thy
forefathers, what word they have for thee.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The Ruler of all has divided the nations apart, sundering Adam’s
children and giving to each people its own home, peoples as numerous as
the sons that sprang from Israel;✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but one was the Lord’s treasured possession, his own people; it was
Jacob he had marked out for his own domain.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He sought them out in the wilderness, there in the fearful desert
spaces, gave them the guidance, taught them the lessons they needed,
guarded them as if they had been the apple of his eye.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` (So the eagle that would incite its young to venture in the air now
hovers above them, now spreads its wings and takes them up to rest on
its own shoulders.)
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` None but the Lord was their guide on that journey, there was no
alien god to be found then in their company.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And afterwards he settled them in a country of high hills, where
they could eat the food their own lands yielded. Honey oozed from its
rocks, on its barren uplands the olive could flourish;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` cheese from the herd, milk was theirs from the flock, the flesh of
well-fed lamb and ram, cattle of Basan’s breed, and he-goats; they ate
the choicest wheat, drank the heady juice of the grape.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` A people so well loved! And now, pampered, they would throw off the
yoke. Pampered, full-fed, swollen with pride, they forsook that divine
creator, revolted against their deliverer.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He must endure the rivalry of alien worship, must look on
indignantly at their detestable doings.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Not to their God they offered sacrifice, but to devils, to gods yet
untried, upstart gods of yesterday, whom their fathers never held in
awe.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` What, forsake the sheltering Power that gave thee birth, forget the
very Lord who created thee?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The Lord was roused to anger when he saw it, saw his own sons and
daughters defying him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I will turn away from them, he said, and see what comes of it; here
is a rebellious race, a thankless brood.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They have deserted me for a god that was no god, phantoms have been
my rivals; now I will desert them in my turn, for a people that is no
people of mine; their rivals shall be men as impious as themselves.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` My anger shall be like a raging fire that burns down to the depths
of the abyss, that consumes earth and all that earth yields, scorches
the very roots of the hills.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` I mean to heap all my plagues upon them, exhaust all the arrows of
my vengeance.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` What famine shall gnaw them, what winged terrors eat them up with
destructive fangs! I will send wild beasts, too, to prey on them,
poisonous serpents shall creep upon them through the dust.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Havoc without, terror within doors; for man and maid, for infancy
and old age, the same doom!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Indeed, I had thought to make away with them altogether, blot out
their very name from all human remembrance;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` but no, I held my hand; were these enemies of theirs to provoke me
with taunts? Should the victors boast it was their own power, not mine,
that had won the day?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` How lost they are to right judgement, this people of Israel, how
slow of discernment!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Ah, if they would only take thought, and read their lesson, and
foresee what is still far away!
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When they see their thousands put to rout by one man, ten thousand
fleeing with two men in pursuit, can they doubt what is the cause of
it? It means their own God has relinquished them; that the Lord’s
decree has given their enemy the mastery;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` that enemy himself will bear witness that his gods are no match for
our God.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Does he enjoy my favour? No, says the Lord,✻ he is but a wild vine,
such as grows in Sodom, or in the purlieus of Gomorrha, yielding grapes
like gall, clusters of bitterness,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` yielding wine like the adder’s venom, the rankling poison of the
viper.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Be sure that I keep the record of his wickedness stored away under
seal in my treasure house;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` vengeance is for me; I will repay when the time comes. A slip of
the foot, and ruin is upon them; little waiting now before the
appointed day comes.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Never doubt it, the Lord will give his people redress, will take
pity on his servants, when he sees their strength so spent, the number
of them so dwindled, whether bond or free.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` He will ask, What has become of those gods of yours, once so well
trusted,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` that shared, once, the fat of your victims, the wine you poured in
libation? Will they not bestir themselves, and come to your aid,
protect you in your hour of need?
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Now you shall learn that I alone am God; there are no others to
rival me; it is mine to kill and to quicken, mine to smite and to heal;
from my power there is no deliverance.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` See, I lift up my hand, and swear by my own eternal being
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` that I am whetting this bright sword of mine, to execute speedy
judgement; I mean to take vengeance, now, on my enemies, requite them
for all their malice.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Now to glut my arrows with their blood, now to flesh this sword of
mine with the slaughter of my enemies, warriors slain in battle and
unhelmeted captives!
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Do honour, you nations, to the Lord’s people; he means to avenge
the blood of his servants, to punish their enemies, to be reconciled
once again with the land of Israel.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` So when Moses had performed his errand, reciting the whole of this
song in the hearing of the assembled people, with Josue the son of Nun
at his side,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` he made an end of all his long discourse to the Israelites,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` in these words, Pay good heed to the appeal I have made to you this
day, and hand it on to your children, bidding them hold fast to all the
terms of this law and carry them out faithfully.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` These duties are not lightly enjoined on you; to every man of you
they are life itself. Only by performing them can you hope for long
enjoyment of this land across Jordan which is to be your home.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` It was on the same day that the Lord said to Moses,
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Climb this mountain of Abarim (that is, of the Further Side; it is
the same as mount Nebo, in the Moabite country opposite Jericho), and
view the land of Chanaan, which I mean to give the sons of Israel for
their own. On that mountain thou art to die.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` This height climbed, thou must needs become a part of thy people,
as thy brother Aaron died and became a part of his people on Mount Hor.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` You disobeyed me, in full sight of the whole people, at the Water
of Rebellion in the desert of Sin, when you did not vindicate my
holiness before the sons of Israel.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Thou shalt have sight, nevertheless, of this land which is my gift
to the Israelites, the land it shall not be thine to enter.
