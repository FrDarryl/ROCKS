"2" = ''':sup:`2` Here is the law of sacrifice, divinely instituted. Bid the sons of
Israel bring a red heifer, fully grown and free from blemish, one that
has never borne the yoke.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This you will give to the priest Eleazar, who will take it beyond
the boundaries of the camp and immolate it there in the sight of all.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He will then dip his finger in its blood, with which he will
sprinkle the front of the tabernacle door seven times;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` the heifer itself he will burn publicly, committing skin and flesh,
blood and dung to the flames.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Cedar-wood, too, and hyssop and stuff twice-dyed in scarlet must be
thrown by the priest into the fire which consumes the heifer.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When all this is done, he will wash his clothes and his own person
before he enters the camp again, and will hold himself defiled till
evening comes;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and there will be the same duty of washing, the same law of
defilement, for the man who has had the burning of it.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The ashes of the heifer must be collected by a man who is still free
from defilement, and poured out in some place that is free from
defilement; and there the people of Israel will keep them to provide
lustral water, the ashes of this heifer that is burned to atone for
men’s faults.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Even the man who has the carrying of the ashes must wash his
clothes, and hold himself defiled till evening comes. This is to be a
sacred observance for the Israelites, and for aliens who dwell among
them, by right unalterable.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` When a man has touched a dead body, and for a week counts as
defiled,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` with this water he must be sprinkled on the third and the seventh

unless he has been sprinkled on the third.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` One who has touched a man’s dead body, and will not use this salve
for his cleansing, profanes the Lord’s dwelling-place; he is lost to
Israel, unclean still, and bearing the burden of his defilement, until
the lustral water sprinkles him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` If a man dies in his tent, this is the rule that must be followed;
all those who go into the tent incur defilement for seven days, and so
does all the furniture in it;

"15" = ''':sup:`15` nothing escapes defilement except what is covered with a lid or
wrapped up.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And if a man is killed or dies in the open, anyone who touches his
body incurs defilement for seven days; so does anyone who touches some
bone of a dead man, or his grave.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` It was to atone for such faults the victim was burned; a handful of
its ashes must be thrown into a vessel that contains fresh water,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and some man who is free from defilement, using hyssop for a brush,
must sprinkle the tent with it, and the furniture of the tent, and all
those who are defiled by contact with death.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So, on the third and on the seventh day, man defiled must be made
clean by man undefiled; and on the seventh day he will wash his
clothes, and hold himself defiled, even yet, till evening.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The man who will not avail himself of such atonement is lost to the
congregation; he is a profanation to the Lord’s sanctuary until the
lustral water has sprinkled him.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` This command must never be abrogated. Even the man who has
sprinkled the lustral water must wash his clothes, and everyone who has
touched it is defiled for the rest of the day.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` The defiled man defiles all he touches; and anyone who touches it
is defiled in his turn till evening.

for seven days, and the water of purification must be used for
cleansing. This reinforces the seriousness of impurity and the need for

is also considered unclean. This highlights how uncleanness spreads,
19:17-19 - The unclean person must be sprinkled with the water of
purification on the third and seventh days. This process symbolizes the
gradual cleansing of sin and the need to obey God's commands to be
