undoing.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Many will embrace their wanton creeds, and bring the way of truth
into disrepute,

Long since, the warrant for their doom is in full vigour; destruction
is on the watch for them.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` God did not spare the angels who fell into sin; he thrust them down
to hell, chained them there in the abyss, to await their sentence in
torment.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Nor did he spare the world he had first made; he brought a flood on
that world of wickedness, preserving Noe, who had borne witness to
holiness, and only seven others with him.

turning them to ashes, for an example to the godless of a later time.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Yet he saved Lot, an innocent man who was overborne by the violence
and the wantonness of his wicked neighbours;

from their trials, while the wrong-doers must await the day of

destroyed, sneer at what they cannot understand, and will soon perish
in their own corruption;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` they will have the reward their wickedness has deserved. To live in

entangled and overpowered by it a second time, means that their last

Notas de rodapé:
2:1-3 - False teachers are a threat to the Church, distorting the truth
and bringing destruction. Greed is often a motivation for falsehood,
2:4-9 - Peter highlights examples from the Old Testament where God

how to deliver the godly from temptation and punish the unrighteous
2:10-12 - False teachers live arrogantly, disregarding God's authority
and corrupting the truth. Their behavior is compared to irrational
2:13-14 - False teachers live in luxury, deceive the unwary, and are
immersed in evil practices. They pursue temporal pleasures without
2:19-22 - False teachers promise freedom, but they are slaves to
corruption. Their deliverance from God is more difficult than that of
someone who has never known the truth, for they return to sin after
6:4-6).
