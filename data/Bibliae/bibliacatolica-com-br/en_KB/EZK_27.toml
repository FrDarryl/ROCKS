gates, and trafficks with many peoples on many shores! Thine was the

western islands, with marquetry of Indian ivory.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Of broidered linen from Egypt the sails they spread for thee, awning
of blue and purple from the Grecian isles gave thee shade.

with shield and helmet decked thy walls;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` men of Arvad ringed the battlements, thy defenders, and the
Gammadim,✻ too, were mounted on thy towers, on thy walls hung their
quivers; lacked nothing for thy adornment.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And for the merchants that dealt with thee, how Carthage poured her
wealth into thy market-place, of silver and iron, of tin and lead!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What purveyors of thine were Ionia, Thubal, and Mosoch, with their
slaves to sell thee, their urns of bronze;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and the men of Thogorma, with horse and horseman and mule!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The sons of Dedan were thy pedlars; riches came to thee from the
islands far away; ivory and ebony thou couldst win by barter.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Syria, too, for the multitude of thy wares, must trade with thee,
exposing in thy mart carbuncles, and purple, and embroidery, and lawn,
and silk, and rubies.

exchanged traffick with thee;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and how rich the variety of it, the coverlets of blue, the
embroideries, the treasure-caskets wound about with cords, the
cedar-wood, all for thy profit!✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But the ships, they were thy pedlars in chief; the ocean-going
ships, that gave thee thy wealth, gave thee thy sea-environed renown.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Alas, that those oarsmen of thine should have ferried thee out into
deep waters, for the storm-wind to wreck thee, out in the heart of the
sea!
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` All thy wealth and treasure and merchandise, thy mariners and
helmsmen, dockyard masters and captains, all the warriors thou hast,
and the common folk that dwell in thee, must sink down to the sea’s
depths in this day of thy fall.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` down come the rowers from their ships, mariner and pilot line the
shore.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Loud they bewail thee, bitter their cry, as they throw dust on
their heads and sprinkle themselves with ashes;

"31" = ''':sup:`31` heads are shaven, sackcloth is every man’s wear; woeful hearts are
all around, and woeful lament.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And a sad dirge they shall sing as they mourn over thee: City was
none like Tyre, that now lies forgotten in the depths of the sea!
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Peoples a many thy trafficking supplied; all the kings of the earth
were richer for wealth of thine, enterprise of thine;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and now the sea has swallowed thee up; buried in the deep waters
all the prosperity that was thine, all the citizens that thronged thee.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The island peoples, how they stood aghast at thy fall; the island
kings, how their faces fell at the news of thy shipwreck!
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` How they hissed in derision, the traders of other nations! Only
ruin is left of thee, for ever vanished and gone.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
27:1-11 - The lamentation over Tyre describes her wealth and glory, but
also anticipates her destruction. Tyre is compared to a great merchant
ship that sinks because of her arrogance and confidence in her riches
27:12-25 - Tyre's trade relations with various Mediterranean nations
are highlighted, showing how the city prospered from its exchange of
goods and wealth. This highlights the danger of trusting in temporal
27:26-36 - The fall of Tyre is described in dramatic terms as a
shipwreck, bringing mourning and despair to all the nations that
depended on her. Tyre's destruction serves as a warning to nations that
rely on powerful material resources rather than on God's sovereignty
