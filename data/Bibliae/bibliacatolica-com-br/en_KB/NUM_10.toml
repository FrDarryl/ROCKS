Notas de rodapé:
10:1-2 - God commands Moses to make two silver trumpets to summon the
congregation and order the movement of the camp. These trumpets
symbolize divine communication and the importance of clear leadership
10:11-13 - The cloud lifts from the Tabernacle, indicating that it is
time for the Israelites to leave the Sinai Desert. This marks a new
stage in Israel's journey to the Promised Land and reinforces God's
78:14).
10:29-32 - Moses invites Hobab, his brother-in-law, to join Israel's
journey, valuing Hobab's knowledge of the wilderness. This demonstrates
the importance of seeking advice and practical help, in addition to
4:9-10).
10:33-36 - As the ark of the covenant went before Israel, Moses prayed
for God's protection and leadership, demonstrating the centrality of
God's presence in the lives of the people. His prayers reflected trust
10:34-36 - Moses' prayer as the ark departed and came to rest ("Arise,
O Lord" and "Return, O Lord") demonstrates God's role as constant
