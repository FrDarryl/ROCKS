path means saving a soul from death, means throwing a veil over a
multitude of sins.✻

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-6 - James warns the rich who exploit the poor and live in luxury,
for God's judgment is approaching. Economic injustice is a grave sin,
5:11-12).
5:7-11 - James exhorts Christians to be patient and steadfast in the
faith, confidently awaiting Christ's return. The example of the
prophets and Job shows that patience and perseverance are rewarded (see
5:13-18 - Prayer has healing and restorative power. James emphasizes
the importance of praying for one another, confessing our sins, and
5:19-20 - James concludes the letter by urging Christians to bring back
to the faith those who have strayed. Restoring the faithful is a work
of great value, for it covers a multitude of sins (see also
5:14-15 - Anointing with oil and prayer by the elders are ways to seek
physical and spiritual healing, showing the importance of communal
Corinthians 12:9).
