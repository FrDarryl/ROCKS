Notas de rodapé:
1:1-2 - The creation of the world begins with the affirmation that God
is the Creator of all things. The account emphasizes divine sovereignty
and the initial chaos, which is transformed by God's word. This
introduction highlights the importance of God's creative power (see
1:3-5 - God's first creative act is the creation of light, separating
it from darkness. This separation symbolizes the order God brings to
the world and light as a symbol of His presence. It is a reminder of
the need for spiritual discernment between light and darkness (see also
1:26-27 - The creation of human beings in God's image is central,
highlighting the dignity and value of every human life. This implies
that human beings have a divine purpose and a unique role in creation,
reflecting God's nature in their capacity to love and create (see also
1:28-31 - God blesses humanity and gives it the mandate to rule over
creation. This verse highlights the responsibility humans have as
stewards of the world. God's assessment that everything is "very good"
reflects the perfection of His creation and God's original intention
01:31 - The final verse of the chapter reaffirms that God saw
everything He had created and found it very good. This not only
highlights the goodness of creation but also suggests that the sin and
corruption that entered the world were not part of God's original plan
