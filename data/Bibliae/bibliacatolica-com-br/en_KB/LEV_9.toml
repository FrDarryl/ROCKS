sons, with the elders of Israel, and said to Aaron,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Choose out a young bullock to atone for your faults, and a ram for
burnt-sacrifice, both without blemish, and offer them to the Lord.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` And bid the sons of Israel choose out a goat to atone for their
faults, with a bullock and a lamb, both one year old, both without
blemish, for their burnt-sacrifice;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` an ox, too, and a ram, by way of welcome-offering. They must
immolate them here before the Lord, and offer up flour kneaded with oil
to accompany each sacrifice; this day, the Lord means to appear among
you.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So they brought to the tabernacle door all that Moses bade them
bring; and to the whole multitude there assembled
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Moses proclaimed, Here is a command laid upon you by the Lord;
fulfil it, and his glory will be revealed to you.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then he said to Aaron, Go up to the altar, and immolate the victim
that is to atone for thy faults; offer burnt-sacrifice, to win pardon
for thyself and for the people; the people too, have a victim thou must
immolate, making intercession for them as the Lord bids thee.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` With that, Aaron came up to the altar, and immolated the bullock
that was to atone for his own faults.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` His sons held out the blood before him, and he dipped his finger and
smeared the horns of the altar with it, pouring the rest away at the
altar’s foot.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then, obedient to the command which the Lord had given Moses, he
sacrificed on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the liver-caul of
this transgression-victim,

"11" = ''':sup:`11` taking its flesh and skin away from the camp to be destroyed by
fire.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` After this, he immolated the victim of the burnt-sacrifice, his
sons holding out first the blood, which he poured away round the altar;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` then the carcase, cut up into joints, with its head and all its
limbs complete, which he burnt on the altar,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` first washing its entrails and its feet in water.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Next, he immolated the goat, as an offering for the people’s
faults, and, purifying the altar,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` went on to the burnt-sacrifice,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` to which he added, burning them on the altar, the customary gifts,
over and above all the ceremonies of the morning sacrifice.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then he immolated the ox and the ram, by way of welcome-offering
for the people. His sons held out the blood, and he poured it round the
altar;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` the fat of the ox, and the ram’s tail, and the kidneys with their
fat, and the cauls of the livers,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` they laid on the breasts of the victims, and when the fat had been
burnt on the altar,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Aaron set apart the two breasts and the two right shoulders, which
he lifted up in the Lord’s presence, as Moses had bidden him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he stretched out his hands over the people, and blessed them;
and so, the sacrifice done, the atonement for faults, the
burnt-sacrifice, and the welcome-offering, he came down from the altar.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` After this, both Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle that
bears record and blessed the people as they came out. Whereupon the
glory of the Lord shone out upon the whole multitude,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and suddenly the Lord sent down fire, which consumed the
burnt-sacrifice, and all the fat that lay on the altar. At the sight,
the whole people raised a cry of praise, and fell face to ground in
worship.

presence and the role of sacrifice in the relationship between God and
