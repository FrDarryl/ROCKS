"1" = ''':sup:`1` So he reached Derbe, and Lystra. Here he met a disciple, named
Timothy, son of a believer who was a Jewess and a Gentile father.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and Paul resolved to take him as a companion on his journey. But he
was careful to circumcise him; he was thinking of the Jews living in
those parts, who all knew that Timothy’s father was a Gentile.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` As they passed from city to city, they recommended to their
observance the decree laid down by the apostles and presbyters at
Jerusalem.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They found the churches firmly established in the faith, and their
numbers daily increasing.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Thus they passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country; the Holy
Spirit prevented them from preaching the word in Asia.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then, when they had come as far as Mysia on their journey, they
planned to enter Bithynia; but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow it.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So they crossed Mysia, and went down to the sea at Troas.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Here Paul saw a vision in the night; a certain Macedonian stood by
him in entreaty, and said, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` That vision once seen, we were eager to sail for Macedonia; we
concluded that God had called us there to preach to them.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So we put out from Troas, made a straight course to Samothrace, and
next day to Neapolis.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thence we reached Philippi, which is a Roman colony and the chief
city in that part of Macedonia; in this city we remained for some days,
conferring together.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` On the sabbath day we went out beyond the city gates, by the river
side, a meeting-place, we were told, for prayer; and we sat down and
preached to the women who had assembled there.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` One of those who were listening was a woman called Lydia, a
purple-seller from the city of Thyatira, and a worshipper of the true
God; and the Lord opened her heart, so that she was attentive to Paul’s
preaching.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` She was baptized, with all her household; and she was urgent with
us; Now you have decided that I have faith in the Lord, she said, come
to my house and lodge there; and she would take no denial.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And now, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, we chanced
to meet a girl who was possessed by a divining spirit; her predictions
brought in large profits to her masters.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This girl used to follow behind Paul and the rest of us, crying
out, These men are the servants of the most high God; they are
proclaiming to us the way of salvation.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And when she had done this for a number of days, Paul was
distressed by it; he turned round and said to the spirit, I command
thee to come out of her, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; and
there and then it came out of her.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Her masters, who saw that all their hopes of profit had vanished,
took hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them off to justice in the
market-place.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When they brought them before the magistrates, they said, These
men, Jews by origin, are disturbing the peace of our city;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` they are recommending customs which it is impossible for us, as
Roman citizens, to admit or to observe.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The crowd gathered round, to join in the accusation; and the
magistrates, tearing their clothes off them, gave orders that they
should be beaten;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` then, when they had inflicted many lashes on them, put them in
prison, and bade the gaoler keep them in safe custody.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thus instructed, he put them in the inner ward, and secured their
feet in the stocks.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` At midnight, Paul and Silas were at their prayers, praising God,
while the prisoners listened to them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And all at once there was a violent earthquake, so that the
foundations of the prison rocked; whereupon every door opened, and
every man’s chains were undone.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The gaoler, who had been awakened, saw the prison doors open, and
drew his sword as if to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had
escaped;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` but Paul cried with a loud voice, Do no hurt to thyself; we are all
here.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And so, when he had called for a light, he came running in and fell
at the feet of Paul and Silas, all trembling;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Sirs, he asked, as he led them out, what am I to do, to save
myself?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Have faith, they said to him, in the Lord Jesus; there lies
salvation for thee, and for thy household.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then they preached the word of the Lord to him, and to all that
were in his house;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and he, there and then, at dead of night, took them away to wash
their wounds, and without delay he and all his were baptized.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` So he led them to his home, where he put food before them, and he
and all his household made rejoicing at having found faith in God.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` When day came, the magistrates sent their officers to say, Those
men are to be discharged.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And the gaoler reported the message to Paul; The magistrates have
sent ordering your discharge; it is time you should come out, and go on
your way in peace.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` But Paul said to them, What, have they beaten us in public, without
trial, Roman citizens as we are,✻ and sent us to prison, and now would
they let us out secretly? That will not serve; they must come here
themselves,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and fetch us out in person. When the officers gave this message to
the magistrates, they were alarmed by this talk of Roman citizenship;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` so they came and pleaded with them, urging them, as they brought
them out, to leave the city.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` On leaving the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they saw
the brethren and gave them encouragement; then they set out on their
travels.
