"1" = ''':sup:`1` Believe me when I tell you this; the man who climbs into the
sheep-fold by some other way, instead of entering by the door, comes to
steal and to plunder:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` it is the shepherd, who tends the sheep, that comes in by the door.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` At his coming the keeper of the door throws it open, and the sheep
are attentive to his voice; and so he calls by name the sheep which
belong to him, and leads them out with him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When he has brought out all the sheep which belong to him, he walks
in front of them, and the sheep follow him, recognizing his voice.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` If a stranger comes, they run away from him instead of following
him; they cannot recognize the voice of a stranger.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` This was a parable which Jesus told them; and they could not
understand what he meant to say to them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So Jesus spoke to them again; Believe me, he said, it is I who am
the door of the sheep-fold.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Those others who have found their way in are all thieves and
robbers; to these, the sheep paid no attention.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I am the door; a man will find salvation if he makes his way in
through me; he will come and go at will, and find pasture.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The thief only comes to steal, to slaughter, to destroy; I have
come so that they may have life, and have it more abundantly.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for
his sheep,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` whereas the hireling, who is no shepherd, and does not claim the
sheep as his own, abandons the sheep and takes to flight as soon as he
sees the wolf coming, and so the wolf harries the sheep and scatters
them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The hireling, then, takes to flight because he is only a hireling,
because he has no concern over the sheep.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am the good shepherd; my sheep are known to me and know me;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` just as I am known to my Father, and know him.✻ And for these sheep
I am laying down my life.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I have other sheep too, which do not belong to this fold; I must
bring them in too; they will listen to my voice; so there will be one
fold, and one shepherd.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This my Father loves in me, that I am laying down my life, to take
it up again afterwards.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Nobody can rob me of it; I lay it down of my own accord. I am free
to lay it down, free to take it up again; that is the charge which my
Father has given me.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` These words of his led to a fresh division of opinion among the
Jews.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Many of them said, He must be possessed; he is a madman; why do you
listen to him?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` While others said, This is not the language of a man who is
possessed by a devil. Has a devil power to open blind men’s eyes?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And now the Dedication feast was taking place at Jerusalem, and it
was winter;✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and Jesus was walking about in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So the Jews gathered round him, and said to him, How long wilt thou
go on keeping us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us openly.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Jesus answered them, I have told you, but you will not believe me.
All that I do in my Father’s name bears me testimony,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and still you will not believe me; that is because you are no sheep
of mine.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And I give them everlasting life, so that to all eternity they can
never be lost; no one can tear them away from my hand.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` This trust which my Father has committed to me is more precious
than all else; no one can tear them away from the hand of my Father.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` My Father and I are one.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` At this, the Jews once again took up stones, to stone him with.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Jesus answered them, My Father has enabled me to do many deeds of
mercy in your presence; for which of these are you stoning me?
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` It is not for any deed of mercy we are stoning thee, answered the
Jews; it is for blasphemy; it is because thou, who art a man, dost
pretend to be God.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I have said,
You are gods?✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` He gave the title of gods to those who had God’s message sent to
them; and we know that the words of scripture have binding force.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Why then, what of him whom God has sanctified and sent into the
world? Will you call me a blasphemer, because I have told you I am the
Son of God?
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` If you find that I do not act like the son of my Father, then put
no trust in me;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` but if I do, then let my actions convince you where I cannot; so
you will recognize and learn to believe that the Father is in me, and I
in him.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Thereupon once again they had a mind to seize him; but he escaped
from their hands,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` and went back to the other side of Jordan, to the place where John
was when he first baptized. There he waited,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` while many came out to see him. John, they said, never did a
miracle,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` but all John told us about this man has proved true. And many found
faith in him there.
