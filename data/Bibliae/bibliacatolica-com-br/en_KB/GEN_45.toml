Egyptians, and all Pharao’s household, could not but hear it.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I am Joseph, said he to his brethren; is my father yet alive? But
his brethren were so overcome with fear that they could not answer him,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and he must needs use gentleness; Come closer, he said, and then,
when they had drawn close to him, I am Joseph, that brother of yours
whom you sent away to be sold as a slave in Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now, do not take it to heart; waste no regrets over the bargain
that brought me here; if I came to Egypt first, it was on God’s errand,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` so God would have me here in readiness to preserve your race, by
giving you food to live on.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` It was not your design, then, it was God’s will that sent me here;

will maintain thee and keep thee from starving, with that household of
thine and all thou hast.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` You and my brother Benjamin here can assure him from the witness of
your own eyes, that it was Joseph who spoke to you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Tell my father of all these honours I enjoy, and of all you saw in
Egypt, and bring him back to me here with all speed.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` With that, he threw his arms round Benjamin’s neck, in tears;
Benjamin, too, wept as he clung to him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Joseph kissed all his brethren in turn, and wept over them,
till at last they found courage to speak to him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And now the news was in everybody’s mouth, and all Pharao’s court
heard that Joseph’s brethren were there. Pharao rejoiced heartily over

'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and these were the orders he would have Joseph give to his
brethren, Pack your beasts, and go back to Chanaan,

"18" = ''':sup:`18` bring your father here, and all your family, to share the blessings
of Egypt with me, and live on the best the land can give.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` And they might borrow waggons from Egypt, to carry their wives and
children back. Take your father with you (he was to tell them) and make
haste over your return;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and leave none of your farm stock behind you;✻ all the wealth of
Egypt awaits you here.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The sons of Israel did as they were bidden; Joseph providing them
with waggons at Pharao’s command, and with food for the journey.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He also had two new garments brought out for each, and gave
Benjamin three hundred silver pieces and five new garments of the
choicest sort;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` sending his father a like gift in both kinds, as well as ten asses
laden with the best merchandise of Egypt, and ten she-asses with corn
and bread to last him over his travels.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thus he sent his brethren home, and his last word, as they set out,
was Be sure there is no quarrelling on the way.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So they left Egypt, and when they reached their father Jacob in
Chanaan,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` they gave him their news, Thy son Joseph is still alive, and it is
he that rules the whole land of Egypt. Jacob heard it, with the look of
one just awoken from a heavy sleep, but at first he would not believe
them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and they must tell him the whole story from first to last. Then,
when he had seen for himself the waggons and all the gifts, he could
breathe again.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` If my son Joseph, he said, is still alive, that is all I ask; I
will go with you, and have sight of him again before I die.
