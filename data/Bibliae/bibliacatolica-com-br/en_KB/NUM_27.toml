"1" = ''':sup:`1` Salphaad, then, was descended from Joseph through Hepher, Galaad,
Machir and Manasses. And now his daughters, Maala, Noa, Hegla, Melcha
and Thersa came forward,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` preferring a suit before Moses and the high priest Eleazar and all
the chieftains, at the tabernacle door. This was their plea:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Our father died in the desert, not that he took any part in Core’s
rebellion against the Lord; he died accountable for no sins but his
own; and he died without male issue. Why must his name be lost to his
clan, only because he had no son? Why may we not inherit side by side
with our father’s kinsmen?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Moses submitted their plea to the Lord’s arbitrament,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and the Lord said to him,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` This is a just plea the daughters of Salphaad are making. Grant them
the right to inherit side by side with their father’s kinsmen, and
succeed to his property.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And make this announcement to the sons of Israel:
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When a man dies without sons, his property shall pass to a daughter;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` if he has no daughter, to his brothers;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` if he has no brothers, to his uncles;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` if he has no uncles either, to those who are next of kin to him.
This right holds good at all times by law unalterable; it was the
Lord’s command to Moses.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` After this, the Lord bade Moses climb the mountain of Abarim, that
was near by, and view the land he was giving to the sons of Israel as
their home.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When thou hast viewed it, said he, thou too, like thy brother
Aaron, shalt become a part of thy people.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Both of you earned my displeasure when the people challenged my
power in the wilderness of Sin, by not vindicating my holiness before
their eyes. (This was by the Waters of Rebellion, at Cades in the
desert of Sin.)
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` To this Moses made answer,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` O God, art not thou Lord of every spirit that breathes? And wilt
thou not find this people a ruler,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` who shall lead them to and fro, marching at their head? Must the
people of the Lord go untended, like sheep without a shepherd?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the Lord said to him, Make choice of Josue, the son of Nun, a
man endowed with high gifts; lay thy hand upon him,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and bid him stand forth before the high priest Eleazar, and the
whole assembly.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` There, in the sight of all, give him thy last charge, and share
with him that dignity which is thine, so that all Israel may learn to
obey him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But whenever some action is planned, the high priest Eleazar will
consult the Lord concerning it; at his word both Josue himself and all
Israel, and all the company that goes with them, shall move this way
and that.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Moses did as the Lord had bidden him, presenting Josue before
the high priest Eleazar and the whole assembly,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and there laying his hands on Josue’s head, and repeating all the
charge which the Lord had given him.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
27:1-4 - Zelophehad's daughters approach Moses to claim their
inheritance, as their father died without sons. This highlights justice
and the inclusion of women in inheritance rights within God's community
27:5-7 - God approves the petition of Zelophehad's daughters and
establishes a new law that guarantees inheritance rights to daughters
if their father has no sons. This demonstrates the equity and justice
27:12-14 - God commands Moses to go up the mountain to see the Promised
Land, but warns him that he will not enter it because of his
disobedience at Meribah. This reminds him of God's holiness and the
need for complete obedience (see also Deuteronomy 32:48-52 and
27:18-20 - Joshua is chosen by God as Moses' successor. He is given the
authority and spirit of leadership to guide Israel. This exemplifies
the importance of the transfer of spiritual leadership under divine
27:21-23 - Moses lays his hands on Joshua in front of the entire
congregation, symbolizing the transfer of authority. This reflects the
continuity of God's plan for His people and the importance of obedience
