"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Darius the Mede, son of Assuerus, was raised to the throne of
Chaldaea;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and in the year when his reign began who but I, Daniel, should
discover, by the reading of old records, how to compute the seventy
years of Jerusalem’s widowhood? Such doom the Lord had foretold to the
prophet Jeremias.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And with that, I turned to the Lord my God; pray to him I would, and
sue for mercy, fasting ever, sackcloth and ashes my only wear.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Prayed I then to the Lord my God, and made confession of my sins, in
these words following: Mercy, mercy, Lord God, the great, the terrible;
to those who love thee, so gracious, with those who keep thy
commandments, troth keeping still!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Sinned we have, and wronged thee, rebelled we have, and forsaken
thee, turned our backs on decree and award of thine,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` nor heeded thy servants, the prophets, that spoke to us in thy name,
to king and prince and the common folk that gendered us.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Fault with thee is none; ours, Lord, to blush for the wrong-doing
that has offended thee, men of Juda, citizens of Jerusalem, Israel near
at hand, Israel banished far away, in what plight thou seest!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Blush we, king and prince of ours, fathers of ours that did the
wrong;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` be it thine, O Lord our God, to have mercy and to forgive. So far we
have strayed from thee,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` so deaf to the divine voice, when the prophets that served thee
bade us follow thy law!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` A whole people that would transgress thy command, turn a deaf ear
to thy calls! What wonder if it fell on us, drop by drop, the avenging
curse God’s servant Moses wrote of? Our sins had deserved it,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and if yonder unexampled punishment befell Jerusalem, it was but a
threat fulfilled; warning we had of it, we and the princes that
governed us.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` No misfortune overtook us, but the law of Moses had foretold it;
and yet, O Lord our God, appease thy anger we would not, nor leave our
sinning, nor bethink ourselves, how well thy word thou keepest;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` what wonder if bane, not blessing, the divine regard brought us? Be
our punishment what it will, not ours to find fault with the God we
have disobeyed.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thou art the Lord our God, whose constraining power rescued thy
people from the land of Egypt, who hast won thyself glory, too, in this
our day; we, Lord, have been sinners, we have shewn ourselves unworthy
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` of all thy faithful dealings with us. But wilt thou let thy
indignant anger fall on Jerusalem, on that holy mountain of thine? Too
long, for our sins and the sins of our fathers before us, all our
neighbours have held Jerusalem, and us thy people, in contempt.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` God of our race, give audience at last to the prayer, the plea thy
servant brings before thee; for thy own honour, restore the sanctuary,
that now lies forlorn, to the smile of thy favour.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` My God, give ear and listen to us; open thy eyes, and see how
desolate is this city of ours, that claims to be thy own. No merits of
ours, nothing but thy great love emboldens us to lay our prayers at thy
feet.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Thy hearing, Lord, and thy pardon; thy heed, Lord, and thy aid! For
thy own honour, my God, deny thyself no longer to the city, the people
that is called thy own!✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Thus prayed I, thus did I confess my own sins, and the sins of my
fellow Israelites, pouring out supplication, there in the presence of
my God, for that holy mountain which is his dwelling-place.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And I was still at my prayer, when the human figure of Gabriel, as
I had seen it at the beginning of my vision, flew swiftly to my side;
it was the hour of the evening sacrifice when he reached me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And with these words he enlightened me: Daniel, my errand is to
instruct thee and give thee discernment.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Even as thy prayer began, a secret was disclosed, and I am here to
make it known to thee, so well heaven loves thee. Mark well, then, the
message, and read the revelation aright.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` It is ordained that this people of thine, that holy city of thine,
should wait seventy weeks before guilt is done away, sin ended, wrong
righted; before God’s everlasting favour is restored, and the visions
and the prophecies come true, and he who is all holiness receives his
anointing.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Be assured of this, and mark it well; a period of seven weeks must
go by, and another period of sixty-two weeks, between the order to
rebuild Jerusalem and the coming of the Christ to be your leader.
Street and wall will be built again, though in a time of distress;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and then sixty-two weeks must pass before the Christ is done to
death; the people will disown him and have none of him. Then the army
of an invading leader will destroy both city and sanctuary, so that his
taking away will mean utter destruction; only a ruin is to be left when
that war is ended.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` High covenant he shall make, before another week is done, and with
folks a many; but when that week has run half its course, offering and
burnt-sacrifice shall be none; in the temple all shall be defilement
and desolation, and until all is over, all is fulfilled, that
desolation shall continue.✻
