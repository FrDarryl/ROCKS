the townspeople, climb they eagerly to the house-tops.

city that makes holiday? Alas for thy dead, that were never slain by
the sword, never died in battle;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` alas for rulers of thine, who with one accord have fled, or else
been cruelly bound! Chains for all that were left, and distant exile.
'''

comfort me, now that this people of mine is widowed.
'''

must bring in from the lower pool;

"10" = ''':sup:`10` take count of the houses in Jerusalem, pulling down some to build
up the defences;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` you must find a bed between the two walls to contain the waters of
the old pool. And all the while, no thought of him who made it all, no
eyes for him who fashioned it, long ago.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This day the Lord, the God of hosts, summons you to mourn and
lament, to shave your heads and wear sackcloth;

like a cloak,
'''

"21" = ''':sup:`21` clothe him with thy robe, gird him with thy girdle, entrust him
with the power that once was thine; to rule all the citizens of
Jerusalem, all Juda’s race, with a father’s care.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` I will give him the key of David’s house to bear upon his
shoulders; none may shut when he opens, none open when he shuts.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` I will fix him securely in his place, like a peg that is to carry
all the royal honour of his father’s house;

and fall, and all that hung from it be ruined; the Lord decrees it.✻

Notas de rodapé:
22:1-2 - The prophecy about the valley of vision is a lament for
Jerusalem, where the people live carelessly even in times of crisis.
This carelessness in the face of judgment highlights the need for
22:8-11 - Jerusalem is rebuked for trusting in her physical defense and
neglecting repentance and faith in God. This warning teaches the
importance of trusting in divine protection above any human preparation
22:12-13 - God calls the people to mourning and repentance, but they
choose celebration and carefree abandon. The lack of spiritual response
to the divine call represents a turning away from God (see also
22:15-19 - Isaiah prophesies against Shebna, the unjust administrator,
symbolizing the fate of all leaders who abuse their power. God exalts
22:20-24 - Eliakim's calling as Shebna's successor highlights God's
provision of righteous leaders. He is a type of Christ, who faithfully
