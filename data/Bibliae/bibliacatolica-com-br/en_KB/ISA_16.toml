"1" = ''':sup:`1` Send forth (O Lord) a lamb to be ruler of the land,✻ from Petra in
the desert to the hill where queen Sion reigns.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There they will be, the women-folk of Moab, waiting at the ford of
Arnon, like fluttered birds, fledgelings that have taken wing from the
nest;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` there are plans to be made, deliberations to be held; Shelter us,
like the shadow, dark as night, that gives shelter at noon-day; hide
these fugitives of ours, do not betray them in their wanderings;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` let them dwell as exiles in your land; poor Moab,✻ give it sanctuary
from threat of the invader! But see, the dust of armies has died down,
the guilty wretch has met his end; vanished and gone, who trampled the
world under foot!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Mercy and faithfulness return; a throne set up in David’s
dwelling-place, for a judge that loves right and gives redress
speedily!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The boasting of Moab has long been in our ears; who so boastful as
he? Proud, scornful, and overbearing, with dreams that came to nothing.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So, from one end of Moab to the other, there is a dirge, everywhere
a dirge; for yonder folk, that live content behind walls of hardened
brick, tidings of ruin.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The fields about Hesebon lie deserted; alien chieftains have rooted
up the vineyard of Sabama, whose shoots once reached as far as Jazer,
strayed through the wilderness;✻ forlorn, now, its tendrils, wandering
overseas.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I will weep, then, as Jazer weeps, for the vineyard of Sabama, water
Hesebon and Eleale with my tears. That thy vineyard, thy vintage-time
should be disturbed by the cry of trampling armies!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` All joy, all triumph gone from that fruitful land of thine; no
mirth, no gaiety left; the presses shall be trampled no more by the
labourers we knew; forgotten, now, the cry that used to go up when they
trod the grapes.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For Moab, my inmost being thrills like a harp’s strings; my heart
goes out to those brick-walled cities of hers.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` What shift will she make, when all goes ill with her on the
heights? Prayer of hers, recourse to those shrines of hers, shall
nothing avail her?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Such was the word the Lord spoke to Moab, long since,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and now he declares his purpose: In three years, by the time a
labourer’s contract is out, Moab, so populous now, shall be shorn of
her glory; shall be left small and weak, a thriving nation no longer.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
16:1-2 - Moab is urged to send tribute to Jerusalem, seeking refuge in
Judah. This symbolizes the search for mercy and the need for submission
to God's people in times of distress (see also 1 Kings 4:21 and
16:4-5 - Isaiah prophesies that a righteous ruler will arise, promising
refuge and security. This ruler is often seen as a messianic reference,
16:6-7 - Isaiah laments Moab's arrogance, which leads to its
destruction. Self-sufficiency and pride are causes of downfall, warning
16:8-10 - Moab's vineyards are destroyed, a symbol of its lost
prosperity. This imagery reinforces the desolation that judgment
16:12-14 - Moab's prayer to its gods does not prevent its destruction.
The ineffectiveness of its idols highlights the futility of trusting in
