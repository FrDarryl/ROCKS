"1" = ''':sup:`1` But Job answered:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` No need to teach me that; how should a man win his suit, matched
against God?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Who would go to law, where one plea on this side is arrayed against
a thousand on that?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` His all-knowing mind, his all-conquering arms, what man ever throve
yet that defied them?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` God, the unseen power that can thrust mountains this way and that,
uproot them in his anger,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` can move earth from its place, and set all its pillars quaking,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` can prevent, with a word, the sun’s rising, or imprison, under his
royal seal, the very stars?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He it was, and no other, that spread out heaven to be his covering,
made ocean a floor under his feet;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` that created Arcturus, and Orion, and the Hyades, and the nooks of
the south;✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` great wonders he does, beyond all our understanding and all our
reckoning.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Hidden from my sight, hidden from my thought, he comes and goes;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` comes suddenly, and how should I defend my doings? goes suddenly,
and how should I question his?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` There is no braving the anger of such a God, when even the Titanic
powers obey him;✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and what am I that I should use phrases of studied eloquence for my
pleading?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Nay, though I had right on my side, I would not plead against him
as an adversary, I would sue to him for mercy as a judge.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` What though I should cry upon him, and he should answer my summons?
Well I know he would listen to no pleadings of mine;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` his storms would overwhelm me, faster than ever the unmerited blows
would fall;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` never a breathing-space, never a draught but of gall!

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Nought avails might, when a giant threatens me; nought avails
right, when none dares to support my quarrel.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Would I plead in defence, he turns my own words against me; be I
never so upright, he will prove me hypocrite.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And innocent I am, but of that I take regard no longer; I am aweary
of life itself.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Still unchanged is the burden of my complaint; innocent and guilty,
he sweeps all away.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` If his scourge must fall, should not a single blow suffice? Why
does he look on and laugh, when the unoffending, too, must suffer?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So the whole world is given up into the power of wrong-doers; he
blinds the eyes of justice. He is answerable for it; who else?

"26" = ''':sup:`26` like a pinnace gliding down stream,✻ or an eagle swooping on its
prey.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Ere now, I have been minded to put away such talk as this, wear a
sad face and live on the rack no more; still would I have pains to
daunt me;

"28" = ''':sup:`28` still thou wouldst hold me guilty, wouldst not spare.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Blamed I must be, in spite of all; vain was my striving,

"30" = ''':sup:`30` vainly I washed me in water pure as snow, kept my hands shining
clean;

"31" = ''':sup:`31` thy condemnation must roll me in the mire again, till the very
clothes I wear shun the touch of me!

"32" = ''':sup:`32` I cannot meet him in judgement as man to man, claim an impartial
hearing for my plea;

"33" = ''':sup:`33` there can be no arbiter between us, to claim jurisdiction over
both.

"34" = ''':sup:`34` Let him lay by his rod, let his terrors cease to daunt me;

"35" = ''':sup:`35` then I will speak out bravely to his face; it is fear that holds me
dumb.

Notas de rodapé:
9:1-2 - Job acknowledges God's greatness and asserts that, before His
majesty, no human being can be considered righteous. This perspective
emphasizes God's transcendence and human powerlessness in the face of
9:3-12 - Job expresses his frustration with his inability to challenge
God. He emphasizes the inevitability of suffering and the difficulty of
understanding God's ways. This reflects the human struggle with pain
9:13-20 - Job's speech highlights that even if he wanted to argue with
God, he could not win. The idea that God is unbeatable underscores the
disproportion between divine wisdom and human understanding (see also
9:21-24 - Job feels his integrity is not recognized, and he expresses
that the unrighteous are often favored. This reflection on the apparent
prosperity of the wicked is a recurring theme in Scripture and raises
9:25-35 - Job cries out for a mediator between himself and God,
revealing the human need for an intermediary in times of desperation.
This search for mediation prefigures Christ's role as our Advocate
