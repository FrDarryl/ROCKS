will send down his blessing; a land of blessing shall be thine.

race, fruitful thy cattle, fruitful this land, his promised gift to thy
fathers.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` The Lord will open to thee the rich stores of heaven, and grant thy
land rain when the season comes for it; he will prosper all thy
enterprises, making thee the creditor of many nations, the debtor of
none;

them the lower place. All this, if thou wilt obey the commandments of
the Lord that I enjoin on thee this day, holding fast to them and
living by them,

"14" = ''':sup:`14` not swerving to right or left, not following the worship of other
gods than thine.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` dust will be all the rain he gives thee, and ashes shall fall from
the skies to overwhelm thee.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The Lord will make thee cower before the onslaught of thy enemies;
the host that went out against them in one company shall flee away in
seven, till thy race is scattered over all the kingdoms of the world,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and the carcase that is left of thee will be left for every bird in
heaven and every beast on earth to prey upon, with none to drive them
away.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The Lord will smite thee with the Egyptian scab, and swelling in
the groin, and the itch; there shall be no curing thee.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The Lord will drive thee distracted, all benighted and crazed in
thy wits,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` till thou wilt grope thy way at noon like a blind man in the dark,
and lose thyself; never a day when thou art not wronged and oppressed,
and there shall be none to deliver thee.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` Wed a wife, and another shall bed her, build a house, and thou
shalt not dwell in it, plant a vineyard, and the vintage shall not be
thine.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Thou wilt see thy own ox slain, and never a morsel for thee, thy
ass carried off, and never restored, thy sheep given to thy enemies,
and no help for it.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Nay, thy sons and daughters will be enslaved to alien masters, and
thy own eyes shall see it, and ache continually at the sight; no power
left thee to resist it.

witnessed.

"35" = ''':sup:`35` The Lord will smite knee and calf of thine with the foul scab, till
it covers thee from head to foot, past all remedy.✻
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Exile awaits thee, awaits the king thou hast chosen to rule over
thee; the Lord will carry thee away into a land thou and thy fathers
never heard of, where thou must needs worship alien gods, of wood and
stone;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and to all the nations among whom the Lord bids thee dwell, thy
name shall be a proverb and a by-word.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Much sown and little reaped, where the locust has eaten;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` vines planted and dressed, and no vintage gathered, no wine drunk,
because the weevil has ravaged them;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` olives everywhere, and no oil to anoint thee, because they drooped
and withered away;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` sons and daughters born, and no comfort to thee, all carried away
into exile.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` No tree of thine, no crop of thine, but the mildew shall spoil it.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` The aliens that dwell in thy land will outpass and over-shadow
thee, humbled now and no match for them;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` they shall be the creditors now, and thou the debtor; it is for
them to lead, for thee to follow.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And other curses shall befall thee, hunting thee down until they
overtake thee, for thy utter ruin; and all because thou wouldst not
listen to the Lord thy God, and hold fast to the commandments and
observances he enjoined upon thee.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` It shall be a warning and a prodigy, the fate that shall come upon
thee, and upon thy race in perpetuity.

"47" = ''':sup:`47` Because thou wouldst not obey the Lord thy God in happiness and
content, when thou hadst enough and to spare,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` thou must learn, now, to obey those enemies the Lord will send out
to conquer thee; obey them in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and
every kind of want; a yoke of iron shall be fastened on thy neck, and
shall crush thee down.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` From far away, from the very ends of the earth, the Lord will send
a nation to sweep down on thee like a bird of prey; a nation whose very
speech is unknown to thee;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` hard-hearted, with no respect for age, no pity for helpless
children.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` All that thy herds, all that thy lands yield, they will take for
food, careless of thy ruin; neither wheat nor wine nor soil nor herd
nor flock shall be left to thee; all will be laid waste.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` In thy cities, too, they will press hard on thee, battering down
everywhere those high walls, those strong walls; all over this land,
which the Lord thy God is now giving thee, there shall be siege at thy
gates.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Thou wilt be fain to eat thy own offspring, the flesh of thy own
sons and daughters, the Lord’s gift to thee; so bitter the stress and
the want these enemies of thine shall bring upon thee.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` The man that lived softly hitherto, in all comfort, will grudge
food to his own brother, to the wife that lay in his bosom,
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` and that food the flesh of his own sons; nothing else is left him,
so hard the siege is pressed against all thy cities.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` The woman, so tender, so dainty, that would not put her foot to the
ground, would not walk a single step, too delicately nurtured for that,
will grudge the flesh of her own sons and daughters to the husband that
lay in her bosom.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` She will eat what comes out from her own body, eat her own son that
is newly born, there in secret; what else has she, hard pressed by the
siege that is brought against these cities of thine?
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` If thou dost not carry out faithfully every word of the law this
book contains, going in fear of the great name, the terrible name, the
Lord thy God,
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` then the Lord will send worse plagues still on thee and on thy
posterity, heavy plagues and of long continuance, grievous and lasting
visitations.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` The fierce afflictions of Egypt (thou hast dreaded them ere now)
shall be thine instead.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And all the sicknesses and plagues of which this book makes no
mention the Lord will bring thee, till he has crushed thee down;
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` only a few will be left out of a number that was countless once as
the stars in heaven, because thou wouldst not listen to the Lord thy
God.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` Hitherto the Lord had taken delight in blessing thy race and
increasing it; now he will take delight in destroying and overwhelming
it, dispossessing it of the land he has given thee for thy home.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` This way and that, among all the nations from earth’s end to
earth’s end, the Lord will scatter it; and in exile thou wilt worship
such alien gods as thou and thy fathers never heard of, gods of wood
and stone.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` And even there thou wilt find no rest, no sure ground under thy
feet. Nought will the Lord leave thee but cowed spirits, and eyes that
fail, and a heart eaten up with sorrow.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` Thou wilt see thy life hanging on a thread; day and night thou wilt
go in fear, not counting life itself thy own.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` In the morning thou wilt say? Will it never be evening? and in the
evening, Will it never be morning? such will be the terrors that daunt
thee, so cruel the sights that meet thy eyes.
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` The Lord will carry thee back over the sea to Egypt, the Lord who
once told thee thou shouldst never see that road again. There the men
and women of your race shall be slaves, on sale to their enemies, and
find no master to buy them.
