'''

'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He also made ten smaller basins, and put five on the right, five on
the left, for the washing of all that was to be offered in
burnt-sacrifice; in the great basin the priests themselves washed.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Within the temple were ten golden lamp-stands, of a prescribed

'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` the large basin, with the twelve oxen beneath it,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and pot and fork and bowl besides all else. All such ornaments for
the Lord’s house did Hiram, king Solomon’s master craftsman, fashion
out of the purest bronze;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` the king had them cast in the clay soil of the Jordan valley,
between Socoth and Saredatha;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` a great multitude of them, so that the weight of bronze was never
counted or known.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Other appurtenances, too, of the Lord’s house must Solomon make;
the golden altar, and the golden tables on which the hallowed loaves
were set out,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` the lamp-stand with its lamps, all of pure gold, ready to burn in
due course before the shrine,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and the flowered bosses for them, and the lamps themselves, and the
tongs, of pure gold too.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Nothing but must be made of the purest gold, incense-boat and
censer and bowl and spoon. Carved doors within, leading to the shrine,
temple doors without, alike were plated with gold. Thus Solomon
completed all the work needed for the service of the Lord’s house.✻
