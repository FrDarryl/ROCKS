"1" = ''':sup:`1` So Joseph approached Pharao with the news that his father and his
brethren had brought their sheep and cattle and all they possessed away
from Chanaan, and were there in the land of Gessen.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He also presented his five youngest brethren to the king,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and these, when the king asked what their employment was, answered,
Thy servants are shepherds, as their fathers were before them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` We have come to seek hospitality in this land of thine, my lord,
because the drought lies heavy on Chanaan, and there is no pasture for
our flocks; our plea is, that thou wouldst grant thy servants a home in
the country of Gessen.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So the king told Joseph, Now that thy father and thy brethren have
come here to bear thee company,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` the whole land of Egypt is at thy disposal; bid them dwell where
they are best able to dwell, occupying the country of Gessen. And if
thou knowest any of their number to be skilful at their craft, give
them charge of my own herds.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Afterwards, Joseph brought his father in, and presented him to the
king, to whom he gave his blessing.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when the king asked him, what was his age?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I have lived a wanderer’s life, said he, these hundred and thirty
years; no long life, and no happy one, compared with the years my
fathers spent, roaming the world before me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So he gave the king his blessing, and left him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Joseph obeyed Pharao’s bidding, and gave his father and his
brethren lands in the most favoured part of Egypt, at Ramesses;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and there he maintained them, with all his father’s kindred, giving
an allowance of food to each.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` All the world over, bread was still scarce, and the drought bore
hardest on Egypt and on Chanaan,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` till at last Joseph had amassed all the money either land possessed
in the royal treasury, through his sales of wheat.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So, when they had nothing left to buy with, the Egyptians all came
to Joseph asking to have bread given them for nothing; Wilt thou watch
us starve, they asked, now that we have no more money left?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If you cannot pay, he answered, bring your cattle here, and you
shall have food in return for these.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So they brought them and he bartered corn for horses and sheep and
cattle and asses, feeding them the whole of that year and taking their
beasts as the price.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` By the next year, they came to him and said, My lord, we must needs
be open with thee; we have come to the end of our cattle, as well as
our money; thou canst see for thyself that nothing is left us except
our lives and our lands.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Do not watch us starve; thou shalt have the disposal of our lands
and of ourselves, making both of these the king’s property, and giving
us seed-corn in return; if not, the land will become a wilderness for
want of tillage.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So Joseph bought the whole land of Egypt, one and all selling their
possessions to him because the famine was so grievous; and he made it
Pharao’s property,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` with all the inhabitants of it from one end of Egypt to the other;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` except the land which the king had assigned to the priests. These
had a fixed allowance of food made to them from the royal store-houses,
and there was no occasion for them to sell their lands.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Joseph said to the people, You can see for yourselves now that
Pharao is lord of your lives and lands; you shall have seed-corn to sow
your fields with,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and when harvest-time comes you shall give up a fifth of your crops
to the king; the other four-fifths I will grant you for the next
sowing, and to feed your households and your children.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Our lives are in thy hand, they said; as long as we enjoy my lord’s
favour, we will gladly be the king’s servants.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` All over Egypt, from that day to this, the payment of the fifth is
a custom which has the force of law, except in the priests’ lands,
which are bound by no such conditions.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Thus Israel began to find a home in Egypt, that is, in the land of
Gessen, took possession of it, and flourished, and grew great.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Jacob himself lived on seventeen years there, so that he reached
altogether the age of a hundred and forty-seven.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And when he saw the day of his death approaching, he sent for his
son Joseph; Do me this favour, he said, put thy hand under my thigh,
and swear, in love and loyalty, that thou wilt not bury me here in
Egypt.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` I would sleep where my fathers sleep; take me far away from this
land and bury me in the burial-place of my kindred. I will do thy
bidding, answered Joseph;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` but Jacob would have him bind himself by an oath. So he gave his
oath; and then Israel turned his eyes towards the top of his bed,✻ and
gave praise to God.
