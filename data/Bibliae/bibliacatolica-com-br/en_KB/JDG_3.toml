men of Sidon, and the Hevites of mount Lebanon, between Baal-hermon
hill and the path that leads to Emath.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Spared they must be, so as to have a test of Israel’s loyalty; would
the Israelites obey the commands which the Lord had given to their
fathers through Moses, or not?

by Amorrhite and Pherezite, by Hevite and Jebusite,

and so came to worship their gods.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` They defied the Lord’s will, forsook him, their own God, and paid
court instead to the gods of the country-side, and to Astaroth;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then, once again, Israel defied the Lord’s will, and he, thus
defied, gave them a rival in Eglon king of Moab,

"13" = ''':sup:`13` that had Ammon and Amelec fighting at his side. This Eglon made an
expedition against the Israelites in which he defeated them, and took
possession of the city of Palm-trees.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And for eighteen years the king of Moab was master of Israel.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And now they cried out to the Lord, and he sent them a fresh
champion, a Benjamite called Aod, son of Gera. He was left-handed, and
when the Israelites sent him to pay King Eglon their tribute,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` he wore at his right side, under his cloak, a hilted dagger,
two-edged, nine inches long.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Gift in hand he came before Eglon, who sat there gross and pampered
of body.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` So, letting his companions go on before him, when the tribute had
been paid,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` he himself went back all the way from the carved rocks of Galgal,
and told the king he had a secret to make known to him. Eglon bade him
keep his counsel, and sent all the courtiers out;

"20" = ''':sup:`20` alone he sat in his summer parlour, when Aod found him. I have a
message for thee from the Lord, said Aod, and, as Eglon rose from his
seat,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` the dagger hidden at Aod’s right side was plunged into his belly.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Such was the force of the blow, that hilt followed blade into the
wound, stuck deep in the fat; and thereupon the bowels discharged their
load.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Good care Aod took to secure lock and bolt behind him;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` then he made his escape by a postern door.When the king’s servants
came and found locked doors they thought he was easing himself, like
enough, there in his summer retreat.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But at last, ashamed of waiting, they brought a key to open it, and
there was their master stretched on the ground dead.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` In the confusion, Aod escaped; he made his way back to the Carved
Rocks, and thence to Seirath.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` There, on the slopes of Ephraim, he blew his horn, and the men of
Israel came down from the hills with Aod at their head
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` crying out, Follow me, the Lord has granted us victory over the
Moabite invader. Down they went at his heels, and seized the ford
across Jordan that leads to Moab. Not a man did they allow to cross,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` but slew, that day, some ten thousand Moabite warriors, cut off
from all hope of escape.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus Israel brought Moab to the dust, and for eighty years the land
was at peace.
