"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now turn we to the days of Assuerus,✻ that was lord of a hundred and
twenty-seven provinces, from India on this side to Ethiopia on that,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and was firmly established on the throne of his kingdom, with the
city of Susan for his capital.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It was now the third year of his reign, and he held high feast for
all his lords and vassals; Persian warriors, Median notables, and the
governor of every province, were his guests.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` All should have proof of his royal splendour, of the power and pride
that were his; and long they kept holiday, for a hundred and eighty
days together.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when the festivity drew to an end, he would entertain all the
folk of Susan, high and low; for a whole week a banquet was spread for
them at the gates of his garden, amid trees planted by art at the royal
bidding.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` On every side, fastened by ivory rings to marble columns, hung
canopies, some white, some flaxen, some violet, with cords of fine
linen and purple thread; couches of gold and silver were set here and
there on a floor of malachite and marble, wondrously patterned.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` From golden cups they drank, and the very trenchers on which the
meat was served were ever of new design. Wine they had in plenty, and
of rare vintage, as befitted a king’s state;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` nor was any man compelled to drink; the king had set one of his
nobles at the head of each table, bidding him see that each man drank
as drink he would.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For the women the queen, Vasthi, held a banquet too, in Assuerus’
own palace.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The seventh day had come; the king’s heart was merry, warmed by
long draughts of wine; and now he had an errand for the seven
chamberlains that waited on him, Maumam, Bazatha, Harbona, Bagatha,
Abgatha, Zethar and Charchas.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` They were to bring queen Vasthi into the king’s presence, wearing
the royal crown, so that he might display her person to the rabble as
well as to his lords; hers was no common beauty.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Vain was the royal summons the chamberlains brought her; she would
not come. Whereupon the king broke out into a great passion of rage,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and was fain to take counsel of the wise men that were ever about
his person, after the fashion of courts; theirs was still the advice he
followed, theirs the knowledge of ancient law and precedent.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` (The chief of them, and the nearest to his person, were Charsena,
Sethar, Admatha, Tharsis, Mares, Marsana and Mamuchan; these seven
princes of Persia and Media attended on him always, and had places next
himself.)
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What sentence should he pass on queen Vasthi, to whom he, king
Assuerus, had sent a summons through his chamberlains, and in vain?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thereupon, in the hearing of the king and his nobles, Mamuchan thus
spoke: Queen Vasthi has put a slight, not upon the king’s grace only,
but on all men, high and low, in his dominions.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` All our women-folk will hear what she has done, and all will set
their husbands at defiance, reminding them how king Assuerus sent for
queen Vasthi, and she would not come.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Not a wife in Persia or Media but will disobey her husband more
lightly for this example; the king has good reason to be angry.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So please thee, let an edict go out in thy name, by the laws of
Persia and Media irrevocable, forbidding Vasthi ever to come into the
royal presence again. Let the crown pass to some head worthier than
hers.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` In all the broad lands under thy domain let this decree be
published; so to all husbands, high and low, their wives shall pay due
honour henceforward.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` King and nobles liked the plan well, and the king did as Mamuchan
had advised,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` sent a letter to each nation in the tongue it spoke, the characters
it used, decreeing that a man should be lord and master in his own
house, and the whole world must take note of it.✻
