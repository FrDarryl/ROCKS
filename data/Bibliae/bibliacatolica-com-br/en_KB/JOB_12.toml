Notas de rodapé:

possesses wisdom and understanding. This reaction highlights the
struggle for dignity amid suffering and the need to be heard (see also
12:4-6 - Job observes that the wicked prosper, challenging the
assumption that justice always manifests itself in this life. This
observation reflects the complexity of suffering and the apparent
prosperity of the wicked, a recurring theme in Scripture (see also
12:7-10 - Job invites his friends to learn from creation, emphasizing

12:11-13 - The statement that the ears evaluate words as the palate

search for truth requires attention and reflection, especially in
5:14).
12:14-25 - Job declares that God is the sovereign One who has control
over all things, including the destruction of the wicked. This
affirmation of divine sovereignty is a reminder of the unshakable faith
