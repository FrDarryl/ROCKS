"2" = ''':sup:`2` Listen, you heavens, and let earth attend to this, a divine
remonstrance; my own sons, that I reared and brought to manhood, hold
me in defiance!

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Ox recognizes its owner, ass knows the way to its master’s crib; and
I? I go unacknowledged; my own people of Israel gives me never a
thought.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Woe to a sinful nation, a people bowed with guilt, a rebellious
race, a brood foully degenerate! They have forsaken God, they have
spurned the Holy One of Israel, turned strangers to me.

before your eyes by strangers, desolation everywhere, as if an enemy

"11" = ''':sup:`11` What do I care, the Lord says, how you multiply those victims of
yours? I have had enough and to spare. Burnt-offerings of rams, and the
fat of stall-fed beasts, and the blood of calves and lambs and goats

courts bringing worship such as yours?

taste,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` thy law-givers wanting loyalty, so that they make common cause with

Notas de rodapé:
