"1" = ''':sup:`1` Senseless Galatians, who is it that has cast a spell on you, that
you should refuse your loyalty to the truth, you, before whom Jesus
Christ has been exposed to view on his cross?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Let me be content with asking you one question, Was it from
observance of the law that the Spirit came to you, or from obeying the
call of faith?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Are you so far out of your right senses? You dedicated your first
beginnings to the spirit; and can you now find your completion in
outward things?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Was it to no purpose that you went through so much? Since it seems
it was to no purpose.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When God lavishes his Spirit on you and enables you to perform
miracles, what is the reason for it? Your observance of the law, or
your obedience to the call of faith?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Remember how Abraham put his faith in God, and it was reckoned
virtue in him.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` You must recognize, then, that Abraham’s real children are the
children of his faith.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` There is a passage in scripture which, long beforehand, brings to
Abraham the good news, Through thee all the nations shall be blessed;
and that passage looks forward to God’s justification of the Gentiles
by faith.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It is those, then, who take their stand on faith that share the
blessing Abraham’s faithfulness won.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Those who take their stand on observance of the law are all under a
curse; Cursed be everyone (we read) who does not persist in carrying
out all that this book of the law prescribes.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And indeed, that the law cannot make a man acceptable to God is
clear enough; It is faith, we are told, that brings life to the just
man;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` whereas the law does not depend on faith; no, we are told it is the
man who carries out the commandments that will find life in them.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` From this curse invoked by the law Christ has ransomed us, by
himself becoming, for our sakes, an accursed thing; we read that, There
is a curse on the man who hangs on a gibbet.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thus, in Christ Jesus, the blessing of Abraham was to be imparted
to the Gentiles, so that we, through faith, might receive the promised
gift of the Spirit.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Brethren, let me take an argument from common life. A valid legal
disposition made by an ordinary human being cannot afterwards be set
aside; no one can make fresh provisions in it.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The promises you know of were made to Abraham and his offspring;
(it does not, by the way, say, To thy descendants, as if it meant a
number of people; it says, To thy offspring, in the singular, meaning
Christ).✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And this is my contention; the law, coming into being four hundred
and thirty years afterwards, cannot unmake the disposition which God
made so long ago, and cancel the promise.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` If our inheritance depends on observing the law, then it is not the
inheritance secured to us by promise; that was promised to Abraham as a
free gift.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` What, then, is the purpose of the law? It was brought in to make
room for transgression, while we waited for the coming of that
posterity, to whom the promise had been made. Its terms were dictated
by angels, acting through a spokesman;✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` (a spokesman represents more than one, and there is only one God).
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Is the law an infringement, then, of God’s promises? That is not to
be thought of. Doubtless, if a law had been given that was capable of
imparting life to us, it would have been for the law to bring us
justification.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But in fact scripture represents us as all under the bondage of
sin; it was faith in Jesus Christ that was to impart the promised
blessing to all those who believe in him.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Until faith came, we were all being kept in bondage to the law,
waiting for the faith that was one day to be revealed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So that the law was our tutor, bringing us to Christ, to find in
faith our justification.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When faith comes, then we are no longer under the rule of a tutor;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` through faith in Christ Jesus you are all now God’s sons.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` All you who have been baptized in Christ’s name have put on the
person of Christ;✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` no more Jew or Gentile, no more slave and freeman, no more male and
female; you are all one person in Jesus Christ.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And if you belong to Christ, then you are indeed Abraham’s
children; the promised inheritance is yours.

Notas de rodapé:
3:1-3 - Paul rebukes the Galatians for straying from the genuine gospel
and leaning back on the flesh instead of living by the Spirit. This
highlights the importance of living in the freedom that Christ won (see
3:6-9 - Paul compares Abraham's faith to the Christian faith, showing
that believers are Abraham's children. Justification by faith is a
continuation of the promise made to Abraham, connecting the Old
3:10-12 - Paul explains that those who rely on observing the law are
under a curse, because the law demands perfect obedience. Justification
comes by faith, not by adherence to the works of the law (see also
3:13-14 - Christ became a curse for us to redeem us from the curse of
the law, and through him we receive the promise of the Spirit. This
verse emphasizes the redemptive character of Christ's work (see also
3:23-25 - Paul speaks of the law as a tutor, leading us to Christ. The
law had a temporary purpose until Christ was revealed, and now we live
