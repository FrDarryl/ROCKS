"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a time when Abraham made his way from there into the
southern country, first settling down between Cades and Sur, then
living as a wanderer in Gerara.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And of his wife Sara he gave out, She is my sister; whereupon
Abimelech, king of Gerara, sent and took her for himself.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But God visited Abimelech in a dream by night, and told him, Thy
life is forfeit, on account of this woman thou hast taken for thyself;
she is wedded to a husband.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Abimelech, as yet, had had no intercourse with her. What, Lord, he
said, must a nation perish that has done no wrong, except through
ignorance?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Did he not tell me himself, She is my sister? And she, did not she
herself claim him as her brother? My conscience has been clear, my
actions honourable, in all I have done.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And God said to him, I know that thou hast acted with a clear
conscience; that is why I preserved thee from sinning against me, and
would not let thee have intercourse with her.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But now thou must give her back to her husband; he is a prophet, and
will intercede for thy life; if thou dost not restore her, I give thee
good warning, thou and thine must perish.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So Abimelech rose up at once before dawn of day, and summoned the
whole company of his servants to let them hear all this; whereupon they
were all overcome with terror.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Abimelech sent for Abraham too, and asked him, What is this
trick thou hast played on us? What wrong have we done thee, that thou
shouldst involve me and my kingdom in such guilt? Thou hast treated us
amiss.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And still he plied him with reproaches; What was in thy mind, that
thou shouldst act thus?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I thought to myself, answered Abraham, This may be a place where
they have no fear of God, and then they will kill me on my wife’s
account.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Besides, she is indeed my sister, on the father’s side but not on
the mother’s, though she is none the less my wedded wife.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When God bade me leave my father’s house and go on my travels, I
said to her, Do me this kindness; give it out, wherever we go, that I
am thy brother.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So Abimelech made Abraham a present, of sheep and oxen, of men and
maid servants, and gave his wife Sara back to him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Here is my land, he said, at your disposal, dwell where thou wilt.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And to Sara he added, See, I am giving this brother of thine a
thousand silver pieces; such amends will enable thee to look the world
in the face, wherever thou goest;✻ only, do not forget that thy
pretence was discovered.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And now, at Abraham’s intercession, God restored health to
Abimelech, to his wife and to his servant women;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` up to now, on account of Abraham’s wife Sara, the Lord had made all
Abimelech’s household barren.

Abimelech, showing that God cares for His plans and protects those who

121:7-8).
20:8-10 - Abimelech confronts Abraham about lying and dishonesty. This
passage highlights the importance of integrity and truth in
20:11-13 - Abraham explains his action, revealing his fear of losing
his life. This narrative shows how fear can lead to reckless decisions,
20:14-18 - Abimelech returns Sarah to Abraham and offers gifts. God is

story emphasizes divine grace at work in the midst of sin and
