[22]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` The peace between Syria and Israel lasted three years.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In the third year, during a visit from king Josaphat, of Juda,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` the king of Israel said to his courtiers, Here is Ramoth-Galaad, a
city (as you all know) that belongs to us; and yet we leave it in the
king of Syria’s hands!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then he turned to Josaphat and asked, Shall I have thy aid in
attacking Ramoth-Galaad?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Why, said he, thou and I are at one; my army, my horses, they are
all thine. But Josaphat would have Achab consult the Lord first.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Achab sent for his prophets, some four hundred in number, and
asked whether he should attack Ramoth-Galaad or let it be? Go to the
attack, they said; the Lord means to make the king’s grace master of
it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But still Josaphat asked whether there was no prophet of the Lord to
be found, so that they could make enquiry through him.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Why yes, the king of Israel told him, there is one man through whom
we might ask for the Lord’s counsel, Michaeas the son of Jemla, yet is
he no friend of mine; still he will be prophesying that ill fortune is
to befall me, never good. Nay, my lord king, said Josaphat, think
better of it.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So Achab summoned one of his chamberlains, and bade him fetch
Michaeas the son of Jemla with all speed.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` There sat the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda, each on his
throne, in all their royal state, in an open space by the gate of
Samaria; and there in their presence all the prophets said their say.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` One of them, Sedecias the son of Chanaana, had provided himself
with a pair of horns fashioned in iron; With these, he said, thou shalt
toss Syria about, till thou hast made an end of it.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And all the prophets had the same word for him; Go and attack
Ramoth-Galaad, they told him, and a blessing on thy journey! The Lord
means to make the king’s grace master of it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So the messenger who went to summon Michaeas told him, Here are all
the prophets bidding the king good speed, like one man; do thou join
thy voice to theirs, and prophesy good fortune.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Nay, said Michaeas, as the Lord is a living God, the word I speak
shall be the word he gives me.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So he came into the king’s presence, and when he was asked whether
it were better to attack Ramoth-Galaad, or to let it be, he answered,
Go to the attack, and a blessing on thy journey! The Lord means to make
the king’s grace master of it.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` What! cried Achab, must I never cease adjuring thee in the Lord’s
name to tell me only the truth?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Listen then, said he; I had a vision of all Israel as sheep, that
strayed because they had no shepherd, and the Lord’s word came, They
have no master now; let them disperse to their home in peace.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` (It is as I told thee, Achab said to Josaphat; still he prophesies
ill fortune, never good.)
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Michaeas went on, Here is a message to thee from the Lord. I
had a vision of the Lord sitting on his throne, with all the host of
heaven waiting on his pleasure, to right and left.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the Lord said, Who is to beguile Achab, king of Israel, so that
he will march to Ramoth-Galaad, and there meet his fall? One said this,
one that;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` till at last a spirit came forward and stood in the Lord’s
presence, offering to beguile Achab. And how wilt thou beguile him? the
Lord asked.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` I will go abroad, said he, and on the lips of all his prophets I
will make myself an influence to deceive. Deceive them thou shalt, the
Lord said, and have thy way with them; go abroad, then, and carry out
thy errand.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And now, see what a lying influence the Lord has spread among these
prophets of thine! For indeed the Lord has determined on thy ruin.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` At that, Sedecias son of Chanaana went up and gave Michaeas a blow
on the cheek; Has the spirit of the Lord passed me by, he asked, and
spoken to none but thee?✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Michaeas only answered, Thou shalt live to see the day when
thou must needs take refuge in an inner room, to hide there.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then the king of Israel said, Take Michaeas hence, and put him in
the charge of Amon, the city governor, and of Joas, son of Amelech.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And give them this royal command of mine, that they are to imprison
him, and give him scant allowance of food and drink till I come back
safe and sound.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Come thou back safe and sound, Michaeas said, and mine was no
message from the Lord. Witness my words, all you that stand here!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` So the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, marched out to
attack Ramoth-Galaad.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Achab would have Josaphat go to battle in full armour and all
his royal array, while he himself went to battle in disguise.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Meanwhile, to all the thirty-two commanders who now marshalled his
chariots, the king of Syria had given the same orders: Press for no
other mark, high or low, but the king of Israel himself.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And these, upon sight of Josaphat, supposed that they had the king
of Israel here; it was against him, then, that they directed their
onslaught;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` but when he cried aloud, they knew that this was not the king of
Israel, and so let him be.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` It was an archer who bent his bow and let fly a shaft at haphazard
that gave Achab a chance wound; it fell between lungs and gullet, and
Achab bade his charioteer wheel about, and carry him away from the
fight, so grievous his wound was.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` All that day the battle raged, and still the king of Israel stood
upright in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and did not die till
evening, though the blood from his wound flowed ever into the body of
his chariot.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then, before sunset, a herald raised a cry all through the ranks,
bidding every man return to his own region and city.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` So the king died, and was carried back to Samaria, where they
buried him;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and there the dogs licked his blood, for they washed his chariot
and his chariot-reins in the pool at Samaria; and so the threat which
the Lord had uttered was fulfilled.✻
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` What else Achab did, all his history, and the record of the ivory
palace he raised and the cities he built, is to be found in the Annals
of the kings of Israel.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Achab, then, was laid to rest with his fathers, and the throne
passed to his son Ochozias.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` This Josaphat, son of Asa, had become king of Juda in the fourth
year of Achab;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` he was thirty-five years old when he came to the throne, and his
reign in Jerusalem lasted twenty-five years. His mother’s name was
Azuba, daughter of Salai.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He followed the example of his father Asa, and never swerved aside
from the Lord’s will;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` though indeed he did not abolish the hill-shrines; men still
offered sacrifice and incense on the mountain-tops.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` With the king of Israel, he lived on terms of peace.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` What else Josaphat did, the record of his high exploits and of the
battles he fought, is to be found in the Annals of the kings of Juda.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` He it was that rid the land of all the shrine-prostitutes his
father Asa had left.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Since there was no king in Edom at this time to bar his way,
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Josaphat would build a fleet in the southern sea to sail out and
fetch gold from Ophir, but sail they might not, for they were all
wrecked, there at Asion-Gaber.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` (Achab’s son Ochozias had requested at this time that mariners from
his own country might sail with Josaphat’s, but Josaphat would not
consent.)
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` So Josaphat was laid to rest with his fathers, with the Keep of his
ancestor David for his resting-place, and the throne passed to his son
Joram.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Ochozias, son of Achab, was crowned king of Israel at Samaria in
the seventeenth year of Josaphat, and his reign over Israel lasted two
years.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` He defied the Lord’s will, following the example of his own father
and mother, and of Jeroboam, that taught Israel to sin.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` To Baal’s service he gave himself and Baal’s worship, and earned,
as his father had earned, the displeasure of the Lord God of Israel.

Notas de rodapé:
22:5-9 - Before going to war against Ramoth-gilead, Jehoshaphat, king
of Judah, asks Ahab to inquire of the word of the Lord. Micaiah, the
true prophet of God, is called, highlighting the importance of seeking
divine guidance before making significant decisions (see also
22:15-18 - Micaiah prophesies Israel's defeat, but Ahab rejects his
message and chooses to follow false prophets. This demonstrates how
refusing to listen to God's truth can lead to destruction (see also
22:19-23 - Micaiah reveals the vision of the heavenly council, where a
lying spirit is sent to deceive Ahab. This vision illustrates God's
sovereign control over all events and God's permissiveness in the face
Thessalonians 2:11-12).
22:29-34 - Despite his precautions, Ahab is mortally wounded in battle,
fulfilling Micaiah's prophecy. This shows that human plans cannot
thwart God's purposes, and God's word always comes true (see also
22:37-40 - Ahab's death and the judgment upon his house are fulfilled
according to the word of the Lord. His reign is marked by idolatry and
disobedience, and his death brings to mind the consequences of sin (see
