"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Solomon had finished building temple and palace, and achieved
all his purpose,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` the Lord appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him
once at Gabaon.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I have listened to thy prayer, the Lord told him, to the suit thou
hast preferred before me; and this temple thou hast built I myself have
hallowed, to be the everlasting shrine of my name; never a day but my
eyes shall be watching, my heart attentive here.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Do thou guide thy steps, like thy father, as in my presence, with an
undivided heart and steadfastly; do thou fulfil all that I command,
hold true to my observances and my decrees;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and I will grant to thy line dominion over Israel eternally. Such
was my promise to thy father David, that he should always have an heir
to sit on the throne of Israel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But if you and your children are content to turn your backs on me,
following me no more, neglecting the commands and observances I have
enjoined on you, betaking yourselves to the service and worship of
alien gods,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` then I will sweep Israel away from the land I gave them, and this
temple which I have hallowed as the shrine of my name, shall be thrust
away out of my sight. Israel shall become a proverb and a by-word among
all the nations,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and this house shall be the monument of its fall. The passer-by will
stand wondering, and hiss in derision; What means it, he will ask, that
the Lord has treated this land, this house so cruelly?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the answer will come, Because they forsook the Lord their God,
who rescued their fathers from the land of Egypt, and betook themselves
to the worship and service of alien gods; that is why the Lord brought
all this ruin upon them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It was twenty years after Solomon had finished the two buildings,
temple and palace,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` that Hiram, king of Tyre, who had sent him the cedar and the
fir-wood and the gold he needed for his undertaking, received twenty
townships from him, belonging to the land of Galilee.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And when he came on a visit from Tyre to see the townships Solomon
had allotted to him, he liked them but little;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What, brother, he cried, were these the only cities thou couldst
spare me? And he gave that region the name of Chabul,✻ which it bears
to this day.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It was twenty thousand talents’ weight of gold that Hiram sent to
king Solomon.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` As for the reasons why king Solomon made such heavy disbursements,
they were these; he must build the temple, and the palace, and Mello,
and Jerusalem wall, and Heser, and Mageddo, and Gazer.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Gazer had been taken and burnt by the invading army of Pharao, king
of Egypt; its inhabitants, who were Chanaanites, he put to the sword,
and later gave it by way of dowry when his daughter married king
Solomon.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It was for Solomon, therefore, to rebuild it,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` together with Lower Bethoron, and Baalath, and Palmyra out in the
desert.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And in general he fortified the unwalled towns in his dominions; he
must have cities, too, in which his chariots and horsemen could be
quartered. Much else, too, he had the whim to build in Jerusalem, and
on Lebanon, and in all parts of his kingdom.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` (Many of the former inhabitants still remained, not of Israelite
stock, Amorrhites, Hethites, Pherezites, Hevites, and Jebusites;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and these descendants of the races which Israel could never
exterminate, king Solomon made into bondservants, as they are to this
day.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Among the Israelites, he would make no man his slave; it was from
these that he drew his warriors and his courtiers, his princes and his
captains, the commanders of his chariots and horsemen.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Five hundred and fifty overseers king Solomon had, to hold the
people to their appointed tasks.)
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And no sooner had Pharao’s daughter removed from the Keep of David
to her new palace, than Solomon set about building up Mello.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Three times a year Solomon offered burnt-sacrifice and
welcome-offerings on the altar he had made in the Lord’s honour, and
burned incense in the Lord’s presence; and he kept the temple in
repair.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` King Solomon also built a fleet at Asion-Gaber, near Ailath on the
shore of the Red Sea, in the territory of Edom.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` In this fleet, Hiram sent men of his own, mariners that had long
experience of the sea, to serve with king Solomon’s men.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` They sailed as far as Ophir, and thence brought back to Solomon
four hundred and twenty talents’ weight of gold.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
9:1-3 - God appears to Solomon for the second time after the completion
of the Temple and the palace. He reaffirms His covenant, promising
blessings if Solomon and the people are obedient, but also warning of
the consequences of disobedience. God's faithfulness to His promises
9:4-5 - God promises Solomon that if he and his descendants walk before
Him with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David did, there will
always be a descendant on the throne of Israel. The importance of
obedience to the covenant is central to the prosperity of the kingdom
9:6-9 - God warns that if the people of Israel stray and worship other
gods, the Temple will be destroyed and Israel will become a disgrace
among the nations. This warning illustrates the conditional nature of
God's blessing, depending on the people's faithfulness (see also
9:10-14 - Solomon gives twenty cities in Galilee to Hiram, king of
Tyre, in exchange for his help in building the Temple. However, Hiram
is not pleased with the cities. This episode reflects the diplomatic
aspects of Solomon's reign and his complex political alliances (see
9:26-28 - Solomon establishes a fleet at Ezion Geber, which brings
great wealth to Israel. Solomon's naval success demonstrates his
commercial and economic dominance, strengthening the kingdom through
72:10).
