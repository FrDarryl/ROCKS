"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was his youngest son, Ochozias, that the citizens of Jerusalem
made king in his place. All his elder brothers had been killed by Arab
freebooters, that fell on the camp where they were lodged; and so
Ochozias became Joram’s heir, and reigned in Juda.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When he came to the throne, he had lived (twice) a score of years
and two,✻ and his reign at Jerusalem lasted but a year. His mother’s
name was Athalia, descended from Amri.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He too followed the example of Achab’s line, his mother prompting
him to impious deeds.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Little wonder if he defied the Lord’s will no less than Achab’s
race, since these were his counsellors, to his undoing, after his
father died.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He shared, too, their designs, and marched with the king of Israel,
Joram that was son to Achab, against Hazael, king of Syria. They met at
Ramoth-Galaad, and there Joram was wounded by the Syrians,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` so that he must go back to Jezrahel to recover; wounds a many he had
received in the battle we speak of. And when Joram, son of Achab, lay
sick at Jezrahel, Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda came there to
visit him.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It was the divine will, for Ochozias’ punishment, that he should pay
Joram this visit, and with him should offer battle to Jehu, son of
Namsi, whom the Lord had anointed king to make an end of Achab’s line.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Jehu it was that fell in with the princes of Juda, sons of Ochozias’
kinsmen and courtiers of his, and slew them, at the time when he was
exterminating the line of Achab;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Jehu it was that made enquiry after Ochozias himself, who was found
still hiding in the kingdom of Samaria, and so brought before him and
slain. Yet he was given burial; was he not descended from king
Josaphat, a king who had set his whole heart on following the Lord?✻
Little hope there seemed then of Juda being governed any longer by
Ochozias’ kindred.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The more so because his mother, Athalia, no sooner heard the news
of her son’s death, than she set about exterminating all the blood
royal of Joram’s dynasty.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Only Joas, Ochozias’ son, was rescued by the princess Josabeth, who
stole him away while all the other princes were being slain, and hid
him, with his nurse, in the room where the bedding was stored up. This
Josabeth, who hid him, was a daughter of king Joram’s, sister to
Ochozias and wife to the high priest Joiada. Joas, then, escaped murder
at Athalia’s hands,

in the house of God.

Notas de rodapé:
22:1-4 - Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, reigns in Judah and follows the evil
ways of his mother Athaliah and father. Family influence is a
significant theme, showing how idolatrous practices can be passed down
13:22).
22:5-7 - Ahaziah allies with Jehoram, king of Israel, to fight Hazael
of Syria, demonstrating his pursuit of alliances that distance himself
from dependence on God. This alliance leads to his death, highlighting
the futility of trusting in human alliances rather than in God (see
22:8-9 - Ahaziah is killed during the battle, and his mother Athaliah
takes the throne. This transition of power highlights how corruption
can be perpetuated through wicked leaders and the importance of
34:2).
22:10-12 - Athaliah seeks to destroy the royal line, but Joash, son of
Ahaziah, is hidden and saved. This illustrates God’s providence in
preserving the faithful remnant, even in times of persecution (see also
22:13-15 - Athaliah's role as ruler is marked by idolatry and
corruption, representing a contrast to godly principles. Her reign
