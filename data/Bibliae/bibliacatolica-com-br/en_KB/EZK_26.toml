"1" = ''':sup:`1` In king Sedecias’ eleventh year, on the first day of the … month,
word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, what was the cry of Tyre over Jerusalem? Joy, joy, the
toll-gate✻ of the world has been broken down! It is mine now; I shall
grow fat on Jerusalem’s ruin!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This doom the Lord God pronounces: Have at thee, Tyre! I mean to
bring hordes of nations marching on thee, like wave upon wave of the
sea.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Walls of Tyre they shall break down, and towers of her overthrow;
all the soil I will scrape away from her, and leave her bare rock,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` doom her to be but an island where fisher-folk dry their nets; I,
the Lord God, will give her over as a prey to all the nations.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Daughter-towns that stand in her territory shall be put to the
sword, and learn my power at last.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Here is Nabuchodonosor of Babylon, the Lord says, a king that has
kings for his vassals, marching from the north with horse and chariot,
with his knights and all his retinue, a great army of men,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` to put thy daughter-towns to the sword, compass thee with
siege-works and raise a mound about thee. A barrier of shields he will
raise under thy walls,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` ply engine and battering-ram against them, and bring down thy towers
with grappling-irons.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Of horses such a company, as shall cover thee all with dust; with
cries of horsemen and rattle of chariot-wheels entering thy gates, thy
walls shall ring again like the walls of a breached city.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Never a street of thine but must echo with hoofs; butchered thy
citizens shall be, thy fair pillars cast down,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` thy wealth plundered, thy merchandise taken for spoil. Down shall
come walls, palaces totter in ruins; stone and timber and mortar of
thine shall strew the seas.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Hushed the murmur of thy songs; never more the sound of harp shall
be heard in thee.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Bare rock thou shalt be, for fisher-folk to dry their nets on;
there shall be no building thee again, says the Lord God.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` This too: The very isles shall echo with the crash of thy fall,
ring with the cries of the wounded dying in thy streets.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Down from their thrones they shall come, all the lords of the
sea-harbours, throw robe aside, broidered coats lay down; wrapped in
dismay they sit on the bare ground, at the sudden fall of thee
bewildered and amazed.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And thus they shall sing thy dirge: What a doom was thine,
sea-built city, far renowned! Mistress of the seas, mother of a race
that all held in dread!
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Day of terror, that affrights the very ships, fills the islands
with alarm, to see no ships leave thy harbour now!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This too: Desolate thou shalt be, thy place among the lost cities;
higher and higher yet the fathomless ocean shall rise about thee,
swallowing thee up under its waters.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Among the dead thy place is, that go down into the grave, where
time is not; entombed with those other ruined cities in the depths of
earth, tenanted no longer. The living world shall see the glory of my
presence,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but thou shalt have no part in it, thou shalt no longer be; who
searches for thee will search evermore in vain, says the Lord God.✻

Notas de rodapé:
26:1-6 - The prophecy against Tyre foretells the destruction of the
port city because of its arrogance and its celebration of the fall of
Jerusalem. Tyre is punished for its confidence in its wealth and
26:7-14 - God describes how Tyre will be besieged and destroyed by
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. The fall of Tyre symbolizes the fall
of nations that trust in their power and wealth, without recognizing
26:15-18 - The destruction of Tyre is portrayed as a tragedy that will
be felt by all nations. This emphasizes that God's judgment is not
limited to Israel, but extends to all nations that reject His authority
