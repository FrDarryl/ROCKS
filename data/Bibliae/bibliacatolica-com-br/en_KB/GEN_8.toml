cattle that went with him in the Ark; so he set a wind stirring over
the earth, and with that, the waters abated.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` The springs of the great depth closed up again; so, too, did the
flood-gates of heaven, and rain fell from heaven no longer;

"3" = ''':sup:`3` more and more the waters receded from the land, beginning to abate,
now that the hundred and fifty days were over.

came to rest upon the mountains of Armenia.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Inch by inch the waters abated, until the tenth month came; on the
first day of the tenth month, the hill tops began to shew.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Noe let forty days pass, and then undid the window he had made in
the Ark, and sent out one of the ravens,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` which went this way and that, and had not come back to him when the
waters dried up over the earth.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then to make sure whether the waters had become shallow over all the
surface of the ground, he sent out one of the doves.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But the dove came back to the Ark and its master, finding never a
resting-place to perch on; and he put out his hand to catch it, and
took it back into the Ark.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Seven days more he waited, and then sent the dove out from the Ark
again;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` this time, it came back to him at night-fall, with a twig of olive
in its mouth, the leaves still green on it; and then Noe could not
doubt that the waters had become shallow all over the ground.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` But still he waited another seven days, and now, when he sent it
out, it came back to him no more.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` It was the first day of the first month of his six hundred and
first year when the waters ebbed away from the land, and Noe,
withdrawing the covering of the Ark, looked round him and found that
the whole surface of the ground was clear.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And by the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the land itself
was dry.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then God’s word came to Noe,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` telling him, Come out of the Ark, with thy wife and thy sons and
their wives.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Bring out with thee all the living creatures thou hast there, of
all kinds, birds and beasts and creeping things that creep on the
earth; occupy this earth, increase and multiply upon it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So Noe came out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with
him;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and the living creatures came out of the Ark, beasts and all
creeping things that roam on the earth, in all their various kinds.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Thereupon Noe built an altar to the Lord, and chose out beasts that
were clean and birds that were clean, and made burnt-offerings there.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the Lord, smelling such a scent as pleased him, made the
resolve, Never again will I plague the earth on man’s account, that has
all the thoughts and imaginations of his heart, even in youth, so bent
towards evil; never again will I send affliction such as this upon all
living creatures.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` While the earth stands, seed-time and harvest, cold and heat,
summer and winter, day and night shall keep their course unaltered.
