"1" = ''':sup:`1` Am I not free to do as I will? Am I not an apostle, have I not seen
our Lord Jesus Christ? Are not you yourselves my achievement in the
Lord?✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` To others I may not be an apostle, but to you at least I am; why,
you are the sign-manual of my apostleship in the Lord.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This is the answer I make to those who call me in question.✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Have we not a right to be provided with food and drink;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` nay, have we not the right to travel about with a woman who is a
sister, as the other apostles do, as the Lord’s brethren do, and
Cephas?✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Must I and Barnabas, alone among them, be forbidden to do as much?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why, what soldier ever fought at his own expense? Who would plant a
vineyard, and not live on its fruits, or tend a flock, and not live on
the milk which the flock yields?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This is not a plea of man’s invention; the law declares it.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When we read in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treads out the corn, must we suppose that God is making provision for
oxen?✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Is it not clear that he says it for our sakes? For our sakes it was
laid down that the ploughman has a right to plough, and the thrasher to
thrash, with the expectation of sharing in the crop.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Here are we, who have sown in you a spiritual harvest; is it much
to ask, that we should reap from you a temporal harvest in return?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` If others claim a share of such rights over you, have not we a
better claim still? And yet we have never availed ourselves of those
rights; we bear every hardship, sooner than hinder the preaching of
Christ’s gospel.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` You know, surely, that those who do the temple’s work live on the
temple’s revenues; that those who preside at the altar share the
altar’s offerings.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And so it is that the Lord has bidden the heralds of the gospel
live by preaching the gospel.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Yet I have not availed myself of any such right.I am not writing
thus in the hope of being treated otherwise; I would rather die than
have this boast taken from me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When I preach the gospel, I take no credit for that; I act under
constraint; it would go hard with me indeed if I did not preach the
gospel.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I can claim a reward for what I do of my own choice; but when I act
under constraint, I am only executing a commission.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` What title have I, then, to a reward? Why, that when I preach the
gospel I should preach the gospel free of charge, not making full use
of the rights which gospel preaching gives me.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Thus nobody has any claim on me, and yet I have made myself
everybody’s slave, to win more souls.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` With the Jews I lived like a Jew, to win the Jews;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` with those who keep the law, as one who keeps the law (though the
law had no claim on me), to win those who kept the law; with those who
are free of the law, like one free of the law (not that I disowned all
divine law, but it was the law of Christ that bound me), to win those
who were free of the law.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` With the scrupulous, I behaved myself like one who is scrupulous,
to win the scrupulous. I have been everything by turns to everybody, to
bring everybody salvation.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` All that I do, I do for the sake of the gospel promises, to win
myself a share in them.✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` You know well enough that when men run in a race, the race is for
all, but the prize for one; run, then, for victory.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Every athlete must keep all his appetites under control; and he
does it to win a crown that fades, whereas ours is imperishable.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So I do not run my course like a man in doubt of his goal; I do not
fight my battle like a man who wastes his blows on the air.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` I buffet my own body, and make it my slave; or I, who have preached
to others, may myself be rejected as worthless.✻
