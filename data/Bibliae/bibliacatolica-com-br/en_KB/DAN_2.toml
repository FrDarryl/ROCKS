"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the second year of his reign,✻Nabuchodonosor had a dream; and his
mind, between sleep and waking, was all distraught.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Diviner and sage, soothsayer and astrologer must be summoned without
more ado, to pronounce on the royal dream;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and when they were admitted to his presence, he said to them, I have
had a dream, but my mind is so distraught, I cannot tell what it was.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the astrologers gave him answer. IN ARAMAIC✻ Long life to the
king’s grace! Be pleased to tell us what the dream was, and it shall be
interpreted.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Why, said the king, I know no more than this; dream and
interpretation both you must needs tell me, or else your lives must be
forfeit, and your houses put to public use.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Gifts and great honour shall be your reward, if you will but tell me
both. Come now, what dreamt I, and what meant my dream?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Once again they demurred; would the king be pleased to recount his
dream to them, interpreted it should be forthwith.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Nay, said the king, I see how it is, you are trying shifts with me.
You know well there is but one way to it;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` dream of mine or doom of yours it must be. Some lying story you have
ready, that will suit your turn; how shall I know your interpretation
is right, if you cannot tell me what dream I saw?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Nay, said they, never a man on earth could do what the king’s grace
asks. Princes and great rulers there have been a many, but none of them
yet, from diviner, sage or astrologer, expected so much!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Here is riddle indeed thou wouldst have us read for thee, lord
king; where is counsellor can tell thee the secret? Unless it were the
gods only, and they walk not with men.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` At this, the king was in such a taking of fury that he would have
all the wise men of Babylon put to death;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and, once the warrant was out for the extinction of them, there was
hue and cry against Daniel and his fellows.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Arioch it was, the captain of the king’s guard, that was
commissioned to rid Babylon of all its wise men, and from him Daniel
would have the why and wherefore of it;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` here was cruel work committed to him; what moved the king’s grace
to be so absolute? And, when Arioch had made all clear to him,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` into the king’s presence he went, asking for more time to answer
the royal question.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So, returning to his fellows, Ananias, Misael and Azarias, he made
all known to them,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and would have them cry out upon the God of heaven for better
knowledge of his secret, without which both he and they should perish
in the general massacre of the wise men.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then, in a vision by night, the secret was revealed to Daniel, and
he fell to praising the God of heaven,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` with such words as these: Blessed be the Lord’s name from the
beginning to the end of time; his are the wisdom and the power;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` change and chance of our mortal life he rules, crowns one man and
discrowns another. Wisdom of the wise, skill of the skilful, what are
they but his gift?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The hidden depths he can lay bare, read the secrets of the dark;
does not light dwell with him?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` God of our fathers, I give thee thanks and praise for thus
enabling, thus enlightening me; for prayer answered, doubt resolved,
and the king’s thought revealed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` With that, he betook himself to Arioch, that was to slay the wise
men, and made suit to him, slay the wise men he should not. Thou hast
but to take me into the king’s presence, said he, and the riddle shall
be read.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Without more ado, Arioch granted his request; here was an exile
from Juda, he said, that would answer the royal question.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Is this true? the king asked of Daniel. Canst thou, Baltassar, tell
me the dream and its meaning both?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Daniel spoke out in the royal presence, Never wizard or sage,
never diviner or prophet, that can give the king’s grace an answer!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But there is a God in heaven, king Nabuchodonosor, that makes
hidden things plain; he it is that has sent thee warning of what must
befall long hence. Let me tell thee what thy dream was, what visions
disturbed thy sleep.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` As thou wast lying there abed, my lord king, thy thoughts still
turned on future times; and he that makes hidden things plain revealed
to thee what the pattern of those times should be.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` If the secret was disclosed to me also, it is not that I have
wisdom beyond the wont of living men; I was but the instrument by which
the meaning of it was to be made known, and a king’s thoughts
unravelled.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` A vision thou hadst of a great image; what splendour, how terrible
an aspect it was that confronted thee!
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Of fine gold the head, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs
of bronze;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` of iron the legs, and of the feet, too, part was iron, part was but
earthenware.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And as thou wert watching it, from the mountain-side fell a stone
no hands had quarried, dashed against the feet of yonder image, part
iron, part clay, and shattered them.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` With that, down came iron and clay, down came bronze and silver and
gold; chaff of the threshing-floor was never so scattered on the summer
breeze. They were gone, none knew whither; and stone that had shattered
image grew into a high mountain, filling the whole earth.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` So much for the dream, and now we that know the secret of it✻ will
tell the king’s grace what it means.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Thou hast kings for thy vassals; royalty, power, dominion and great
renown the God of heaven has bestowed on thee;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` every haunt of man and wild beast and flying bird he has given over
to thee, all alike he has made subject to thee; the head of gold, who
else but thou?
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Another and a lesser empire must follow thine, one of silver, then
another of bronze, still wide as the world;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` then a fourth, of iron, breaking down and crushing all before it,
as iron has power all-conquering, all-subduing.✻
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` But feet and toes of the image were part iron, part clay; this
fourth empire will be divided within itself. Foundation of iron there
shall yet be, from which it springs; sure enough, in the feet thou
sawest, earthenware was mixed with true steel.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Yet was true steel mixed with base earthenware, token that this
empire shall be in part firmly established, in part brittle.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Iron and clay mingled; race of the conquerors shall be adulterated
with common human stock; as well mix clay with iron!✻
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And while those empires yet flourish, another empire the God of
heaven will bring into being, never to be destroyed, never to be
superseded; conqueror of all these others, itself unconquerable.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` This is that stone thou sawest none ever quarried, that fell from
the mountain-side, bringing clay and iron and bronze and silver and
gold to nothing; this was a revelation the king’s grace had from the
most high God himself of what must come about; true was thy dream, and
this, past doubt, the meaning of it.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` With that, king Nabuchodonosor bowed down face to earth, and made
Daniel reverence; ay, he would have sacrifice offered to him, and
incense,
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` and with these words greeted him: Doubt is none but this God of
yours of all gods is God, of all kings the master; he it is brings
hidden things to light, or how couldst thou have read the secret?
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Thereupon, he raised Daniel to high rank, and showered riches on
him; ruler he should be of all Babylon’s provinces, and over all its
wise men have the pre-eminence.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` But Daniel made suit to him, and it was Sidrach, Misach and
Abdenago that had Babylon under their charge; Daniel himself was the
king’s courtier still.
