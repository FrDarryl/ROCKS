"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now there was a great outcry of the common sort, men and women,
against their richer neighbours, that were Jews too.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Poor folk, who had sons and daughters in great number, had bethought
themselves of bartering these for the corn they must have if they would
live;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` some, in the great scarcity, had been ready to pledge lands,
vineyards and house in return for corn;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` some had offered vineyard or lands for a pledge when they would
borrow money to pay the royal tribute.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now they complained, These men are our brothers; of one race,
they and we, of one race, their sons and ours; and here are we, with
some of our daughters bondwomen already, giving up sons and daughters
to slavery still, and no hope of ransoming them; here are lands and
vineyards of ours given over to the enjoyment of others!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Great was my anger when I heard such cause of complaint was theirs.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I took deep thought over it, and then taxed nobles and rulers with
their fault; would they play the usurer with their own brethren?
Summoning a great assembly of the citizens to confront them,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I reminded them that we in Babylon had been at pains to ransom our
Jewish brethren who were enslaved to the heathen; must we now ransom
them anew, from masters of their own flesh and blood? At this, there
was silence; nothing could they find to say.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Here are sorry doings, I told them. Have you no fear of God’s
vengeance, of the reproach this will earn from our heathen neighbours?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You are not the only creditors; I myself, my kinsmen and my
servants have been lending money and corn on all sides. Come, let us
conspire to forgo our rights, let us all remit the debt due to us;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and do you restore, here and now, lands, vineyards, olive-yards and
houses; restore, too, the interest charge you claim of a hundredth, for
money and corn, wine and oil alike.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Restore it we will, they answered, and make no further claim; thy
bidding shall be done. Thereupon I summoned the priests, and would have
this undertaking secured by an oath.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I shook the dust, too, from the folds of my lap, and cried out: God
give no gentler handling than this to the man who plays me false; sweep
away house and lands, and leave him a beggar! Amen, answered the whole
assembly, and gave praise to God. And loyally the agreement was kept.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For twelve years, ever since Artaxerxes gave me my commission in
Juda (that is, from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of his
reign) my kinsmen and I refused to take the allowance which was granted
to the governors.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` My predecessors, by accepting corn, wine, and money, at the rate of
forty sicles a day, had been a burden to the people, who suffered also
from the exactions of their servants. Not so I, God’s fear preventing
me;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` instead of buying lands, my care was to help build the wall, and
there was no servant of mine but took his place among the workmen.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` A hundred and fifty Jews, (the rulers,✻ and those) who came in to
help us from the country round about, fed at my expense;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` every day an ox and six fat rams, and fowls besides, were dressed
for me, and every tenth day brought a fresh supply of various wines;
yet for this and much else I would take no allowance as governor in
return; to such straits had the men of Juda been brought.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Not unremembered, Lord, not unrewarded, be these services done to
thy people.
