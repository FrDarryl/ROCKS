"2" = ''':sup:`2` This Phassur gave Jeremias a beating, and put him in the stocks at
the upper gate of Benjamin, in the temple precincts,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Danger enough thou shalt have, the Lord says, thou and those friends
of thine; with thy own eyes thou shalt see the enemy put them to the
sword, when I make the king of Babylon master of Juda; to Babylon he
will take them, and put them to the sword there.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All the wealth of this city, all the fruits of its toil, all that is
of price, all the treasury of Juda’s kings, those enemies shall have in
their power, to plunder and carry off and take back to Babylon with
them.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And thou, Phassur, with all thy household, shalt go into exile; to
Babylon thou shalt go, in Babylon thou shalt die, and there find burial

'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Long have I prophesied, and still I clamoured against men’s
wickedness, and still cried ruin; day in, day out, nothing it earns me,
this divine spokesmanship, but reproach and mockery.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` But the Lord stands at my side, a strong champion; fall and fail
they must, my persecutors, and be disappointed of their hopes; fools,

thoughts of man’s heart, let me live to see thee punish them; to thee I

morn, dirge at noon, like some city the Lord overthrows in anger

sorrow greet me, and in disappointed striving all my life is spent?
