Notas de rodapé:
3:6 - The mystery revealed to Paul is that the Gentiles are fellow
heirs of the promise in Christ, members of the body, and partakers of
the promise of the gospel. This is a fundamental point for
3:14-19 - Paul prays that believers would be strengthened in spirit and
understand the depth of Christ's love. God's love is the foundation and
3:20-21 - Paul concludes this chapter with a doxology, extolling God's
power that works abundantly in our lives. Paul's prayer reinforces our
confidence in God's ability to accomplish more than we ask or imagine
