"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a man of Nephthali dwelling in the city of that name,
which lies in the hill-country of Galilee, beyond Naasson, by the road
leading westwards with Sephet on the left of it. His name was Tobias;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and when he was carried off as a prisoner by the Assyrians under
king Salmanasar, he would not make his exile an excuse for deserting
true religion.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Every day he would share whatever means he had with his
fellow-captives, that were men of his own clan.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Even when he was a boy, and was of least regard among the men of
Nephthali, no boyish levity did his acts display.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` While the rest had recourse to the golden calves Jeroboam had set up
when he reigned in Israel, Tobias shunned their company and went his
own way;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` went up to Jerusalem to the Lord’s temple, and worshipped the Lord
that was God of Israel. First-fruit and tithe he duly offered,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and every third year he tithed his goods afresh, for the needs of
wanderers and homeless folk.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` By such acts as these he shewed, even in boyhood, what loyalty he
had for the law of God;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` when he grew up it was a maiden of his own tribe, called Anna, that
he wedded, and their son, called by his father’s name,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` was brought up to fear God and keep clear of every fault.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Such was he, when, like all his tribe, he was carried away, with
his wife and his son, to Nineve.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` All the rest might share the food of the Gentiles, he would not
lose his innocence, he would not defile himself by eating what the law
forbade.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And God, finding his heart so loyal to the divine commands, won him
favour with king Salmanasar.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` From this king he had leave to go where he would, and spend his
time as he would;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` so he made a round of all his fellow-exiles, giving them such good
counsel as might avail them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Once he was at a Median city called Rages, and had with him ten
talents of silver, a gift from the king’s bounty.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` To what use should he put it? He found there a fellow-tribesman of
his own, called Gabelus, who was in great need; to him, then, he lent
the aforesaid silver under a bond.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Time passed; Salmanasar died, and the throne passed to his son
Sennacherib, who was no friend to the Jews;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and now it was Tobias’ daily task to visit his own clansmen,
comforting them and providing for each of them as best he could, out of
what store he had;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` it was for him to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to honour
with careful burial men that had died of sickness, and men slain.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Sennacherib came home from Judaea, escaping while he might
from the divine vengeance his blasphemies had brought upon him, he
killed many an Israelite in his anger; and these too Tobias would bury.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When this came to the king’s ears, he gave orders that Tobias
should be put to death, and seized all his property;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` but he escaped, with his wife and son, into safe hiding; destitute
as he was, he had many friends.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And then, forty-five days later, Sennacherib was murdered by his
own sons,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` whereupon Tobias came back home, and had all his goods restored to
him.✻
