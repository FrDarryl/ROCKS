to all respect; otherwise God’s name and our doctrine will be ill
spoken of.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And those whose masters belong to the faith must not think the less
of them, for being their brethren; they should render all the better
service, when those who benefit by their good will are believers,
worthy of their love. Teach them, and encourage them, so to act.
'''

principles which are the principles of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the
doctrine which accords with holiness?

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then it is because he is puffed up with vanity; knowledge he has
none, but an itch for speculation and controversy. What comes of it?
Only jealousy, quarrelling, recriminations and base suspicions,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` all such encounters as must arise between men with corrupted minds
who have lost track of the truth. Religion, they think, will provide
them with a living.

than a bare sufficiency goes with it.✻

content with that.

them; all those useless and dangerous appetites which sink men into
ruin here and perdition hereafter.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The love of money is a root from which every kind of evil springs,
and there are those who have wandered away from the faith by making it
their ambition, involving themselves in a world of sorrows.✻

living, holiness, and faith, and love, and endurance, and kind
forbearance.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Fight the good fight of faith, lay thy grasp on eternal life, that
life thou wert called to, when thou didst assert the great claim before
so many witnesses.

light; no human eye has seen or can ever see him; to him be glory and
everlasting empire, Amen.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Warn those who are rich in this present world not to think highly
of themselves, not to repose their hopes in the riches that may fail
us, but in the living God, who bestows on us so richly all that we
enjoy.

ready to give, and to share the common burden,

to have life which is true life within their grasp.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` It is for thee, Timothy, to keep safe what has been entrusted to
thee, avoiding these new, intruding forms of speech, this quibbling
knowledge that is knowledge only in name;✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` there are those who profess them, and in professing them have shot
wide of the mark which faith sets us. Grace be with thee, Amen.
