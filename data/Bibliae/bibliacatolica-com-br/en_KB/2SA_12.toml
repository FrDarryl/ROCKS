"1" = ''':sup:`1` So it was that the Lord sent Nathan on an errand to David; and this
was the mes-sage he brought him. There were two men that lived in the
same town, one rich, one poor.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The rich man had flocks and herds in great abundance;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` the poor man had nothing except one ewe-lamb which he had bought and
reared, letting it grow up in his house like his own children, share
his own food and drink, sleep in his bosom; it was like a daughter to
him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The rich man was to entertain a friend, who was on his travels; and,
to make a feast for this foreign guest, he would take no toll of his
own flocks and herds; he robbed the poor man of the one lamb that was
his, and welcomed the traveller with that.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` David, burning with indignation at the wrong, said to Nathan, As the
Lord is a living God, death is the due of such a man as this;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` for this cruel deed of his, he shall make compensation fourfold.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man.Here is a message for
thee, said he, from the Lord God of Israel: I anointed thee king of
Israel, I saved thy life when Saul threatened it;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I gave thee thy master’s goods to enjoy, thy master’s wives to
cherish in thy bosom; all Israel and Juda are in thy power, and if that
were not enough, more should be thine for the asking.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And thou, wouldst thou defy the Lord’s commandment, and do the wrong
he hates, putting Urias the Hethite to the sword, so as to take his
wife for thy own? The men of Ammon struck the blow, but thou art his
murderer.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For the wrong thou hast done in robbing Urias the Hethite of his
wife, to make her thine, murder shall be the heirloom of thy own race.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` This is the Lord’s message to thee: I mean to stir up rebellion
against thee in thy own household; before thy very eyes take thy own
wives from thee and give them to another, that shall bed them in the
full light of yonder sun.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thou didst go to work secretly; when this threat of mine is
fulfilled, all Israel and yonder sun shall witness it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord; and
Nathan answered, The Lord has given thy sin quittance, thou shalt not
die for it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But thou hast brought on the Lord the contempt of his enemies,✻ and
the son that has been born to thee is doomed to die.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So Nathan went home, and now the little son Urias’ wife had borne
to David was struck down by the Lord, and no hope was left for him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` David still interceded for him with the Lord, keeping strict fast
and passing his nights on the ground;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` he would not humour his counsellors when they came and bade him
rise to his feet again, nor would he take food with them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then, after six days, the child died; and David’s servants had not
the courage to tell him it was so. If he would not listen to our
remonstrances, they thought, while the child yet lived, what penance
will he do when we tell him it is dead!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But David, as he marked them whispering to one another, guessed
what had befallen; The child is dead? he asked, and when he heard that
it was,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` he rose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, changed his
garments, and went into the Lord’s house to do reverence there. Then he
came back to his house, asked for food, and ate.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And when his servants asked what his meaning was, that he should
fast and lament over the child still living, rise up and take food once
the child was dead,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` he answered, Fast and lament I would, for the child’s sake, while
he lived; It may be, I thought, the Lord will grant me his life.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now that he is dead, what need to fast? Can I bring him back from
the grave? I shall go to be with him, he will not come back to me.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then David comforted his wife Bethsabee, and took her to his bed;
and she bore him a son whom he called Solomon. Him the Lord loved,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and sent word by the prophet Nathan that he was to be called The
Lord’s Favourite, in proof of his great love.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Meanwhile, Joab was attacking Rabbath, and took the royal quarter
of it.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then he sent a message to David, I have been attacking Rabbath, but
the river-side part of the city remains yet to be won.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Muster all the rest of thy army to attack the city and take it; I
would not earn the credit of the victory by taking it myself.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` So David, mustering all his forces, marched on Rabbath and stormed
it.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He took the king’s crown from his head, a crown of gold weighing a
full talent, set with the rarest jewels, and wore it himself;✻ much
plunder he carried off from the city besides.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` As for the people, he had them brought out and sawed in pieces, or
crushed under iron chariots, or cut up with knives, or passed through a
brick-kiln; and the same treatment he gave to all the cities of Ammon.
Then David and his army returned to Jerusalem.✻
