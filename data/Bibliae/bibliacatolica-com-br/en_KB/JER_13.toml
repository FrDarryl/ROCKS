"1" = ''':sup:`1` The Lord’s word came to me: Go and buy a girdle of linen, and put it
about thy loins, one that was never yet soaked in water.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Girdle I bought me as the Lord had bidden, and wore it;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and now the Lord spoke again:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Is the girdle bought and worn? Up, take it with thee to Euphrates
river, and hide it there in a crevice of the rock.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So I went obediently, and hid it away in the Euphrates.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Many days afterwards, the Lord sent me on my travels again to the
Euphrates, to recover the girdle hidden there at his command;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` so thither I went, and unearthed the girdle from its hiding-place,
to find it all perished and useless.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Whereupon the Lord’s word came to me,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and this was his message: Not less the great pride of Juda, the
great pride of Jerusalem, must perish.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Here is a rebellious people that will not listen to my call; they
must needs take their own false path, courting alien gods and
submitting to their worship. No better, then, than yonder useless
girdle;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` close as a man’s girdle fits about his loins I had bound Israel and
Juda to myself; my people they were to be, my renown and prize and
pride; but no, they would not listen.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Tell them this, too, from the Lord God of Israel, Flagons must have
wine to fill them. And when they answer, it is no news to them that
flagons are for wine,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` give them this message from the Lord: Ay, but the people of this
land, king of David’s line sitting on David’s throne, priest and
prophet and citizens of Jerusalem every one, are flagons waiting to be
filled. I mean to bemuse them, as with wine,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and then shatter✻ them; brother torn away from brother, and fathers
from their children; ruth and respite none shall have, nor be spared in
the common ruin.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Hear and heed and humble yourselves; it is the Lord who speaks.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Give God his due, ere the shadows fall, and your feet begin to
stumble on the dark mountain-ways. For day you shall long, but he will
have turned it into night; dark as death the lowering of the storm.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Sirs, if you will not listen now, give me leave to hide myself away
and bemoan your proud hearts; weep I must and wail, and my eyes run
down with tears, if the Lord’s flock is doomed to captivity.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` To king✻ and queen-mother say this, Come down and take your places
with the rest, discrowned of your royalty.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Shut off are the cities of the south, entry is none; dispeopled
lies Juda, of all her sons dispeopled.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` New-comers from the north country, look about you and see! …✻ … Ah,
Jerusalem, what has become of the flock once entrusted to thee, thy
honourable care?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` What wilt thou say when thou art called to give account of it? Thy
enemies are such as thou hast taught how to attack thee; thy schooling
has recoiled on thy own head; sharper than travail-throes the anguish
that shall overtake thee.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And wilt thou find room for surmise, why this should have befallen
thee? Doubt not it is thy own wrong-doing that has stripped thee naked,
and plunged thy steps deep in defilement.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Sooner may Ethiop turn white, leopard’s hide unmarked, than Juda
unlearn the lesson of ill-doing and amend.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Far and wide I will scatter thy sons, like straws caught in the
desert wind;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` such is the fortune sent thee, such thy retribution exactly
awarded, because thou hast forgotten me, and in lying fables put thy
trust.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` That is why I will pull thy skirts about thy ears and manifest thy
shame;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` adulteries of thine, and lasciviousness, and all the guilt of thy
debauchery, the foul deeds I have seen done on hill-tops, in the open
country-side. Fie on thee, Jerusalem, that wilt not come back to me and
be cleansed! Shall it last for ever?

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
13:1-11 - The parable of the filthy belt is used to illustrate the
corruption of the people of Judah. God compares Israel to a belt,
which, when used incorrectly, becomes useless. Disobedience to the Lord
13:12-14 - The prophecy that the wine jars will be broken symbolizes
Judah's impending destruction. The people's pride and confidence in
13:15-17 - The call to repentance is made to avoid destruction. God
warns the people not to harden their hearts, for divine judgment is
approaching, and repentance is the only way to avoid calamity (see also
13:18-23 - The humiliation of Judah and the judgment upon the nation
are foretold, for the people have turned away from God. The analogy of
the woman and the girdle illustrates the nearness of the judgment that
will be visited upon Judah (see also 2 Kings 24:10-16 and Lamentations
1:18).
13:24-27 - The people will be scattered among the nations, and their
idolatries will be punished. God speaks against the people's pride,
announcing their dispersion and punishment for their sin, but with the
7:34).
