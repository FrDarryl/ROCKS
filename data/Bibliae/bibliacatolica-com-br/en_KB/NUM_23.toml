provide him with as many bullocks and as many rams.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` When his bidding was done, they offered a bullock and a ram on each
altar.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Wait here by the sacrifice, he told Balac; I will go and meet the
Lord, if he will, and tell thee what message he has charged me with.✻

"4" = ''':sup:`4` No sooner had he withdrawn than the Lord came to meet him, and
Balaam told him how he had raised seven altars, offering a bullock and
a ram on each.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` With that, the Lord put a message on his lips, bidding him return to
Balac and deliver it;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` so he returned, to find Balac standing beside the burnt-sacrifice he
had made, with the Moabite chiefs about him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Balaam prophesied: I have come from Aram, from the hills out in
the east; it was Balac summoned me, the king of the Moabites. He bade
me come and curse Jacob, come with all speed, and lay my ban on Israel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Curse them, I, when God’s curse does not light on them? I lay a ban,
where ban from the Lord is none?

"9" = ''':sup:`9` I will climb the high rocks to see them, the hills shall enlarge my
view; here is a people destined to dwell apart, not counted among the
muster-roll of the nations.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Sons of Israel, countless as the dust, line of Jacob, past all
numbering, may death find me faithful as these, be my end like theirs!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Balac asked Balaam, What trick is this thou hast played on me?
I sent for thee to curse my enemies; wilt thou bless them instead?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But he answered, What words should I use, save what the Lord bids
me utter?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nay, said Balac, come with me to another spot, from which thou wilt
only be able to see a part of Israel, not the whole people; from this
thou shalt lay a curse on them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So he took him to the high ground at the top of mount Phasga; and
there, when Balaam had raised seven altars with an offering of bullocks
and rams,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` he would have Balac wait by the burnt-sacrifice, while he kept his
tryst.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The Lord met him and put a message on his lips to give Balac.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Balac, waiting there with the chiefs of Moab by the
burnt-sacrifice, asked him what the Lord’s word was.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And again he prophesied: Stand there, Balac, and listen; a message
for thee, son of Sephor!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` It is not for God to gainsay himself, as men do, to alter, like the
things of earth; must he not make good his word, fulfil his promise?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` My errand is to bless, and I cannot retract the blessing.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` It is no false God that Jacob worships, no senseless image that has
its shrine in Israel; the Lord dwells with them as their God; his royal
trumpets sound for victory.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` This is the God that brought them out of Egypt, and made them like
a wild ox for strength.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Jacob needs no soothsayer, Israel no divination; time will reveal
the marvellous things God does for them;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` a people that is like a lioness roused, a lion ready to spring,
never resting till it has devoured its prey, drunk the blood of
slaughtered men.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And now Balac would have no more, either of curse or of blessing;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` but Balaam said, Did I not warn thee that I must needs carry out
God’s bidding?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Come, said Balac, let me find thee another vantage-point; from this
perhaps, God will allow thee to curse them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he took him up to the top of mount Phogor, looking out towards
the desert.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Here too Balaam must have seven altars, seven bullocks, and seven
rams;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and Balac did as he was bidden, offering a bullock and a ram on
every altar.

Notas de rodapé:
23:1-3 - Balaam prepares sacrifices according to the custom of the time
before delivering God's message. Although Balaam is a prophet hired to
curse Israel, he can only speak what God reveals to him, demonstrating
23:7-10 - In the first prophecy, Balaam declares that he cannot curse
anyone whom God has not cursed. Israel is blessed and set apart by God
as His chosen people, highlighting God's sovereignty in protecting His
23:11-12 - Balak is frustrated with Balaam because instead of cursing
Israel, Balaam blesses them. This demonstrates that human plans cannot
14:27).
23:19-20 - God is not a man, that he should lie or change his mind. His
blessing upon Israel is irrevocable, reaffirming God's faithful and
unchanging nature. This verse is one of the most frequently quoted to
demonstrate the confidence one can have in God's promises (see also
23:27-30 - Balak tries again, leading Balaam to a different location to
curse Israel. However, Balak's persistence in seeking a curse shows the
human desperation of trying to change what God has already determined
