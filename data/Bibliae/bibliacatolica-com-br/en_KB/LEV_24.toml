to feed at all times the lamps

"3" = ''':sup:`3` before the veil, where the ark bears record of me in the tabernacle
that attests my covenant. Aaron shall set them there to burn before the
Lord from evening to morning; a rite you shall observe continually, age
after age.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` They shall be set there always in the Lord’s presence, on the
lamp-stand that is of pure gold.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Take flour, too, and bake twelve loaves of it, a peck of flour to
each of them;

"6" = ''':sup:`6` these must be set on the table of pure gold that stands there before
the Lord, six on each side of it.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` And put grains of fine incense on them; the bread is to be a

"9" = ''':sup:`9` the old will be for the use of Aaron and his sons, who are to eat

"10" = ''':sup:`10` There was a man who had been born in the camp of Israel, his mother
an Israelite, his father an Egyptian; and this man, quarrelling there
with a true-born Israelite,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` blasphemed the Lord’s name in heaping curses upon him. So they
brought him before Moses. (His mother’s name was Salumith, daughter to
Dabri, of the tribe of Dan.)
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he was put under guard, while they waited to know the Lord’s

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And this was the word the Lord gave Moses:

to account for it;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` he blasphemed the Lord’s name, and he must die. Be he citizen or
stranger, he must be stoned by the whole people; death for the
blasphemer.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Death, too, for anyone who smites a man and kills him.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` If he injures a beast, he can make it good; one beast will do as
well as another;

"19" = ''':sup:`19` but if he causes injury to one of his fellow-countrymen, he must
pay for it in the same coin,

"20" = ''':sup:`20` making amends for broken limb with broken limb, for eye with eye,

punishment.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Your award must be the same, whether it was citizen or stranger
that did the wrong; it is a just God you worship.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So Moses gave word to the Israelites, and they, obedient to the
Lord’s command, took the blasphemer beyond the confines of the camp,
and there stoned him.
