[32]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` After all this faithful service done, Juda was invaded by
Sennacherib, king of the Assyrians, who laid siege to its fortified
cities, thinking to make them his own.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Ezechias, warned by his approach that Jerusalem was the chief object
of his attack,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` bade his nobles and commanders consider the plan of shutting in the
water courses that ran beyond the city walls.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` To this all agreed, and he set a multitude of hands to work stopping
up all the springs, as well as the stream that flowed through the open
country; should there be water flowing freely for the kings of Assyria
to profit by it?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` No pains did he spare to rebuild the wall where it had fallen into
disrepair, with towers to crown it and a second wall within; Mello,
too, in the Keep of David he fortified anew, and prepared shields and
all other weapons of defence.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then he appointed commanders for his army; and these he bade
assemble in the open space by the city gate, where he spoke to them for
their encouragement.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Play the man, he said, and keep your courage high; let there be no
shrinking, no faint hearts, at the sight of the Assyrian king and the
hordes that follow him; we have many more on our side than they on
theirs.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Theirs is but mortal strength; we have the Lord our God to aid us,
and fight on our side. In such words from king Ezechias the hearts of
the men of Juda found support.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, was laying siege with his army to
Lachis; and now he sent envoys to Jerusalem with a message for king
Ezechias and for all the citizens;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Word to you, they said, from the king of Assyria. What confidence
is it that makes you so bold, cooped up there in Jerusalem?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Will you die there of hunger and thirst, deluded by Ezechias’
promise that the Lord your God will deliver you from the power of the
Assyrian king?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Tell me, who is Ezechias? Is he not the man who has robbed this God
of hill-shrine and altar, leaving you but one altar to repair to, when
you would do worship and burn incense before him?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` See how I and my fathers have subdued the world, and the gods of a
whole world could not rescue it from me!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Tell me, in all these countries my fathers and I have laid waste,
was there ever a god found could save his people from my power, that
you should trust this God of yours when the same power threatens you?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do not be deluded by the persuasions of Ezechias; do not listen to
him. All those peoples and kingdoms my fathers and I have conquered,
their gods notwithstanding; will your God do better?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Much else these courtiers said in dispraise of the Lord God, and
his servant Ezechias;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` there was a letter, too, Sennacherib wrote, full of blasphemy
against the Lord God of Israel, boasting that Ezechias’ God could not
save his people from attack, where the gods of so many other nations
had failed them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Nay, they must needs raise a cry in the Hebrew tongue, to daunt the
folk who sat on Jerusalem walls, and persuade them to yield up the
city.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Lightly did they speak of Jerusalem’s God, as if he had been all
one with those old gods the Chanaanites worshipped, idols made by human
hands.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Against such blasphemers, king Ezechias and the prophet Isaias, son
of Amos, fell to prayer, crying out to heaven for aid;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and with that, the Lord sent out his angel, who smote down warrior
and chieftain and commander in the Assyrian king’s camp, so that he
went home in sorry plight. And there, when he was at worship in the
temple of his god, two sons of his own body drew their swords on him
and slew him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Thus it was the Lord rescued Ezechias and the men of Jerusalem from
the Assyrian king’s power, and of all else that assailed them; on every
side he kept them free from alarm.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Many were the victims and offerings that were brought to the Lord
at Jerusalem; many were the gifts made by Ezechias king of Juda, whom
all the nations held thenceforward in high renown.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And now Ezechias fell sick, and was at death’s door; but he prayed
to the Lord, and the Lord answered his prayer, giving him a sign of his
recovery.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Yet it was an ill return he made for all these benefits; his heart
was puffed up with pride, so that he brought punishment upon himself,
on Juda, too, and Jerusalem;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` for this pride of his, both he and the citizens of Jerusalem
afterwards humbled themselves, and it was not in Ezechias’ own time
that the Lord’s vengeance fell.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Great were the riches of Ezechias and his fame; great was the store
of silver and gold, of jewels and spices, of weapons for every purpose
and of precious ware, that king Ezechias laid up.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` He had store-houses too, for corn, wine and oil, stables full of
beasts, and folds full of flocks;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` new cities he must build, so many were his herds of sheep and
cattle, so abundant were the possessions the Lord had given him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It was this Ezechias that blocked the upper waters of the Gihon
stream, and conveyed them under ground into the western part of the
Keep of David. In all that he did, he prospered;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and if, when the princes of Babylon came to enquire about the
portent that had happened in his country, God left him to his own
counsel, it was but to try him, and test the dispositions of his heart.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` What else Ezechias did, all his acts of piety, may be found set
down in the Vision of Isaias, son of Amos, and in the Record of the
kings of Juda and Israel.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So Ezechias was laid to rest with his fathers, on the slope where
the tombs of David’s sons are; and all Juda and Jerusalem did honour to
his funeral. And the throne passed to his son Manasses.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
32:1-8 - Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invades Judah, but Hezekiah
encourages the people to trust in the Lord, who is more powerful than
any human army. This trust in God in the midst of danger reflects faith
32:9-19 - Sennacherib tries to intimidate the people of Judah by
blaspheming God. This attempt to discredit the faithful reveals the
world's contempt for God's power, but it also highlights the conflict
37:23).
32:20-22 - Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah pray, and God delivers
Jerusalem by sending an angel who destroys the Assyrian army. This
shows that fervent prayer and faith can result in divine deliverance
32:24-26 - Hezekiah becomes seriously ill, but prays to the Lord and is
healed. However, he gives in to pride, but later repents. This
highlights the importance of repentance and humility before God (see
32:27-33 - Hezekiah prospers and is remembered for his accomplishments,
but his death follows a period of pride. This account serves as a
warning against the danger of spiritual pride, even for the most
