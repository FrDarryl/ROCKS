"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then he took me into the outer court again, the northern part of it,
and would have me enter the parlours that lay there, close to the
pavilion and to the northern side of the temple.✻

the outer, they rose, gallery upon gallery, three storeys in all.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` In front of them was a walk ten cubits wide, encroaching on the
inner court by one cubit;✻ all their doors faced the north.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Here, the top rooms were narrower, since they must make room for
porticos at the side, built out over the two lower storeys;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` these three-storeyed parlours had no columns in front of them, like
the parlours in the outer court,✻ but made up for it by porticos that
rose from the roof of the first two floors, filling in the width of the
fifty cubits.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Inner parlours faced outer only with fifty cubits of their wall’s
length;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` in the outer court, the parlours were but fifty cubits long, whereas

"13" = ''':sup:`13` These parlours, he told me, built to north and south beside the
pavilion, are hallowed precincts, where the priests who sacrifice to
the Lord may eat what is set apart for holy uses. All that is set
apart, all the offerings made for fault and for wrong done, shall there
be laid out, as on holy ground.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Nor, entering it, shall the priests leave it for the inner court
all at once; here they must lay aside their vestments, for these, too,
are hallowed, and put on other clothes before ever they mingle with the
people.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` With that, he made an end of measuring the precincts within, and
led me through the eastern doorway, to measure them from without.

sacred and things profane.

Notas de rodapé:
42:1-5 - Ezekiel is led to an outer courtyard of the temple, where he
sees the priests' chambers and the spaces reserved for divine service.
This emphasizes the importance of separating holy and profane places,
42:6-9 - The priests' chambers are described as spaces of consecration
and preparation. This emphasizes the priests' call to live in holiness
and to prepare properly for worship, highlighting the importance of
42:10-14 - The description of the chambers for the Levites and priests
highlights the division between areas designated for God's service and
those for the people. The temple is seen as a place of worship, but
42:15-20 - The emphasis on measuring the temple chambers and areas
demonstrates the precision and care that must be taken in worshiping
God. Every detail has a divine purpose, reflecting the order and
42:21-23 - The measurement of the chambers and the careful separation
of the sacred areas demonstrate the standard of purity and worship that
God requires. The temple is a picture of how God's holiness is
reflected in the lives of His people and their relationship with Him
