"1" = ''':sup:`1` Jesus meanwhile went to the mount of Olives.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And at early morning he appeared again in the temple; all the common
folk came to him, and he sat down there and began to teach them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And now the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman who had
been found committing adultery, and made her stand there in full view;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Master, they said, this woman has been caught in the act of
adultery.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Moses, in his law, prescribed that such persons should be stoned to
death; what of thee? What is thy sentence?✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` They said this to put him to the test, hoping to find a charge to
bring against him. But Jesus bent down, and began writing on the ground
with his finger.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When he found that they continued to question him, he looked up and
said to them, Whichever of you is free from sin shall cast the first
stone at her.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then he bent down again, and went on writing on the ground.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And they began to go out one by one, beginning with the eldest, till
Jesus was left alone with the woman, still standing in full view.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Jesus looked up, and asked her, Woman, where are thy accusers?
Has no one condemned thee?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No one, Lord, she said. And Jesus said to her, I will not condemn
thee either. Go, and do not sin again henceforward.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now once more Jesus spoke to them, I am the light of the world,
he said. He who follows me can never walk in darkness; he will possess
the light which is life.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Whereupon the Pharisees told him, Thou art testifying on thy own
behalf, thy testimony is worth nothing.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Jesus answered them, My testimony is trustworthy, even when I
testify on my own behalf; I know whence I have come, and where I am
going; you do not know whence I have come, you do not know where I am
going.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` You set yourselves up to judge, after your earthly fashion; I do
not set myself up to judge anybody.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And what if I should judge? My judgement is judgement indeed; it is
not I alone, my Father who sent me is with me.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Just so it is prescribed in your law, The testimony of two men is
trustworthy;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` well, one is myself, testifying in my own behalf, and my Father who
sent me testifies in my behalf too.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Hereupon they said to him, Where is this Father of thine? And Jesus
answered, You have no knowledge, either of me or of my Father; had you
knowledge of me, you would have knowledge of my Father as well.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` All this Jesus said at the Treasury, while he was teaching in the
temple; and no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And he said to them again, I am going away, and you will look for
me, but you will have to die with your sins upon you; where I am going
is where you cannot come.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` At this, the Jews began to ask, Will he kill himself? Is that what
he means by, Where I am going is where you cannot come?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But he went on to say, You belong to earth, I to heaven; you to
this world, I to another.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` That is why I have been telling you that you will die with your
sins upon you; you will die with your sins upon you unless you come to
believe that it is myself you look for.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Who art thou, then? they asked. Jesus said to them, What, that I
should be speaking to you at all?✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` There is much I could say of you, many judgements I could pass on
you; but what I tell the world is only what I have learned from him who
sent me, because he cannot deceive.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And they could not understand that he was calling God his Father.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then Jesus said to them, When you have lifted up the Son of Man,
you will recognize that it is myself you look for, and that I do not do
anything on my own authority, but speak as my Father has instructed me
to speak.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me all alone, since
what I do is always what pleases him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` While he spoke thus, many of the Jews learned to believe in him.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And now Jesus said to those among the Jews who believed in him, If
you continue faithful to my word, you are my disciples in earnest;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` so you will come to know the truth, and the truth will set you
free.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` They answered him, We are of Abraham’s breed, nobody ever enslaved
us yet; what dost thou mean by saying, You shall become free?✻
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And Jesus answered them, Believe me when I tell you this; everyone
who acts sinfully is the slave of sin,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and the slave cannot make his home in the house for ever. To make
his home in the house for ever, is for the Son.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Why then, if it is the Son who makes you free men, you will have
freedom in earnest.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Yes, I know you are of Abraham’s breed; yet you design to kill me,
because my word does not find any place in you.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` My words are what I have learned in the house of my Father, and
your actions, it seems, are what you have learned in the school of your
father.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Our father? they answered him; Abraham is our father. Jesus said to
them, If you are Abraham’s true children, it is for you to follow
Abraham’s example;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` as it is, you are designing to kill me, who tell you the truth as I
have heard it from God; this was not Abraham’s way.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` No, it is your father’s example you follow. And now they said to
him, We are no bastard children; God, and he only, is the Father we
recognize.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Jesus told them, If you were children of God, you would welcome me
gladly; it was from God I took my origin, from him I have come. I did
not come on my own errand, it was he who sent me.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Why is it that you cannot understand the language I talk? It is
because you have no ear for the message I bring.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` You belong to your father, that is, the devil, and are eager to
gratify the appetites which are your father’s. He, from the first, was
a murderer; and as for truth, he has never taken his stand upon that;
there is no truth in him. When he utters falsehood, he is only uttering
what is natural to him; he is all false, and it was he who gave
falsehood its birth.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And if you do not believe me, it is precisely because I am speaking
the truth.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Can any of you convict me of sin? If not, why is it that you do not
believe me when I tell you the truth?
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` The man who belongs to God listens to God’s words; it is because
you do not belong to God that you will not listen to me.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Hereupon the Jews answered him, We are right, surely, in saying
that thou art a Samaritan, and art possessed?
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` I am not possessed, Jesus answered; it is because I reverence my
Father that you have no reverence for me.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Not that I am looking to my own reputation; there is another who
will look to it, and be the judge.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Believe me when I tell you this; if a man is true to my word, to
all eternity he will never see death.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` And the Jews said to him, Now we are certain that thou art
possessed. What of Abraham and the prophets? They are dead; and thou
sayest that a man will never taste death to all eternity, if he is true
to thy word.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Art thou greater than our father Abraham? He is dead, and the
prophets are dead. What dost thou claim to be?
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` If I should speak in my own honour, Jesus answered, such honour
goes for nothing. Honour must come to me from my Father, from him whom
you claim as your God;
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` although you cannot recognize him. But I have knowledge of him; if
I should say I have not, I should be what you are, a liar. Yes, I have
knowledge of him, and I am true to his word.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` As for your father Abraham, his heart was proud to see the day of
my coming; he saw, and rejoiced to see it.✻
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` Then the Jews asked him, Hast thou seen Abraham, thou, who art not
yet fifty years old?
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` And Jesus said to them, Believe me, before ever Abraham came to be,
I am.✻
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Whereupon they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid
himself, and went out of the temple.
