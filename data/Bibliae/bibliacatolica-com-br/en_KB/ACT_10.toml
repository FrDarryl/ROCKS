"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was, at Caesarea, a centurion named Cornelius, belonging to
what is called the Italian cohort,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` a pious man who worshipped the true God, like all his household,
gave alms freely to the people, and prayed to God continually.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He, about the ninth hour of the day, had a vision, in which he
clearly saw an angel of God come in and address him by his name.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` What is it, Lord? he asked, gazing at him in terror. And he
answered, Thy prayers and alms-deeds are recorded on high in God’s
sight.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now he would have thee send men to Joppa, to bring here one
Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` he lodges with a tanner, called Simon, whose house is close to the
sea; thou wilt learn from him what thou hast to do.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So the angel visitor left him, and thereupon he summoned two of his
servants, and one of the soldiers who were in attendance on him, a man
of piety;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he told them all that had passed, and sent them on their way to
Joppa.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Next day, while these were on their journey and were drawing near
the city, Peter went up to the house-top about noon, to pray there.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He was hungry, and waiting for a meal; and while they were
preparing it, he fell into a trance.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He saw heaven opening, and a bundle, like a great sheet, let down
by its four corners on to the earth;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` in it were all kinds of four-footed beasts, and things that creep
on the earth, and all the birds of heaven.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And a voice came to him, Rise up, Peter, lay about thee and eat.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It cannot be, Lord, answered Peter; never in my life have I eaten
anything profane, anything unclean.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then the voice came to him a second time, It is not for thee to
call anything profane, which God has made clean.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Three times this happened, and then the bundle was drawn up again
into heaven.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Peter was still puzzling in his mind over the meaning of his
vision, when Cornelius’ messengers, who had now found their way to
Simon’s house, were seen standing at the gate;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` where they called out and asked if Simon, who was also called
Peter, lodged there.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` To Peter, as he was turning over the vision in his mind, the Spirit
said, Here are three men asking for thee;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` rise and go down, and accompany them without misgiving; it is I who
have sent them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Peter went down to the men; Here I am, he said, the man you are
looking for; what is your errand?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The centurion Cornelius, they said, a man who worships the true God
and keeps his law, as all the Jewish people will testify, has received
a revelation from one of the holy angels; he was to have thee brought
to his house, and listen to what thou wouldst say.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thereupon Peter bade them come in, and made them welcome; and next
day he set out with them, accompanied by some of the brethren from
Joppa.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The day after that, they reached Caesarea, where Cornelius was
awaiting them; he had gathered his kinsmen and his closest friends
about him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And as soon as Peter had entered, he was met by Cornelius, who fell
at his feet and did reverence to him;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` but Peter raised him; Stand up, he said, I am a man like thyself.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So he went in, still conversing with him, and found a great company
assembled.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` You know well enough, he told them, that a Jew is contaminated if
he consorts with one of another race, or visits him; but God has been
shewing me that we ought not to speak of any man as profane or unclean;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and so, when I was sent for, I came without demur. Tell me then,
why you have sent for me.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Cornelius said, Three days ago, at this very time, I was making
my afternoon prayer in my house,✻ when suddenly I saw a man standing
before me, in white clothes,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` who said to me, Cornelius, thy prayer has been heard, thy almsdeeds
have won remembrance in God’s sight.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Thou art to send to Joppa, and summon thence that Simon who is also
called Peter; he is lodging with a tanner called Simon, close to the
sea.✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` I lost no time, therefore, in sending for thee, and thou hast done
me a favour in coming. Now thou seest us assembled in thy presence,
ready to listen to whatever charge the Lord has given thee.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Thereupon Peter began speaking; I see clearly enough, he said, that
God makes no distinction between man and man;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` he welcomes anybody, whatever his race, who fears him and does what
piety demands.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` God has sent his word to the sons of Israel, giving them news of
peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` You have heard the story, a story which ran through the whole of
Judaea, though it began in Galilee, after the baptism which John
proclaimed;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` about Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit
and with power, so that he went about doing good, and curing all those
who were under the devil’s tyranny, with God at his side.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` We are witnesses of all he did in the country of the Jews, and in
Jerusalem. And they killed him, hanging him on a gibbet;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` but on the third day God raised him up again, and granted the clear
sight of him,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` not to the people at large, but to us, the witnesses whom God had
appointed beforehand; we ate and drank in his company after his rising
from the dead.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And he gave us a commission to preach to the people, and to bear
witness that he, and none other, has been chosen by God to judge the
living and the dead.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` All the prophets bear him this testimony, that everyone who has
faith in him is to find remission of sins through his name.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Before Peter had finished speaking to them thus, the Holy Spirit
fell on all those who were listening to his message.✻
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` The faithful who had come over with Peter, holding to the tradition
of circumcision as they did, were astonished to find that the free gift
of the Holy Spirit could be lavished upon the Gentiles,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` whom they heard speaking with tongues, and proclaiming the
greatness of God.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Then Peter said openly, Who will grudge us the water for baptizing
these men, that have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And he gave orders that they should be baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus Christ. And after this, they asked him to stay on some days
with them.

Notas de rodapé:
10:1-8 - Cornelius, a Roman centurion, receives a divine vision
instructing him to call Peter. This is the beginning of the opening of
the gospel to the Gentiles, breaking down cultural and religious
10:9-16 - Peter has a vision in which God shows him that there are no
more impurities, symbolizing the acceptance of the Gentiles. The vision
reflects the expansion of the gospel beyond Israel to all nations (see
10:34-43 - Peter preaches to Cornelius and his household about
salvation in Christ, emphasizing that God is no respecter of persons.
Peter's preaching shows that the gospel is for everyone, regardless of
2:21).
10:44-48 - The Holy Spirit descends upon the Gentiles, demonstrating
that salvation in Christ is for all. This is an important milestone in
the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian community (see also
