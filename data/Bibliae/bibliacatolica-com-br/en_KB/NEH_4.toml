rebuild-ing the walls, and cruel were the taunts he uttered against the
Jews in his anger.

taunted us: What are they about, these starveling Jews? Do they think
we Gentiles will let them have their way? Or do they think to handsel
their work at dawn and have it finished by nightfall? From those
charred ashes can they make stones to build with?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Let them build, said his gossip, Tobias the Ammonite; come a fox by,
he will leap over all the stones they can put together.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Mark it well, Lord God, how they turn us into a laughing-stock; on
their own heads let the mockery recoil; exile and ignominy be their own
lot!

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Do not hide away their guilt; imperishable in thy presence be the
record of the wrong they did, in flouting such a design as this!

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Meanwhile we did not cease building, and now we had completed the
whole circuit of the wall up to half its full height, so eagerly did
the people set about their task.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when this news came, that the breach in Jerusalem walls was
healing, and the gaps were being filled, great was the indignation of
Sanaballat and Tobias, of Arab, Ammonite and Philistine alike;

"8" = ''':sup:`8` and now, making common cause, they would attack Jerusalem and throw
all into confusion.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` But still we asked help of our God, and set watchmen on the walls,
day and night, to defeat their purpose.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Already the Jews were complaining that they had no strength left
for carrying burdens, that the ground was choked with rubble; our task
would never be finished;

"11" = ''':sup:`11` and now our enemies thought to steal upon us unawares, and put an
end to it by taking our lives.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` On ten several occasions Jews that lived near them came back to us
from different parts with the same news;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` and at last I must array a force, armed with sword and lance and
bow, behind the wall round its whole circuit.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` That provision made, I set about encouraging them, nobles and
chiefs and common folk alike; Fear no assault, I told them; bethink you
how great, how fearsome the Lord is, and fight well each for his own
kindred, for son and daughter and wife, for house and home.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` And so, when word came to our enemies that we had been forewarned,
God threw all their plot into confusion.Back we went to our several
posts at the wall;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and thenceforward the warriors among us were divided into two
companies; one of these remained at work, while behind them, under the
clan chiefs of Juda, the rest stood arrayed for battle, with lance and

"18" = ''':sup:`18` nor was there ever a workman but must build with his sword girt at
his side. And the men that blew the trumpets were close beside me;

"19" = ''':sup:`19` I had warned nobles and chiefs and common folk, Here is a task for
many to do; spread wide apart, we are sundered far here on the wall and
there;

"20" = ''':sup:`20` rally, all of you, to any point where you hear the trumpet sound,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` We officers✻ too must take our share in the work, only half of us
standing by with our spears, from dawn till the stars rise.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` And to the common folk I said, Each of you, and his manservant with
him, must lodge here in Jerusalem itself, taking turn and turn about,
day and night.

stripped for washing.
