[31]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` That same year, on the first day of the third month, word came to me
from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, here is a message for Pharao, king of Egypt, and his
retinue. Say to him, This greatness of thine, whose memory does it
recall?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Not less powerful once was the Assyrian✻ king, a very cedar of
Lebanon. How fair its boughs, yonder tree, its leaves how
overshadowing; what height, what thickness of growth about its top!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Water nourished it, water came up from the depth beneath to sustain
it, washed about its roots and parted into runnels to feed the trees
around.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` In all the country-side none rose so tall, had covert so thick,
branches so wide; none fed so deep.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Among its boughs the birds nested, the beasts in their travail
sought its shade; proud nations a many under Assyria’s shelter grew.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So fair it was, so tall and spreading, there by the brimming water’s
side,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` in God’s own garden cedar could not overtop it, fir-tree match it
for height, or plane-tree for shade. God’s garden itself could not shew
such beauty:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` never a tree there, tree of Eden,✻ but must envy it the leafy
loveliness that was my gift.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Alas, that he should aim too high, the Lord God says; alas for
youth’s luxuriant promise, that swelled his heart with pride!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I must needs hand him over to a conquering power, that should
settle my reckoning with him; he, the godless, homeless should be.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Cut down, yonder tree, by alien folk, heathen that pity have none,
and left to lie on the hill-side, boughs choking the valleys, branches
carried off by the mountain streams; vassal nations abandoned his
shelter, and he was all alone.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the fallen trunk birds nested, under torn branches the wild
beasts made their lair;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` never again should tree boast of its height, there by the river
bank, overtopping the covert of the woods, never again should the
waters nourish its pride. Death and the deep earth should await them
all, mortal things to a mortal doom appointed.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Sad dirge was his, the Lord God says, at his down-going; the great
depth was the shroud of him, its flooding streams hushed and stayed;
mourned Lebanon, and all the forest swooned away.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` How it echoed through the world, the crash of his fall! He too,
like all mortal things, was for the earth at last; comfort for those
others that were brought to earth like himself, trees of Eden like
himself, so noble, so fair, so well watered!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` All alike must go down to the grave, the sword’s way; his arm …✻ …
his shadow their protection against surrounding nations.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And thou, in thy greatness and glory among Eden’s trees so like
him! Yet thou, like other Eden trees, must come down low as earth can
bring thee; and the sword shall level thee with the uncircumcised in
death. (Pharao is meant, and Pharao’s retinue, the Lord God says.✻ )

Notas de rodapé:
31:1-9 - The allegory of the cedar tree of Lebanon is used to describe
Egypt, which, though great and strong, will be overthrown. The tree
symbolizes the Egyptian power, which was exalted but which, before God,
31:10-14 - The fall of the great tree (Egypt) will be a spectacle for
all nations, who will learn from God's judgment. The destruction of
human empires serves as a warning to all nations that no human
31:15-17 - The fall of Egypt will be like the fall of other great
nations that have fallen in the past. This reinforces the theme of the
ephemerality of human kingdoms and the fact that all are susceptible to
31:18:00 - Egypt, like the fallen tree, will be forgotten by all
nations, and its greatness will be remembered only by its fall. The
pride and self-sufficiency of powerful nations are temporary, for only
6:19-21).
