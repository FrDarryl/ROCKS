prison-house, and it is the Lord’s constraining power that has won you
your freedom; mark out this day by eating no bread that has leaven in

Hethite, the Amorrhite, Hevite and Jebusite, that land, all milk and
honey, which he promised thy fathers he would give thee, thou shalt

day of it shall be kept as a feast in the Lord’s honour.
