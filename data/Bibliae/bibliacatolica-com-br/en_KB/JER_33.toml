has the Lord to tell thee about these? …… to siege and sword.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Come they to fight against the Chaldaeans, it is but to strew those
earthworks with their own dead bodies; in anger and scorn I will smite

Give thanks to the Lord, the Lord is gracious, his mercy endures for

country’s doom shall be reversed, says the divine promise, and all
shall be as of old.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Juda and all its townships a desert, no living thing to dwell
there? Nay, says the Lord of hosts, once again it shall be the abode of
shepherds, a resting-place for their flocks.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` By hill and plain and the uplands of the south, all over Benjamin
and round about Jerusalem, all through the cities of Juda, there shall
be flocks passing to and fro, and their masters a-counting them, the

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Behold, he says, a time is coming when I will make good my promise
to Israel and Juda;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` the day will dawn, the time be ripe at last for that faithful scion
to bud from David’s stock; the land shall have a king to reign over it,
giving just sentence and due award.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` When that time comes, Juda shall find deliverance, none shall
disturb Jerusalem’s rest; and the name given to this king shall be, The

"20" = ''':sup:`20` giving him this message: If you can rescind my ordinance of day and
night, that there should be day-time and night-time no more,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` only then will I rescind the privilege granted to my servant David,
and there shall be heirs of his throne no more, Levites and priests to
wait on me no more.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` My servant David, the Levites that wait on me, these shall have a
posterity countless as the stars of heaven, measureless as the
sea-sand.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` This message, too, Jeremias had from the Lord:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Mark well how they declare, the folk among whom thou dwellest,✻
that there are two families✻ the Lord has chosen, and both he has cast
off; so that they despise my own people, and no longer count it a
nation.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But this is the divine answer: Laws if I have made none for day and
night, for heaven and earth no ordinances prescribed,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` then let it be thought that I mean to cast Israel away, or depose
the line of David from its headship over all who spring from Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. Trust me, their doom shall be reversed, their lot
shall be pitied.
