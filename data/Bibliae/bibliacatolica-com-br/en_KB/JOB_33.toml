Notas de rodapé:
33:1-3 - Elihu, a new character, introduces himself and says his speech
will be clear and honest. He emphasizes the importance of direct
communication and sincerity when addressing issues of suffering and
God, reflecting the need for a genuine conversation about faith (see
33:14-18 - Elihu emphasizes that God speaks to humanity in various
ways, including dreams and visions. This highlights God's ongoing
communication with humanity and the need for us to be attentive to His
1:1-2).

33:27-30 - Elihu concludes that God can restore man and bring him life
