hardship and turmoil and drudgery of old days,

pools; I will sweep it clean, the Lord of hosts says, sweep it clean
away.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` And now the Lord of hosts has taken an oath, his doom shall be
executed, his design shall stand:
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` In this my own land I will break the power of Assyria,✻ upon these
