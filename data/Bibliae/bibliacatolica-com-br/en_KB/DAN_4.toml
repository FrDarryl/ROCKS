"1" = ''':sup:`1` All went well in my household; never was Nabuchodonosor’s court more
flourishing.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And then I had a dream that put me in fear; nor waking thoughts gave
my troubled wits repose.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Thereupon I gave orders that all the wise men of Babylon should
appear before me, to interpret my dream;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` diviner and sage, astrologer and soothsayer, all must assemble, and
there in their presence I rehearsed what dream it was, but never one of
them could tell me the meaning of it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` At last came Daniel, one of their number, styled after my own god’s
name Baltassar, and endowed by all the holy gods✻ with their spirit. To
him I unfolded my dream thus:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Diviner is none, Baltassar, such as thou art; the spirit of all the
holy gods is in thee, and there is no mystery beyond thy ken. Tell me,
thou, what vision came to me in sleep, what events it boded.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Wouldst thou know, what fantasies disturbed my rest, this was what I
saw. Grew a tree from the heart of earth, beyond measure tall;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` a great tree and a thriving; top of it reached the heavens, and the
ends of the earth had view of it.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What fair leaves it had, what foison of fruit, enough to cater for a
whole world! Beast was none but might take shelter under it, bird was
none but might nest in its branches, and to all living creatures it
gave food.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But as I lay watching in my dream, came down from heaven one of the
holy ones that mount guard there,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and loud rang his message: Down with yonder tree, lop branch, strip
leaves, spill fruit! Let beast its shade, bird its covert forsake!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Yet leave the stock of it fast in earth.Band of iron, chain of
bronze! There on the soft meadow-grass heaven’s dew wet him, pasture
with the beasts find he;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` heart of man be changed in him, beast’s heart given him, till seven
seasons there have found him, and passed him by.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Doom it is of the unsleeping ones, will and word of the holy ones;
live men and learn that he, the most High, of human kingship is
overlord, gives it to whom he will, and holds none too base for the
having of it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thus dreamt I, the great king Nabuchodonosor. Make haste,
Baltassar, and read me the riddle; wise man was none in my kingdom that
could tell me the meaning of it, but thou hast the spirit of the holy
gods in thee; thou canst unravel it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Daniel, Baltassar if you will, made no answer. For a whole
hour, in silence, he gave himself up to his thoughts, and right
comfortless they were. Nay, Baltassar, the king said at last, never
lose heart over a dream, and the interpretation of a dream! Lord king,
said he, such dreams be for thy enemies! To ill-wishers of thine bode
they what they bode!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` A tree tall and sturdy, top reaching the heavens, in all the
world’s view,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` fair branches, fruit abounding, food for all, beasts sheltering,
birds nesting there,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` what is it, lord king, but thou? So great thy power has grown, it
reaches heaven; earth’s bounds are the bounds of thy dominion.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He watches ever, that holy one thou sawest coming down from heaven;
and his word was, Down with the tree, away with it, yet leave the stock
of it rooted fast! Of iron band he spoke, and chain of bronze; of soft
meadow-grass under the dews of heaven; of one that should have his
pasture among the beasts, till seven seasons had found him there, and
passed him by.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Sentence from the most High this dream forbodes, and the king’s
grace the subject of it.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Far from the haunts of men thou shalt be driven out, and among
brute beasts thou shalt have thy dwelling; eat grass, ox-fashion, and
with heaven’s dew be drenched, till seven seasons have passed thee by;
so learn thou must, that of all human kingship the most High is
overlord, and grants it where he will.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` If stock of tree is to be left rooted, be sure thy throne shall be
thine once again; but first thou must learn thy lesson, that all power
is from above.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Deign, my lord king, to be advised by me; with almsgiving, with
mercy to the poor, for fault and wrong-doing of thine make amends; it
may be he will condone thy guilt.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` All this king Nabuchodonosor underwent.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` A twelvemonth later, as he walked to and fro on the roof of his
palace at Babylon,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` he said aloud: Babylon lies before me, the great city, the royal
city I have built; sure proof of my power, fair monument of my renown!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And before the words had died on his lips, came a voice from
heaven: King Nabuchodonosor, here is thy doom! Pass away from thee it
must, that royal power of thine;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` driven from the haunts of men, with beasts dwell thou, grass like
the cattle eat thou, till seven seasons have passed thee by, and
learned thou hast that the most High is overlord of all human kingship,
to grant it where he will.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` There and then fell the doom on Nabuchodonosor; thrust him out they
did, to feed on grass, and ever the dew of heaven drenched him; thick
as eagle’s feathers his hair grew, and like birds’ talons his nails.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When the appointed time was over, I lifted up my eyes to heaven, I,
Nabuchodonosor, and right reason came back to me. Blessed I then the
most high God, to the eternal gave glory and praise; such a reign as
his lasts for ever, such power as his the ages cannot diminish.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Matched with him, the whole world of men counts for nothing; in the
heavenly powers, as in our mortal lives, he accomplishes his will, and
none may resist him, none may ask his meaning.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And when reason came back to me, back came royal pomp and state,
back came the beauty I once had; prince and senator waited on me,
restored to my throne now in more magnificence than ever.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` What wonder if I, Nabuchodonosor, praise this King of heaven, extol
and glorify him, so faithful to his promise, so just in his dealings?
Proud minds none can abase as he.✻

Notas de rodapé:
4:1-3 - Nebuchadnezzar begins with a decree praising God for His
sovereignty. This recognition of divine power becomes a central theme,
but it will be challenged by Nebuchadnezzar's own experience (see also
4:4-18 - The king has a dream about a great tree being cut down, and
Daniel is called to interpret it. The dream prophesies the temporary
downfall of Nebuchadnezzar, who will be humbled for his pride and left
to live like an animal until he acknowledges God's sovereignty (see
4:19-27 - Daniel interprets the dream and advises the king to repent to
avoid divine judgment. This passage highlights human pride and the need
for humility before God, who alone is sovereign over all the kingdoms
4:28-33 - The fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy occurs when
Nebuchadnezzar is temporarily removed from his position, living like an
animal until he acknowledges God's sovereignty. This event serves as a
warning against human pride and self-sufficiency (see also
4:34-37 - Nebuchadnezzar repents and praises God for His sovereignty.
His restoration is a lesson in the importance of recognizing God's
dominion over history and governments. Nebuchadnezzar's humiliation is
