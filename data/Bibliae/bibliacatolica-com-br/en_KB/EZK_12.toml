'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, thou dwellest among a brood of rebels, that have eyes to
see with, ears to hear with, yet see and hear nothing, so bent are they
on rebellion.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Do thou, then, son of man, provide thee with an exile’s pack, and
while it is daylight, let them see thee marching to and fro; in their
full view, if those rebellious eyes will but mark it, remove from one
place to another,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` carrying those goods of thine with thee, as if ready for a journey.
Then, at nightfall, take thy leave in public, as if thou wert going
into exile.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Let them see thee dig a hole through the wall of thy house, to
escape by;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` let them see thee carried out on men’s shoulders, darkness all
around, blindfold, so that thou canst not view the land about thee. A
portent of doom thou shalt be to the men of Israel.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` His bidding was done; while daylight served, I brought my exile’s
pack out into the open; then, at nightfall, dug wall through and went
out on my dark journey, borne on men’s shoulders, plain to view.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What of the rebel brood? Have the Israelites asked to know what thou
meanest?

prince that rules over Jerusalem, and over all such Israelites as dwell
in their native country.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Tell them, This is your own doom I foreshadow; the men of Israel
shall fare as I do, exile and prison their lot,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and he who rules among them shall be fain to escape in the
darkness, borne on men’s shoulders. They shall breach wall to make way
for him, and he shall go with his face covered, so that he will look on
the land no more.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` But my net is spread; I have him in the noose; Babylon for him, the
Chaldaean country for him; that land, too, he shall not see, yet die in
that land he must.✻

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Retinue and bodyguard of his, nay, all his army, I will scatter to
the four winds, with my naked sword at their heels.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then at last they shall learn what manner of God I am, when they
find themselves lost among the nations, dispersed all the world over!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` A few shall survive, in despite of sword, famine, and pestilence,
to tell these new neighbours of theirs what foul deeds they did; so
shall the Gentiles✻ learn to know me.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Word came to me from the Lord:

that dwelt in it.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Lonely the crowded streets, wasted the country-side must be, ere
you learn to know me.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` What means this saying you have in Israel, The days drag on, and
never a warning comes true?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Tell them this from the Lord God: Here is a proverb shall be heard
in Israel no more; I mean to do away with it. Tell them the time is
close at hand now for the fulfilment of all my warnings.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Vain vision and flattering hopes Israel shall know no longer;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` the divine foretelling shall not wait for the divine fulfilling; in
your own days, brood of rebels, you shall witness both, the Lord God
says.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` And the Lord’s word came to me:

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Fond hope of Israel, that these should be distant things thou
foretellest, the prophet of a later age!

Israel's condition. This prophetic action illustrates the reality of
exile, indicating that the people are being taken captive because of
9:7-9).
12:3-7 - Ezekiel's symbolic act of leaving exile illustrates the harsh

12:8-14 - The destruction of Jerusalem is announced, with the promise

12:15-16 - The promise that God will preserve a faithful remnant during
the exile is given. This reflects the mercy of God, who always
maintains a small faithful group, even in times of severe judgment (see
12:17-20 - Ezekiel is instructed to announce that the people will see
