"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the Lord gave him this answer, What, you hypocrites, is there
any one of you that will not untie his ox or his ass from the stall and

Notas de rodapé:
13:1-5 - Jesus warns of the need for repentance, emphasizing that death
is not the cause of divine punishment, but rather the opportunity for
conversion. Repentance is essential to avoid eternal damnation and must
13:6-9 - The parable of the barren fig tree emphasizes God's patience,
but also the need for fruits of repentance. God provides time for
repentance, but a lack of spiritual fruit can lead to judgment (see
13:10-17 - The healing of the woman bent over on the Sabbath reveals
Jesus' mercy, which places human dignity above rigid traditions. Jesus
teaches that the Sabbath should be a time of liberation and healing,
13:18-21 - Jesus uses two parables (the mustard seed and the yeast) to
illustrate the growth of God's Kingdom. Small acts of faith and
obedience can have a huge impact on God's plan for humanity (see also
13:22-30 - Jesus teaches about the narrow gate, emphasizing that many
will try to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but few will be saved.
Salvation requires effort, genuine repentance, and a transformed life
