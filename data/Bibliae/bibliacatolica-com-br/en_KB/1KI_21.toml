"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now turn we to the vineyard at Jezrahel, which belonged to Naboth
the Jezrahelite, close to Achab’s palace, that was King of Samaria.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Give me that vineyard of thine, Achab said to Naboth, so near
adjoining my house, to make a herb-garden of it. In its place, I will
give thee a better vineyard of my own, or its worth in money, if that
likes thee better.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The Lord be merciful to me, Naboth answered; should I give thee the
land that was my fathers’ patrimony?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And at that, Achab went home sullen and ill to cross, only because
Naboth had refused to give up his fathers’ patrimony. Down on his bed
he lay, face to wall, and would take no food.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So his wife Jezabel came in to see him, and know what ailed him,
that he should refuse to eat;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and he told her the story, how he had offered Naboth the Jezrahelite
a sum of money for his vineyard, or a better vineyard, if he would, in
place of it, and Naboth had refused to give the vineyard up.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` A fine king thou art, she said, as ever ruled in Israel! Up with
thee, and eat, set thy heart at rest; I will give thee the vineyard of
Naboth the Jezrahelite.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then she wrote a letter in Achab’s name, sealing it with his own
seal, and despatched it to the elders and chief men that were Naboth’s
fellow-citizens.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The tenour of it was this; They were to proclaim a solemn fast, and
where the greatest of the townspeople sat, there must be a seat for
Naboth.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then two rogues must be suborned to bear false witness against him,
accusing him of blasphemous speech about God and the king; and so they
were to have him out, and stone him to death.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So the elders and chief men, Naboth’s fellow-citizens, obeyed the
instructions Jezabel’s letter had given them;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` they proclaimed a fast, and would have Naboth sit among the
greatest of the townspeople;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and there, opposite him, sat two rogues, whom they had brought in
to that end. These, like the slanderers they were, accused Naboth of
cursing God and the king; whereupon he was led out beyond the city
walls, and stoned to death.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then a message was sent to Jezabel, telling her how Naboth had died
by stoning;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and no sooner had she heard of his death, than she bade the king
bestir himself. Take for thy own, she said, the vineyard which Naboth
the Jezrahelite would not sell thee; Naboth is dead, and can thwart thy
will no longer.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And away went Achab to take possession of Naboth’s vineyard; Naboth
was dead.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thereupon the word of the Lord came to Elias the Thesbite,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Up, and go to meet Achab, king of Israel, that dwells in Samaria;
thou wilt find him now in the vineyard of Naboth; he has gone to take
possession of it.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And this message thou wilt give him from the Lord: Wouldst thou
slay, and dispossess the slain? Then tell him, Thus says the Lord,
Here, where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick thine.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Here is one comes to seek me out, was Achab’s greeting, that is no
friend of mine. Seek thee out I must, said he, to tell thee thou art a
slave. Thou hast given thyself up to such doings as are hateful in the
Lord’s sight.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And hateful is the ruin I mean to bring on thee, sweeping away
every trace of thee; every male of Achab’s house shall die, be he
bondman or free man in the realm of Israel.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` No better shall thy race fare than Jeroboam’s, that was son of
Nabat, or Baasa’s, that was son of Ahia; thou too hast earned my
displeasure, thou too hast taught Israel to sin.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And of Jezabel the Lord said, Here, in the purlieus of Jezrahel,
the dogs shall have Jezabel for their food.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As for Achab, die he in the city, he shall be food for the dogs,
die he in the open country, he shall be food for all the birds of
heaven.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Never was such another as Achab, that gave himself up to doings
hateful in the Lord’s sight, his wife Jezabel prompting him;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` very foully he did, in paying worship to the false gods of those
Amorrhites whom the Lord dispossessed to make room for Israel.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Yet Achab, when he heard Elias’ warning, tore his garments and
clothed himself in sackcloth, fasted and made sackcloth his bed, and
went ever with head bowed,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` till the Lord sent this word to Elias the Thesbite:
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Achab, as thou seest, humbles his pride before me. Humbled for my
sake, he shall have this reward; the doom shall not fall in his days. I
will wait till his son is on the throne, and then bring calamity upon
all his race.

Notas de rodapé:
21:1-4 - Ahab desires Naboth's vineyard, but Naboth refuses to sell it
because of Israel's inheritance law. Naboth's faithfulness to God's Law
contrasts with Ahab's selfish desire and greed, revealing the conflict
12:15).
21:5-10 - Ahab's wife, Jezebel, plots Naboth's death to satisfy the
king's desire. This evil act of conspiracy and murder highlights the
corruption of power and the wickedness of the human heart (see also
21:17-19 - God sends Elijah to confront Ahab after the murder of
Naboth. Elijah's prophecy against Ahab and Jezebel reveals that no one
is above God's justice, not even the king. This underscores the
21:25-26 - The Bible emphasizes that Ahab was Israel's worst king,
incited by Jezebel to commit abominations. His life is an example of
how persistent sin and evil influence can corrupt an entire nation (see
21:27-29 - Ahab, repentant, humbles himself before God upon hearing
Elijah's condemnation. God, in His mercy, postpones full judgment on
his house. This shows that even the worst of sinners can experience
