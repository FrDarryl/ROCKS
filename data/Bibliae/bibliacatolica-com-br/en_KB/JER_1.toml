'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The word of the Lord came to me, and his message was:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I claimed thee for my own before ever I fashioned thee in thy
mother’s womb; before ever thou camest to the birth, I set thee apart
for myself; I have a prophet’s errand for thee among the nations.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Alas, alas, Lord God (said I), I am but a child that has never
learned to speak.

brewing for all thy fellow-countrymen.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` All the tribes the northern kings rule I mean to muster, the Lord
says; hither they will march, and each will set up his throne where
gate of Jerusalem stands, or encircling wall, or fortified city of
Juda.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And there I will plead my cause against the men of Juda, charging

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Up, then, gird thee like a man, and speak out all the message I
give thee. Meet them undaunted, and they shall have no power to daunt
thee.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Strong I mean to make thee this day as fortified city, or pillar of

the Lord says, to deliver thee?
