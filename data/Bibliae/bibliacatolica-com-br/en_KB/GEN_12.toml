thy kinsfolk, and thy father’s home, and come away into a land I will
shew thee.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then I will make a great people of thee; I will bless thee, and make

nephew, Lot. Abram was seventy-five years old✻ at the time when he left
Haran,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` took his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot with him, all the possessions
they had acquired in Haran, and all the retainers born in their service
there, and set out for the land of Chanaan. When they reached it,

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Abram went across country as far as Sichem and the Valley of Clear
Seeing.✻ Those were the days when the Chanaanites still dwelt in the
land.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And sure enough, as soon as Abram set foot in Egypt, the Egyptians
remarked the great beauty of his wife,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` and Pharao was told of her by his courtiers, who sang her praises
to him. So Sarai was carried off to Pharao’s court,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and Abram, for her sake, was well treated; he had no lack of sheep,
oxen, and asses, of men and maid servants, of she-asses, too, and
camels.

Enough; here is thy wife, take her and begone.

wife and all his possessions.
