mischief, and give the city ruinous counsel.

snug here as meat in a cooking-pot.✻

"5" = ''':sup:`5` With that, the spirit of the Lord came full upon me, and bade me
speak. This message I gave them from the Lord of hosts, These are your
own words, men of Israel; can I not read your hearts?

"6" = ''':sup:`6` So many done to death in this city, you have filled all the streets
of it with bodies of the slain!

"13" = ''':sup:`13` So, in my vision, I prophesied, and while I was prophesying,
Pheltias the son of Banaias sank down dead. Thereupon I fell face to
earth, crying aloud, Alas, alas, Lord God, wilt thou take full toll of
the remnant left to Israel?

"14" = ''':sup:`14` But the Lord’s answer came to me:

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thou hast brethren, son of man, thou hast brethren still. They are
nearest of kin to thee that are far away, exiled sons of Israel. What
