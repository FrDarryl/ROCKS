"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now, brethren, I appeal to you by God’s mercies to offer up your
bodies as a living sacrifice, consecrated to God and worthy of his
acceptance; this is the worship due from you as rational creatures.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And you must not fall in with the manners of this world; there must
be an inward change, a remaking of your minds, so that you can satisfy
yourselves what is God’s will, the good thing, the desirable thing, the
perfect thing.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Thus, in virtue of the grace that is given me, I warn every man who
is of your company not to think highly of himself, beyond his just
estimation, but to have a sober esteem of himself, according to the
measure of faith which God has apportioned to each.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Each of us has one body, with many different parts, and not all
these parts have the same function;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` just so we, though many in number, form one body in Christ, and each
acts as the counterpart of another.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The spiritual gifts we have differ, according to the special grace
which has been assigned to each. If a man is a prophet, let him
prophesy as far as the measure of his faith will let him.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The administrator must be content with his administration, the
teacher, with his work of teaching,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` the preacher, with his preaching.✻ Each must perform his own task
well; giving alms with generosity, exercising authority with anxious
care, or doing works of mercy smilingly.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Your love must be a sincere love; you must hold what is evil in
abomination, fix all your desire upon what is good.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Be affectionate towards each other, as the love of brothers
demands, eager to give one another precedence.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I would see you unwearied in activity, aglow with the Spirit,
waiting like slaves upon the Lord;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` buoyed up by hope, patient in affliction, persevering in prayer;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` providing generously for the needs of the saints, giving the
stranger a loving welcome.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Bestow a blessing on those who persecute you; a blessing, not a
curse.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Rejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with the mourner.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Live in harmony of mind, falling in with the opinions of common
folk, instead of following conceited thoughts; never give yourselves
airs of wisdom.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Do not repay injury with injury; study your behaviour in the
world’s sight as well as in God’s.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Keep peace with all men, where it is possible, for your part.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Do not avenge yourselves, beloved; allow retribution to run its
course; so we read in scripture, Vengeance is for me, I will repay,
says the Lord.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Rather, feed thy enemy if he is hungry, give him drink if he is
thirsty; by doing this, thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Do not be disarmed by malice; disarm malice with kindness.✻
