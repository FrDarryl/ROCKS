"1" = ''':sup:`1` Are you prepared to go to law before a profane court, when one of
you has a quarrel with another, instead of bringing it before the
saints?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` You know well enough that it is the saints who will pass judgement
on the world; and if a world is to abide your judgement, are you unfit
to take cognizance of trifling matters?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` You have been told that we shall sit in judgement on angels; how
much more, then, over the things of common life?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` You would do better to appoint the most insignificant of your own
number as judges, when you have these common quarrels to decide.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` That I say to humble you. What, have you really not a single man
among you wise enough to decide a claim brought by his own brother?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Must two brethren go to law over it, and before a profane court?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And indeed, it is a defect in you at the best of times, that you
should have quarrels among you at all. How is it that you do not prefer
to put up with wrong, prefer to suffer loss?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Instead of that you commit wrong, you inflict loss, and at a
brother’s expense.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Yet you know well enough that wrong-doers will not inherit God’s
kingdom. Make no mistake about it; it is not the debauched, the
idolaters, the adulterous,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` it is not the effeminate, the sinners against nature, the
dishonest, the misers, the drunkards, the bitter of speech, the
extortioners that will inherit the kingdom of God.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` That is what some of you once were; but now you have been washed
clean, now you have been sanctified, now you have been justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus, by the Spirit of the God we serve.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I am free to do what I will; yes, but not everything can be done
without harm. I am free to do what I will, but I must not abdicate my
own liberty.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Food is meant for our animal nature, and our animal nature claims
its food; true enough, but then, God will bring both one and the other
to an end. But your bodies are not meant for debauchery, they are meant
for the Lord, and the Lord claims your bodies.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And God, just as he has raised our Lord from the dead, by his great
power will raise us up too.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Have you never been told that your bodies belong to the body of
Christ? And am I to take what belongs to Christ and make it one with a
harlot? God forbid.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Or did you never hear that the man who unites himself to a harlot
becomes one body with her? The two, we are told, will become one
flesh.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Whereas the man who unites himself to the Lord becomes one spirit
with him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Keep clear, then, of debauchery. Any other sin a man commits,
leaves the body untouched, but the fornicator is committing a crime
against his own body.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Surely you know that your bodies are the shrines of the Holy
Spirit, who dwells in you. And he is God’s gift to you, so that you are
no longer your own masters.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` A great price was paid to ransom you; glorify God by making your
bodies the shrines of his presence.✻

Notas de rodapé:

6:12-20 - Paul teaches that the Christian's body is a temple of the
Holy Spirit and should therefore be treated with respect. He condemns
