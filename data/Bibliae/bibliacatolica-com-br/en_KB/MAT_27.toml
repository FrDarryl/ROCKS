[27]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` At day-break, all the chief priests and elders of the people laid
their plans for putting Jesus to death,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and they led him away in bonds, and gave him up to the governor,
Pontius Pilate.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And now Judas, his betrayer, was full of remorse at seeing him
condemned, so that he brought back to the chief priests and elders
their thirty pieces of silver;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I have sinned, he told them, in betraying the blood of an innocent
man. What is that to us? they said. It concerns thee only.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Whereupon he left them, throwing down the pieces of silver there in
the temple, and went and hanged himself.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The chief priests, thus recovering the money, said, It must not be
put in the treasury, since it is the price of blood;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and after consultation, they used it to buy the potter’s field, as a
burial place for strangers;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` it is upon that account that the field has been called Haceldama,
the field of blood, to this day.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And so the word was fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet
Jeremy, when he said, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the
price of one who was appraised, for men of the race of Israel appraised
him,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and bestowed them upon the potter’s field, as the Lord had bidden
me.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked him,
Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus told him, Thy own lips have said
it.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And when the chief priests and elders brought their accusation
against him, he made no answer.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Pilate said to him, Dost thou not hear all the testimony they
bring against thee?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But Jesus would not answer any of their charges, so that the
governor was full of astonishment.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` At the festival, the governor used to grant to the multitude the
liberty of any one prisoner they should choose;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and there was one notable prisoner then in custody, whose name was
Barabbas;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` so, when they gathered about him, Pilate asked them, Whom shall I
release? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He knew well that they had only given him up out of malice;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and even as he sat on the judgement-seat, his wife had sent him a
message, Do not meddle with this innocent man; I dreamed to-day that I
suffered much on his account.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But the chief priests and elders had persuaded the multitude to ask
for Barabbas and have Jesus put to death;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and so, when the governor openly asked them, Which of the two would
you have me release? they said, Barabbas.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Pilate said to them, What am I to do, then, with Jesus, who is
called Christ? They said, Let him be crucified.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And when the governor said, Why, what wrong has he done? they cried
louder than ever, Let him be crucified.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And so, finding that his good offices went for nothing, and the
uproar only became worse, Pilate sent for water and washed his hands in
full sight of the multitude, saying as he did so, I have no part in the
death of this innocent man; it concerns you only.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And the whole people answered, His blood be upon us, and upon our
children.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And with that he released Barabbas as they asked; Jesus he
scourged, and gave him up to be crucified.✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` After this, the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the palace, and
gathered the whole of their company about him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` First they stripped him, and arrayed him in a scarlet cloak;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` then they put on his head a crown which they had woven out of
thorns, and a rod in his right hand, and mocked him by kneeling down
before him, and saying, Hail, king of the Jews.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And they spat upon him, and took the rod from him and beat him over
the head with it.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` At last they had done with mockery; stripping him of the scarlet
cloak, they put his own garments on him, and led him away to be
crucified.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` As for his cross, they forced a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, whom
they met on their way out, to carry it;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and so they reached a place called Golgotha, that is, the place
named after a skull.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Here they offered him a draught of wine, mixed with gall, which he
tasted, but would not drink,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and then crucified him, dividing his garments among them by casting
lots. The prophecy must be fulfilled, They divide my spoils among them,
cast lots for my garments.✻
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` There, then, they sat, keeping guard over him.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Over his head they set a written proclamation of his offence, This
is Jesus, the king of the Jews;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and with him they crucified two thieves, one on his right and one
on his left.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The passers-by blasphemed against him, tossing their heads;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Come now, they said, thou who wouldst destroy the temple and build
it up in three days, rescue thyself; come down from that cross, if thou
art the Son of God.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` The chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him in the
same way.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` He saved others, they said, he cannot save himself. If he is the
king of Israel, he has but to come down from the cross, here and now,
and we will believe in him.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He trusted in God; let God, if he favours him, succour him now; he
told us, I am the Son of God.✻
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Even the thieves who were crucified with him uttered the same
taunts.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` From the sixth hour onwards there was darkness over all the earth
until the ninth hour;✻
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, Eli,
Eli, lamma sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?✻
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Hearing this, some of those who stood by said, He is calling upon
Elias:
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` and thereupon one of them ran to fetch a sponge, which he filled
with vinegar and fixed upon a rod, and offered to let him drink;
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` the rest said, Wait, let us see whether Elias is to come and save
him.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up his
spirit.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` And all at once, the veil of the temple was torn this way and that
from the top to the bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks parted
asunder;
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` and the graves were opened, and many bodies arose out of them,
bodies of holy men gone to their rest:
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` who, after his rising again, left their graves and went into the
holy city, where they were seen by many.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` So that the centurion and those who kept guard over Jesus with him,
when they perceived the earthquake and all that befell, were overcome
with fear; No doubt, they said, but this was the Son of God.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` Many women stood watching from far off; they had followed Jesus
from Galilee, to minister to him;
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` among them were Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and
Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` And now it was evening, and a man came forward, by name Joseph, a
rich man from Arimathea, who followed Jesus as a disciple like the
rest;
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` he it was who approached Pilate, and asked to have the body of
Jesus; whereupon Pilate ordered that the body should be given up.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Joseph took possession of the body, and wrapped it in a clean
winding-sheet;
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` then he buried it in a new grave, which he had fashioned for
himself out of the rock, and left it there, rolling a great stone
against the grave-door.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` When he had gone, there were two who sat on there opposite the
tomb, Mary Magdalen and the other Mary with her.✻
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` Next day, the next after the day of preparation, the chief priests
and the Pharisees gathered in Pilate’s presence,
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` and said, Sir, we have recalled it to memory that this deceiver,
while he yet lived, said, I am to rise again after three days.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` Give orders, then, that his tomb shall be securely guarded until
the third day; or perhaps his disciples will come and steal him away.
If they should then say to the people, He has risen from the dead, this
last deceit will be more dangerous than the old.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` Pilate said to them, You have guards; away with you, make it secure
as you best know how.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` And they went and made the tomb secure, putting a seal on the stone
and setting a guard over it.

Notas de rodapé:
27:1-10 - Judas's betrayal and repentance illustrate the gravity of sin
and the pain that accompanies unresolved guilt. His tragic death also
reflects the importance of genuine repentance and seeking forgiveness
27:27-31 - Jesus' humiliation by the Roman troops reveals His physical
and emotional suffering on behalf of humanity. He, being innocent,
takes the place of sinners, fulfilling His mission of salvation (see
27:45-54 - Jesus' death and supernatural phenomena, such as the
darkness and the earthquake, confirm His identity as the Son of God.
His death on the cross was an act of redemption for humanity, opening
