oath, and can bear witness of what he has seen or known, yet witness he
bears none; he must pay the penalty.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` A man may have touched what has been killed by a wild beast or has
fallen dead, or the carcase of a reptile,✻ or some other unclean thing,
unaware of his defilement at the time; yet he has incurred guilt by the
fault.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Or he has touched some defilement of the human body; there are many
such; he may be unaware of it till afterwards, but he has incurred
guilt.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Or he has taken an oath, pronounced with the lips, to do this or
that;✻ he has given his pledged word, and then forgotten that he gave
it, but remembers it afterwards.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` For all such faults as these a man must do penance,✻

"6" = ''':sup:`6` offering up a ewe-lamb or a she-goat from his flock; so the priest
will make intercession to have his fault pardoned.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` If he has no beast to give, he must offer two turtle-doves, or two
young pigeons to the Lord instead, one in amends for his fault, and the
other as a burnt-sacrifice.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` The priest, when these are brought to him, will offer the first as a
transgression-victim, bending its head right back to the wings, but so
that it is still attached to the neck, not completely severed,

he will allow to drip down at the altar’s foot, to make amends for the
transgression.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` If he cannot even lay his hand on two turtle-doves, or two young
pigeons, the transgression-offering must be a tenth of a bushel of
flour; but he will not mix oil with it, or lay incense on it; this is
an offering for transgression.

on the altar, as a token-sacrifice for the man who brought it,

priest will keep as his own offering.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And this, too, was a commandment which the Lord gave Moses:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If anyone commits a fault by inadvertence, defrauding the Lord of
his due over things consecrated, he must make amends for his guilt by
offering a ram without blemish out of his flock, such a ram as is worth
two silver pieces by sanctuary reckoning.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` He must also make restitution of the sum that is lacking, and a
fifth part of it besides, handing this to the priest, who will make
intercession for him when he offers up the ram, and win him pardon.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Or, if the fault of inadvertence lies only in disobeying the law,
it is enough that, when he becomes aware of his guilt,✻

"18" = ''':sup:`18` he should bring the priest a ram without blemish out of his flock,
of greater or less worth as the fault demands. And the priest shall
intercede for the unwitting transgressor, winning him pardon
