"1" = ''':sup:`1` Six days afterwards Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John
with him, and led them up on to a high mountain where they were alone.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he was transfigured in their presence, his face shining like the
sun, and his garments becoming white as snow;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and all at once they had sight of Moses and Elias conversing with
him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then Peter said aloud to Jesus, Lord, it is well that we should be
here; if it pleases thee, let us make three arbours in this place, one
for thee, one for Moses and one for Elias.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Even before he had finished speaking, a shining cloud overshadowed
them. And now, there was a voice which said to them out of the cloud,
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; to him, then,
listen.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The disciples, when they heard it, fell on their faces, overcome
with fear;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` but Jesus came near and roused them with his touch; Arise, he said,
do not be afraid.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And they lifted up their eyes, and saw no man there but Jesus only.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus warned them,
Do not tell anybody of what you have seen, until the Son of Man has
risen from the dead.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And his disciples asked him, Tell us, why is it that the scribes
say Elias must come before Christ?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He answered, Elias must needs come and restore all things as they
were;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but I tell you this, that Elias has come already, and they did not
recognize him, but misused him at their pleasure, just as the Son of
Man is to suffer at their hands.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the disciples understood that he had been speaking to them of
John the Baptist.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When they reached the multitude, a man came up and knelt before
him: Lord, he said, have pity on my son, who is a lunatic, and in great
affliction; he will often throw himself into the fire, and often into
water.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I brought him here to thy disciples, but they have not been able to
cure him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Jesus answered, Ah, faithless and misguided generation, how long
must I be with you, how long must I bear with you? Bring him here
before me.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Jesus checked him with a word, and the devil came out of him;
and from that hour the boy was cured.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Afterwards, when they were alone, the disciples came to Jesus and
asked, Why was it that we could not cast it out?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Jesus said to them, Because you had no faith. I promise you, if you
have faith, though it be but like a grain of mustard seed, you have
only to say to this mountain, Remove from this place to that, and it
will remove; nothing will be impossible to you.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But there is no way of casting out such spirits as this except by
prayer and fasting.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` While they were still together in Galilee, Jesus told them, The Son
of Man is to be given up into the hands of men.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` They will put him to death, and he will rise again on the third
day. And they were overcome with sorrow.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And when they reached Capharnaum, the collectors of the Temple
pence approached Peter, and asked, Does not your master pay the Temple
pence?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Yes, he said. Soon afterwards he came into the house, and Jesus
forestalled him; Simon, he said, tell us what thou thinkest; on whom do
earthly kings impose customs and taxes, on their own sons, or on
strangers?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` On strangers, Peter told him; and Jesus said to him, Why then, the
children go free.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But we will not hurt their consciences; go down to the sea, and
cast thy hook; take out the first fish thou drawest up, and when thou
hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a silver coin there; with this
make payment to them for me and for thyself.

Notas de rodapé:
17:1-2 - Jesus' transfiguration on the mountain is a pivotal moment in
which He reveals His divinity to His disciples. The presence of Moses
and Elijah points to the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in
17:3-4 - Peter's proposal to build three tents reflects his desire to
prolong that moment of glory. However, God's voice from heaven reveals
that Jesus is the beloved Son, and the only right response is to listen
17:5-9 - The Father's voice confirms that Jesus is His beloved Son and
commands the disciples to listen to Him. After the transfiguration,
Jesus instructs the disciples not to tell the vision until He is
resurrected, pointing to the mystery of His death and resurrection (see
17:14-21 - Jesus heals a boy possessed by an evil spirit, and His
rebuke of the disciples for their lack of faith highlights the
17:24-27 - The temple tax issue is resolved by Jesus miraculously, with
the fish that brings the necessary coin. This demonstrates Christ's
sovereignty over all things, including religious authorities (see also
