Notas de rodapé:
19:1-9 - The division of the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon within
the inheritance of Judah reflects the complexity of tribal
relationships. This narrative shows how God is sovereign in the
distribution of blessings and how unity is fundamental among the tribes

highlighting the importance of geography in tribal identity. Location
is a crucial part of the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel and
demonstrates His providence in every detail (see also Deuteronomy
19:17-23 - The inheritance of the tribe of Issachar reveals the
diversity of the land and God's sovereignty in distributing blessings
according to His plan. Geography and cultural identity are fundamental
19:24-31 - The description of the inheritance of the tribe of Asher
highlights the need for faithfulness and commitment to God. Each tribe
is called to fulfill its role within God's plan for the nation (see
19:32-51 - The summary of the tribal divisions and the mention of the
cities of refuge emphasize the importance of justice and protection
within the Israelite community. God establishes a system that reflects
19:1-3).
