"1" = ''':sup:`1` Amasias was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne, and
his reign at Jerusalem lasted twenty-nine years; his mother’s name was
Joadan, a woman of Jerusalem.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This Amasias obeyed the Lord’s will, but not with full obedience.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Once his power was firmly established, he put his father’s murderers
to death,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` but not their children; the Lord’s injunction, laid down by the
terms of Moses’ law, was that a father must not die for his son’s
guilt, or a son for his father’s; no guilt but his own should bring a
man to death.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then he mustered the whole of Juda, marshalling them by their clans,
and appointing commanders and captains for the whole of Juda and
Benjamin. When the count was taken of all that were above the age of
twenty, he found himself in command of three hundred thousand fighting
men, armed with spear and shield.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` To these he added a force of a hundred thousand warriors from
Israel, hired for a hundred talents of silver.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But now a messenger from God came and told him, My lord king, this
force of Israelites must not march with thee; to Israel, to the whole
kingdom of Ephraim, the Lord denies his aid.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Count as thou wilt on the strength of thy array, God will give thy
enemies the mastery; he alone sends victory and defeat.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when Amasias asked what was to become of the hundred talents he
had spent on the mercenaries from Israel, the answer came, Worse losses
yet the Lord can make good to thee.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Thereupon Amasias drew off the Israelite troops and bade them go
home; go home they did, but full of indignation against Juda.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And he, with renewed confidence, led his own army out to the Valley
of the Salt-pits, where they killed a thousand Edomites on the field;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` ten thousand more they captured alive, and took them to a steep
rock, from whose summit they threw them down headlong, so that all were
dashed to pieces.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But meanwhile the army which Amasias had sent home, instead of
taking them into battle with him, scattered here and there among the
cities of Juda, all the way (from Samaria)✻ to Bethoron, killing three
thousand of the inhabitants, and carrying away great store of plunder.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` After this victory over the Edomites, Amasias brought home with him
some of the idols men worshipped there in Seir; and these gods he made
his own, worshipping them himself and burning incense before them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the Lord, much angered with him, sent a prophet to ask, What
gods are these thou worshippest, that could not rescue their own people
from thy onslaught?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He answered, What, wouldst thou be the king’s counsellor? Peace, or
thy life shall pay for it! And the prophet said, as he turned to go, So
much ill done, and no heed paid to my counsel! Certain it is the Lord
has doomed thee to die.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And now Amasias, upon ill advice taken, sent a challenge to Joas,
son of Joachaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, Come, let us have a trial
of strength!
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And this message he had in answer: Said Lebanon thistle to Lebanon
cedar, Let my son have thy daughter to wife. But down came wild beasts
from Lebanon forest, and all the thistle got was, he was trampled
underfoot.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` At the thought of thy victory over Edom, thy heart is puffed up
with pride. Keep thyself at home, do not invite disaster, to thy own
and Juda’s ruin.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Amasias would have his way; the Lord’s will was that he should
fall into his enemy’s hands, to punish him for worshipping the gods of
Edom.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Joas, king of Israel, marched out, and they faced one another
while Amasias, king of Juda, was still in his own territory, at
Bethsames;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` here the men of Juda were routed by the Israelites, and scattered
to their homes in flight.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thus Amasias, son of Joas, son of Joachaz, king of Juda, was
captured by Joas king of Israel at Bethsames, and taken back to his own
city of Jerusalem; where Joas made a breach in the wall four hundred
cubits long, from the gate of Ephraim to the Corner gate,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` carried off all the gold and silver and other ware that was to be
found in the temple, in the treasury of Obededom, and in the royal
treasury, took hostages besides, and so made his way back to Samaria.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Amasias, son of Joas, king of Juda, survived this Joas, son of
Joachaz, king of Israel, but fifteen years.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` What else Amasias did, first and last, is set down in the Record of
the kings of Israel and Juda.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But ever since he forsook the Lord, fresh troubles befell him. A
conspiracy was made against him in Jerusalem, and when he fled to
Lachis they sent in pursuit of him and put him to death there;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` afterwards his body was brought back to Jerusalem in a
horse-litter, and there buried with his fathers in David’s Keep.✻

Notas de rodapé:
25:1-4 - Amaziah, son of Joash, begins his reign and seeks to do what
is right, but not with a sincere heart. This shows that the appearance
of righteousness does not replace the need for a heart truly committed
25:5-10 - Amaziah hires mercenary soldiers, but is warned by a prophet
not to trust them. This warning highlights the importance of depending
on God rather than relying on human strategies for battle (see also
25:11-16 - Amaziah defeats the Edomites and turns away, worshiping
their gods. This transition highlights the danger of allowing temporary
victories to lead to idolatry, reinforcing the need for continued
10:14).
25:17-24 - Amaziah confronts Joash, king of Israel, leading to a
disastrous battle. The dispute between the kingdoms illustrates the
consequences of a proud heart and a lack of respect for God's word (see
25:25-28 - Amaziah is defeated and murdered, ending his life in
unfaithfulness. This narrative serves as a warning about the cost of
straying and the importance of remaining faithful to the Lord to the
