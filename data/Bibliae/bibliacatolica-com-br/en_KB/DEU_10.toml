"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then it was the Lord said to me, Carve two tablets of stone, like
those others, and come to meet me at the top of Horeb.✻ Make an ark of
wood,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and put these tablets in it, when I have inscribed them with all the
contents of those other tablets thou didst break.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So I made an ark of acacia wood, and carved two fresh tablets like
the old;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` these I bore in my hands as I went up the mountain, and on these the
Lord wrote down, as he had written down before, the ten commandments he
gave you out of the heart of the flames, when the people were assembled
there.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` These, when I had come back from the mountain top, I laid up in the
ark which I had made, as the Lord had bidden me, and there they remain.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` (It was when the Israelites had moved their camp from Beeroth in the
Jacan country to Mosera that Aaron died, and his son Eleazar became
high priest instead;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` then they went on to Gadgad and to the well-watered valley of
Jetebaatha.)✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And now the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi, to carry the ark that
bears record of his covenant, and to minister in his presence, and to
impart blessing in his name, as they still do;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` that is why the Levites have no lands assigned to them like their
brethren, the Lord thy God has promised them that he himself will be
their portion.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Forty days and nights, then, as before, I remained there on the
mountain top, and once more the Lord listened to me, and spared you
from destruction.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` March on, he said, put thyself at the head of my people; they shall
enter and take possession of the land which was my promised gift to
their fathers.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` What return, then, Israel, does the Lord thy God ask of thee? This,
that thou shouldst fear the Lord thy God, and follow the path he
chooses for thee, and love him, and serve the Lord thy God with all thy
heart and soul,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and keep those divine commandments and observances I enjoin on thee
this day, as the conditions of thy happiness.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` This Lord God, that is master of the heavens, and the heaven above
the heavens, of earth, too, and of all that they contain,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` would yet knit thy fathers closely to him in his great love, and
make choice of you, their sons, above all other nations in the world;
the proof of it is before you.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` It is for you, then, to rid your hearts of defilement,✻ a
stiff-necked people no longer;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` the Lord your God is God of all gods, Lord of all lords, how great
a God, how strong, how terrible! He will not flatter the great, or take
bribes from the rich;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` he gives redress to the orphan and the widow; he is a friend of the
wanderer, and gives him food and clothing.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You too must befriend the wanderer; were not you strangers
yourselves in the land of Egypt?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve none but him, hold
close to him, and make thy vows in his name;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` he is all thy renown, this God of thine whose marvels and whose
judgements thy own eyes have witnessed.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When thy fathers made their way into Egypt, they were but seventy
souls, and now see what increase the Lord has given thee, so that thou
canst vie with the stars in heaven for number.

Notas de rodapé:
10:1-5 - God renews the tablets of the law, demonstrating His continued
commitment to Israel, even after their rebellion. This symbolizes the
10:12-13 - Moses calls Israel to obedience and fear of the Lord,
emphasizing that the relationship with God must be marked by love and
14:15).
10:14-16 - Moses reminds us that heaven and earth belong to the Lord,
and yet He chose Israel out of love. The call to "circumcise your
heart" means that true obedience must be internal, not just external
10:17-19 - God is described as impartial and just, a defender of
orphans, widows, and strangers. Moses instructs Israel to imitate this
justice by showing love and compassion to those in need (see also
10:20-22 - Israel is called to fear and serve God, remembering the
great works He performed in bringing them out of Egypt. Gratitude is a
central theme, and the relationship with God should be based on
12:24).
