God, the Lord of hosts, lean they for support.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` What happened in times past, I had foretold long before; warning was
uttered, and in the public ear; then, suddenly, I would set to work,
and the prophecy was fulfilled.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I knew well what an untamed creature thou art, neck stubborn as an
iron hawser, forehead intractable as bronze;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I would warn thee from the first, tell thee what was coming before

the will of idols thou didst carve and cast.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
48:1-2 - God denounces the hypocrisy of Israel, who invoke His name
without true righteousness. This criticism reflects the importance of
48:3-5 - God declares that He foretold future events to show that He is
the only God, for Israel was prone to attribute His works to idols.
48:9-11 - God withholds His wrath for His name’s sake, preserving
Israel to display His glory. This grace highlights God’s commitment to
48:17-18 - God presents Himself as Israel's Redeemer and laments that
His people failed to obey, which would have brought peace and
prosperity. Obedience results in divine blessings (see also Deuteronomy
48:20-21 - God calls His people out of Babylon, proclaiming deliverance
and divine faithfulness. This command reflects God's grace and
18:4).
