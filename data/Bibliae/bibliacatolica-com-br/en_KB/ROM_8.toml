"1" = ''':sup:`1` Well then, no judgement stands now against those who live in Christ
Jesus, not following the ways of flesh and blood.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The spiritual principle of life has set me free, in Christ Jesus,
from the principle of sin and of death.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` There was something the law could not do, because flesh and blood
could not lend it the power; and this God has done, by sending us his
own Son, in the fashion of our guilty nature, to make amends for our
guilt. He has signed the death-warrant of sin in our nature,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` so that we should be fully quit of the law’s claim, we, who follow
the ways of the spirit, not the ways of flesh and blood.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` To live the life of nature is to think the thoughts of nature; to
live the life of the spirit is to think the thoughts of the spirit;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and natural wisdom brings only death, whereas the wisdom of the
spirit brings life and peace.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` That is because natural wisdom is at enmity with God, not submitting
itself to his law; it is impossible that it should.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Those who live the life of nature cannot be acceptable to God;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but you live the life of the spirit, not the life of nature; that
is, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. A man cannot belong to Christ
unless he has the Spirit of Christ.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But if Christ lives in you, then although the body be a dead thing
in virtue of our guilt, the spirit is a living thing, by virtue of our
justification.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells
in you, he who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead will give life to
your perishable bodies too, for the sake of his Spirit who dwells in
you.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thus, brethren, nature has no longer any claim upon us, that we
should live a life of nature.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` If you live a life of nature, you are marked out for death; if you
mortify the ways of nature through the power of the Spirit, you will
have life.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Those who follow the leading of God’s Spirit are all God’s sons;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` the spirit you have now received is not, as of old, a spirit of
slavery, to govern you by fear; it is the spirit of adoption, which
makes us cry out, Abba, Father.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The Spirit himself thus assures our spirit, that we are children of
God;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and if we are his children, then we are his heirs too; heirs of
God, sharing the inheritance of Christ; only we must share his
sufferings, if we are to share his glory.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Not that I count these present sufferings as the measure of that
glory which is to be revealed in us.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If creation is full of expectancy, that is because it is waiting
for the sons of God to be made known.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Created nature has been condemned to frustration; not for some
deliberate fault of its own, but for the sake of him who so condemned
it, with a hope to look forward to;✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` namely, that nature in its turn will be set free from the tyranny
of corruption, to share in the glorious freedom of God’s sons.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The whole of nature, as we know, groans in a common travail all the
while.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And not only do we see that, but we ourselves do the same; we
ourselves, although we have already begun to reap our spiritual
harvest, groan in our hearts, waiting for that adoption which is the
ransoming of our bodies from their slavery.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` It must be so, since our salvation is founded upon the hope of
something. Hope would not be hope at all if its object were in view;
how could a man still hope for something which he sees?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And if we are hoping for something still unseen, then we need
endurance to wait for it.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Only, as before,✻ the Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness; when
we do not know what prayer to offer, to pray as we ought, the Spirit
himself intercedes for us, with groans beyond all utterance:
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and God, who can read our hearts, knows well what the Spirit’s
intent is; for indeed it is according to the mind of God that he makes
intercession for the saints.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Meanwhile, we are well assured that everything helps to secure the
good of those who love God, those whom he has called in fulfilment of
his design.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` All those who from the first were known to him, he has destined
from the first to be moulded into the image of his Son, who is thus to
become the eldest-born among many brethren.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So predestined, he called them; so called, he justified them; so
justified, he glorified them.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When that is said, what follows? Who can be our adversary, if God
is on our side?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He did not even spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all; and
must not that gift be accompanied by the gift of all else?
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Who will come forward to accuse God’s elect, when God acquits us?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Who will pass sentence against us, when Jesus Christ, who died,
nay, has risen again, and sits at the right hand of God, is pleading
for us?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will affliction, or
distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or peril, or the
sword?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For thy sake, says the scripture, we face death at every moment,
reckoned no better than sheep marked down for slaughter.✻
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Yet in all this we are conquerors, through him who has granted us
his love.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Of this I am fully persuaded; neither death nor life, no angels or
principalities or powers, neither what is present nor what is to come,
no force whatever,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` neither the height above us nor the depth beneath us, nor any other
created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which
comes to us in Christ Jesus our Lord.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
8:1-2 - There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, for
the law of the Spirit of life in Christ sets you free from the law of
sin and death. This verse highlights the transformation that occurs
8:5-11 - Those who live according to the flesh seek the things of the
flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit seek the things of
the Spirit. The presence of the Holy Spirit is vital to the new life in
8:14-17 - Christians are children of God, led by the Holy Spirit, and
have the promise of inheriting the Kingdom of God together with Christ.
Adoption as sons is one of the most profound blessings of salvation
8:18-25 - Present suffering is nothing compared to the future glory
that will be revealed in Christ. The hope of redemption is a central
theme in the Christian life, pointing to final glorification (see also
8:28-30 - God works all things together for the good of those who love
Him and are called according to His purpose. Predestination and divine
calling ensure that God's plan for Christians is fulfilled (see also
