"1" = ''':sup:`1` Afterwards, when he had made an end of saying all this, Jesus told
his disciples:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` You know that after two days the paschal feast is coming; it is then
that the Son of Man must be given up to be crucified.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` At this very time, the chief priests and the elders of the people
gathered in the court of the high priest, whose name was Caiphas;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and there they plotted to bring Jesus into their power by cunning,
and put him to death.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Yet they still said, Not on the day of the feast, or perhaps there
will be an uproar among the people.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But then, while Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper, at
Bethany,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` a woman came to him, with a pot of very precious ointment, and
poured it over his head as he sat at table.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The disciples were indignant when they saw it: What is the meaning
of this waste? they asked.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It would have been possible to sell this at a great price, and give
alms to the poor.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This Jesus knew, and said to them, Why do you vex the woman? She
did well to treat me so.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` You have the poor among you always; I am not always among you.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When she poured this ointment over my body, she did it to prepare
me for my burial;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and I promise you, in whatever part of the world this gospel is
preached, the story of what she has done shall be told in its place, to
preserve her memory.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And at that, one of the twelve, Judas who was called Iscariot, went
to the chief priests
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and asked them, What will you pay me for handing him over to you?
Whereupon they laid down thirty pieces of silver.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he, from that time onwards, looked about for an opportunity to
betray him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` ✻ On the first of the days of unleavened bread the disciples came
to Jesus and asked, Where wilt thou have us make ready for thee to eat
the paschal meal?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And Jesus said, Go into the city, find such a man, and tell him,
The Master says, My time is near; I and my disciples must keep the
paschal feast at thy house.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The disciples did as Jesus bade them, and made all ready for the
paschal meal there.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When evening came, he sat down with his twelve disciples,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and, while they were at table, he said, Believe me, one of you is
to betray me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` They were full of sorrow, and began to say, one after another,
Lord, is it I?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He answered, The man who has put his hand into the dish with me
will betray me.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The Son of Man goes on his way, as the scripture foretells of him;
but woe upon that man by whom the Son of Man is to be betrayed; better
for that man if he had never been born.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Judas, he who was betraying him, said openly, Master, is it I?
Jesus answered, Thy own lips have said it.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And while they were still at table, Jesus took bread, and blessed,
and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take, eat, this is
my body.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then he took a cup, and offered thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink, all of you, of this;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` for this is my blood, of the new testament, shed for many, to the
remission of sins.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And I tell you this, I shall not drink of this fruit of the vine
again, until I drink it with you, new wine, in the kingdom of my
Father.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And so they sang a hymn, and went out to mount Olivet.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` After this, Jesus said to them, To-night you will all lose courage
over me; for so it has been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of his flock will be scattered.✻
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But I will go on before you into Galilee, when I have risen from
the dead.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Peter answered him, Though all else should lose courage over thee,
I will never lose mine.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus said to him, Believe me, this night, before the cock crows,
thou wilt thrice disown me.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Peter said to him, I will never disown thee, though I must lay down
my life with thee. And all the rest of his disciples said the like.✻
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` So Jesus came, and they with him, to a plot of land called
Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples, Sit down here, while I go in
there and pray.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` But he took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. And now he grew
sorrowful and dismayed;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` My soul, he said, is ready to die with sorrow; do you abide here,
and watch with me.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` When he had gone a little further, he fell upon his face in prayer,
and said, My Father, if it is possible, let this chalice pass me by;
only as thy will is, not as mine is.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Then he went back to his disciples, to find them asleep; and he
said to Peter, Had you no strength, then, to watch with me even for an
hour?
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit
is willing enough, but the flesh is weak.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Then he went back again, and prayed a second time; and his prayer
was, My Father, if this chalice may not pass me by, but I must drink
it, then thy will be done.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And once more he found his disciples asleep when he came to them,
so heavy their eyelids were;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` this time he went away without disturbing them, and made his third
prayer, using the same words.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` After that he returned to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep
and take your rest hereafter; as I speak, the time draws near when the
Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.✻
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Rise up, let us go on our way; already, he that is to betray me is
close at hand.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And all at once, while he was speaking, Judas, who was one of the
twelve, came near; with him was a great multitude carrying swords and
clubs, who had been sent by the chief priests and the elders of the
people.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` The traitor had appointed them a signal; It is none other, he told
them, than the man whom I shall greet with a kiss; hold him fast.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` No sooner, then, had he come near to Jesus than he said, Hail,
Master, and kissed him.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Jesus said to him, My friend, on what errand hast thou come? Then
they came forward and laid their hands on Jesus, and held him fast.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` And at that, one of those who were with Jesus lifted a hand to draw
his sword, and smote one of the high priest’s servants with it, cutting
off his ear.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Whereupon Jesus said to him, Put thy sword back into its place; all
those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Dost thou doubt that if I call upon my Father, even now, he will
send more than twelve legions of angels to my side?
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` But how, were it so, should the scriptures be fulfilled, which have
prophesied that all must be as it is?
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` And Jesus said to the multitude at that hour, You have come out to
my arrest with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber; and yet I used
to sit teaching in the temple close to you, day after day, and you
never laid hands on me.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` All this was so ordained, to fulfil what was written by the
prophets. And now all his disciples abandoned him, and fled.✻
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` And those who had arrested Jesus led him away into the presence of
the high priest, Caiphas, where the scribes and the elders had
assembled.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Yet Peter followed him at a long distance, as far as the high
priest’s palace; where he went in and sat among the servants, to see
the end.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` The chief priests and elders and all the Council tried to find
false testimony against Jesus, such as would compass his death.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` But they could find none, although many came forward falsely
accusing him; until at last two false accusers came forward
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` who declared, This man said, I have power to destroy the temple of
God and raise it again in three days.✻
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` Then the high priest stood up, and asked him, Hast thou no answer
to make to the accusations these men bring against thee?
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` Jesus was silent; and the high priest said to him openly, I adjure
thee by the living God to tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son
of God?
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` Jesus answered, Thy own lips have said it. And moreover I tell you
this; you will see the Son of Man again, when he is seated at the right
hand of God’s power, and comes on the clouds of heaven.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` At this, the high priest tore his garments, and said, He has
blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Mark well, you have
heard his blasphemy for yourselves.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` What is your finding? And they answered, The penalty is death.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` Then they fell to spitting upon his face and buffeting him and
smiting him on the cheek,
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` saying as they did so, Shew thyself a prophet, Christ; tell us who
it is that smote thee.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` Meanwhile, Peter sat in the court without; and there a maid-servant
came up to him, and said, Thou too wast with Jesus the Galilean.
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` Whereupon he denied it before all the company; I do not know what
thou meanest.
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` And he went out into the porch, where a second maid-servant saw
him, and said, to the bystanders, This man, too, was with Jesus the
Nazarene.
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` And he made denial again with an oath, I know nothing of the man.
'''
"73" = ''':sup:`73` But those who stood there came up to Peter soon afterwards, and
said, It is certain that thou art one of them; even thy speech betrays
thee.
'''
"74" = ''':sup:`74` And with that he fell to calling down curses on himself and
swearing, I know nothing of the man; and thereupon the cock crew.
'''
"75" = ''':sup:`75` Then Peter remembered the word of Jesus, how he had said, Before
the cock crows, thou wilt thrice disown me; and he went out, and wept
bitterly.✻

Notas de rodapé:
26:1-5 - The chief priests and elders plot to secretly arrest Jesus.
This plan reveals the religious leaders' rejection of the Messiah and
the fulfillment of God's will, which is accomplished even through human
26:36-46 - Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane shows His anguish and submission
to the Father's will, despite His suffering. Prayer in times of crisis
teaches us to seek divine strength and to trust in God's plans, even

26:69-75 - Peter's denial before Jesus' judgment highlights human
weakness and the need for vigilance in faith. Even in his failings,
Peter is restored by Christ's grace, exemplifying forgiveness and
