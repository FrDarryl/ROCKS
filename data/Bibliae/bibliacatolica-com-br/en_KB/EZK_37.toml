"1" = ''':sup:`1` … The Lord’s power laid hold of me, and by the spirit of the Lord I
was carried away and set down in the midst of the plain, which was
covered with bones.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Round the whole extent of them he took me, where they lay thick on
the plain, all of them parched quite dry.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Son of man, he said, can life return to these bones? Lord God, said
I, thou knowest.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then he bade me utter a prophecy over the bones: Listen, dry bones,
to the word of the Lord.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` A message to these bones from the Lord: I mean to send my spirit
into you, and restore you to life.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Sinews shall be given you, flesh shall grow on you, and skin cover
you; and I will give you breath to bring you to life again; will you
doubt, then, the Lord’s power?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So I prophesied as he had bidden me, and as I prophesied a sound
came, and I felt a stirring, and the bones came together, each at its
proper joint;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` under my eyes the sinews and the flesh clothed them, and the skin
covered them, but there was no breath in them even now.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Son of man, he said, prophesy now to the breath of life; give the
breath of life itself this message from the Lord God: Come, breath of
life, from the four winds, and breathe on these slain men to make them
live.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So I prophesied as he had bidden me, and the breath of life came
into them, so that they lived again; and all rose to their feet, host
upon host of them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then he told me, Son of man, in these bones here thou seest the
whole race of Israel. They are complaining that their very bones have
withered away, that all hope is lost, they are dead men.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It is for thee to prophesy, giving them this message from the Lord
God: I mean to open your graves and revive you, my people; I mean to
bring you home to the land of Israel.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Will you doubt, then, the Lord’s power, when I open your graves and
revive you?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When I breathe my spirit into you, to give you life again, and bid
you dwell at peace in your own land? What the Lord promises, the Lord
performs; you will know that, he tells you, at last.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Son of man, take two pieces of wood, and write on one, For Juda,
and the tribes of Israel that take part with him; on the other, that is
the stick of Ephraim, write, For Joseph, and all the tribes of Israel
that take part with him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then join them together into the form of a single stick, so that
they are united in thy hand.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And when thy fellow-countrymen would have thee tell them what thou
meanest by all this,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` give them this message from the Lord: Here is this stick of Joseph
and his confederate tribes, with Ephraim at their head; I mean to join
it with Juda’s and make one stick of it; one stick now, and in my
hand.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And while thou art still holding the inscribed sticks, there in the
presence of thy fellow-countrymen,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` say this: A message from the Lord God! I mean to recall the sons of
Israel from their exile among the Gentiles, gather them from every side
and restore them to their home.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And there, in the hill-country of Israel, I will make one nation of
them, with one king over them all; no longer shall they be two nations
under two crowns.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` No more shall they be contaminated with idol-worship, and foul
rites, and forbidden things a many; I will deliver them from the lands✻
that were once the haunts of their sinning, and make them clean again;
they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` They shall have one king over them, a shepherd to tend them all, my
servant David; my will they shall follow, my commands remember and
obey.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And their home shall be the home of your fathers, the land I gave
to my servant Jacob; they and their children shall enjoy it, and their
children’s children, in perpetuity, and ever my servant David shall be
their prince.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` My covenant shall pledge them prosperity, a covenant that shall
never be revoked; I will make them …✻ and give them increase, and set
up my sanctuary in their midst for ever.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` My tabernacle over them; they my people, and I their God;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` proof to all the world that I, the Lord, have set Israel apart, I
that dwell apart in their midst for ever.

Notas de rodapé:
37:1-2 - The vision of the valley of dry bones symbolizes Israel's
spiritual death and desolation. God, by bringing life to these bones,

symbolizes the spiritual renewal He offers His people (see also
37:3-6 - God asks Ezekiel if bones can live, challenging the prophet's
faith. Ezekiel's answer, "You know," reflects his trust in God, who can

of living men. This event is a metaphor for the return and restoration
of Israel, who would be brought back to their land after the exile (see
