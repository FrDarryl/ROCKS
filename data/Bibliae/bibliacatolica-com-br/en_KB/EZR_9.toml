"1" = ''':sup:`1` When all this was done, a complaint was brought to me by the
chieftains, against priest and Levite and common folk alike. They had
not kept themselves apart from the old inhabitants of the land,
Chanaanite, Hethite, Pherezite, Jebusite, Ammonite, Moabite, Egyptian
and Amorrhite, or from their detestable practices;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` foreign wives and daughters-in-law had contaminated the sacred stock
of Israel, and the chief blame for this lay with the rulers and
magistrates themselves.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` At this news I tore cloak and tunic both, plucked hair from head and
beard, and sat there lamenting.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Such as feared God’s warnings, defied by these restored exiles,
rallied to my side; and still I sat lamenting until the time came for
the evening sacrifice.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then, at the time of the evening sacrifice, I rose up from my
posture of grief; cloak and tunic still torn about me, I fell on my
knees and stretched out my hands to the Lord my God.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And thus I prayed: O my God, I am all confusion, I am ashamed to
lift my eyes towards thee; so deep, head-deep, are we sunk in the flood
of our wrong-doing, so high, heaven-high, mounts the tale of our
transgressions.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Sinful fathers begot us, sinners are we to this day; in vain have we
fallen a prey, we and our kings and our priests, to the power of
Gentile kings, to massacre, exile, rapine, and the humiliation that is
with us now.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For a brief moment it seemed as if the Lord our God had listened to
our prayers; he would leave a remnant of our race surviving, leave us a
foot-hold✻ on this holy ground; some gleam of hope our God would afford
us, some breath of life in our bondage.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Slaves we were, but in our slavery the Lord did not abandon us; he
deigned to win us the favour of the Persian king; we were to live
still, the house of our God was to rise anew, restored from its ruins,
Juda and Jerusalem should have a wall to defend them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And now, O Lord our God, after all this, what plea can we offer?
Thy will stands defied.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` That will of thine, through thy servants the prophets, thou hast
made fully known to us. They warned us, The land in whose conquest you
are engaged is a heathen land, like heathen lands everywhere, unclean;
detestable rites have filled it to the brim with defilement.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Never a daughter of yours for their sons, never a daughter of
theirs for yours; never peace or good will between them and you, while
time lasts! So you shall rise to greatness, so you shall enjoy all the
blessings this land of yours can give, and bequeath them evermore to
your sons for their inheritance.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And now, after so much wrong-doing, such punishment for lives ill
lived, such pardon for our sins, and the deliverance that is with us
this day,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` should we turn back? Should we defy thy commandments, by mating
with these, the abominable? Oh, then indeed thy patience is at an end;
no remnant of us is to be left surviving!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Lord God of Israel, the fault is not with thee; that we are alive
to-day is proof of it. Ours is the fault; we stand before thee guilty,
and without excuse.
