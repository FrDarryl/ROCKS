Notas de rodapé:
2:1-3 - Zephaniah calls for Judah's collective repentance. The pursuit
of righteousness and humility is crucial to avoiding God's judgment.
True change begins with a repentant heart, turning to God in humility
2:4-7 - God's judgment is announced on Judah's neighboring nations,
such as the Philistines, Moab, and Ammonites. These nations are guilty
of arrogance and oppression, and divine judgment will extend to all
nations that practice wickedness. This teaches that God judges all
2:8-11 - The judgment on Moab and Ammon is detailed, highlighting how
attitudes of pride and arrogance will lead to their destruction. God's
sovereignty over all nations is reaffirmed, and His dominion is not
48:1-47).
2:12-15 - The destruction of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, is
prophesied. Nineveh was a proud and oppressive empire, and its judgment
will be an example of how arrogance before God results in downfall.
This judgment also applies to all human powers that rise up against God
