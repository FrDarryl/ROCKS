[27]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now word was given for the voyage to Italy, Paul being handed
over, with some other prisoners, to a centurion called Julius, who
belonged to the Augustan cohort.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` We embarked on a boat from Adrumetum which was bound for the Asiatic
ports, and set sail; the Macedonian, Aristarchus, from Thessalonica,
was with us.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Next day we put in at Sidon; and here Julius shewed Paul courtesy by
allowing him to visit his friends and be cared for.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then, setting sail, we coasted under the lee of Cyprus, to avoid
contrary winds,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` but made a straight course over the open sea that lies off Cilicia
and Pamphylia, and so reached Lystra in Lycia.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` There the centurion found a boat from Alexandria which was sailing
for Italy, and put us on board.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` We had a slow voyage for many days after this; we made Gnidus with
difficulty, and then, with the wind beating us back, had to sail under
the lee of Crete by way of Salmone.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Here we were hard put to it to coast along as far as a place called
Fair Havens, near the city of Thalassa.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Much time had now been wasted, and sailing had become dangerous; the
fast was already over; and Paul bade them make the best of it.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Sirs, he said, I can see plainly that there is no sailing now,
without injury and great loss, not only of our freight and of the
vessel, but of our own lives too.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The centurion, however, paid more attention to the helmsman and the
master than to Paul’s advice.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The harbour was not well placed for wintering in; so that more of
them gave their voices for sailing further still, in the hope of making
Phoenice and wintering there; it is a harbour in Crete, which faces in
the direction of the South-west and North-west winds.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` A light breeze was now blowing from the South, so that they thought
they had achieved their purpose, and coasted along Crete, leaving their
anchorage at Assos.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But it was not long before a gale of wind struck the ship, the wind
called Euraquilo;✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` she was carried out of her course, and could make no head against
the wind, so we gave up and let her drive.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` We now ran under the lee of an island named Cauda, where we
contrived, with difficulty, to secure the ship’s boat.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When it had been hoisted aboard, they strengthened the ship by
passing ropes round her; then, for fear of being driven on to the
Syrtis sands, they let down the sea-anchor, and so drifted.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` On the next day, so violently were we tossed about in the gale,
they lightened ship,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and on the third, they deliberately threw the spare tackle
overboard.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For several days we saw nothing of the sun or the stars, and a
heavy gale pressed us hard, so that we had lost, by now, all hope of
surviving;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and we were much in want of food. And now Paul stood up in their
presence, and said, Sirs, you should have taken my advice; if you had
not put out from Crete, you would have saved all this injury and
damage.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But I would not have you lose courage, even now; there is to be no
loss of life among you, only of the ship.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` An angel stood before me last night, sent by the God to whom I
belong, the God whom I serve,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and said, Have no fear, Paul, thou art to stand in Caesar’s
presence; and behold, God has granted thee the safety of all thy fellow
voyagers.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Have courage, then, sirs; I trust in God, believing that all will
fall out as he has told me.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Only we are to be cast up on an island.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` On the fourteenth night, as we drifted about in the Adriatic sea,✻
the crew began to suspect, about midnight, that we were nearing land;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` so they took soundings, and made it twenty fathom; then they
sounded again a short distance away, and made it fifteen fathom.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Afraid, therefore, that we might be cast ashore on some rocky
coast, they let down four anchors from the stern, and fell to wishing
it were day.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And now the sailors had a mind to abandon the ship, and lowered the
boat into the sea, pretending that they meant to lay out anchors from
the bows.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But Paul told the centurion and the soldiers, These must stay on
board, or there is no hope left for you;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` whereupon the soldiers cut the boat’s ropes away and let it drop.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` As day began to break, Paul entreated them all to take some food;
To-day, he said, is the fourteenth day you have been in suspense, and
all that time gone hungry, neglecting to eat;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` pray take some food, then; it will make for your preservation; not
a hair of anyone’s head is to be lost.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And with that he took bread, and gave thanks to God before them
all, and broke it, and began to eat.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Thereupon they all found courage, and themselves took a meal.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` The whole number of souls on board was two hundred and seventy six.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` So all ate till they were content; and afterwards they began to
lighten the ship, throwing the corn into the sea.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` When day broke, they found that the coast was strange to them. But
they sighted a bay with a sloping beach, and made up their minds, if it
should be possible, to run the ship ashore there.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` They lifted the anchors and trusted themselves to the mercy of the
sea, at the same time unlashing the tiller; then they hoisted the
foresail to the breeze, and held on for the shore.✻
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` But now, finding they were running into a cross-sea, they grounded
the ship where they were. The bows, which were stuck fast, felt no
movement, but the stern began falling to pieces under the violence of
the waves;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` whereupon the soldiers would have killed the prisoners, for fear
that any of them should dive overboard and escape,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` but the centurion balked them of their will, because he had a mind
to keep Paul safe. He gave orders that those who could swim should go
overboard first, and make their way to land;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` of the rest, some were ferried across on planks, and some on the
ship’s wreckage. So it was that all reached land in safety.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
27:1-12 - Paul embarks on a voyage to Rome, and the crew encounters
difficult weather. The storm that arises symbolizes the difficulties
Christians face in following Christ's mission, but God continues to
27:13-20 - The storm hits the ship, and the situation becomes
desperate. Paul, trusting in God, assures the safety of all on board,
27:21-26 - Paul delivers a message of encouragement to the crew,
assuring them that no one will be lost. The power of Paul's prophetic
word reflects the importance of listening to divine guidance in times
