"1" = ''':sup:`1` And thus Job continued to lay bare his thought:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Alas for the changes the months have brought with them! Alas for the
old days, when God was my protector,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` when his light shone above me, its rays guiding me through the
darkness!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Days of ripe manhood, when God was my home’s familiar guest,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` he, the Almighty, at my side! I had my children still about me;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` the milk frothed in pools at my feet, no rock so hard but my olives
bathed it in oil.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Went I to the city gate, there was my seat ready for me in the open
square;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` rose the young men to make place for me, rose the aged to do me
honour;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` nobles fell silent, and waited, finger on lip,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` words failed the chieftains, and counsel they gave no more.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` None heard the fame of me then, but called me a happy man; none
watched my doings then, but spoke in my praise.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Poor man nor helpless orphan cried to me in vain;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` how they blessed me, souls reprieved from instant peril; with what
comfort the widow’s heart rejoiced!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Dutiful observance was still the vesture I wore, my robe and crown
integrity;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` in me, the blind found sight, the lame strength,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` the poor a father. None so ready to give the stranger’s cause a
hearing,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` break open the fangs of the wrong-doer and snatch the prey from his
teeth.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Here, thought I, I have built myself a nest to die in; here, like
some palm-tree, I shall defy the years,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` palm-tree that spreads out its roots to the river-bank, on whose
leaves lodges the dew;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` my fame never diminishing, never worn out the bow I bear.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` How eagerly men hung upon my words, intent to learn what counsel I
would give,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` nor ventured to speak when I had done! A gracious influence my
words fell,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` like autumn rain or the spring showers on lips athirst.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Were they faint-hearted, they found me smiling still, and the
encouragement of my glance never failed them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Deigned I to be their leader, the first place was mine; yet ever
when I sat like a king with his retinue about him, I would comfort the
mourner’s tears.
