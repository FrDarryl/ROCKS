"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now, in heaven, a great portent appeared; a woman that wore the
sun for her mantle, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve
stars about her head.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` She had a child in her womb, and was crying out as she travailed, in
great pain of her delivery.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then a second portent appeared in heaven; a great dragon was there,
fiery-red, with seven heads and ten horns, and on each of the seven
heads a royal diadem;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` his tail dragged down a third part of the stars in heaven, and flung
them to earth. And he stood fronting the woman who was in childbirth,
ready to swallow up the child as soon as she bore it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` She bore a son, the son who is to herd the nations like sheep with a
crook of iron; and this child of hers was caught up to God, right up to
his throne,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` while the mother fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a
place of refuge for her, and there, for twelve hundred and sixty days,
she is to be kept safe.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Fierce war broke out in heaven, where Michael and his angels fought
against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought on their part,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` but could not win the day, or stand their ground in heaven any
longer;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` the great dragon, serpent of the primal age, was flung down to
earth; he whom we call the devil, or Satan, the whole world’s seducer,
flung down to earth, and his angels with him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then I heard a voice crying aloud in heaven, The time has come; now
we are saved and made strong, our God reigns, and power belongs to
Christ, his anointed; the accuser of our brethren is overthrown. Day
and night he stood accusing them in God’s presence;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but because of the Lamb’s blood and because of the truth to which
they bore witness, they triumphed over him, holding their lives cheap
till death overtook them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Rejoice over it, heaven, and all you that dwell in heaven; but woe
to you, earth and sea, now that the devil has come down upon you, full
of malice, because he knows how brief is the time given him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So the dragon, finding himself cast down to earth, went in pursuit
of the woman, the boy’s mother;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` but the woman was given two wings, such as the great eagle has, to
speed her flight into the wilderness, to her place of refuge, where for
a year, and two years, and half a year she will be kept hidden from the
serpent’s view.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thereupon the serpent sent a flood of water out of his mouth in
pursuit of the woman, to carry her away on its tide;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` but earth came to the woman’s rescue. The earth gaped wide, and
swallowed up this flood which the dragon had sent out of his mouth.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So, in his spite against the woman, the dragon went elsewhere to
make war on the rest of her children, the men who keep God’s
commandments, and hold fast to the truth concerning Jesus.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he stood there waiting on the sea beach.✻
