"1" = ''':sup:`1` This Darius saw fit to appoint a hundred and twenty lords
lieutenant, who should govern the provinces of his empire;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and over these, three viceroys, of whom Daniel was one; governor
should be answerable to viceroy, and the king’s grace should not be
troubled with such matters.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Yet governor was none or viceroy that could compare with Daniel, so
richly God inspired him;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and soon the king’s thought was, to put the whole empire under his
care. Right gladly would his rivals have found opportunity to discredit
him in the king’s eyes; but no, handle or pretext they could find none,
so faithful was he, so far removed from all breath of suspicion.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And at last they were fain to admit, if charge was to be found
against Daniel at all, keeping of his God’s law must be the ground of
it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So they took the king by surprise; Long life, they said, to the
king’s grace!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Here is a design upon which we are all agreed, viceroy and
magistrate and governor and senator and judge; that an edict should go
out under the royal seal forbidding thy subjects to make any request of
god or man these next thirty days, save only of thyself. And if any man
disobeys, it shall be at his peril; he is for the lion-pit.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` May it please the king’s grace to give this design of ours effect,
and make the decree unalterable, under law of the Medes and Persians,
the law there is no amending.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Draw up the edict he did, and signed it.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` As for Daniel, when he heard it was law, he took himself home; and
now as ever, three times a day, he would open his chamber window
towards Jerusalem eastwards, doing reverence on bended knee and
praising his God.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Be sure they surprised him at it, these enemies of his; found him
a-praying to his God,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and went off to remind the king of his edict. Had not a law been
enacted, prayer there should be none to god or man those thirty days
following, save to the king; and that on pain of the lions? Law it is,
said he, and law of the Medes and Persians there is no amending.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Why then, they asked the king, what of Daniel, Daniel the Jewish
exile, that for law and edict cares nothing? Three times a day he
offers his God prayer.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Pitiful hearing was this for the king’s ear; to save Daniel was all
his thought, and to that end he laboured till set of sun;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but the trap they had devised was too crafty for him, and ever they
put him in mind there was no help for it. By the law Medes and Persians
use, let the king once make a decree, there is no amending it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` At last the king gave orders Daniel should be sent for and shut up
in the lion-pit; So faithful a servant, he told him, thy God must needs
deliver.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And with that, a stone was brought and set down at the pit’s
entrance, which the king sealed and his nobles both; there should be no
interfering with Daniel.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Home went the king, and supperless to bed; he would have no food
brought him, and sleep he could not.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` With the first light of day, the king was up and stirring; to the
lion-pit he hastened,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and as he came up to it, he cried out most lamentably: Daniel,
worshipper of the God that lives, thou wert ever his true servant; has
power of his availed to rescue thee from the lions?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Long life to the king’s grace, Daniel answered;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` angel of his did his errand, and stopped the lions’ mouths. What
harm should they do me, one that my God sees guiltless? And for
thyself, lord king, nought did I to earn thy displeasure.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Right glad the king was to learn of Daniel’s safety; be sure he
gave orders they should bring Daniel up out of the pit, and out of the
pit they brought him, unscathed from head to foot; such reward they
have that trust in God.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thereupon, at the king’s bidding, they fetched his accusers, and
thrust them into the lion-pit, their wives and children with them. But
these never reached the floor of it, so quickly the lions fell upon
them, and broke all the bones of them to nothing.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Darius sent out a proclamation to all the world, without
distinction of nation, race or language, wishing them well,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and enjoining this decree upon them, that all the subjects of his
empire should hold the God of Daniel in awe and reverence. Here is a
God that lives, he told them, a God that abides for ever; such a reign
as his there is no overthrowing, such power as his the ages cannot
diminish.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` His to deliver, his to save, his to shew wondrous portents in high
heaven and on earth beneath, the God who saved Daniel from the lions.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Let Darius reign, or Cyrus the Persian, this same Daniel throve
yet.
