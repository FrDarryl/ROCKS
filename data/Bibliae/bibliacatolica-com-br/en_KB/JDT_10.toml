ground where she lay prostrate in the Lord’s presence,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` called her maidservant to her, and went downstairs into her house.
Flung aside, now, the sackcloth, folded away her widow’s weeds;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` she bathed herself, anointed herself with the finest myrrh, parted
and tied her hair. The garments of happier days she donned anew, put on
her sandals, took bracelet and anklet, ear-ring and finger-ring; decked
herself with every ornament she had.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The Lord himself lent grace to her mien; manly resolve, not woman’s
wantonness, was the occasion of her finery, and he would enhance her
beauty till all beholders should vow there was never woman so fair.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` A bottle of wine she bade her serving-maid carry, and a phial of
oil, parched corn and dry figs, and bread, and cheese, and so she went
out on her journey.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When they reached the gates, they found Ozias and the elders of the
city awaiting them there;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and no sooner did these catch sight of her, than they fell into a
great wonderment of her beauty.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Still they did not question her, but let her pass; May the God of
our fathers, they said, grant thee his favour, and his strength speed
whatever design is in thy heart. Cause may Jerusalem have to be proud
of thee; may thy name live among the holy and the just!

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And all the bystanders, as with one voice, said Amen to that.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` So, with a prayer to the Lord, Judith passed out at the gate, and
her maidservant with her.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` At break of day, while she was yet making her way down the
mountain-slope, she fell in with the advance-guard of the Assyrians,
who stopped her, and asked whence she came, whither she was bound?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` A Hebrew, she said, but I have given my fellow-countrymen the slip,
well knowing that the city must fall into your hands. Why did they defy
you, and refuse to surrender, instead of throwing themselves on your
mercy?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What was I to do? I determined to win audience with your general,
Holofernes, and tell him of their secret plans; shew him, too, means by
which he may reduce the city without losing a man of his army.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Her story told, they must next scan her face; and now their eyes
dazzled with the admiration they had of her beauty.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` It has been the saving of thy life, they told her, this plan thou
hast formed of betaking thyself to our master yonder.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Of this be well assured, once thou hast found thy way to his
presence he will use thee well; none so welcome as thou. And so they
led her to Holofernes’ tent, and advised him of her coming.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` No sooner did she stand before him, than Holofernes’ eyes made him
her prisoner.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Meanwhile, his lords were saying to one another, Who shall belittle
the Hebrew folk, or doubt they are worth the attacking, when for prize
there are such women as this?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` As for Judith, she saw only Holofernes, as he sat there with a
canopy over him, a canopy of purple, with gold and emeralds and other
precious stones worked into it.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` She looked him full in the face, then did reverence, bowing down to
earth, until his servants raised her to her feet, at their master’s
bidding.
