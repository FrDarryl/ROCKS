"1" = ''':sup:`1` Eastern gate of the inner court, the Lord God says, must be shut on
the six working days, open on the sabbath; on the day of the new moon,
too, it shall be opened.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When it is opened, the prince shall come in by way of the outer
hall, and wait in the entrance till the priests have done presenting
burnt-sacrifice of his, welcome-offering of his; there on the threshold
he shall do reverence, and go his ways, but the gate shall not be shut
after him, not till the evening.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` On sabbath days, and when the moon is new, before this gate the
people also shall do reverence.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Six lambs and a ram, without blemish, are the prince’s
burnt-sacrifice to the Lord every sabbath,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` with a bushel of flour for the ram, and for the lambs what bloodless
offering he will; and of oil a gallon and a half to the bushel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And when the moon is new, the same victims, and a bullock besides,
unblemished as they;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` with the bullock, too, a bushel goes as bloodless offering, and the
rest shall be as before.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Through the outer hall of the gateway the prince comes and goes;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but on feast-days, when a great throng comes into the Lord’s
presence, they must enter by one gate and leave by the opposite, from
north to south or south to north,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and the prince, that worships in their midst, shall enter and leave
as they.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And for the bloodless offering, come feast-day, come holiday, it
shall be made as aforesaid.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Will the prince make burnt-sacrifice or welcome-offering of his own
free will, the eastern gate shall be opened for him, as on the sabbath,
till burnt-sacrifice or welcome-offering is done; but when he goes out,
the gate shall be shut behind him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And there shall be daily burnt-sacrifice; morning by morning he
shall offer one of that year’s lambs, unblemished;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` of flour, morning by morning, the sixth part of a bushel, and half
a gallon of oil mingled with it; ever this bloodless offering is the
Lord’s due, continual and unalterable.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Lamb and flour and oil, morning by morning, an eternal sacrifice.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If the prince will make a gift of land to sons of his, the Lord God
says, their patrimony it is, held by right of inheritance;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` crown lands he cannot alienate to any of his servants beyond the
year of jubilee, when they must needs return to him; the crown lands
are entailed upon his sons.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And at no time shall he rob the people by violence of their
rightful patrimony; if he will endow his sons, out of his own patrimony
let him do it; my people must not be disinherited.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` And now he took me through an entry close by the side of the gate,
which led to the northern row of priests’ rooms round the sanctuary.
Where this reached its western end,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` there was a kitchen, which the priests used, he told me, to boil
the flesh of victims for a fault or a wrong done, to bake the bloodless
offering. They must not be carried out into the courtyard; such holy
contact was not for the people.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Afterwards he took me into the outer court, round all the corners
of it in turn, and shewed me that there was a little garth in each of
them; no corner but had its garth;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` in each, there was a space of forty cubits by thirty, perfectly
matched.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The wall enclosed them, and here, under an open roof, kitchens were
built.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` These kitchens, he told me, were used by the temple attendants for
cooking the welcome-offerings made by the people.
