"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was in the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites
left Egypt, in the second month (Zio, as it is called) of the fourth
year of Solomon’s reign in Israel, that the building of the Lord’s
house began.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This house built by Solomon in the Lord’s honour was sixty cubits
long, twenty wide, and thirty high;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` in front of the temple was a porch whose length, like the width of
the temple itself, was twenty cubits, but it was only ten cubits wide.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Slanting windows he made to light his temple,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and about its walls he built storied galleries, that ran all round
the sides of the temple and its shrine with pent-houses round about
them;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` the lowest of these galleries was five, the middle six, and the
highest seven cubits broad; and they rested on beams close to the
outside of the building all about, they were not attached to the temple
walls.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` All the time the temple was a-building, the stones used were ready
hewn and shaped, so that there was no ringing of hammer or axe or iron
tool in the house itself, while it was being built.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` There was a door in the middle of the pent-house on the southern
side of the building; from this a spiral staircase led to the first
floor, and another to the top floor.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When he had finished building the walls of the house, Solomon
covered it in with cedar rafters;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` then, over the whole of it, he built an added storey five cubits
high, and roofed the house with planks of cedar.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` This was a message the Lord sent to Solomon:
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So thou art building me a house? Follow, then, my commandments,
execute my decrees, hold fast to all the laws I have given thee, and by
these guide thy steps. So I will grant thee fulfilment of the promise I
made to thy father David;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I will come and live among the sons of Israel, and not forsake my
people any more.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So Solomon pressed on with the building of the house, until all was
finished.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Its walls within were cedar-panelled, from the floor to the top of
the walls, where the rafters sprang, no panel but was of cedar; only
the floor was covered with planks of fir.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The furthest part of the temple was cedar-panelled to a height of
twenty cubits from top to bottom; it was this inmost recess that he
made into a shrine, a place all holiness,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and before the doors of this shrine the remaining forty cubits of
length made up the temple proper.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` All was cedar panelling, rounded and fitted with the craftsman’s
utmost skill, embossed with carving, cedar everywhere, and no stone in
the walls allowed to shew itself.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And there in the midst, in the inmost part of the building, stood
the shrine in which the ark of the Lord was to rest;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` twenty cubits in length, width, and height, and covered with plates
of pure gold; plated, too, was the cedar altar.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then he covered all the rest of the building, the ante-room of the
shrine, with plates of pure gold, fastened with golden nails.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Nothing in the temple but was sheathed in gold, the altar that
stood before the shrine with the rest.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Within the shrine stood two cherubim, made of olive-wood, ten
cubits high;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` each of these had wings of five cubits’ breadth, so that there was
ten cubits’ distance between the tips of them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The second cherub matched the first in height, no difference of
size or of workmanship between them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Ten cubits high they stood,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` there in the midst of the inner shrine, either touching the wall
with one wing and its fellow’s wing with the other.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The cherubim, too, he plated with gold.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` All the walls of the temple were adorned with bands of carved and
embossed work, cherubim and palm-trees and other patterns, standing out
in high relief;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` the floor, within the sanctuary and without, he covered with gold.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` At the entrance to the shrine he made doors of olive-wood, between
five-sided pilasters;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` doors of olive-wood, carved with figures of cherubim and
palm-trees, and other sculpture in high relief; doors and cherubim and
palm-trees and all the rest were covered with gold.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` At the entrance to the temple were square posts of olive-wood;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and the door on either side was of fir-wood; either door was
double, but the two halves were connected, so that they opened
together.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Cherubim, and palm-trees, and other sculpture stood out in high
relief, and he covered all with gold plates squared by rule.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He also built an inner courtyard, whose walls had three courses of
dressed stone and one of cedar-wood.✻
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` So, in the month of Zio of the fourth year of his reign, the
foundations of the building were laid;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and it was finished, in all its parts and with all its
appurtenances, in the eighth month (Bul, as it is called) of his
eleventh year; so that it was seven years in building.

Notas de rodapé:
6:1-2 - In the fourth year of his reign, Solomon began building the
Temple in Jerusalem. The fact that the Temple was built exactly 480
years after the Exodus from Egypt shows the importance of fulfilling
God's promises and establishing His presence among His people (see also
6:11-13 - God speaks to Solomon, assuring him that His presence will
dwell in the Temple if Israel follows His commandments. This emphasizes
that a relationship with God depends on obedience to His covenant, not
14:23).
6:14-18 - The Temple was completed with details of gold and cedar wood.
The beauty and richness of the materials symbolize God's glory and
majesty, reflecting that He deserves the best in worship and service
6:19-22 - The Holy of Holies was overlaid with pure gold, emphasizing
the holiness of this place, where the Ark of the Covenant would be
placed. This represents God's closeness to His people, but also the
6:37-38 - The construction of the Temple took seven years to complete.
The number seven symbolizes perfection and completeness in the Bible,
indicating that the Temple was a perfect work, completed according to
