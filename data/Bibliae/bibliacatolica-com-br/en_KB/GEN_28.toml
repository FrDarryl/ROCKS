this charge upon him: It is not for thee to marry a woman of Chanaanite
stock;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` rather bestir thyself, and make thy way to Mesopotamia of the
Syrians; there dwelt thy mother’s father, Bathuel, there thou mayest
wed one of the daughters of thy uncle Laban.

so that a multitude of nations may spring from thee.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` May he grant to thee, and to thy race after thee, the blessing which
he promised to thy grandfather Abraham; possession of the land in which
thou dwellest now as a stranger.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Jacob took leave of him, and set out on his journey to Mesopotamia
of the Syrians, to the home of his uncle Laban, son of Bathuel, the
Syrian.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` An ill day for Esau; here was Jacob sent with his father’s blessing
to find himself a wife in Syria; forbidden, as he would win that
blessing, to marry a Chanaanite;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` here was Jacob gone all the way to Mesopotamia in obedience to his
parents’ whim!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` These women of Chanaan, Esau thought, are little to my father’s
liking;

"9" = ''':sup:`9` so he betook himself to Ismael,✻ and married a third wife, Maheleth,
daughter to Abraham’s son Ismael, and sister to Nabaioth.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Meanwhile Jacob had left Bersabee, and was on his way to Haran.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` There was a place he reached as nightfall overtook him, so that he
must lie down and rest; so he took one of the stones that lay around
him, to make a pillow of it, and went to sleep.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He dreamed that he saw a ladder standing on the earth, with its top
reaching up into heaven; a stairway for the angels of God to go up and
come down.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Over this ladder the Lord himself leaned down, and spoke to Jacob,
I am the Lord, he said, the God of thy father Abraham, the God of
Isaac; this ground on which thou liest sleeping is my gift to thee and
to thy posterity.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thy race shall be countless as the dust of the earth; to west and
east, to north and south thou shalt overflow thy frontiers, till all
the families on earth find a blessing in thee, and in this race of
thine.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I myself will watch over thee wherever thou goest, and bring thee
back to this land again; before I have done with thee, all my promises
to thee shall be fulfilled.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When he awoke from his dream, Jacob said to himself, Why, this is
the Lord’s dwelling-place, and I slept here unaware of it!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he shuddered; What a fearsome place is this! said he. This can
be nothing other than the house of God; this is the gate of Heaven.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So it was that, when he rose in the morning, Jacob took the stone
which had been his pillow, and set it up there as a monument, and
poured oil upon it;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and he called the place Bethel, the House of God, that was called
Luza till then.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And there he took a vow; If God will be with me, he said, and watch
over me on this journey of mine, and give me bread to eat and clothes
to cover my back,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` till at last I return safe to my father’s house, then the Lord
shall be my God.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` This stone, too, which I have set up as a monument, shall be called
the House of God. And of all the gifts thou sendest me, a tenth part
shall be the offering I make thee.
