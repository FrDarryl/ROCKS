"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Nicanor was told, Judas was in the Samaritan country, he would
have pressed home the attack against him, there and then, on the
sabbath day.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But the Jews gainsaid him; for there were Jews that fought,
unwillingly enough, under his orders. What, said they, wouldst thou
fight beast-fashion, without mercy? This holy day respect thou needs
must, in his honour that is God all-seeing.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Why, where is he then, said the impious wretch, this God who would
have sabbath kept? In the heavens?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` In heaven he is, sure enough, they answered, the living Lord our
master, that gave orders the seventh day should be observed.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So be it, said he, and I am your master on earth, and my orders are,
To arms, and despatch the king’s business! Yet carry out his design
they would not.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Such an empty braggart was this Nicanor, he thought to make a single
victory of it, over all the Jews at once;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Machabaeus on his side kept ever his confidence, yet with the sure
hope, God would bring him aid.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And for his men he had the same encouragement; let them never be
daunted by the onslaught of the heathen, but rather bethink them of
heaven’s mercies in time past, and look to God Omnipotent for victory.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Of the law and the prophets he spoke to them, and reminded them of
their old battles, till all were eager for the fight;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` nor was it enough to arouse their ardour; he shewed them, too, how
treacherous the heathen had proved, and how forsworn.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus it was his care to arm them, not with shield or spear for
their defence, but with excellent words of good cheer.A dream of his he
told them, most worthy of credence, that brought comfort to one and
all.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And what saw he? Onias, that had once been high priest, appeared to
him; an excellent good man this, modest of mien, courteous,
well-spoken, and from his boyhood schooled in all the virtues. With
hands outstretched, he stood there praying for the Jewish folk.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then he was ware of another, a man of great age and reverence,
nothing about him but was most worshipful;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` who this might be, Onias told him forthwith: Here is one that loves
our brethren, the people of Israel, well; one that for Israel and for
every stone of the holy city prays much; God’s prophet Jeremias.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And with that, Jeremias reached forward to Judas, and gave him a
golden sword;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` This holy sword take thou, he said, God’s gift; this wielding, all
the enemies of my people Israel thou shalt lay low.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` A most noble harangue, and one very apt to rouse the emulation of
his followers, and to stiffen their courage. No wonder if they resolved
they would put it to the touch, and manfully engage the enemy; valour
should decide all. Was not the holy city, was not the temple itself in
jeopardy?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For wives and children, for brethren and kindred, their concern was
less; of the perils they dreaded, profanation of the temple was first
and foremost.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And what of those who were left in the city? No common anxiety they
felt for these others that were going into battle.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now was the hour of decision; the enemy was at the gates, drawn up
in full array; here were the elephants, here was the cavalry, posted at
points of vantage.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Judas, when he saw the number of his assailants, how manifold were
their appointments, how fierce the temper of the beasts, was fain to
lift hands heavenward, and to the Lord make his appeal; the Lord, that
is wondrous in his doings, and at his own pleasure crowns right, not
might, with victory.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And this was the manner of his praying: Lord, in the days of
Ezechias thou didst send thy angel, and take toll of a hundred and
eighty-five thousand in the camp of Sennacherib!
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Ruler of heaven, some friendly angel of thine this day escort us;
dread and dismay let thy outstretched hand inspire,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` to the confusion of yonder blasphemers that levy war on thy holy
people! And so he brought his prayer to an end.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` By this, Nicanor’s army was coming forward to the attack, with
blowing of trumpets and with songs of battle.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Judas and his company went to meet them calling still upon God
for his succour;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and ever while hand fought, heart prayed. Such joy had they of
God’s present assistance, they cut down a full thirty-five thousand of
the enemy;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` when they let be, and returned in triumph from the pursuit, news
greeted them Nicanor himself had armed for the fight, and lay there
dead.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` What a cry was then raised, what a stir, what hymns they sang, in
the speech of their own country, to God Omnipotent!
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Judas? Not for nothing had he devoted body and soul, this long
while, to the service of his fellow countrymen! Nicanor’s head, and one
of his arms cut off from the shoulder downwards, he bade them carry to
Jerusalem;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and there he called the tribesmen together, ranged the priests
about the altar, and sent his summons to the heathen that garrisoned
the citadel.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Head and hand he shewed them of the godless Nicanor, the hand that
was stretched out so boastfully against the holy temple of the
Almighty,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` bidding them cut the blaspheming tongue in pieces and cast it to
the birds, nail the rash hand to the temple’s face.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` None but praised the Lord of heaven at the sight; Blessed be the
Lord, they cried, that has kept his house undefiled still!
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` As for Nicanor’s head, Judas hung it at the top of the citadel, to
be a clear and evident token, how God gives aid.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And all with one consent made a decree, never should that day pass
unobserved;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` they would keep holiday on the thirteenth of the Syrian month Adar,
which is the eve of Mardochaeus’ feast.✻
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Such was the history of Nicanor; and since that time the city has
been in Jewish possession. Here, then, I will make an end of writing;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` if it has been done workmanly, and in historian’s fashion, none
better pleased than I; if it is of little merit, I must be humoured
none the less.✻
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Nothing but wine to take, nothing but water, thy health forbids;
vary thy drinking,✻ and thou shalt find content. So it is with reading;
if the book be too nicely polished at every point, it grows wearisome.
So here we will have done with it.

Notas de rodapé:
15:1-3 - Nicanor plans to attack the Jews on the Sabbath, disrespecting
their faith. This disregard for Jewish religious practices reflects the
arrogance of his enemies, but it also sets the stage for divine
15:7-9 - Judas Maccabeus encourages his men to trust in God for
victory, citing past events in which God saved Israel. Faith in God's
redemptive history is used to strengthen the warriors' confidence (see
15:11-13 - Jude sees a vision of Onias and Jeremiah interceding for the
people, which brings hope and courage. This vision highlights the
importance of the intercession of the saints and the connection between
15:20-24 - Judas prays to God before the battle, invoking divine
justice against the blasphemers. Prayer before battle demonstrates
confidence in God's sovereignty over the destiny of the nations (see

praising God. This victory is seen as a sign that God continues to
