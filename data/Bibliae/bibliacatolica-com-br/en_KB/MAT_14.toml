"1" = ''':sup:`1` At this time Herod, who ruled in that quarter, heard what was told
of Jesus.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he said to his men, This is no other than John the Baptist; he
has risen from the dead, and that is why these powers are active in
him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For Herod himself had arrested John and put him in chains and thrown
him into prison, for love of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` because John told him, It is wrong for thee to take her.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And he would willingly have put him to death, but was prevented by
fear of the multitude, who looked upon John as a prophet.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then, at the celebration of Herod’s birthday, the daughter of
Herodias danced before them all, and Herod was so well pleased with her
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` that he promised, on oath, to grant her whatever request she made.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` She had been prompted beforehand by her mother; Give me, she said,
the head of John the Baptist; give it me here on a dish.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the king was stricken with remorse; but, out of respect for his
oath and for those who sat with him at table, he granted her request,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and so had John beheaded in his prison.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` His head was brought in on a dish, and given to the girl, and she
carried it off to her mother.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But his disciples gained access to the body, which they took away
and buried, and came to tell the news to Jesus.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Jesus, when he had heard it, took ship from the place where he was,
and withdrew into desert country, to be alone; but the multitudes from
the towns heard of it, and followed him there by land.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So, when he disembarked, he found a great multitude there, and he
took pity on them, and healed those who were sick.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And now it was evening, and his disciples came to him and said,
This is a lonely place, and it is past the accustomed hour; give the
multitudes leave to go into the villages and buy themselves food there.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Jesus told them, There is no need for them to go away; it is
for you to give them food to eat.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They answered, We have nothing with us, except five loaves and two
fishes.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Bring them to me here, he said;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` then he told the multitudes to sit down on the grass, and when the
five loaves and the two fishes were brought to him he looked up to
heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples;
and the disciples gave them to the multitude.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` All ate and had enough, and when they picked up what was left of
the broken pieces they filled twelve baskets with them;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` about five thousand men had eaten, not reckoning women and
children.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` As soon as this was done, he prevailed upon his disciples to take
ship and cross to the other side before him, leaving him to send the
multitudes home.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When he had finished sending them home, he went up by himself on to
the hill-side, to pray there; twilight had come, and he remained there
alone.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Meanwhile the ship was already half-way across the sea, hard put to
it by the waves, for the wind was against them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And then, when the night had reached its fourth quarter, Jesus came
to them, walking on the sea.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When they saw him walking on the sea, the disciples were terrified;
they said, It is an apparition, and cried out for fear.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But all at once Jesus spoke to them; Take courage, he said, it is
myself; do not be afraid.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is thyself, bid me come to thee
over the water.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He said, Come; and Peter let himself down out of the ship and
walked over the water to reach Jesus.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then, seeing how strong the wind was, he lost courage and began to
sink; whereupon he cried aloud, Lord, save me.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And Jesus at once stretched out his hand and caught hold of him,
saying to him, Why didst thou hesitate, man of little faith?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So they went on board the ship, and thereupon the wind dropped.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And the ship’s crew came and said, falling at his feet, Thou art
indeed the Son of God.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` When they had crossed, they reached the country of Genesar;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and the inhabitants of that place, recognizing him, sent into all
the country round, and brought to him all those who were in affliction;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and they entreated him that they might be allowed to touch even the
hem of his garments. And everyone who touched him was restored to
health.✻
