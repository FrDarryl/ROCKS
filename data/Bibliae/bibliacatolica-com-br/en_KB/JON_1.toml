"1" = ''':sup:`1` The Lord’s voice came to Jonas, the son of Amathi:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Up, and to the great city of Nineve make thy way; I would have thee
preach to them; great guilt of theirs claims my cognizance.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Rise up he did, but his thought was, he would escape to Tharsis, and
there avoid the Lord’s scrutiny. So he made his way to Joppa, and
there, sure enough, was a ship bound for Tharsis; passage-money was
paid, and aboard went Jonas with the rest of them, sailing for Tharsis
to be out of the Lord’s way.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But now the Lord sent out a boisterous wind over the sea, that
raised a great tempest there, and the ship was like to have been broken
all to pieces.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Sore afraid the mariners were, and loud they called upon their god;
ay, and fell to throwing the tackle overboard, to lighten ship. And
what of Jonas? He had gone down into the ship’s hold, and fallen fast
asleep.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But that would not serve; up came the captain and asked what he
meant, to lie there sleeping? Up, said he, and cry out upon thy God!
Who knows but God will take pity on us, and grant us our lives yet?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` By this, the ship’s company were of another counsel; Nay, said one
to other, cast we the lot, and so find out how it is that such peril
has befallen us! Cast lots they did, and Jonas was singled out.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Tell us, they cried, for whose sake✻ it is that we are come into
such peril! Tell us what thy errand is, whence thou art journeying and
whither, what nation it was gave thee birth.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I am a Hebrew, he told them, and worship the Lord, the God of
heaven, that made the sea and the dry land both.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when they heard (for he told them all) that this was a man who
would escape from the Lord’s sight, they were in a great taking of
fear. What ailed thee? they asked.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And how must we use thee, if we would have yonder seas calmed for
us? (Even as they spoke, the waves grew more angry yet.)
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Why, said he, take me up and throw me over the ship’s side, and the
sea will grant you respite; doubt there is none, I am the cause of all
this peril that has befallen you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What would you? They fell to the oars, hoping to make land thus,
but could nothing avail; ever angrier grew the seas about them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And at last they cried out upon the Lord; Take we this man’s life,
they said, let it not be to our own undoing! Do not charge us with the
death of an innocent man, thou who hast so manifested thy divine will!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And with that, they took Jonas up, and threw him over the ship’s
side. All at once, the raging of the sea was stilled;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` what awe fell on those mariners! What sacrifices they made, what
vows they offered to the Lord!

Notas de rodapé:
1:1-2 - God calls Jonah to preach against the city of Nineveh, but he
flees to Tarshish. Jonah's refusal to fulfill his divine mission
reflects human resistance to God's call, often out of fear or prejudice
1:3-5 - Jonah tries to flee God's call on a ship, but a great storm is
sent by God. The storm symbolizes the consequences of disobeying God,
1:6-10 - The sailors, fearing for their lives, question Jonah and
discover that he is responsible for the storm. The sailors' plight
illustrates the impact of sin and disobedience on the lives of others,
and also reveals God's mercy even in times of crisis (see also
1:11-15 - Jonah instructs the sailors to throw him overboard to calm
the storm. Jonah's action shows that obedience is essential to halt
divine judgment. This act also points to the necessity of sacrifice to
1:16-17 - The storm calms after Jonah's sacrifice. God provides a great
fish to swallow Jonah, symbolizing divine grace that saves even when
