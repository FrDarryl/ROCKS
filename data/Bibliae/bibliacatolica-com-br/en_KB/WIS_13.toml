good seen, and he, who is existent Good,✻ not known! Should they not

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Instead, they have pointed us to fire, or wind, or to the nimble
air, wheeling stars, or tempestuous waves, or sun and moon, and made
gods of them, to rule the world!

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Perhaps the beauty of such things bewitched them into mistaking it
for divinity? Ay, but what of him who is Master of them all; what
excellence must be his, the Author of all beauty, that could make them!

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Or was it power, and power’s exercise, that awoke their wonderment?
Why then, how many times greater must he be, who contrived it!

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Such great beauty✻ even creatures have, reason is well able to
contemplate the Source from which these perfections came.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Yet, if we find fault with men like these, their fault is little by

creatures, trusting only in the senses, that find such beauty there.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` But there are men more wretched yet, men who repose all their
confidence in a world of shadows. They give the name of god to what is
made by human art, gold and silver that human workmanship has turned
into the likeness of living things, blocks of senseless stone that
human hands have carved, long ago.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` What would you? Here is a craftsman in wood has been to the forest

"13" = ''':sup:`13` But one more piece of refuse wood is left, that is fit for nothing;
so crooked is it and so gnarled. See him, in an idle moment, pick it up
and spend his leisure carving it! A master craftsman this; ere long it
has taken shape, made into a man’s likeness;

prayer, addressing himself all the while to a senseless thing.
