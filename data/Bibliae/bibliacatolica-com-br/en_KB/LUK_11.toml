"1" = ''':sup:`1` Once, when he had found a place to pray in, one of his disciples
said to him, after his prayer was over, Lord, teach us how to pray, as
John did for his disciples.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he told them, When you pray, you are to say, Father, hallowed be
thy name; thy kingdom come;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` give us this day our daily bread;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and forgive us our sins; we too forgive all those who trespass
against us; and lead us not into temptation.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Let us suppose that one of you has a friend, to whom he goes at dead
of night, and asks him, Lend me three loaves of bread, neighbour;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` a friend of mine has turned in to me after a journey, and I have
nothing to offer him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And suppose the other answers, from within doors, Do not put me to
such trouble; the door is locked, my children and I are in bed; I
cannot bestir myself to grant thy request.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I tell you, even if he will not bestir himself to grant it out of
friendship, shameless asking will make him rise and give his friend all
that he needs.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And I say the same to you; ask, and the gift will come, seek, and
you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Everyone that asks, will receive, that seeks, will find, that
knocks, will have the door opened to him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Among yourselves, if a father is asked by his son for bread, will
he give him a stone? Or for a fish, will he give him a snake instead of
a fish?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Or if he is asked for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Why then, if you, evil as you are, know well enough how to give
your children what is good for them, is not your Father much more ready
to give, from heaven, his gracious Spirit to those who ask him?✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` ✻ He had just cast out a devil, which was dumb; and no sooner had
the devil gone out than the dumb man found speech. The multitudes were
filled with amazement;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but some of them said, It is through Beelzebub, the prince of the
devils, that he casts the devils out,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` while others, to put him to the test, would have him shew a sign
out of heaven.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But he could read their thoughts, and said to them, No kingdom can
be at war with itself without being brought to desolation, one house
falling upon another.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And how do you suppose that Satan’s kingdom can stand firm if he is
at war with himself, that you should accuse me of casting out devils
through Beelzebub?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Again, if it is through Beelzebub that I cast out devils, by what
means do your own sons cast them out? It is for these, then, to
pronounce judgement on you.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But if, when I cast out devils, I do it through God’s power, then
it must be that the kingdom of God has suddenly appeared among you.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When a strong man, fully armed, mounts guard over his own palace,
his goods are left in peace;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` but when a man comes who is stronger still, he will take away all
the armour that bred such confidence, and divide among others the
spoils of victory.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He who is not with me, is against me; he who does not gather his
store with me, scatters it abroad.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The unclean spirit which has possessed a man, and then goes out of
him, walks about the desert looking for a resting-place, and finds
none; and it says, I will go back to my own dwelling, from which I came
out.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And it comes back, to find that dwelling swept out, and neatly set
in order.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Thereupon, it goes away and brings in seven other spirits more
wicked than itself to bear it company, and together they enter in and
settle down there; till the last state of that man is worse than the
first.✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When he spoke thus, a woman in the multitude said to him aloud,
Blessed is the womb that bore thee, the breast which thou hast sucked.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he answered, Shall we not say, Blessed are those who hear the
word of God, and keep it?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The multitudes gathered round him, and he began speaking to them
thus; This is a wicked generation; it asks for a sign, and the only
sign that will be given to it is the sign of the prophet Jonas.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Jonas was the sign given to the men of Nineve; the sign given to
this generation will be the Son of Man.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The queen of the south will rise up with the men of this generation
at the judgement, and will leave them without excuse; for she came from
the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a
greater than Solomon is here.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The men of Nineve will rise up with this generation at the
judgement, and will leave it without excuse; for they did penance when
Jonas preached to them, and behold, a greater than Jonas is here.✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Nobody lights a lamp, and then puts it away in a cellar or under a
bushel measure; it is put on the lamp-stand, so that its light may be
seen by all who come in.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Thy body has the eye for its lamp; and if thy eye is clear, the
whole of thy body will be lit up; when it is diseased, the whole of thy
body will be in darkness.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Take good care then, that this principle of light which is in thee
is light, not darkness;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` then, if thy whole body is in the light, with no part of it in
darkness, it will all be lit up as if by a bright lamp enlightening
thee.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` At the time when he said this, one of the Pharisees invited him to
his house for the mid-day meal; so he went in and sat down at table;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` the Pharisee meanwhile was inwardly surmising, why he had not
washed before his meal.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And the Lord said to him, You Pharisees are content to cleanse the
outward part of cup and dish, while all within is running with avarice
and wickedness.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Fools, did not he who made the outward part make the inward too?
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Nay, you should give alms out of the store you have, and at once
all that is yours becomes clean.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Woe upon you, you Pharisees, that will award God his tithe, though
it be of mint or rue or whatever herb you will, and leave on one side
justice and the love of God; you do ill to forget one duty while you
perform the other.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Woe upon you, you Pharisees, for loving the first seats in the
synagogues, and to have your hands kissed in the market-place;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` woe upon you, that are like hidden tombs which men walk over
without knowing it.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And here one of the lawyers answered him; Master, he said, in
speaking thus thou art bringing us too into contempt.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And he said, Woe upon you too, you lawyers, for loading men with
packs too heavy to be borne, packs that you yourselves will not touch
with one finger.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Woe upon you, for building up the tombs of the prophets, the same
prophets who were murdered by your fathers;
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` sure witness that you approve what your fathers did, since you
build tombs for the men they murdered.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Whereupon the wisdom of God warns you, I will send my prophets and
my apostles to them, and there will be some they will kill and
persecute;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` so they will be answerable for all the blood of prophets that has
been shed since the beginning of the world,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias, who was killed
between the altar and the temple; yes, I tell you, this generation will
be held answerable for it.✻
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Woe upon you, you lawyers, for taking away with you the key of
knowledge; you have neither entered yourselves, nor let others enter
when they would.✻
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` As he said all this to them, the scribes and Pharisees resolved to
hunt him down mercilessly and to browbeat him with a multitude of
questions.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Thus they lay in wait for him, hoping to catch some word from his
lips which would give them ground of accusation against him.
