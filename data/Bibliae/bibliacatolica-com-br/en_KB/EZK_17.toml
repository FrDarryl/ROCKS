"1" = ''':sup:`1` Word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` A riddle, son of man, a parable for the men of Israel to interpret!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This shall be thy message from the Lord God: A great eagle there
was, strong of wing, long of limb; thick and gay his plumage. And this
eagle flew to Lebanon, where he robbed cedar of cedar’s very pith;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` tore away its crown of leaves and carried it off to Merchant-land,✻
set it down in Traffic City.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then back he flew to that same country, chose out both seed and
seed-ground there; it was on a level lawn by a brimming stream he
planted it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When the plant grew, it proved to be a spreading vine, low of
stature, and ever branch curled inwards and root struck downwards, yet
vine it was, with sprig that burgeoned, shoot that sprang.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But now, here is a second eagle comes in sight, another great eagle,
strong of wing, thick-plumed; and it seems as if the vine, in the
garden where it grows, were stretching out its roots, waving its
tendrils, to ask this second eagle for water instead.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` What, when it was planted in ground so fair, by waters so abundant,
with such promise of leaf and fruit, a vine so destined to greatness!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Will any good come of this? asks the Lord God. Nay, roots shall be
plucked up, fruit ravaged, branches left to wither; fade it must, nor
is it like to need great strength or many hands for its unearthing.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Take root is not thrive; rich soil or none, when the sirocco
parches it, the vine must wither.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then the Lord’s word came to me,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` bidding me ask the rebel brood, Were they at a loss for the meaning
of it? This tells how Nabuchodonosor came to Jerusalem, carried off the
king and princes and took them away to Babylon;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` yet spared a prince of the blood royal, making a treaty with him
and exacting an oath of allegiance. All the flower of the citizens he
carried away;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` the kingdom should be submissive henceforward, and rebel no more,
should keep troth with him loyally.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Straightway the new king revolted from Nabuchodonosor, and sent
envoys to Egypt, asking for horses, asking for the despatch of a great
army in his support. Speeds he, finds he deliverance? Should broken
faith avail him?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` As I am a living God, the Lord says, Babylon that made a king of
him, Babylon that trusted in his false oath of allegiance, shall be the
place of his death.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Nor think that his enemy✻ will need great strength, a great muster
of men, to overcome him, mound here, trench there, and the loss of many
lives;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` for the man that did so ill, held his faith a light thing and broke
the bond he had set his hand to, there is no escape.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This doom the Lord pronounces: As I am a living God, false troth
and broken treaty shall be the undoing of him!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` My net is spread; I have him in the noose; Babylon for him! There I
will call him to account for the dishonour he has done to my name by
his treachery;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and all that escape with him, nay, his whole army, must fall by the
sword, or survive scattered to the four winds; you shall learn what
manner of God you worship.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And here is a message from the Lord God: Pith of the tall cedar I
will take and set it firm, young branch from its crest of branches I
will snap off, and plant it on a mountain that stands high above the
rest.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` High in the hill-country of Israel I will plant it, and there it
shall grow into a great cedar-tree; no bird on the wing but shall find
rest under its shade, nestle among its branches;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` till all the forest learns its lesson, that I, the Lord, bring high
tree low, raise low tree high, wither the burgeoning trunk, give life
to the barren. What the Lord promises, the Lord fulfils.

Notas de rodapé:
17:1-10 - The parable of the tree and the scepter illustrates Israel's
disobedience. The scepter, representing the king of Judah, would be
broken, and the nation would experience destruction, highlighting the
Chronicles 36:11-14).
17:11-15 - The broken alliance between the king of Judah and the king
of Babylon symbolizes betrayal and disloyalty. Trust in human alliances

can lead to the downfall of a nation or an individual (see also

tree planted in the earth, symbolizing the future restoration of the
house of Israel. God will bring new hope to His people, fulfilling His
