Christ’s kingdom, God’s kingdom, if he is debauched, or impure, or has
that love of money which makes a man an idolater.

very things which bring down God’s anger on the unbelievers;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` you do ill to throw in your lot with them.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Once you were all darkness; now, in the Lord, you are all daylight.
You must live as men native to the light;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is the light that rebukes such things and shews them up for what
they are; only light shews up.✻

arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.✻

"26" = ''':sup:`26` He would hallow it, purify it by bathing it in the water to which
his word gave life;

"27" = ''':sup:`27` he would summon it into his own presence, the Church in all its
beauty, no stain, no wrinkle, no such disfigurement; it was to be holy,
it was to be spotless.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` And that is how husband ought to love wife, as if she were his own
body; in loving his wife, a man is but loving himself.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` It is unheard of, that a man should bear ill-will to his own flesh

Christ and his Church.✻

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-2 - Paul exhorts Christians to be imitators of God, living in love,
as Christ loved us and gave himself for us. Christ's sacrificial love
5:3-7 - The apostle warns against sexual immorality, impurity, and
greed, which have no place among the saints. The Christian life should
5:8-14 - Paul calls Christians to live as children of light, avoiding
the works of darkness and exposing them to the light. The contrast
between light and darkness is a metaphor for the Christian life (see
5:22-33 - Paul teaches about the relationship between husband and wife,
comparing it to the relationship between Christ and the church. The
sacrificial love of husbands and the submission of wives reflect
Peter 3:1-7).
