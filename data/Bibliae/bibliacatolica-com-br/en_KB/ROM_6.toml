"1" = ''':sup:`1` Does it follow that we ought to go on sinning, to give still more
occasion for grace?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` God forbid. We have died, once for all, to sin; can we breathe its
air again?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` You know well enough that we who were taken up into Christ by
baptism have been taken up, all of us, into his death.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` In our baptism, we have been buried with him, died like him, that
so, just as Christ was raised up by his Father’s power from the dead,
we too might live and move in a new kind of existence.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` We have to be closely fitted into the pattern of his resurrection,
as we have been into the pattern of his death;✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` we have to be sure of this, that our former nature has been
crucified with him, and the living power of our guilt annihilated, so
that we are the slaves of guilt no longer.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Guilt makes no more claim on a man who is dead.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And if we have died with Christ, we have faith to believe that we
shall share his life.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` We know that Christ, now he has risen from the dead, cannot die any
more; death has no more power over him;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the death he died was a death, once for all, to sin; the life he
now lives is a life that looks towards God.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And you, too, must think of yourselves as dead to sin, and alive
with a life that looks towards God, through Christ Jesus our Lord.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` You must not, then, allow sin to tyrannize over your perishable
bodies, to make you subject to its appetites.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` You must not make your bodily powers over to sin, to be the
instruments of harm; make yourselves over to God, as men who have been
dead and come to life again; make your bodily powers over to God, to be
the instruments of right-doing.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Sin will not be able to play the master over you any longer; you
serve grace now, not the law.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And if it is grace, not the law, we serve, are we therefore to fall
into sin? God forbid.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` You know well enough that wherever you give a slave’s consent, you
prove yourselves the slaves of that master; slaves of sin, marked out
for death, or slaves of obedience, marked out for justification.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And you, thanks be to God, although you were the slaves of sin
once, accepted obedience with all your hearts, true to the pattern of
teaching to which you are now engaged.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thus you escaped from the bondage of sin, and became the slaves of
right-doing instead.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I am speaking in the language of common life, because nature is
still strong in you.✻ Just as you once made over your natural powers as
slaves to impurity and wickedness, till all was wickedness, you must
now make over your natural powers as slaves to right-doing, till all is
sanctified.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` At the time when you were the slaves of sin, right-doing had no
claim upon you.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And what harvest were you then reaping, from acts which now make
you blush? Their reward is death.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Now that you are free from the claims of sin, and have become God’s
slaves instead, you have a harvest in your sanctification, and your
reward is eternal life.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Sin offers death, for wages; God offers us eternal life as a free
gift, through Christ Jesus our Lord.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
6:1-2 - God's grace should not be used as an excuse for sin, because as
Christians, we have died to sin. Life transformation is evidenced by
6:3-4 - Baptism symbolizes union with Christ in His death and
resurrection, being an act of rebirth to a new life in Christ (see also
6:6-7 - The old human nature was crucified with Christ, so that we are
now freed from the dominion of sin. Justification brings the freedom to
4:22-24).
6:12-14 - The Christian must not allow sin to reign in his mortal body,
but instead offer himself to God as an instrument of righteousness.
Corinthians 6:19-20).
06:23 - The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus. This verse is a crucial contrast between the fate of
3:16).
