that wealth of hers, and herself burnt to the ground!
'''

Accaron, for hopes belied; no chieftain in Gaza, no townsfolk left in

yonder Philistines;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` snatch the blood-stained morsel from their mouths, the unhallowed

Notas de rodapé:
9:1-8 - Zechariah prophesies against Israel's enemy nations, showing
that God has control over the nations and that His people will be
protected. This divine victory over their enemies highlights God's
9:9-10 - The triumphal entry of the righteous and humble King into
Jerusalem is a messianic prediction of Christ. He brings peace, not
through war, but through reconciliation and justice (see also
9:11-17 - God promises to restore the people of Israel and protect the
faithful, bringing victory over their enemies and pouring out His
blessing upon them. The image of God as the protector and deliverer of
10:28-29).
