"1" = ''':sup:`1` While Esdras thus prayed for mercy, lying in tears before God’s
temple, a great throng of Israelites gathered round him, men, women and
children alike, and loud was their lament.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` At last Sechenias the son of Jehiel, of Aelam’s clan, said to him,
We have offended our God by marrying foreign wives, women of the
neighbouring peoples; but is there no hope of pardon for Israel?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Come, let us make a covenant with the Lord our God; let us send away
these wives, and the children born of them. That is the Lord’s counsel;

"4" = ''':sup:`4` With thee, Esdras, the decision rests; count on our obedience; up,
and go boldly about thy task.

against Israel heavier yet.

will; separate yourselves from the peoples that live around you, from
the foreign wives you have married.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` At that, the whole multitude gave a loud cry, At thy bidding it
shall be done!

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Only, because the throng was so great, and it was the rainy season,
when there was no standing out of doors, because their task could not
be performed in one day or two, so many were the faults thus committed,

"14" = ''':sup:`14` they would have their rulers go bail for the rest.✻ Then, in each
township, those who had married alien wives should meet the elders and
judges of it at a fixed time, till at last no faults were left to earn
their God’s vengeance.
