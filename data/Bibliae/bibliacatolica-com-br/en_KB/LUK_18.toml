"1" = ''':sup:`1` And he told them a parable, shewing them that they ought to pray
continually, and never be discouraged.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There was a city once, he said, in which lived a judge who had no
fear of God, no regard for man;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and there was a widow in this city who used to come before him and
say, Give me redress against one who wrongs me.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For a time he refused; but then he said to himself, Fear of God I
have none, nor regard for man,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` but this widow wearies me; I will give her redress, or she will wear
me down at last with her visits.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Listen, the Lord said, to the words of the unjust judge,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and tell me, will not God give redress to his elect, when they are
crying out to him, day and night? Will he not be impatient with their
wrongs?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I tell you, he will give them redress with all speed. But ah, when
the Son of Man comes, will he find faith left on the earth?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` There were some who had confidence in themselves, thinking they had
won acceptance with God, and despised the rest of the world; to them he
addressed this other parable:
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, the
other a publican.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The Pharisee stood upright, and made this prayer in his heart, I
thank thee, God, that I am not like the rest of men, who steal and
cheat and commit adultery, or like this publican here;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` for myself, I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I
possess.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the publican stood far off; he would not even lift up his eyes
towards heaven; he only beat his breast, and said, God, be merciful to
me; I am a sinner.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I tell you, this man went back home higher in God’s favour than the
other; everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and the man who
humbles himself shall be exalted.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then they brought little children to him, asking him to touch them.
The disciples saw them and rebuked them for it:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` but Jesus called the children to him, and said, Let them be, do not
keep them back from me; the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Believe me, the man who does not accept the kingdom of God like a
little child, will never enter into it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And one of the rulers asked him, Master, who art so good, what must
I do to win eternal life?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Jesus said to him, Why dost thou call me good? None is good, except
God only.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Thou knowest the commandments, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt
not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false
witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I have kept all these, he said, ever since I grew up.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When he heard that, Jesus said, In one thing thou art still
wanting; sell all that belongs to thee, and give to the poor; so the
treasure thou hast shall be in heaven; then come back and follow me.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The answer filled him with sadness, for he was very rich;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and Jesus, seeing his mournful look, said, With what difficulty
will those who have riches enter God’s kingdom!
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle’s eye, than for a
man to enter the kingdom of God when he is rich.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But when he was asked by those who were listening to him, Why then,
who can be saved?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` he told them, What is impossible to man’s powers is possible to
God.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Hereupon Peter said, And what of us? we have forsaken all that was
ours, and followed thee.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus said to them, I promise you, everyone who has forsaken home,
or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children for the sake of the
kingdom of God,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` will receive, in this present world, many times their worth, and in
the world to come, everlasting life.✻
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then he took the twelve apostles aside, and warned them, Now we are
going up to Jerusalem, and all that has been written by the prophets
about the Son of Man is to be accomplished.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He will be given up to the Gentiles, and mocked, and beaten, and
spat upon;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` they will scourge him, and then they will kill him; but on the
third day he will rise again.✻
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` They could make nothing of all this; his meaning was hidden from
them, so that they could not understand what he said.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` When he came near Jericho, there was a blind man sitting there by
the way-side begging.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he, hearing a multitude passing by, asked what it meant;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` so they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was going past.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Whereupon he cried out, Jesus, son of David, have pity on me.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Those who were in front rebuked him, and told him to be silent, but
he cried out all the more, Son of David, have pity on me.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Then Jesus stopped, and gave orders that the man should be brought
to him; and when he came close, he asked him,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` What wouldst thou have me do for thee? Lord, he said, give me back
my sight.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Jesus said to him, Receive thy sight; thy faith has brought thee
recovery.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And at once the man recovered his sight, and followed him,
glorifying God; all the people, too, gave praise to God at seeing it.✻
