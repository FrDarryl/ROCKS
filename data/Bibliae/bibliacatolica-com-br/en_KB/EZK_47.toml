"1" = ''':sup:`1` And last, he took me to the door of the temple itself, and shewed me
where a stream of water flowed eastwards from beneath the threshold of
it. Eastward the temple looked, and eastward these waters flowed,
somewhat to the temple’s right, so as to pass by the southern side of
the altar.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Through the northern gate he led me, and round the walk that passed
the outer gate, taking the eastern sun; and here, to the right of the
gate, the water gushed out.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Eastward then he faced, the man of the measuring-rod; measured a
thousand cubits, and led me across a stream that reached my ankles.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Another thousand, and when I crossed the stream it reached my knees;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` another thousand, and it was up to my waist, another thousand, and
now it had become a torrent I might not cross any longer, so high the
waters had swelled, out of my depth.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Mark it well, son of man, said he; and with that he brought me out
on to the bank again;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` when I reached it, I found that there were trees growing thick on
either hand.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This stream, he told me, must flow eastward to the sand-dunes, and
so fall into the desert; pass into the Dead Sea and beyond it,
cleansing those waters by its passage.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Wherever it flows, there shall be teeming life once again; in the
Dead Sea itself there will be shoals of fish, once this stream has
reached it, this stream that heals all things and makes all things
live.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Fisher-folk will line the shores of it, and there will be drying of
nets all the way from Engaddi to Engallim, and fish there will be in
great shoals, varied in kind as the ocean fish are.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Only the swamps and marshes about it there is no cleansing; these
shall turn into salt-pits.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And on either bank of the stream fruit-trees shall grow of every
kind; never leaf lost, never fruit cast; month after month they shall
yield a fresh crop, watered by that sanctuary stream; fruit for man’s
eating, and medicinal leaves.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` This message, too, the Lord God has for you, about the frontiers of
the territory you are to divide among the twelve tribes; twelve,
because Joseph must have a double portion.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I promised it to your fathers long ago; This land, I told them,
shall be allotted to you.✻ And you must allot it among yourselves in
equal shares.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` These are to be its boundaries on the north; from Hethalon, on the
Great Sea, across the pass which leads to Sedada
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and Emath, by Berotha and Sabarim (where Emath marches with Syria)
and Hazar Tichon (near the Hauran country)
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` to the Syrian frontier-town of Hazar Enan, its extreme limit
inland. Ever northward it stretches, this northern frontier of yours,
till it reaches Emath.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The eastern frontier is to be drawn between Hauran and what is now
Syria, between Galaad and Israel proper, down the line of the Jordan to
the Dead Sea.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Towards the south and the noon-day sun, the line stretches from
Thamar to the Waters of Challenge at Cades, then follows the Brook of
Egypt to the sea;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and on the west, it runs straight from the Egyptian border to the
Emath pass.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` All this territory must be apportioned between the tribes of
Israel;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` then you will divide it up among yourselves. Aliens will have their
share in it, such aliens as have thrown in their lot with yours and
bred amongst you; native Israelites you shall count them, and allot
them their portions in this tribe or that.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` Amidst the tribe which has given him shelter, each shall find a
home, the Lord God says.
