"15" = ''':sup:`15` We made a halt of three days by the Ahava river; and there I found
that I had common folk with me and priests, but no Levites.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So I despatched some of the chiefs, Eliezer, Ariel, Semeias,
Elnathan, Jarib, (a second Elnathan,) Nathan, Zacharias and Mosollam,
with two prudent counsellors, Joiarib and Elnathan,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` to Eddo, who was in command at Casphia; I bade them ask Eddo and

"19" = ''':sup:`19` also a Merarite, Hasabias, with Isaias and twenty more of his.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` There were also two hundred and twenty Nathinaeans; these
Nathinaeans were men bound over by David and David’s councillors to the
service of the Levites. A list of all their names was supplied to us.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` There, by the Ahava river, I proclaimed a fast; we would do
penance, and ask of the Lord our God a safe journey for ourselves, for
the children who went with us, and for all that was ours.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` I would have asked the king for an escort of horsemen to defend us
from attack, but shame withheld me; had we not boasted in the king’s
presence that our God graciously protected all who had recourse to him,
that only faithless servants of his brought down on themselves the
constraining power of his vengeance?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So fast we did, to win the favour we asked of God, and all went
well.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then I chose twelve of the leading priests, Sarabias and Hasabias
with ten others,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and handed over to them the offerings made by king, councillors,
and nobles, and by such Israelites as came forward with gifts; the
whole weight of silver and gold, and all the hallowed appurtenances of
our God’s temple.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` It was six hundred and fifty talents of silver I paid over to them,
with a hundred pieces of silver ware; and a hundred talents of gold,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` with twelve bowls of the same metal, each of ten pounds’ weight,
and two pieces of the finest bronze ware, like gold itself for beauty.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` You are consecrated to the Lord, I told them, and here are
consecrated things; here are silver and gold offered as a free gift to
the Lord God of our fathers.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Keep watchful guard over them; you are answerable for delivering
them safely, in the presence of priest and Levite and clan chief there
in Jerusalem, into the treasury of our God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So these priests and Levites took all that weight of silver and
gold into their keeping, and the ornaments besides, that must be
brought safely to the house of our God at Jerusalem.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` We left the Ahava river on the twelfth day of the first month,
bound for Jerusalem; and, with our God protecting us from all peril on
the way, of open enemy or secret,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` to Jerusalem we came. We had been there but three days
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` before silver, gold and ornaments, were delivered safe in our God’s
temple. Meremoth, son of the priest Urias, and Eleazar, son of Phinees,
with two Levites, Jozabed son of Josue and Noadaia son of Bennoi,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` handed it over, all counted and weighed, and its weight was duly
entered.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And these exiles, restored now from captivity, offered the God of
Israel burnt-sacrifice; twelve calves for the twelve tribes of Israel,
ninety rams and seventy-seven lambs, besides twelve goats as an
offering for fault. Such was the burnt-sacrifice they made in the
Lord’s honour;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` then they delivered the royal edict to the governors, that were the
king’s officers; and now God’s people and God’s house were held in
honour by all that bore rule in the country west of Euphrates.
