home; The loyal city, men shall call her, and that mountain where
dwells the Lord of hosts, The holy mountain.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` This, too: Trust me, there shall yet be aged folk in the streets of
Jerusalem, men and women both, that go staff in hand, they are so bowed
with years;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` thronged they shall be, those streets, with boys and girls at play
in the open.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And this: Hard to believe? So now they find it, poor remnant of a
people; but should I, the Lord of hosts, find it hard to perform?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And this, too: See if I do not rescue my people from the east
country and the west,

"9" = ''':sup:`9` A message from the Lord of hosts! Take courage, then, you that still
hold fast by✻ the commands the prophets gave you, when the foundations
of yonder house were a-laying, and the Lord of hosts had no temple yet.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Before that time, labour went unrewarded, for man and beast; so
hard pressed were you, none might come or go in safety; every man, in
those days, I left at his neighbour’s mercy.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` But now, says the Lord of hosts, this remnant of my people shall
enjoy better fortune;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` a happier seed-time is theirs. Its fruit the vineyard shall yield,
the land its harvest, heaven its rain, and all for this remnant to
enjoy.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Breed of Juda, breed of Israel, by-words of misfortune once, when
heathen folk fell to cursing their enemies; happy deliverance, they
shall be names of blessing now! Your fears vanquish, go bravely on;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` he, the Lord of hosts, gives you his warrant for it. Time was, says
he, when your fathers had roused my anger, and I was ever planning
mischief against you;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` no respite then! Today, for the good estate of Juda and Jerusalem
plan I no less eagerly; vanquish your fears.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And for your part, this do: deal honestly with your neighbours,

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And word came to me from the Lord of hosts, bidding me say this in
his name:

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Fasts you kept ever, when three months of the year, or four, six
months or nine were gone, shall be all rejoicing and gladness for the
men of Juda now, all high festival, will you but love true dealing and
peaceful ways.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` This promise I give you from the Lord of hosts: What alien throngs,
from what far cities, shall make pilgrimage yet!

"21" = ''':sup:`21` And ever, as fresh towns they reach, says pilgrim, Come with us,
and welcome; court we the divine favour, to the Lord of hosts repair
we; says townsman, Go with you I will.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` No nation so populous, no kingdom so strong, but shall betake
itself to Jerusalem, to find the Lord of hosts and court his divine
favour.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` This, too: A time is coming, when there is never a man of Jewish

is ours! The tale has reached us, how God is there to protect you.
