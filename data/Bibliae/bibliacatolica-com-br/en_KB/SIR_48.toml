fire-brand, his message.

left of the enemies that bore him a grudge, and found the Lord’s
commandment too hard for them.

proud kings, that might leave their sick-beds no more?

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Sinai should tell thee, Horeb should tell thee, of award made, and
doom pronounced;

'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In that whirlwind Elias was lost to view, bequeathing his spirit of
prophecy in full measure to Eliseus. Here was a man that in all his

should find release.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` With that, the Lord’s angel fell on the camp of Assyria, and
brought its armies to nothing.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So faithfully Ezechias did the Lord’s will, following boldly the
example of his father, king David; so well he obeyed Isaias, a great
prophet and a faithful interpreter of the vision the Lord gave him.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` In Isaias’ days it was that the sun went back, in token that the
