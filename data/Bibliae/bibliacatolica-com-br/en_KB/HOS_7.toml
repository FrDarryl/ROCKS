Notas de rodapé:
7:1-3 - The Lord laments Israel's persistence in sin, despite His
warnings. Their unfaithfulness is clear, and the consequences are
inevitable. Israel's heart has become hardened, turning even further
7:4-7 - The people of Israel are compared to a furnace, boiling over
and consuming itself. This metaphor represents the internal destruction
caused by sin, where the leadership and the people as a whole are
7:8-10 - Israel mixed with other nations, compromising its identity and
faith. Israel's unfaithfulness is symbolized by the mixing of wheat and
rye, which hinders spiritual growth and God's blessing on the people
7:11-16 - Israel fails to acknowledge its sinful condition and
continues to seek alliances with other nations rather than trusting in
God. This pride and lack of repentance result in its destruction (see
07:16 - God laments Israel's fall, for they have turned away from His
guidance and sought their own ways. Unfaithfulness is the cause of
Israel's suffering, and their failure to return to God makes the
1:21).
