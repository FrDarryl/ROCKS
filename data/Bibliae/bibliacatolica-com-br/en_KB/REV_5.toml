"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now I saw that he who sat on the throne carried in his right
hand a scroll. The inside of the page and the outside were both written
on, and it was sealed with seven seals.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And I saw an angel of sovereign strength, who was crying in a loud
voice, Who claims the right to open the book, and break the seals on
it?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But there was no one in heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, who
could open the scroll and have sight of it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I was all in tears, that none should be found worthy to open the
scroll or have sight of it;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` until one of the elders said to me, No need for tears; here is one
who has gained the right to open the book, by breaking its seven seals,
the Lion that comes from the tribe of Juda, from the stock of David.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then I saw, in the midst, where the throne was, amid the four
figures and the elders, a Lamb standing upright, yet slain (as I
thought) in sacrifice. He had seven horns, and seven eyes, which are
the seven spirits of God, that go out to do his bidding everywhere on
earth.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He now came, and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat
on the throne,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and when he disclosed it,✻ the four living figures and the
twenty-four elders fell down in the Lamb’s presence. Each bore a harp,
and they had golden bowls full of incense, the prayers of the saints.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And now it was a new hymn they sang, Thou, Lord, art worthy to take
up the book and break the seals that are on it. Thou wast slain in
sacrifice; out of every tribe, every language, every people, every
nation thou hast ransomed us with thy blood and given us to God.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Thou hast made us a royal race of priests, to serve God; we shall
reign as kings over the earth.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then I heard, in my vision, the voices of a multitude of angels,
standing on every side of the throne, where the living figures and the
elders were, in thousands of thousands,✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and crying aloud, Power and Godhead, wisdom and strength, honour
and glory and blessing are his by right, the Lamb that was slain.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And every creature in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, and
on the sea, and all that is in it,✻ I heard crying out together,
Blessing and honour and glory and power, through endless ages, to him
who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then the four living figures said, Amen; and the twenty-four elders
fell prostrate, worshipping him who lives for ever and ever.✻

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-5 - John sees the scroll sealed with seven seals, and no one is
worthy to open it until the Lamb, Christ, appears as the one worthy to
open the seals. Christ's victory over death makes Him worthy to reveal
5:6-10 - The Lamb is described as having been slain and worthy of
worship from all creation. His work of redemption is universal, and His
5:11-14 - Worship of the Lamb extends to all the heavenly orders,
showing that Christ is the center of all worship in heaven and on
earth. Christ's victory is an invitation for all creation to surrender
