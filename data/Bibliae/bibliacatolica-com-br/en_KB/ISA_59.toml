"1" = ''':sup:`1` Doubt you the Lord’s hand can reach far as ever, to bring
deliverance? Think you his ear has grown deaf, that you cry out in
vain?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Nay, sin of yours has come between you and your God; guilt of yours
has estranged him that he denies you audience;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` the bloodstained hands, the itching fingers, lying lips, and tongues
that whisper of treachery.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Who owns the claim of justice, who judges honourably? A lie their
confidence, folly their watchword, they carry mischief in the womb,
bring shame to birth.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Eggs the cockatrice may hatch, yet there is death in the taste of
them, a brood of basilisks;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` deftly the spider weaves, yet web of hers will never make cloth,
none will be the warmer for her toil; so it is with these; all
unprofitable their schemes, their doing all undoing.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Swift ministers of evil, hot-foot they scent down the blood of
innocence,✻ their aim ever to destroy, leave a trail of havoc and ruin.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Where peace should be found they know not, nor ever set their hearts
on right; still stray by crooked paths where safety is none.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What wonder if redress is still far from us, if reprieve linger on
its way? Crave we light, and nothing see but darkness, hope we for
dawn, and walk in dusk.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Blind men that grope along a wall, hands, not eyes, to shew the
way, stumble we at noonday as though benighted; we are dead men in a
world of shadows.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No better than growling bears, or doves that moan and mourn, still
we hope for the redress that never comes, the deliverance that is far
away.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Our guilt mounts up before thee, our sins accuse us; shame ever at
our side, we confess the wrong done.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Heinous our treason against the Lord, that turn away from his
divine leading to plan cruelty and rebellion; false thoughts we
conceive in our hearts that still find utterance.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Redress is withheld from us, because loyalty lies neglected in our
streets, and honour finds no entrance;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` alas that loyalty should be forgotten, innocence marked down for
spoil!All this the Lord has seen, and shame he thought it there should
be no redress.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Was there no champion to come forward? None found he, and his heart
misgave him. And so his own arm must bring the deliverance he intended,
his own faithfulness held him to it.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` That faithfulness is the breastplate that arms him, that saving
power the helmet that guards his head; vengeance the garment he wears,
jealous love the mantle that wraps him round.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Doubt not he will repay, wreak his anger upon the rebels, give his
enemies their due; no island so far off but it shall have its
punishment,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` till the name of the Lord strikes terror into western lands, and
the east stands in awe of his fame. Here is a river coming upon them in
full flood, driven on by the Lord’s breath;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` here is one that brings deliverance to Sion, and to all Jacob’s
children that turn away from their sins; the Lord has promised it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` This covenant I will make with them, the Lord says: Spirit of mine
that dwells in thee, words of mine entrusted to thy lips, on thy lips
shall dwell, on the lips of thy children and thy children’s children,
henceforth and for ever.
