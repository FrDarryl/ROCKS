"1" = ''':sup:`1` Father, answered the young Tobias, I will do all thy bidding;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but as for recovering the money, I have little hope. Here is one who
is a stranger to me, and I to him; what proof can I bring forward?
Meanwhile, I must find my way to Rages, and of that I have no
experience.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Nay, said his father, I have the man’s bond here; do but shew him
that, and he will restore the money without more ado.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Up then, and find some man of credit, that will go with thee upon
condition of a due reward; must I die before thou bring the money back
to me?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` With that, his son went out, and at the door stood a young man of
noble mien, all girt about, as if he were ready for a journey.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Little he knew that this was an angel of God, as he gave him
welcome; Fair sir, he asked, whence comest thou?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And on hearing that he had been among the men of Israel, Why then,
said he, thou knowest the road from here to Media?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I know it well, he answered; no step of it but I have marched often
enough, when I would visit a fellow-countryman of ours who lives there;
one Gabelus. The city where he dwells, Rages, is in Media, in the
hill-country about Ecbatana.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Wait for me here, Tobias asked of him, while I give my father news
of this.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then he went back, and told the story to his father, who was all
astonishment, and would have the stranger brought in.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So in he came, and wished him abiding happiness.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Happiness! Tobias said; little happiness for me, that sit here in
the dark, and see never the light of day!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Take courage, the stranger said, God means thy soon recovery.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then Tobias asked, Wilt thou take my son with thee, and guide him
to Media, to Rages, and so to the house of Gabelus? There shall be a
reward awaiting thee on thy return.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I will take him there, said the angel, and bring him home again
besides.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Tobias would know of what household or tribe he came.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It was indeed no other than the angel Raphael that spoke to him;
What, he answered, is it my lineage, not myself, thou wouldst have for
thy son’s escort?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But set thy mind at rest; my name is Azarias,✻ and a man of renown,
Ananias, was my father.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Forgive me, Tobias said, for doubting thy lineage; thou comest of
good stock indeed.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Raphael, then, promised to conduct the boy safely and bring him
safely home,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and Tobias bade them good speed; God be with you, said he, on your
journey, and may his angel bear you company!
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then, when his pack was ready, the young Tobias bade his father and
mother farewell, and the travellers set out together.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now that the boy had gone, his mother fell a-weeping; Here was the
only support of our old age, said she, why hast thou passed him on into
other hands?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Would to God the money thou hast sent him to claim had never been
thine!
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` We were content in our poverty; the very sight of the lad was
riches enough.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Dry thy tears, Tobias answered; safe will he fare, this son of
ours, and safe return; those eyes shall have sight of him again.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` I hold it for truth that some good angel of the Lord escorts him,
to see that all goes well with him and grant him happy return.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Thus comforted, the mother dried her tears and complained no more.✻
