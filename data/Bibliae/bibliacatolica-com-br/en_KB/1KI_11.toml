"1" = ''':sup:`1` But king Solomon gave his heart to many women of alien birth, not
only to Pharao’s daughter, but to Moabites and Ammonites, Edomites and
Sidonians and Hethites.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` It was of such races that the Lord had warned Israel, You must not
mate with them, or let them mate with your daughters; no question but
they will beguile your hearts into the worship of their own gods. Hotly
he loved and close he clung to them;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` seven hundred wives, each with a queen’s rights, and three hundred
concubines besides; what marvel if they beguiled his heart?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So, an old man now, he was enticed by women into the worship of
alien gods, and his heart was not true to the Lord, his own God, like
his father David’s before him.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` To Astarthe, goddess of the Sidonians, Solomon bowed down, and to
Moloch, the false god of Ammon,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and set the Lord’s will at defiance, instead of shewing his father’s
loyalty.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` To Chamos, the false god of Moab, and to Moloch, the false god of
Ammon, Solomon built shrines, there on the mountain-side in full view
of Jerusalem,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and humoured thus all those foreign wives of his, that must burn
incense, each to her own god, and offer victims.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So the Lord was angry with Solomon for playing him false, when he,
the Lord God of Israel, had twice appeared to him,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and warned him against this very sin of alien worship; a warning
that went unremembered.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Since this is thy mind, he told Solomon, to disregard my covenant
and the bidding I gave thee, I will not scruple to tear the kingdom
from thy grasp, and give it to one of thy own servants.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Only, for the love of thy father David, I will not do it in thy
life-time; it is thy son that shall lose his kingdom.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nor will I take away the whole of it; one tribe he shall have left
to him, for the sake of my servant David, and Jerusalem, the city of my
choice.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the Lord gave Solomon an enemy to contend with, Adad the
Idumean, of the royal dynasty of Edom.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` This man had made his escape, at the time when David invaded
Idumea, and Joab, the commander of his army, was seeing to the burial
of all its male inhabitants, who had been put to the sword.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Joab, with all the fighting men of Israel, had spent six months
there, exterminating every male survivor of the Edomite race,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and meanwhile Adad, still in early boyhood, took refuge in Egypt,
under the charge of certain Edomites, that had been his father’s
servants.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It was from Madian they began their journey, and when they reached
Pharan they found adherents there; with these, they made their way into
Egypt and had recourse to king Pharao, who gave Adad a house of his
own, with an allowance of food and lands to cultivate.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Great favour Adad won with king Pharao, who gave him his own
sister-in-law, the sister of queen Taphnes, for his wife;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` by her he had a son, Genubath, whom Taphnes brought up at Pharao’s
palace, so that he lived at court among Pharao’s own children.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When news reached Adad, there in Egypt, that David had been laid to
rest with his fathers, and that Joab, too, the commander of his army,
was dead, he asked Pharao’s leave to go back to his own country.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Why, Pharao asked, what is lacking to thee here, that thou shouldst
be pining for thy home? Nothing, said he, but give me leave for all
that.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` (Meanwhile, God gave Solomon another enemy to contend with, Razon,
son of Eliada, that ran away from his master, Adarezer king of Soba,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and levied war on him. When David conquered Soba, Razon became
leader of a robber band, that went and settled in Damascus, where they
made him king;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and all through Solomon’s reign he was the enemy of Israel.) Such
was the cause of Adad’s rebellion and his ill will against Israel, and
he set up a kingdom in Syria.✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` There was a servant, too, of king Solomon’s that turned against
him, Jeroboam son of Nabat, an Ephraimite that lived at Sareda with his
widowed mother, Sarva.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And this is the story of his rebellion against his master. At the
time when Solomon was building Mello, and filling up the gap his father
had left in the walls of David’s Keep,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` this Jeroboam was a warrior at the height of his strength, and
Solomon marked him out for a young man gifted and active, so he put him
in charge of the labour that was exacted from the northern tribes.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And now, as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, he met the prophet
Ahias, of Silo, that was clad in a new cloak, out in the open country,
where none else was by.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Ahias, tearing the new cloak he wore into twelve pieces,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` bade Jeroboam take ten of them; This message, said he, the Lord God
of Israel sends thee, I mean to wrest the kingship from the power of
Solomon, and make over ten tribes to thee.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` One tribe shall remain his, for the sake of my servant David, and
of Jerusalem, among all the cities of Israel the city of my choice.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He has forsaken me, to worship Astarthe, goddess of the Sidonians,
Chamos, god of Moab, and Moloch, god of Ammon; he has not followed the
path I bade him follow, by doing my will and keeping command and decree
of mine, like his father David before him.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Not from his hand will I take the kingdom away, nor all of it;
while he lives, I will grant him rule over it, for love of my chosen
servant David, that kept command and decree of mine faithfully;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` but his son shall lose it. Ten tribes I will give to thee,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and to his son one tribe only, so that my servant David may still
have his lamp alight in my presence, there in Jerusalem, the favoured
sanctuary of my name.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` On thee my choice shall fall; thou shalt have power to thy heart’s
content, the king of Israel.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And if thou wilt attend to the charge I lay upon thee, following
the ways I bid thee follow and doing my will, keeping command and
decree of mine as my servant David once did, then I will be with thee,
and grant thee a dynasty abiding as David’s was.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` I will make Israel over to thee; such sorrow I will bring on the
race of David, but not for ever.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Solomon would fain have put Jeroboam to death, but he was up and
gone; he took refuge with Sesac king of Egypt, and remained there till
Solomon’s death.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` As for the rest of Solomon’s life and doings, and the stories told
of his wisdom, they are all to be found in the Annals of king Solomon.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` He was forty years on the throne, with his capital at Jerusalem,
but with all Israel for his subjects;
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` and when he was laid to rest with his fathers, they buried him,
David’s heir, in David’s Keep. And he was succeeded by his son Roboam.

Notas de rodapé:
11:1-3 - Solomon disobeyed God by marrying numerous foreign women, who
ultimately turned his heart to other gods. His moral and spiritual
decline contrasted with the promising beginning of his reign and
demonstrated the danger of disobedience (see also Deuteronomy 7:3-4 and
11:4-6 - Solomon, now elderly, is led to worship other gods because of
his wives. His unfaithfulness to God marks the beginning of the
division of the kingdom of Israel. The impact of idolatry is profound,
even for a king so blessed with wisdom (see also Deuteronomy 17:17 and
11:9-13 - God is angry with Solomon for his straying and announces that
the kingdom will be divided. However, for David's sake, this division
will occur in the time of his son. Here we see the importance of the
Kings 12:15).
11:14-22 - God raises adversaries against Solomon, including Hadad the
Edomite. This growing opposition reflects divine judgment on the king
who strayed from obedience. The consequences of Solomon's sin begin to
11:26-40 - Jeroboam, Solomon's servant, is chosen by God to rule the
ten tribes of Israel. The prophet Ahijah symbolizes this division by
tearing his cloak into twelve pieces. This event marks the beginning of
Israel's political and spiritual division (see also 1 Kings 12:20 and
