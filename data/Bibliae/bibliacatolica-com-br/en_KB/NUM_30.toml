Lord:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It may be, man or woman will take a vow, or an oath. If it be a man,

word.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But if a woman has made a vow, or bound herself by an oath, it may
be she is only a girl, living in her father’s house still. Did her
father know that she had vowed or sworn, and make no protest? Then she
is bound by her vow;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` she must fulfil what she bound herself by oath to fulfil.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Did her father, as soon as he heard of it, refuse his consent? Then
vow or oath are null and void; she cannot be held to her promise if her
father did not consent to it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It may be such a girl will marry, still under her vow, still bound

vow thenceforward; she must carry out what she promised.
'''

oath;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` is she bound to fulfil her promise? Yes, if he hears of it and
makes no protest.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But if he immediately refuses his consent, she cannot be held to
her undertaking; the Lord will not hold her guilty if her husband’s
consent is refused.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It may be a wife will bind herself by an oath, vowing to mortify
herself by fasting or some other kind of abstinence; it is for her
husband to decide whether she is to keep it or not.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If he makes no protest on hearing of it, but waits till afterwards
before making his decision, she must pay her vow, keep the promise she
made; there was no protest from him when he heard of it.
'''

will be held to account for her fault.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Such are the rules the Lord gave Moses, to govern the conduct of

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
30:1-2 - God establishes the importance of keeping vows made to Him.
Integrity and seriousness in committing to God are fundamental to the
life of faith, and breaking a vow is considered a serious sin (see also
30:3-5 - The law regarding women's vows states that a father or husband
can annul vows made by a daughter or wife. This reflects the
patriarchal system of the time, but also the protection of women under
3:1-6).
30:6-8 - Vows made by a married woman can be annulled by her husband if
he disavows them upon hearing them. This reflects the man's spiritual
authority in the home, according to the practices of the Law of Moses
30:9-12 - Widowed or divorced women, when making vows, are responsible
for fulfilling their promises, since they do not have a male authority
figure over them. This reinforces personal responsibility before God
30:13-16 - The husband has the power to confirm or nullify any vow his
wife makes. The chapter's conclusion emphasizes the established
authority in the family and the accountability of both spouses before
