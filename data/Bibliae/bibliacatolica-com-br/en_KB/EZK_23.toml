[23]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There were two women once, son of man, daughters of the same mother,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` that went to Egypt and played the wanton there, so wanton and so
young! There those breasts surrendered to the attack, virginity was
ravished.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For their names, the elder was called Oölla, the younger Oöliba;
both I espoused, and they bore me sons and daughters. (Samaria and
Jerusalem are the true names.)
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` What did Oölla? She played me false, love-sick for the Assyrians
that dwelt hard by, her paramours.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Gay gallants were these, princes and noblemen that went clad in
purple, and proudly they came riding, for they were horsemen all.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Among the flower of Assyrian chivalry was none but enjoyed her
favours; and she, that courted all alike, soiled herself with their
idolatry.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Alas, still unforgotten her dalliance in Egypt; the lovers that
bedded her in her youth, mishandled her virgin breast, plied her with
their debauchery!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Love-sick for new paramours, into their keeping she should be given
up, the Assyrians should have the mastery of her.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` How they stripped and dishonoured her, robbed her of sons and
daughters both, and then put her to the sword! Never fell such signal
punishment upon womankind.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` That sight before her, what did the other sister, Oöliba? Why, she
outwent the first in her wantonness, more lascivious yet;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` she too cast shame aside, gave herself to the gallants of Assyria
that came riding by, horsemen all, princes and noblemen in their
broidered cloaks, so young, so fair!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Light women both; I knew them now.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` This other would set no bounds to her lust; her eye fell on some
pictured wall, where the men of Chaldaea stood portrayed, all in
crimson.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What girdles they had about their loins, these men of Babylon, what
gaily-coloured turbans they wore! Sure, they must be princes, all of
them, in their own Chaldaean land!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And with that, her eye fell a-doting on them, and she must send
them a message all the way to Chaldaea.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So the Chaldaeans, too, were her bed-fellows, dishonoured her with
their embraces, till even she grew weary of dishonour.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Weary was I too, as once of her sister; the open harlotry, the
public shame!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Must she still renew her unfaithfulness, hanker still after those
old debaucheries in Egypt,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` when she was love-sick for gallants lusty as the wild ass, hot as
stallions?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Alas, Oöliba, are they remembered still, the passions of thy youth,
far away in Egypt, when those breasts surrendered to the attack, that
virginity was ravished?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` This doom, then, the Lord God pronounces on thee: They shall be
summoned to the attack, all those old lovers thou art wearied of,
beleaguer thee round about;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` all those Chaldaeans from Babylon, nobleman and prince and
chieftain, all those gay gallants from Assyria, captains and rulers,
lords paramount and knights of renown!
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` What rattling of chariot-wheels, what hordes of warriors in
breastplate and shield and helmet, mustered about thy walls! These
shall be thy judges; theirs the sentence thou must abide.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Ministers of my jealous anger, they shall cut nose and ears off
thee, and there shall be sword-strokes yet; carry off thy sons and thy
daughters, and the fire shall have work to do yet.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` They shall strip thee of thy clothes, rifle thy proud ornaments;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` gone the memory of thy harlotries in Egypt, no hankering for them
now, no thought of Egypt now!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Weary thou art and disdainful of them, says the Lord God, but they
shall have the mastery of thee;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and they shall use thee cruelly enough; carry all thy harvest away,
and leave thee stripped and humbled; lay bare the secret of thy shame.
Lust it is and lechery of thine
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` that has brought thee to this pass; so wantonly didst thou court
the heathen, till at last their idolatry infected thee.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Thy sister’s counterpart, the cup of thy sister’s doom thou shalt
inherit;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` deep thy cup shall be as hers, wide as hers; full of mockery and
reproach, so much it holds,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` full of dizziness and dismay, full of despair and melancholy, the
cup of thy sister Samaria.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Drink it thou shalt, ay, drain it to the dregs, till thou art ready
to devour cup itself piecemeal, or mutilate thy own breasts in thy
madness.✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Me thou didst forget; on me thy back was turned; wanton and
faithless, thou shalt be held to account.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Arraign them, son of man, the Lord God said to me; confront Oölla
and Oöliba with the record of their foul deeds.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Blood-stained those adulterous hands; false gods they have taken
for their paramours, and to the greed of false gods sacrificed their
own children and mine.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Theirs to defile my sanctuary, profane my sabbath;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` no sooner had they done offering their sons to false gods, than my
sanctuary must be violated; so would they treat me in my own house.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And then they sent word to their paramours, summoning them from
afar.They came, those paramours; and thou, fresh from the bath, eyes
painted, all thy ornaments hung about thee,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` didst await them, sitting on a fine bed with a table before it;
incense of mine, oil of mine was there.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` What a stir was heard there, as of a great throng taking their
ease! They had brought in a rabble of desert folk with them, and these
must be given bracelets for their arms, fine garlands for their heads.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And I wondered whether she would grant them her favours, even she,
that had grown so old in unfaithfulness;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` but sure enough they went in, boldly as to a harlot’s bed.✻ Such
lovers had Oölla and Oöliba, wantons both.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Yet honest folk there be,✻ that can judge their deeds as adultery
should be judged and murder; adulterous they are and murderous both at
once.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Muster me a company of such men, the Lord God says, and let them
make a fearful example of these women, their prize.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` With stones from many hands, with swords from every side dispatch
them; death for their children, the fire for their homes!
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Rid we the land of its guilt; of such harlotry let all women
beware!
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Wantonness punished, idolatry’s guilt uncondoned; you shall know
the Lord’s power at last.

Notas de rodapé:
23:1-4 - The chapter opens with the allegory of two sisters, Oholah and
Oholibah, who represent the cities of Samaria and Jerusalem,
respectively. This metaphor illustrates the spiritual unfaithfulness
23:5-10 - Oholah, representing Samaria, prostitutes herself to the
Assyrians, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness to God. Idolatry is seen
as spiritual adultery, a betrayal of the covenant with God (see also 2
23:11-21 - Oholibah, representing Jerusalem, is more corrupt than her
sister, committing greater abominations. The chapter highlights the
moral and spiritual degeneration of Judah, leading to imminent
23:22-30 - God promises to punish Oholibah by bringing judgment upon
Jerusalem, represented by the invasion of enemy nations. The sin of
unfaithfulness will be punished, and God's judgment will fall severely
23:31-49 - The chapter concludes with a detailed description of
Oholibah's punishment, showing that God's justice will be fully
executed. Jerusalem's punishment will be exemplary for all nations,
