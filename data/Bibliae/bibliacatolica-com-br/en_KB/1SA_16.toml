"1" = ''':sup:`1` But now the Lord said to Samuel, What, still lamenting over Saul? I
have cast him off; he is to be king of Israel no longer. Come, put oil
in that phial of thine, and go on an errand for me to Jesse of
Bethlehem; in one of his sons I have looked myself out a king.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` How can I undertake such a journey, asked Samuel, without Saul
coming to hear of it, and killing me? Take a young bull with thee, the
Lord answered, and make it known, I have come to offer the Lord
sacrifice.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To this sacrifice Jesse must be bidden; then I will reveal my will
to thee, and thou shalt anoint the man I direct thee to anoint.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Thereupon Samuel did as the Lord bade him; and when he reached
Bethlehem, the elders of the city greeted him in alarm, asking whether
his coming boded well for them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Yes, he told them, I have come to offer the Lord sacrifice. Rid
yourselves of defilement, and join with me in offering it. And with
that he hallowed Jesse and his sons, and bade them come to the
sacrifice with the rest.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` As soon as they entered the house, his eye fell on Eliab, and he
said, Here stands the Lord’s choice, in the Lord’s presence!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the Lord warned Samuel, Have no eyes for noble mien or tall
stature; I have passed this one by. Not where man’s glance falls, falls
the Lord’s choice; men see but outward appearances, he reads the
heart.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then Jesse called Abinadab, and brought him into Samuel’s presence;
but, No, said he, this is not the Lord’s choice;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` then Samma, but he said, No, not this one either.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Seven sons of his did Jesse thus present before Samuel, but none of
these, he was told, had the Lord chosen.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then Samuel asked Jesse whether these were all, and he answered,
One still remains, the youngest, herding the sheep. Send for him,
answered Samuel; we must not sit down till he comes.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Jesse sent and fetched him, red-cheeked, fair of face, pleasant
of mien. And now the Lord said, Up, anoint him; this is my choice.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Whereupon Samuel took out the phial of oil and anointed him then
and there in his brethren’s presence; and on him, on David, the spirit
of the Lord came down, ever after that day. As for Samuel, he rose up
and went home to Ramatha.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Meanwhile the Lord’s spirit passed away from Saul; instead, at the
Lord’s bidding, an evil mood came upon him that gave him no rest.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` God sends thee an ill mood, his servants told him, to disquiet
thee.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` We are thy servants, waiting on our Lord’s bidding; shall we go and
find some skilful player on the harp, to relieve thee, when God visits
thee with this evil mood, by his music?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Yes, answered Saul, find one who can play the harp well, and bring
him to me.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And here one of his servants offered advice; Stay, I myself have
met such a man, a skilful player indeed, a son of Jesse the
Bethlehemite. He is sturdy besides, and a tried warrior, well-spoken
and personable, and the Lord is with him.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Thereupon a message went out from Saul to Jesse, There is a son of
thine, David, that looks after thy sheep; send him to me.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Jesse loaded an ass with bread, and a flagon of wine, and a
kid, and sent these by David as a present to Saul.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thus it was that David met Saul and entered his service; and became
his armour-bearer, so well Saul loved him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Let David remain here in attendance on me, Saul told Jesse; I like
him well.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And whenever Saul was taken with this evil mood of his, David would
fetch his harp, and play; whereupon Saul was comforted and felt easier,
till at last the evil mood left him.

Notas de rodapé:
16:1 - God commands Samuel to go to Bethlehem to anoint a new king from
among the sons of Jesse. This verse marks the transition from Saul to
16:6-7 - When Samuel sees Eliab, he thinks he must be the chosen one,
but God corrects him by saying that He looks not at the outward
appearance, but at the heart. This reinforces the idea that God chooses
16:11-13 - David, the youngest and seemingly insignificant of Jesse's
sons, is anointed king. This event highlights the theme of the "little
one" being exalted by God and prefigures David's central role in
1:27-29).
16:14 - The Spirit of God withdraws from Saul, and an evil spirit
torments him. This verse symbolizes the removal of God's grace from
Saul and the beginning of his spiritual and mental decline (see also
16:17-23 - David, chosen to play the harp and calm Saul, enters the
king's service. This providential encounter between David and Saul
reflects how God uses simple situations to accomplish His greater
