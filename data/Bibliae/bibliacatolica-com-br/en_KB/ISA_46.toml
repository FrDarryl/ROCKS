gazing-stock for wild beasts and cattle! Heavy enough the burden you
had to carry;

none for their toiling worshippers,✻ living souls that have gone off

Notas de rodapé:
46:1-2 - Babylon’s idols, such as Bel and Nebo, are portrayed as

46:3-4 - God reminds His people that He has carried them from birth and
will continue to sustain them into old age. This promise reaffirms
God’s faithfulness and care (see also Deuteronomy 32:11-12 and

declares the end from the beginning. This highlights His omniscience
46:11:00 - God affirms that He will fulfill His intentions, mentioning
a "bird of prey" that will carry out His plan. This reference may
1:1-2).
46:12-13 - God urges the rebellious to listen, for His justice is near,
