"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then, once again, the sons of Israel defied the Lord, and for forty
years he left them at the mercy of the Philistines.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There was a certain tribesman of Dan called Manue, who lived at
Saraa, and had a wife that bore him no children.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To her the Lord’s angel appeared, and said, Poor barren one, poor
childless one, thou art to conceive, and bear a son.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` See to it that no wine or strong drink, no unclean food passes thy
lips,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` for this son whom thou art to conceive and bear is to be a Nazirite
from his birth; even when he is a child, no razor must come near his
head. And he shall strike the first blow to deliver Israel from the
power of the Philistines.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So when she met her husband she told him, I have been speaking with
a messenger from God, who might have been an angel, such awe his look
inspired in me. Who he was, his home, his name, he would not tell,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` but the message he gave me was that I should conceive, and have a
son. And I must abstain from wine and all strong drink, and from all
unclean food, because this son of mine was to be a Nazirite from his
childhood up, bound to the Lord by his vow from the day of his birth to
the day of his death.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Thereupon Manue entreated the Lord to send his messenger again, and
tell them how this child, once born, should be nurtured.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the Lord granted his prayer; once more the angel of God appeared
to his wife, as she sat resting in a field. Her husband was not with
her, and she, upon sight of the angel,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` ran off to fetch him; He has come back, she told him, the man I saw
a few days since.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So he rose and followed her, and asked the angel whether it was he
that had brought the message to his wife; Yes, he said, it was I.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Tell me, then, said Manue, when thy promise is fulfilled, what life
is the boy to lead, what things are they he must shun?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But the angel of the Lord answered, Enough that thy wife should
observe the warnings I gave her,✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` eating nothing that grows in the vineyard, drinking no wine or
strong drink, abstaining from all unclean food; these commands of mine
she must carry out faithfully.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And now Manue said to the angel of the Lord, Pray do me one favour;
allow us to cook a kid for thy eating.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Detain me if thou wilt, said the angel, but of thy food I must not
eat; offer burnt-sacrifice, if thou wilt, to the Lord. And still Manue
did not recognize that it was the Lord’s angel;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` What is thy name? he asked. If thy words come true, we would fain
give thee some token of gratitude.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` My name? said he. Do not ask my name; it is a high mystery.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So Manue brought the kid, and a bread-offering with it, and laid it
on the rock, presenting it before the Lord; and mystery indeed there
was, before the eyes of Manue and his wife;✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` as flames went up to heaven from the altar, the angel of the Lord
went up too, there amid the flames.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` At the sight, Manue and his wife fell down face to earth. Now that
he had disappeared from their view, Manue knew him for what he was,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and said to his wife, This is certain death; we have seen the Lord.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Nay, answered his wife, if the Lord meant us harm, he would not
have accepted our sacrifice and our bread-offering; he would not have
shewn us this marvellous sight, nor told us what is to befall.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And so she bore a son, and called him Samson. As the lad grew, the
Lord’s blessing was on him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It was at the Encampment of Dan, between Saraa and Esthaol, that
the spirit of the Lord first visited him.

Notas de rodapé:
13:1 - The people of Israel again do what is evil in the sight of the
Lord and are delivered into the hands of the Philistines. This repeated
cycle of sin, oppression, and repentance is a central theme in the Book
of Judges, demonstrating the need for divine leadership (see also
13:2-5 - The announcement of Samson's birth by a barren woman is a
demonstration of God's power to bring life where there seems to be no
hope. Samson's appointment as judge is an example of God's sovereign
18:14).
13:6-14 - The woman visits an angel of the Lord, who instructs her on
Samson's upbringing and education. The importance of obedience to God's
commandments in the formation of leaders is emphasized, showing that
spiritual education is crucial to the fulfillment of God's purpose (see
13:15-20 - Manoah's request to the angel of the Lord for further
revelation highlights the human search for divine guidance. The angel's
response reaffirms the importance of sacrifice and worship to God,
13:21-25 - The Lord's presence manifests itself in Samson, marking him
as chosen for the mission of delivering Israel. The Spirit of the Lord
begins to move upon Samson, demonstrating the importance of spiritual
Corinthians 12:4-11).
