"1" = ''':sup:`1` Soon after this, it chanced that two of the king of Egypt’s
courtiers, his cup-bearer and his pastrycook, fell into disgrace with
their master.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The one was chief of all his cup-bearers, the other of all his
pastrycooks, and Pharao, angry with both of them,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` handed them over to the captain of the guard, to share Joseph’s
prison.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So the gaoler put them in Joseph’s charge, and he saw to their
needs. They had not been long in captivity
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` when, on a single night, either of them had a dream, portending what
it portended to each.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Joseph, when he visited them next morning, found both of them
downcast,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and enquired why they looked sadder than their wont.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` We have been dreaming, they said, and we can find no interpreter.
Why, said Joseph, it is God who interprets our dreams for us; tell me
what it was you saw.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The chief cup-bearer related his dream first; I saw in front of me,
he said, a vine,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` which had three shoots. First they budded, and then, when they had
flowered, grapes grew upon them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I had Pharao’s cup in my hand; so I took the grapes and pressed
them out into the cup I held, and gave Pharao the draught.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This, answered Joseph, is what thy dream meant; the three shoots
stand for three days which have yet to pass,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` after which Pharao will bethink himself that he has need of thee,
and will restore thee to thy old office; then thou wilt hand the cup to
him by right of thy office as thou ever didst.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Pray do not forget me, in that day of thy prosperity; as thou
lovest me, win from Pharao my release from this prison of ours.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` It was treachery brought me here, when I left the land of the
Hebrews, and now I am in this dungeon for no fault of mine.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Hereupon the chief cook, finding that Joseph could interpret the
first dream so well, reminded them that he had dreamt too; I was
carrying three baskets of loaves on my head, said he,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and the top basket contained pastry of every kind; but the birds
came and ate it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thy dream, answered Joseph, means this; the three baskets stand for
three days which have yet to pass,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` after which Pharao will take away thy life,✻ and so hang thee on a
gibbet, for the birds to come and prey on thy flesh.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The third day after was Pharao’s birthday, and he made a great
feast for his servants. And as he sat feasting, he remembered the chief
cup-bearer and the chief pastrycook.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The one he restored to his office of putting the cup in his hand;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` the other he hung on a gallows, to prove the truth of the prophecy
that had been made.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But the chief cup-bearer, in his new good fortune, thought no more
of the man who had interpreted his dream.

Notas de rodapé:
40:1-4 - Joseph is imprisoned and becomes responsible for the
prisoners. His leadership, even under adverse circumstances,
demonstrates God's sovereignty in his life. Joseph is an example of
integrity and responsibility, even in times of trial (see also
40:5-8 - The dreams of Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker reveal the
importance of dream interpretation in Egyptian culture. Joseph,
trusting in God, offers explanations that highlight his gift and his
37:5-10).
40:9-15 - The interpretation of the cupbearer's dream, which results in
his restoration, shows how God can use difficult situations to further
His will. Joseph also asks the cupbearer to remember him upon his
10:30-31).
40:16-19 - The interpretation of the baker's dream, which predicts his
death, emphasizes the seriousness of divine revelation. This highlights
that not all the results of God's promises are positive, but reflect
12:5).
40:20-23 - The cupbearer forgets Joseph, illustrating the fragility of
human promises. This passage teaches patience and trust in God, even
