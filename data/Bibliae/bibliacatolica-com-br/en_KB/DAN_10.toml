"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then, in the third year of Cyrus’ reign, that was king of Persia, a
fresh revelation was made to Daniel, who is also called Baltassar. Here
is truth indubitable, and a great host … And right well he understood
its meaning; little avails vision where understanding is none.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For three weeks together I, Daniel, that saw it, had been making sad
cheer;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` for three weeks together dry bread was my diet, nor ever did meat or
wine cross my lips, nor oil anoint me.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Came now the twenty-fourth day of the new year, and I stood by the
banks of the great river, where it is called Tigris.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I looked up, and saw a man standing there clad all in linen, and his
girdle of fine gold.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Clear as topaz his body was, like the play of lightning shone his
face, and like burning cressets his eyes; arms and legs of him had the
sheen of bronze, and when he spoke, it was like the murmur of a throng.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The vision was for me, for Daniel, alone; my companions never saw
it; such fear overcame them, they were fain to hide themselves,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and I was left alone with this high vision for my company. No wonder
if my spirits were cowed; pale grew my cheek, and all the strength in
me ebbed away.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He spoke, and as I listened to that voice, I swooned where I stood,
and lay there, face to earth,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` till a hand touched me, giving fresh impulse to knee and wrist.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Daniel, he said to me, Daniel, so well beloved, up with thee, and
heed thou well; I have an errand to thee. Yet for all he spoke thus to
me, I stood there trembling,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and still he must allay my fears. Take heart, Daniel, said he; thy
prayers did not go unheard. Prayer of thine it was beckoned me to thy
side, from the very moment when thou didst set about thy search for
knowledge, by fasting in the presence of thy God;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` but these twenty-one days he who guards the realm of Persia has
delayed my coming. At last Michael, one of the high lords, brought me
aid, and there, at Persia’s court, I was left master of the field.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now I am here to tell thee what shall befall thy people in the last
days; long days must pass ere the revelation is accomplished.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Ever, as he spoke, I stood there dumb, and with eyes downcast,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` till all at once a touch fell on my lips, like the touch of human
hand.✻ Now found I speech, to give yonder visitant his answer. Bethink
thee, my lord, I said, that sight of thee unknits my frame; strength in
me is none.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` How should slave bandy words with master? Not strength alone fails
me; the very breath will not come.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Once again a hand seemed to touch me, and words came to hearten me;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Nay, fears are not for thee, so well beloved; never harm befall
thee! Take courage, and play a man’s part! With that, I found my
strength again; Speak on, my Lord, said I; thou hast put new heart into
me.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he answered, Hast thou read, by this, the secret of my coming
to thee? I am even now on my way back to fight against the lord of
Persia; when I left him, what saw I but the lord of the Greeks already
on the march?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Only I must shew thee first what is written in the book of doom.✻
Much is to do, and save for Michael, that is guardian of your race, I
have none to aid me.
