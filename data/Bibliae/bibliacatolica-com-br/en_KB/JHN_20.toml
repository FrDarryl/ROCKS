"16" = ''':sup:`16` Jesus said to her, Mary. And she turned and said to him, Rabboni

'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Jesus said, Do not cling to me thus; I have not yet gone up to
my Father’s side. Return to my brethren, and tell them this; I am going
up to him who is my Father and your Father, who is my God and your God.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So Mary Magdalen brought news to the disciples, of how she had seen
the Lord, and he had spoken thus to her.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And now it was evening on the same day, the first day of the week;
for fear of the Jews, the disciples had locked the doors of the room in

'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So, eight days afterwards, once more the disciples were within, and
Thomas was with them; and the doors were locked. Jesus came and stood
there in their midst; Peace be upon you, he said.

and believe.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` Thomas answered, Thou art my Lord and my God.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Jesus said to him, Thou hast learned to believe, Thomas,
