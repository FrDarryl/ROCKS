"1" = ''':sup:`1` And this is how the tabernacle is to be fashioned. Make ten curtains
of twisted linen thread, worked in threads of blue and purple and
scarlet twice-dyed, with all the embroiderer’s art.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` All the curtains are to be of the same size, twenty-eight cubits in
length and four in width.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Five of these must be joined to each other, and then the remaining
five in the same way;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the sides, the extreme edges of the curtains must be fitted with
loops of blue cord, to fasten one to the next,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` fifty loops at the edge of either set of curtains, so let in that
loop meets loop and can be fastened to it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then make fifty gold clasps, and join the two widths of curtain
together, to make a single tent of them.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Next, make eleven coverings of goats’ hair, to protect the tapestry
over the tabernacle.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The measurements of all these coverings are to be the same; each
will be thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Join together first five of the coverings, then the other six; the
sixth of these is to hang double over the front of the tapestry.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Make fifty loops at the edge of the first set of coverings, then
fifty at the edge of the other, to join them together,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and fifty brazen clasps, to hold these loops together, so that the
whole may form a single protecting roof.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Since there is one more of these coverings than is needed for the
protection of the tapestry, fold it double and use it to protect the
back of the tabernacle.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The coverings are a cubit longer on the north and south than the
tapestry, and this additional cubit will hang down, to protect the
tabernacle itself on either side.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then make another canopy over the roof, of rams’ fleeces dyed red,
and yet another, of skins dyed violet.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then make upright frames of acacia wood to support the tabernacle.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Each must be ten cubits high, and a cubit and a half wide;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and at the sides of it, two tenon-pieces must jut out, so that each
frame can be mortised to the next; all the frames are to be made in
this manner.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Twenty of these will be on the south, facing the midday sun,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` with forty silver sockets, two at the foot of each frame, close to
the corners;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and twenty more on the opposite side, that looks northwards;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` these again will have forty silver sockets, two at the foot of each
frame.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And for the western end of the tabernacle there will be six frames,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and two in addition, which must be set up in the corners at the
extreme end of the tabernacle.✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` All these will be joined together, from bottom to top, with a
single kind of fastening to hold them all; the two frames which are to
be set up in the corners will be joined in the same way as the others.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Thus there will be eight frames in all, with sixteen silver
sockets, two to each frame.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then make five poles of acacia wood, to hold the frames together on
one side of the tabernacle,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and five more to hold it together on the other side, and the same
number for the western end;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` these will be passed right along the frames from end to end.✻
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Gild the frames themselves, and furnish them with gold rings, by
which the poles can hold the frames together; these poles, too, must be
plated with gold.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So must thou set up the tabernacle, in conformity with the pattern
that has been shewn to thee on the mountain.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Make a veil, too, out of twisted linen thread, worked in threads of
blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed, with all the embroiderer’s art,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and let it hang down from four posts of acacia wood, gilded and
with gilt capitals,✻ but set in silver sockets.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` This veil will be held up by rings. The ark is to be set down
behind it, and thus it will be a division between the sanctuary and the
inner sanctuary.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The throne, too, which rests above the ark and its records, will be
in the inner sanctuary;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` on the outer side of the veil, the table will stand on the north,
and the lamp-stand on the south side of the tabernacle, opposite the
table.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Make a screen, too, out of twisted linen thread, embroidered with
threads of blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed, for the entrance of
the tabernacle;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` it must hang from five gilded posts of acacia wood, with gilt
capitals and sockets of bronze.
