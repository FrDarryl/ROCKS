This year once added to the tale of years, feast-days of it over and

lion-city indeed.

set engines in place to besiege thee.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Cower down thou must, and offer parley from the earth where thou
liest; from the ruins thy voice will make itself heard, no better than
a muttering from the ground, as it were some ghost that moaned there
under the earth.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then, like fine dust, the hordes that routed thee shall vanish; like
a spark that smoulders, thy conquerors shall die away.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Suddenly, in a moment, the Lord will sweep down upon them in
thunder, and earthquake, in a storm of roaring wind, in fire that

Abraham’s deliverer: No longer shall Jacob be disappointed, no longer
