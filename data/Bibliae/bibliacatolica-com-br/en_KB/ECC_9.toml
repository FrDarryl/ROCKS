"1" = ''':sup:`1` All this, too, I pondered in my heart, and would spare no pains to
find out the meaning of it. Here are upright men and wise; and every
task of theirs is in God’s keeping, nor can any tell whether they have
earned his love, or his displeasure!
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This remains as yet uncertain, and meanwhile all have the same lot,
upright and godless, good and wicked, clean and unclean alike. Brought
they offerings or brought they none, well did they or ill, true swore
they or false, it is all one.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Of all that goes amiss, here under the sun, nothing does more hurt
than this equality of fortunes; what wonder if men’s hearts, while yet
they live, are full of malice and defiance? And so they journey on to
the grave.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Were but immortality the prize! But no, hope of that is none; living
dog is better off than dead lion.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` They live under sentence of death; and when death comes, of nothing
will they be aware any longer; no reward can they receive, now that
every trace of them has vanished away;

"6" = ''':sup:`6` no love, no hatred, no envy can they feel; they have said good-bye
to this world, and to all its busy doings, here under the sun.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Go thy ways, then, eat thy bread with a stout heart, and drink wine
to thy contenting; that done, God asks no more of thee.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` live at ease with the wife that is thy heart’s love, long as this
uncertain life is granted thee; fugitive days, here beneath the sun.
Live thou and labour thou under the sun as thou wilt, this thy portion
shall be, and nothing more.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Whatever lies in thy power, do while do it thou canst; there will
be no doing, no scheming, no wisdom or skill left to thee in the grave,
that soon shall be thy home.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then my thought took a fresh turn; man’s art does not avail, here
beneath the sun, to win the race for the swift, or the battle for the
strong, a livelihood for wisdom, riches for great learning, or for the
craftsman thanks; chance and the moment rule all.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Nor does man see his end coming; hooked fish or snared bird is not
overtaken so suddenly as man is, when the day of doom falls on him
unawares.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And here, too, is wise warning, most wise, as I judge it.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` There was a small city once, with few men to hold it; and there was
a great king that marched out against it, raised a mound and ringed it
with siege-works, till it was beleaguered on every side.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` To such a city, how came relief? By the wise counsel of one poor
man that had his wits about him. And was there anyone, think you, that
remembered the poor man afterwards? Not one.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Sure enough, said I, wisdom has the better of valour; but see how
the poor man’s wisdom goes for nothing, and no one listens to him now!

"17" = ''':sup:`17` A wise man’s whisper carries further than great outcry from a king
of fools.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Arms cannot match wisdom; by one slip,✻ what great advantage is
lost!
