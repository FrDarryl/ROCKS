"1" = ''':sup:`1` Out upon you, the Lord says, what treason is this? Here be plans
afoot that were never mine, webs a-weaving, and the pattern none of my
choice. Trust me, you do but add to your guilt.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` What are these journeyings down into Egypt, and I never consulted?
Think you to find refuge in the strength of Pharao, look you to Egypt
for shelter?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Strength of Pharao shall play you false, nor shelter Egypt bring
you, but shame.

comfort there, only failure and mockery.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` What burden for the cattle-droves in the south? Here is a land of
difficulty and danger, home of lion and lioness, of viper and flying
serpent; and through it, goods piled on asses’ backs, treasures stored
on the humps of camels, go men asking for help where help is none.

word has been said about her, There goes Pride, let her alone.

own children, to listen to the law of their God;

vision of the truth. Ever they must be told what likes them best,
comforted in their illusions;

of Israel, must be kept far from their view.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` From him, the Holy One of Israel, this message: Warning of mine you
have rejected, so blindly you trust your own cunning, your own
headstrong will.

fragments, till no shard is left that will carry a lighted coal from
the hearth, or a mouthful of water from the cistern.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` From the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, word was given you, Come
back and keep still, and all shall be well with you; in quietness and
in confidence lies your strength. But you would have none of it;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` What if the Lord waits his time before he will have mercy on you?
The more glorious, when it comes, his deliverance. The Lord is a God
who makes award justly, blessed they shall be that wait for him.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` In Jerusalem they only will be left, true citizens of Sion. And
thou, Jerusalem, tears shalt have none to shed; mercy is none he shall
withhold. Soon as he hears thee crying out to him, the answer will
come.

path, follow it; no swerving to right or left!

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Silver leaf on thy graven images defaced now, defaced the sheaths
of gold; thou wilt cast all away, as a woman casts away defiled clouts
of hers, and bid it begone.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` And thereupon, sow where thou wilt all over the land, rain shall be
granted to thy crops; rich and full shall be thy harvest of wheat; thou
shalt have pasture, then, for lambs to browse in at liberty.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Ox and ass on thy farm shall have mixed feed, pure grain fresh
winnowed on the threshing-floor;

"25" = ''':sup:`25` never a mountain-top, never a high hill, but will flow with
torrents of water, when that day comes. The dead shall lie in heaps
that day, and towers come crashing down;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` moon’s light will be like the light of the sun, and the sun will

aflame, and there is no withstanding it! There is menace on his lips,
his tongue is like a consuming fire,

"30" = ''':sup:`30` The Lord will make his dread voice heard, will lay bare his
terrible arm, volleying out his anger in flashes of devouring fire,
laying all low with his whirlwind, with his hail-stones;

"31" = ''':sup:`31` and Assur will shrink in fear from the Lord’s voice, and will feel
his rod.
