'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, give this message from the Lord God to the prince of
Tyre: An ill day for thee, when thy proud heart told thee thou wast a
god, enthroned god-fashion in the heart of the sea! Mortal man, thou
hast played the god in thy own thoughts.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` What if more than a Daniel thou wert for wisdom, no secret hidden
from thee?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Skill and craft have brought thee power, lined thy coffers with gold
and silver;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and this skill of thine, this pedlar’s empire of thine, have made
thee proud of thy own strength.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` This doom, then, the Lord God has for thee, man that wouldst play
the god:
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I mean to embroil thee with foreign foes, a warrior nation as none
else, that shall draw sword on that fair creature, thy wisdom, soil thy
beauty in the dust!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Dragged down to thy ruin, wounded to thy death, there in the heart
of the sea,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` wilt thou still boast of thy godhead to the slayer, while his sword
ungods thee?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Such my doom is for thee, death at an alien’s hand, the
uncircumcised for thy company.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` This too: Son of man, sing a dirge over yonder king of Tyre.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This be thy message to him from the Lord God: The token, thou, of
my considerateness.✻ How wise thou wast, how peerlessly fair,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` with all God’s garden to take thy pleasure in! No precious stone
but went to thy adorning; sardius, topaz, jasper, chrysolith, onyx,
beryl, sapphire, carbuncle and emerald; all of gold was thy fair
fashioning. And thy niche✻ was prepared for thee when thou wast
created;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` a cherub thou shouldst be, thy wings outstretched in protection;
there on God’s holy mountain I placed thee, to come and go between the
wheels of fire.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` From the day of thy creation all was perfect in thee, till thou
didst prove false;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` all these traffickings had made thee false within, and for thy
guilt I must expel thee, guardian cherub as thou wert, from God’s
mountain; between the wheels of fire thou shouldst walk no longer.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` A heart made proud by its own beauty, wisdom ruined through its own
dazzling brightness, down to earth I must cast thee, an example for
kings to see.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Great guilt of thine, all the sins of thy trafficking, have
profaned thy sanctuaries; such a fire I will kindle in the heart of
thee as shall be thy undoing, leave thee a heap of dust on the ground
for all to gaze at.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` None on earth that recognizes thee but shall be dismayed at the
sight of thee; only ruin left of thee, for ever vanished and gone.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` This too:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Son of man, turn thy regard towards Sidon, and prophesy its doom.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` This message give it from the Lord God: Have at thee, Sidon!
Battle-field thy territory shall be of my renown! In her, too, my power
shall be made known, my sentence executed, my holiness vindicated.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Plague I mean to bring down on her and blood-letting both; the
sword everywhere, and wounded men dying in her streets, to prove what
power the Lord has.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` No more shall the Israelites have scornful enemies round about,
thorns and briers to prick and hurt them;✻ they shall know at last what
manner of God they serve.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When I restore the scattered race of Israel from its exile, the
Lord God says, my holiness shall be vindicated for all the world to
see. The land I gave to my servant Jacob shall be thenceforward its
home;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` securely it shall dwell there, build houses, plant vineyards, fear
no attack. It shall see every scornful neighbour punished, and know at
last what it is to have the Lord for its God.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
28:1-10 - The prophecy against the prince of Tyre denounces his
arrogance and his attempt to equal himself with God. The condemnation
of the prince of Tyre highlights how pride and self-sufficiency are
2:4).
28:11-19 - The prophecy against the king of Tyre is one of the most
detailed, describing the fall of a being who was "in Eden, in the
garden of God," a reference to sin and the fall of humanity. The fall
of Tyre is compared to the fall of Lucifer due to pride and rebellion
28:20-23 - God's judgment against Sidon is announced, with the promised
punishment for its wickedness. Sidon's destruction reflects God's
punishment for those who persist in their wicked practices and reject
28:24-26 - Israel's restoration is contrasted with the destruction of
enemy nations. The judgment against Tyre and Sidon is a lesson that
God's vengeance is certain, but it also reveals His faithfulness in
11:25-32).
