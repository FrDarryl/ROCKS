"1" = ''':sup:`1` Ephraim, that would still play shepherd to the wind, still hunt in
the track of the storm, and nothing hoard up but treachery, nothing but
his own ruin! See him making treaties with the Assyrian, sending
tribute of oil to Egypt!

account,✻ for ill deeds and ill designs rewarding him.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Here was one that took precedence of✻ his brother even in the womb;
strength was his, of celestial strength the rival.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Did he not hold his own in contest with an angel, and prefer, with

Notas de rodapé:
12:1-2 - Israel continues to rebel against God, seeking help in
alliances with foreign nations. This behavior reflects the people's
ingratitude, having forgotten God's faithfulness throughout their
history, as seen in the passages about Abraham and Jacob (see also 2
12:3-6 - The example of Jacob, who wrestled with God and prevailed, is
used to call Israel to repentance and true worship. God is presented as
the one who blesses those who seek His face with humility and sincerity
12:7-9 - Israel is rebuked for its dependence on wealth and falsehood.
God's true blessing comes not from material resources, but from living
in obedience and faithfulness to the Lord. The call is for the people
6:33).
12:10-14 - God sent the prophets to warn Israel, but the people still
reject God's message. The chapter highlights the need to hear God's
voice and seek His guidance to restore the covenant (see also
