"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now Ezechias fell sick, and was at death’s door; indeed, the
prophet Isaias, son of Amos, visited him with this message from the
Lord, Put thy affairs in order; it is death that awaits thee, not
recovery.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` At this Ezechias turned his face towards the wall, and prayed to the
Lord thus:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Remember, Lord, I entreat thee, a life that has kept true to thee,
an innocent heart; how I did ever what was thy will. And Ezechias wept
bitterly.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Whereupon, before ever Isaias reached the middle of the court-yard,
the word of the Lord came to him,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Go back, and tell Ezechias, the ruler of my people, Here is a
message to thee from the Lord, the God of thy father David. I have
listened to thy prayer, and marked thy tears; be it so, I have granted
thee recovery. Within three days thou shalt be on thy way to the Lord’s
temple,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and I will add fifteen years to thy life. And I will save thee and
thy city from the power of the Assyrian king; I will be its protector,
for my own honour and the honour of my servant David.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Isaias bade them bring a lump of figs, and when this was
brought and laid on the king’s ulcer, he recovered.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When Ezechias asked what sign should be given him that his health
would be restored, and that he would set foot in the Lord’s temple
within three days,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Isaias told him, Here is thy proof that the Lord will keep his
promise. Wouldst thou have the shadow on the sun-dial climb forward by
ten hours, or travel backwards as much?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Why, said he, it were no great matter that it should advance ten
hours; rather, by my way of it, let it travel ten hours backwards.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So the prophet Isaias made appeal to the Lord, and the shadow
retraced the last ten hours it had advanced on the sun-dial of Achaz.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now, hearing of his sickness, the king of Babylon, Berodach
Baladan, son of Baladan, sent a letter and gifts to Ezechias.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Ezechias was delighted at the coming of these envoys, and shewed
them his scented treasure-house, with its gold and silver and spices
and rich ointments; the rooms where his ornaments were kept; all the
wealth of his store-house. There was nothing in palace or domain but he
shewed it to them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then the prophet Isaias gained audience of king Ezechias, and asked
him, What message did these men bring, and whence had they come? They
came to see me, said Ezechias, from a country that is far away, from
Babylon.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And when Isaias asked what they had seen in his palace, he told
them, They saw everything in my palace; I have no treasures I did not
shew them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And at that Isaias said to Ezechias, I have a message for thy
hearing from the Lord.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Behold, a time is coming when all that is in thy house, all the
treasures which thy fathers have amassed there in times past, will be
taken away to Babylon; nothing shall be left of it, the Lord says.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And sons of thine, men of thy own line, of thy own stock, shall be
carried off to be eunuchs in the palace of the kings of Babylon.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Why then, Ezechias said to Isaias, welcome be the word the Lord has
spoken through thee! In my time at least may there be peace; may the
promise hold good.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` What else Ezechias did, the record of his great deeds, and of the
pool and conduit by which he stored water in Jerusalem, is to be found
in the Annals of the kings of Juda.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Ezechias was laid to rest with his fathers, and the throne
passed to his son Manasses.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
20:1-3 - Hezekiah falls gravely ill and prays to the Lord for mercy.
His sincere and repentant prayer reveals the power of personal prayer
5:15-16).
20:4-6 - God hears Hezekiah's prayer and promises to heal him and give
him 15 more years of life. This reinforces the idea that God answers
prayers and has power over life and death (see also 1 Kings 17:21-22
20:8-11 - Hezekiah asks for a sign to confirm his healing, and God
causes the shadow on the sundial to move back. This miracle is a
demonstration of God's sovereign control over time and nature (see also
20:12-13 - Babylonian ambassadors visit Hezekiah, and he displays all
the riches of his kingdom. Hezekiah's lack of discernment in this
20:16-18 - Isaiah prophesies that Babylon will take everything Hezekiah
showed him, including his descendants. This prophecy marks the
beginning of the end of Judah and the coming of the Babylonian exile
