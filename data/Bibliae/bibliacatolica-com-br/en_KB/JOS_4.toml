"1" = ''':sup:`1` And when they had crossed over, the Lord bade Josue
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` choose out twelve men, one from each tribe;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` each was to pick out a solid stone from the river-bed, where the
feet of the priests had stood, and these must be set up to mark the
place where they encamped that night.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Josue summoned twelve men, whom he had chosen out to represent
the twelve tribes of Israel;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Go half-way across Jordan, he told them, to where the ark of the
Lord your God stands, and bring me thence on your shoulders one stone
each of you, one for each of the tribes of Israel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` They are to serve you for a monument; your children, before long,
will be asking you, What is the meaning of these stones?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And you will be able to answer, When the ark that bears record of
the Lord’s covenant went across the Jordan, the waters dried up at its
coming; that is why these stones have been set up here, to remind
Israel of that crossing for all time.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The Israelites did as Josue bade them; carried the twelve stones
from the river-bed, one for each tribe, as the Lord had commanded, and
set them down in the camp.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Josue also marked the place, full in the bed of Jordan, where the
priests and the ark had halted; here, too, he set up twelve stones,
which are there to this day.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Meanwhile, such was the divine command Josue had received through
Moses, the priests must stand there in the river-bed till all was
over.✻ So the people marched on speedily enough;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` not till all had reached the other side could the ark of the Lord
cross, and the priests take their place at the head of the people.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Ruben and Gad and half Manasses must send their warriors in the van
of Israel, as Moses bade them;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` company after company, file after file, these in their turn went
past, forty thousand fighting men, into the level plain that lies
before the city of Jericho.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` That day, the Lord would win renown for Josue for all Israel to
see; he was to be feared as Moses was feared in life.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And now the Lord had a fresh command for him,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Bid the priests that are carrying the ark come out of the Jordan.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The word was given, and they came up, carrying the ark with them;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and no sooner had they set foot on dry ground than the stream
filled its bed again, flowing past as before.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` On the tenth day of the first month the people left Jordan behind
them, and encamped at Galgal, east of the city of Jericho.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Here, at Galgal, Josue set up the twelve stones they had taken out
of the river-bed.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And he said to the Israelites, It will not be long before sons are
asking their fathers the question, What is the meaning of these stones?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And you will hand on the lesson to them: Israel once crossed over
Jordan yonder dry-shod.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The Lord your God dried up its waters in full view of Israel, to
let them pass over,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` just as in earlier times he dried up the Red Sea, when it lay in
our path.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So all the nations of the world were to learn how strong the power
of the Lord is, and you too should fear the Lord your God continually.

Notas de rodapé:
4:1-3 - God instructs Joshua to collect stones from the Jordan as a
memorial. Creating markers is crucial to remembering God's
interventions and strengthening the faith of future generations (see
4:4-7 - The stones of the Jordan serve as a testimony to the children
of Israel of God's miracle. This act of remembrance is a vital practice
in the life of faith, helping to cultivate gratitude and hope (see also
4:9 - Joshua also erects a monument in the middle of the Jordan,
showing that God's presence should be remembered even in places where
He has worked mightily. This highlights the importance of recognizing
Timothy 1:6-7).
04:14 - God exalts Joshua before Israel, confirming his leadership.
This shows that true authority is established by God and that respect
4:20-24 - Joshua's instruction to teach his children about what God did
at the Jordan is an example of the importance of passing on faith.
Stories of how God works in our lives should be shared to encourage the
145:4-6).
