"2" = ''':sup:`2` Thus says the Lord: Do not learn to follow Gentile ways, or be
dismayed by portents in the heavens, as the Gentiles are.

must do their work, lest it should fall to pieces.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Idols cunningly plated as palm-trees,✻ yet dumb as they, and men
must carry them to and fro, for movement they have none! To these give

thine? Boast the world as it will of wisdom or of empire, none can
rival thee.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Ah, folly and blindness, ah, fond teaching, lifeless as wood itself!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Ay, bring plates of silver from Tharsis, gold from Ophaz, it is all
man’s work, fresh from the smithy; bring robes of blue and purple, they
are man’s work still!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But the Lord is God in good earnest, a God that lives, that has
eternal dominion, and can make earth tremble with his frown, strike the
nations powerless when he threatens them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No place on earth or under heaven, you must tell the nations, for
gods that could fashion neither heaven nor earth.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Power that made the earth, wisdom that orders nature, foresight
that spread out the heavens!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` At the sound of his voice, what mustering of the waters overhead!
He summons up the cloud-wrack from the world’s end, turns the lightning
into a rain-storm, brings the winds out of his store-house;✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` how puny, then, is man’s skill, how sorry a thing is the carver’s
workmanship; after all his pains, only a lifeless counterfeit!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Fond imaginations, fantastic figures, when the time comes for
reckoning, they will be heard of no more.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Not such the worship that is the heirloom of Jacob’s line; their
God is the God who made all things, Israel his patrimony, the Lord of
hosts his name.

'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` This time, the Lord says, I mean to hurl them far away, the
dwellers in this land, and great distress shall be theirs, that they
may be found …✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Alas, for my wounding, for the grievous hurt that is mine! Hitherto
I had thought to bear my sickness, if this were all;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` but now what am I? A tent broken down, all its ropes severed: all
my citizens have deserted me, and are no more to be found; who shall
raise the pole, who shall stretch the curtains now?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the cause of it? Unskilful shepherds that would have no
recourse to the Lord; see how their art has failed them, and all the
flock is scattered far and wide!
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` A sound comes to me that brings tidings with it, a great stir from
the north country; all Juda is to become a desert, a lair for serpents✻
now.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Lord, I know it well enough, it is not for man to choose his lot;
not human wisdom guides our steps aright.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Chasten me, Lord, but with due measure kept; not as thy anger
demands, or thou wilt grind me to dust.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Pour out this indignation of thine upon the nations that do not
acknowledge thee, on the tribes that never invoke thy name; by whom
Jacob is devoured, devoured and devastated, and all his pride scattered
to the winds.✻
