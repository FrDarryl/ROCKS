"2" = ''':sup:`2` the cities of Aroer will lie, now, abandoned to flocks, that take
their ease undisturbed.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Ephraim protected no more, Damascus a kingdom no more, what is left
of Syria will enjoy no more renown than Israel itself; such is her doom
from the Lord of hosts.

swollen seas that go roaring past; like the roar of those swollen seas

God will rebuke him, and in a moment he is far away, swept like the
