Euphrates, under its king Pharao Nechao, and there was defeated by
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, in the fourth year of Joachim’s reign
over Juda, that was son to Josias.

'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yoke steed, and, horsemen, mount; stand to your ranks, helmeted;
scour lance, and don breastplate!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` What means it? Here be cowards turning their backs, here be great
warriors slain; pell-mell they flee, and never a glance behind; peril
is all around, the Lord says.

foaming torrent?

warriors, Ethiop and Libyan with their great shields, men of Lydia that

Euphrates banks, the Lord, the God of hosts, will claim his sacrifice.

wounds! Salve after salve thou wilt try in vain; there is no healing
thee.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thy shame has come to all men’s ears, earth echoes with thy lament;
warrior leaned upon warrior of thine for support, and they fell both
together.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And thus the Lord prophesied to Jeremias the coming of
Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, and his victory over Egypt.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Here is news for Egypt; cry it in Magdalus, wake the echoes of
Memphis, in Taphnis tell it abroad! Stand to arms, make ready for
battle; thy border countries have fallen a prey to the sword already!

wilderness Memphis shall be, where none may dwell henceforward.

north a gad-fly✻ shall come to trouble her rest.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` But those mercenaries of hers that went to and fro like bullocks
full-fed, see how they have turned about and taken flight all at once,
none ready to stand his ground! The day has come when they are marked
down for slaughter; they shall be called to account at last.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Loud her voice shall rise above the clash of bronze,✻ now that the
invader’s army draws near, pitiless as woodmen that go a-hewing;

"23" = ''':sup:`23` forest is none so deep they shall not lay it bare, numberless as
the locust-swarm.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Poor Egypt, all shame and confusion, prey of the northern folk!
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, has pronounced his doom: I
mean to have a reckoning now with Ammon of Thebes,✻ with Pharao and
Egypt, with all its gods and all its kings, with Pharao and all who
trust in Pharao’s aid!

"26" = ''':sup:`26` I mean to give them up into the hands of their mortal enemies,
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon and his vassals; then Egypt shall have
rest, as Egypt did of old.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Have thou no fear, the Lord says, Jacob, that art my servant still;
not for Israel is danger brewing. From that far country of exile I mean
to restore thee, restore those children of thine; Jacob shall return,
and live at ease, every blessing shall enjoy, and enemies have none to
fear.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` For thee no terrors, Jacob that art my servant, the Lord says; am I
not at thy side? Of all the lands in which I have dispersed thee I will
