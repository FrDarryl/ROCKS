bread, and fat, and blood, when all the while these foul doings of

uncircumcised, in the commonwealth of Israel, the Lord says; place in

loins, with no such habiting as may bring them out in a sweat.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` These vestments of office they must lay aside, and put away in the
temple sacristy, when they go out to mingle with the people in the
