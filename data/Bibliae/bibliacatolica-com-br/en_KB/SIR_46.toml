"9" = ''':sup:`9` since the days when Moses yet lived; he it was, and Caleb the son of
Jephone, that took a generous part together; they would have engaged
the enemy, and saved their own people from guilt by hushing the murmurs

king’s ear, and gave warning of the death that awaited him; a prophet,
even in the tomb, while there was yet guilt among his people to be
effaced.
