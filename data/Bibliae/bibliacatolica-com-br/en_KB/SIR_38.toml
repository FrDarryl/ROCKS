divine appointment,

bring gifts to him.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Medicines the most High has made for us out of earth’s bounty, and
shall prudence shrink from the use of them?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Were not the waters of Mara made wholesome by the touch of wood?✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Well for us men, that the secret virtue of such remedies has been
revealed; skill the most High would impart to us, and for his marvels
win renown.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thus it is that the physician cures our pain, and the apothecary
makes, not only perfumes to charm the sense, but unguents remedial; so
inexhaustible is God’s creation,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` such health comes of his gift, all the world over.

to physicians.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When a man dies, let thy tears flow, and set up a great lamenting,
as for thy grievous loss; shroud him according to his quality, and
grudge him no pomp of funeral;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` then, to be rid of gossip, bemoan him bitterly for a day’s space,
ere thou wilt be comforted in thy sorrow;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` one day or two, as his worth claims, bemoan him; no need to win
thyself an ill name.

own strength; where heart goes sad, back goes bowed.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` So long as thou withdrawest thyself, sad thy heart will be; and
what patrimony but heart’s mirth is left to the poor?

himself of doing if he is to come by it.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` How shall he drink full draughts of wisdom that must guide the
plough, that walks proud as any spearman while he goads on his team,
all his life taken up with their labours, all his talk of oxen?

"27" = ''':sup:`27` His mind all set on a straight furrow, the feeding of his cows an
anxiety to deny him sleep?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So it is with every workman and master-workman, that must turn
night into day. Here is one that cuts graven seals; how he busies
himself with devising some new pattern! How the model he works from
claims his attention, while he sits late over his craft!

"29" = ''':sup:`29` Here is blacksmith sitting by his anvil, intent upon his iron-work,
cheeks shrivelled with the smoke, as he battles with the heat of the
furnace,

thoughts go to the perfect achieving of it.

"38" = ''':sup:`38` or to sit in the judgement-seat. Not theirs to understand the law’s
awards, not theirs to impart learning or to give judgement; they will
not be known for uttering wise sayings.

"39" = ''':sup:`39` Theirs it is to support this unchanging world of God’s creation;
they ply their craft and ask for nothing better; … lending themselves
freely and making their study in the law of the most High.✻
