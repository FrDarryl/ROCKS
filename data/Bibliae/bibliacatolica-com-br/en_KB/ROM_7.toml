"1" = ''':sup:`1` You must surely be aware, brethren (I am speaking to men who have
some knowledge of law) that legal claims are only binding on a man so
long as he is alive.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` A married woman, for instance, is bound by law to her husband while
he lives; if she is widowed, she is quit of her husband’s claim on her;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` she will be held an adulteress if she gives herself to another man
during her husband’s lifetime, but once he is dead she is quit of his
claim, and can give herself to another man without adultery.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Well, brethren, you too have undergone death, as far as the law is
concerned, in the person of Christ crucified,✻ so that you now belong
to another, to him who rose from the dead. We yield increase to God,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` whereas, when we were merely our natural selves, the sinful passions
to which the law bound us worked on our natural powers, so as to yield
increase only to death.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Now we are quit of the claim which death had on us, so that we can
do service in a new manner, according to the spirit, not according to
the letter as of old.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Does this mean that law and guilt are the same thing? God forbid we
should say that. But it was only the law that gave me my knowledge of
sin; I should not even have known concupiscence for what it is, if the
law had not told me, Thou shalt not covet.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But the sense of sin, with the law’s ban for its foothold, produced
in me every sort of concupiscence. Without the law, the sense of sin is
a dead thing.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` At first, without the law, I was alive; then, when the law came with
its ban, the sense of sin found new life,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and with that, I died. The ban, which was meant to bring life,
proved death to me;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` the sense of sin, with the law’s ban for its foothold, caught me
unawares, and by that means killed me.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The law, to be sure, is something holy; the ban is holy, and right,
and good.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` A good thing, and did it prove death to me? God forbid we should
say that. No, it was sin that produced death in me, using this good
thing to make itself appear as sin indeed, sin made more sinful than
ever by the ban imposed on it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The law, as we know, is something spiritual; I am a thing of flesh
and blood, sold into the slavery of sin.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` My own actions bewilder me; what I do is not what I wish to do, but
something which I hate.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Why then, if what I do is something I have no wish to do, I thereby
admit that the law is worthy of all honour;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` meanwhile, my action does not come from me, but from the sinful
principle that dwells in me.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Of this I am certain, that no principle of good dwells in me, that
is, in my natural self; praiseworthy intentions are always ready to
hand, but I cannot find my way to the performance of them;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` it is not the good my will prefers, but the evil my will
disapproves, that I find myself doing.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And if what I do is something I have not the will to do, it cannot
be I that bring it about, it must be the sinful principle that dwells
in me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` This, then, is what I find about the law, that evil is close at my
side, when my will is to do what is praiseworthy.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Inwardly, I applaud God’s disposition,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` but I observe another disposition in my lower self, which raises
war against the disposition of my conscience, and so I am handed over
as a captive to that disposition towards sin which my lower self
contains.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Pitiable creature that I am, who is to set me free from a nature
thus doomed to death?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Nothing else than the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
If I am left to myself, my conscience is at God’s disposition, but my
natural powers are at the disposition of sin.✻

Notas de rodapé:
7:4-6 - As Christians, we have died to the law through the body of
Christ, so that we may live according to the Spirit. Our relationship
to the law is transformed by the new covenant in Christ (see also
7:7-12 - The law reveals sin, but it is not sin in itself. God's law is
good because it helps us recognize our failure and our need for
7:14-17 - The apostle Paul describes the internal struggle between the
desire to obey the law and the presence of sin in the flesh. This
illustrates the spiritual battle faced by Christians (see also
7:18-25 - Even though we are regenerated, Christians still face the
battle against sin. This internal struggle highlights the need for
1:8-9).
7:24-25 - Paul's conclusion highlights the human dilemma and the
victory achieved in Christ Jesus, who frees us from the slavery of sin
