"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now a new message came to Moses from the Lord, March on, then,
with the people thou hast led out of Egypt; make thy way hence to the
land I promised Abraham, Isaac and Jacob should be the home of their
race.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I am ready to send an angel who will go before thee, so as to cast
out Chanaanite, Amorrhite, Hethite, Pherezite, Hevite and Jebusite,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and bring thee into the land that is all milk and honey. But I will
not go with thee myself, stiff-necked people as thou art, or I might be
moved to destroy thee on the way.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The people, on hearing this bitter reproach, went mourning, and none
wore his ornaments, as custom bade;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` the Lord’s word came through Moses to the Israelites, You are a
stiff-necked people, and if once I set out on the march among you, I
would be moved to destroy you. Take off, here and now, your ornaments,
and wait till I have resolved what to do with you.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So there, at mount Horeb, the sons of Israel laid their ornaments
aside.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Moses, too, removed his tent,✻ and pitched it far off, away from the
camp, calling it, The tent which bears witness to the covenant; to
this, all who had disputes to settle must betake themselves, away from
the camp.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when Moses repaired to this tent of his, all the people rose up
and stood at the doors of their own tents, following Moses with their
eyes till he went in.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And, once he was within the tent that bore witness of the covenant,
the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance of it,
and there the Lord spoke with Moses,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` while all watched the pillar of cloud standing there, and rose up
and worshipped, each at his own tent door.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus the Lord spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his
friend. And when he returned to the camp, Josue, son of Nun, the young
man who served him, never left the tent unguarded.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Moses complained to the Lord, Thou biddest me lead this people
on the march, but thou wilt not tell me who it is thou art sending me
for my guide. And this is the man whom thou callest thy familiar
friend, assuring him of thy favour!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nay, if indeed thou dost look upon me with favour, make thy own
presence known to me; let me know thee, and know that thy favour is
with me. Have more regard for this folk, thy own people.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` My presence, the Lord said, shall go before thee, and bring thee to
thy resting-place.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` It must be thyself, said Moses, going before us; otherwise do not
bid us leave the place where we are.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` How am I and thy people to know that thou dost look upon us with
favour, if thou wilt not journey with us; such a privilege as no other
people in the world can boast?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the Lord told Moses, I will grant this request of thine; such
favour thou hast with me, thou, my familiar friend.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Give me, then, said Moses, the sight of thy glory.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he answered, All my splendour shall pass before thy eyes, and I
will pronounce, in thy presence, my own divine name, the name of the
Lord who shews favour where he will, grants pardon where he will.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But, my face, he said, thou canst not see; mortal man cannot see
me, and live to tell of it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then he said, There is a place here, close by me, where thou mayst
stand on a rock;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` there I will station thee in a cleft of the rock, while my glory
passes by, and cover thee with my right hand until I have gone past.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So, when I take my hand away, thou shalt follow me with thy eyes,
but my face thou canst not see.

Notas de rodapé:
33:1-3 - God instructs Moses to lead the people into the promised land,
but declares that He will not be among them because of their rebellion.
God's absence among them highlights the consequences of sin and the
33:7-11 - Moses pitched a tent outside the camp, where God spoke with
him "face to face." This passage highlights the intimacy of Moses'
relationship with God and the importance of intercession (see also
33:12-14 - Moses intercedes for the people, asking that God's presence
go with them. God responds by affirming that His presence will
accompany them, demonstrating His mercy and the effectiveness of
33:15-16 - Moses declares that without God's presence, Israel is no
different from other nations. This emphasizes that the true identity of
33:18-23 - Moses asks to see God’s glory, and God allows him to see
only His back, for no one can see His face and live. This reveals God’s
Timothy 6:16).
