"1" = ''':sup:`1` Word came back to Joab that the king was in tears, mourning over his
son;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and the news of the royal grief went round among the army, so that
the victory they had won that day issued only in lament.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They would not even return that day to the city, feeling such shame
as a broken and routed army feels;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and all the while the king hid his face away, and went on crying
aloud, My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` At last Joab made his way into the royal lodging, and said to the
king, Here is a fine day’s work, to make all thy followers go about
hanging their heads! The men who have saved thee and thy sons and
daughters, thy wives and concubines, from peril of death!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Nothing but love for thy enemies, nothing but hatred for thy
friends; never a thought, this day, for thy own captains and thy own
men! If we were all dead, and Absalom still lived, I warrant thou hadst
been the better pleased.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Bestir thyself, come out and speak to thy men, and earn their good
will; I swear by the Lord that if thou dost not come out, not a man
will be left to serve thy cause by night-fall; and worse awaits thee
than all the troubles which have come upon thee from the days of thy
youth till now.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So the king rose up, and seated himself at the gateway; and there,
once the word had gone round that the king was sitting in the gateway,
all his followers came into the royal presence.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But the men of Israel had fled home. And now, all through the tribes
of Israel, there was high debate; Here is a king, men said, that has
rid us of our enemies, rescued us from the power of the Philistines,
and he must be exiled from his kingdom to please Absalom!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This Absalom, whom we anointed to be our king, has fallen in
battle; why is no voice raised for bringing the king back to us?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` News of what the Israelites were saying had reached the court, and
now king David sent word to the priests, Sadoc and Abiathar, bidding
them ask the elders of Juda, Why are you the last to welcome the king
home again?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` You are my own tribesmen, my own kith and kin, why do you hang
back, instead of restoring me to the throne?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He bade them, too, give this message to Amasa, Art thou not my own
flesh and blood? May the Lord punish me as I deserve, and more than I
deserve, if I do not make thee, instead of Joab, commander of my army
henceforward!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thus he won over the men of Juda till they had but a single
thought, and a message was sent to the king bidding him come back to
them, and all his men with him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So the king set out for home, and by the time he reached the
Jordan, the whole of Juda had assembled at Galgal to meet him and
escort him over the river.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Semei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, hastened to bear them
company, welcoming king David
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` with a thousand of his own tribesmen; there was Siba, too, that had
once been a servant in the court of Saul, with his fifteen sons and
twenty servants of his, and these, plunging into the Jordan
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` before the king could reach it, were across the ford, ready to
escort his household and wait upon his bidding. Semei, Gera’s son, was
no sooner across Jordan than he fell at the king’s feet;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` My lord, he said, do not hold me guilty, forget the wrong thy
servant did thee when thou, my lord king, hadst left Jerusalem; let
there be no grudge in thy royal heart.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I, thy servant, confess this day the wrong I did; that is why I
have come, first spokesman of the other tribes, to meet the king’s
grace on his way.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` At this, Abisai son of Sarvia would have Semei put to death, for
the curses he uttered against an anointed king.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` What, sons of Sarvia, David answered, will you never give me rest?
This day, of all others, would you mar my peace? No Israelite shall
lose his life this day, which has taught me for the first time that I
am king in Israel.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And to Semei he said, Thou shalt not die, and took his oath to
confirm it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then the king was met by Miphiboseth, that was heir to Saul; he
came with feet begrimed, with beard untrimmed, in garments that went
unwashed from the day of the king’s departure to the day of his return.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Down from Jerusalem he came to meet him, and when the king asked,
Why didst thou not bear me company, Miphiboseth?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` his answer was, My lord king, my own servant played me false; may
it please thee, I bade him saddle me an ass, so that I could ride in
the king’s company, lame as I am;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and he, not content with disobeying, has brought a false charge
against me before my lord the king. But thou, my lord king, art wise as
an angel of God; do what thou wilt.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` For indeed, the whole of my father’s line deserve nothing better
than death at thy hands, and thou hast given me, thy servant, a place
among the guests at thy table; what right have I to complain? I will
raise my voice no more in my defence.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And the king told him, No need to say more. My word has been
passed; do thou and Siba divide the lands between you.✻
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Why, let him take all, Miphiboseth answered; enough for me that my
lord the king has come home in peace.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Berzellai, too, the man of Galaad, came down from Rogelim, to
attend his crossing of Jordan, ready to accompany him to the further
bank.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Berzellai of Galaad was an old man, eighty years old; he it was
that brought the king provisions, while he lay at the Encampment, for
he was a man of great riches.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` To him the king said, Bear me company, and take thy ease with me at
Jerusalem.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But Berzellai answered, What, a man of my years go up to Jerusalem
with the king’s grace?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` I am eighty years old now; are my senses still keen, to tell sweet
from bitter? Can thy servant take pleasure in food and drink? Can my
ear catch the tone of songster and songstress? Nay, I would not be a
burden to my lord the king;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` let thy servant go with thee a little of the way beyond Jordan, and
no more. I need no such exchange of friendship;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` rather, my prayer is that I should be allowed to go back and die in
my own city, and be buried close to the grave where my father and
mother lie. Here is thy servant Chamaam; let him go with thee, my lord
king, and do with him what thou wilt.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Chamaam shall go with me, the king replied, and it shall be for
thee to choose what is to be done with him; no request of thine shall
go ungranted.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So, when he and all the people had crossed over Jordan, the king
kissed Berzellai and blessed him, and he went home,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` while the king passed on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him.All the
men of Juda had been the king’s escort, but of the other Israelites
only a half;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` and now the men of Israel came to him with one accord, and asked,
How is it that our brethren, the men of Juda, have stolen thee from us?
By what warrant did they escort the king, and his household and the
warriors of David’s army, on their passage over Jordan?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Why, answered the men of Juda, he is nearer of kin to us. There is
no cause here for anger. Have we lived on the king’s bounty, or been
singled out to receive his gifts?
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And the Israelites replied, We are ten to one; our rights with the
king, our claims upon David, are ten times as great as yours. Why did
you wrong us by not conferring with us first about our king’s
restoration? Thus either side pleaded its own cause, but the men of
Juda more bitterly than the men of Israel.
