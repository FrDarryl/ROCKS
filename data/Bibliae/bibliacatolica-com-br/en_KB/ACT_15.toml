"1" = ''':sup:`1` But now some visitors came down from Judaea, who began to tell the
brethren, You cannot be saved without being circumcised according to
the tradition of Moses.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Paul and Barnabas were drawn into a great controversy with them; and
it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and certain of the rest✻ should
go up to see the apostles and presbyters in Jerusalem about this
question.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So the church saw them on their way, and they passed through
Phoenice and Samaria, relating how the Gentiles were turning to God,
and so brought great rejoicing to all the brethren.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When they reached Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, and
by the apostles and presbyters; and they told them of all that God had
done to aid them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees came
forward and declared, They must be circumcised; we must call upon them
to keep the law of Moses.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When the apostles and presbyters assembled to decide about this
matter
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` there was much disputing over it, until Peter rose and said to them,
Brethren, you know well enough how from early days it has been God’s
choice that the Gentiles should hear the message of the gospel from my
lips, and so learn to believe.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` God, who can read men’s hearts, has assured them of his favour by
giving the Holy Spirit to them as to us.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He would not make any difference between us and them; he had removed
all the uncleanness from their hearts when he gave them faith.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` How is it, then, that you would now call God in question, by
putting a yoke on the necks of the disciples, such as we and our
fathers have been too weak to bear?✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` It is by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that we hope to be
saved, and they no less.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then the whole company kept silence, and listened to Barnabas and
Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had performed among the
Gentiles by their means.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And when they had finished speaking, James answered thus, Listen,
brethren, to what I have to say.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Simon has told us, how for the first time God has looked with
favour on the Gentiles, and chosen from among them a people dedicated
to his name.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` This is in agreement with the words of the prophets, where it is
written:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Afterwards, I will come back, and build up again David’s tabernacle
that has fallen; I will build up its ruins, and raise it afresh;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` so that all the rest of mankind may find the Lord, all those
Gentiles among whom my name is named, says the Lord, who is the doer of
all this.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` God has known from all eternity what he does to-day.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And so I give my voice for sparing the consciences of those
Gentiles who have found their way to God;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` only writing to bid them abstain from what is contaminated by
idolatry, from fornication, and from meat which has been strangled or
has the blood in it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` As for Moses, ever since the earliest times he has been read,
sabbath after sabbath, in the synagogues, and has preachers in every
city to expound him.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Thereupon it was resolved by the apostles and presbyters, with the
agreement of the whole church, to choose out some of their own number
and despatch them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas who
was called Barsabas, and Silas, who were leading men among the
brethren.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they sent, by their hands, this message in writing; To the
Gentile brethren in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia, their brethren the
apostles and presbyters send greeting.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` We hear that some of our number who visited you have disquieted you
by what they said, unsettling your consciences, although we had given
them no such commission;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and therefore, meeting together with common purpose of heart, we
have resolved to send you chosen messengers, in company with our
well-beloved Barnabas and Paul,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` men who have staked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` We have given this commission to Judas and Silas, who will confirm
the message by word of mouth.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` It is the Holy Spirit’s pleasure and ours that no burden should be
laid upon you beyond these, which cannot be avoided;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` you are to abstain from what is sacrificed to idols, from
blood-meat and meat which has been strangled, and from fornication. If
you keep away from such things, you will have done your part. Farewell.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So they took their leave and went down to Antioch, where they
called the multitude together and delivered the letter to them;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and they, upon reading it, were rejoiced at this encouragement.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Judas and Silas, for they were prophets too, said much to encourage
the brethren and establish their faith;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` they stayed there for some time before the brethren let them go
home, in peace, to those who had sent them.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But Silas had a mind to remain there; so Judas went back alone to
Jerusalem.✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Paul and Barnabas waited at Antioch, teaching and preaching God’s
word, with many others to help them;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and then, after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go back
and visit the brethren in all the cities where we have preached the
word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And Barnabas was for taking John, also called Mark, with them.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But Paul said, here was a man who left them when they reached
Pamphylia, and took no part with them in the work; it was not right to
admit such a man to their company.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So sharp was their disagreement, that they separated from each
other; Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed off to Cyprus,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` while Paul chose Silas for his companion and went on his journey,
commended by the brethren to the Lord’s grace.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And he travelled all through Syria and Cilicia, establishing the
churches in the faith, and bidding them observe the commands which the
apostles and presbyters had given.✻

Notas de rodapé:
15:1-2 - The dispute over the circumcision of Gentiles leads the
apostles and elders to gather in Jerusalem. This event marks the
beginning of the Council of Jerusalem, which was important for defining
15:6-11 - Peter defends the Gentiles by saying that the Holy Spirit has
come upon them as upon the Jews. This highlights God's acceptance of
the Gentiles without circumcision, symbolizing salvation by grace (see
15:12-21 - The Jerusalem Council decides that Gentiles must abstain
from certain practices, but they do not have to follow the entire law
of Moses. This reflects the importance of maintaining unity in the
Corinthians 8:9).
15:36-41 - Paul and Barnabas part ways over a disagreement about John
Mark, but this does not hinder the advancement of the mission. This
episode highlights the reality of disagreements within the Christian
community, but also God's sovereignty to use even conflicts for His
