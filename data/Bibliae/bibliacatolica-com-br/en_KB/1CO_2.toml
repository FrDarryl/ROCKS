"1" = ''':sup:`1` So it was, brethren, that when I came to you and preached Christ’s
message to you, I did so without any high pretensions to eloquence, or
to philosophy.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I had no thought of bringing you any other knowledge than that of
Jesus Christ, and of him as crucified.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` It was with distrust of myself, full of anxious fear, that I

'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` my preaching, my message depended on no persuasive language, devised
by human wisdom, but rather on the proof I gave you of spiritual power;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` God’s power, not man’s wisdom, was to be the foundation of your
faith.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` There is, to be sure, a wisdom which we make known among those who
are fully grounded; but it is not the wisdom of this world, or of this
world’s rulers, whose power is to be abrogated.

teaches, but in words taught us by the Spirit, matching what is
spiritual with what is spiritual.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Mere man with his natural gifts cannot take in the thoughts of
God’s Spirit; they seem mere folly to him, and he cannot grasp them,
because they demand a scrutiny which is spiritual.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Whereas the man who has spiritual gifts can scrutinize everything,
without being subject, himself, to any other man’s scrutiny.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Who has entered into the mind of the Lord, so as to be able to
