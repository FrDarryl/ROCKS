"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Ezechias sent out a summons to Juda and all Israel (for his
word went out by letter even to Ephraim and Manasses), bidding them
come up to the Lord’s house at Jerusalem, and keep his paschal feast
there.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The king and his nobles and all Jerusalem were of this advice, that
the pasch should be kept in the second month;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` keep it at the appointed time they might not, but must wait till
priests had cleansed themselves in sufficient number, and the people
could assemble at Jerusalem.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Such was the resolve taken by the king and his subjects;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and because so many had long neglected the law’s injunction, the
summons should go out to all Israel, from Bersabee to Dan, bidding them
keep the pasch there at Jerusalem, in the Lord’s honour, that was all
Israel’s God.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So couriers went out in the king’s service, bearing letters in his
name and in the name of his nobles to Israel and Juda alike, and this
was their purport; Come back, Israelites, to the Lord, all that remnant
of you the Assyrian king has spared; and he, the God of Abraham, Isaac
and Israel, will come back to your side.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` See how your fathers and brethren have deserted the Lord, the God of
their race, and been left to their doom; be wiser than they.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Do not rebel, as your fathers did, against his yoke; surrender to
the Lord, and come up to this sanctuary, which he has hallowed for all
time; obey him, the Lord, the God of your fathers, and his fierce anger
will be appeased.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When you have come back to the Lord, the victors will relent, and
allow your banished sons and brethren to return home; so gracious the
Lord is, so merciful; turn back to him, and his face shall be hidden
from you no more.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Swiftly the couriers went from city to city of Ephraim and
Manasses, right up to Zabulon, meeting everywhere with scorn and
derision;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but there were some tribesmen of Aser, Manasses and Zabulon that
fell in with the proposal, and came.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` In Juda, such was the Lord’s enabling power, they had but one
thought, to obey the Lord’s will, obey the command of the king and of
his nobles.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So it was a great throng that came to Jerusalem to keep this feast
of unleavened bread in the second month.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` First they set about destroying the altars up and down Jerusalem,
overthrowing all the shrines at which incense had been burned to false
gods; and these they threw down into Cedron valley.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then, on the fourteenth day of the second month, they slew the
paschal victim. Priest and Levite, cleansed of their defilement at
last, offered burnt-sacrifice in the Lord’s house,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` keeping their due order, according to the terms of that law which
God’s servant Moses gave. Only it was the Levites that must hand over
to the priests the blood which was to be poured out,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` so many of the worshippers were still uncleansed; for all those who
had not come in time to rid themselves of their defilement, the Levites
must slay the victim.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` There were many from Ephraim, Manasses, Issachar and Zabulon that
must overstep the bounds of the law by eating their paschal meal while
they were yet defiled; but Ezechias made intercession for these; surely
the Lord, in his goodness, would pardon
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` such as made the Lord God of their fathers their whole heart’s
quest; cleansed or no, he would not find fault with them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` In answer to this prayer, the Lord gave his people quittance.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So, amid great rejoicing, for seven days together, all the
Israelites assembled at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread.
Day by day priest and Levite stood there praising the Lord as best
their music might;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Ezechias himself spoke to hearten them, sons of Levi that had such
skill in the Lord’s service. All the seven days of the feast they ate
the victims of their own welcome-offerings, giving thanks to the Lord,
their fathers’ God.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And now the whole multitude resolved to keep festival seven days
more, and right gladly they did it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` A thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep were given to them by
king Ezechias, a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep by the nobles;
task enough for the many priests that had cleansed themselves by now.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Glad was Juda that day, glad were priest and Levite, and new-comers
from Israel, and men of alien birth from Israel’s domain and Juda’s
alike;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` such high festival was kept in Jerusalem as the city had never seen
since the days of David’s son Solomon, that was king of all Israel.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then priests and Levites stood up to bless the people, nor did
their voices go unheard; heaven’s holy dwelling-place echoed to their
prayer.
