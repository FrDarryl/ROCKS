thing you must keep set apart for me, age after age.

will be used to burn sacred incense before the veil of the Most Holy
Place. This altar symbolizes the prayers of the people ascending to
God, representing the central role of prayer in worship (see also
30:11-16 - The command to collect a ransom for each Israelite
symbolizes the equality of all before God. The ransom also reminds us

30:17-21 - The bronze basin, placed between the altar and the

30:34-38 - The formula for the sacred incense is given, and it may only
