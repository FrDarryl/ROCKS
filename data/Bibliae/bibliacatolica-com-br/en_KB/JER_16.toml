"3" = ''':sup:`3` for sons and daughters born in this land, for mothers who there gave
them birth and fathers who begot them, the Lord has ill news to hear.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Die they of the plague, they shall lie like dung on the ground,
unwept, unburied; meet they their end by sword or famine, birds in air
and beasts that roam the earth shall prey on the carrion of them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Where they hold wake for the dead, such is the Lord’s bidding, never
enter thou, condole and console thou never; friendship of mine this
people shall never have, nor grace, nor mercy, the Lord says.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Die rich, die poor in that country of theirs, burial and wake they
shall have none; never a limb gashed or a head shaved to honour them;

so stern, wherein their guilt lies, what wrong they have done to the
Lord their God,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` tell them this in his name: It is because your fathers have
forsaken me, had recourse to alien gods, and submitted to the worship
of them, my claim renounced, my laws defied.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And you have out-done your fathers in malice, each of you following
the ill bent of his own heart, and disobeying me.

and after that many huntsmen, to hunt them down among mountains and

guilt of theirs can escape my scrutiny.

the men that have profaned my own land with dead idols, spread
pollution through all my domain.

Notas de rodapé:
16:1-4 - God commands Jeremiah not to marry or have children as a sign

God's judgment and the impending destruction that will affect all
16:5-9 - The prophet is forbidden to participate in mourning and
revelry, a reflection of the great calamity to come. The absence of joy
in a land marked by judgment underscores the seriousness of the moment
24:17).
16:10-13 - When the people question Jeremiah's words, he prophesies the
devastation of Judah, reminding them that punishment is the result of
sin and rebellion against God. Failure to repent results in inevitable
16:14-15 - God promises that, despite the judgment, He will bring the
children of Israel back to their land in a future of restoration. This
reflects God's faithfulness and mercy after the punishment (see also
16:19-21 - Jeremiah laments the idolatry and hardness of the people's
hearts. God announces that He will bring judgment on the nations that
caused Israel's downfall, demonstrating that, while He punishes, He is
46:1-2).
