Notas de rodapé:
23:1-2 - David appoints Solomon king of Israel and organizes the
Levites for temple service. This transition of power is accompanied by
a preparation for worship of God, demonstrating the centrality of the
Chronicles 28:5-6).
23:3-6 - David counts Levites thirty years of age or older to serve in
the temple. This emphasizes the importance of organization and
preparation in serving God, as well as the continuity of the Levitical
23:13 - Aaron's sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar are appointed
to the priesthood. Eleazar and Ithamar will continue the priestly line
after the death of Nadab and Abihu, highlighting the importance of
23:24-26 - The counting of the Levites who would serve in the temple
highlights that with the construction of the temple, responsibilities
would change, as the transportation of the tabernacle would cease. This
reflects the transition from a period of mobility to a fixed place of
worship (see also Deuteronomy 12:10-11 and 1 Kings 8:10-11).
23:30-32 - The Levites were charged with praising and ministering
before God, maintaining the order and sanctity of the temple. Their
role was essential to maintaining ongoing worship and reverence in the
16:4-6).
