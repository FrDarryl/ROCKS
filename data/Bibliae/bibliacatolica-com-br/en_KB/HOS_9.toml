"1" = ''':sup:`1` No rejoicing, Israel, no cries of gladness now! Wouldst thou be like
the heathen, and rejoice that thou hast played thy God false, ever
selling thy favours to the first comer, in return for a full
threshing-floor?✻

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Not for such reapers harvest and vintage; the wanton must go without
her wine;

"3" = ''':sup:`3` dispeopled, now, the Lord’s territory, Ephraim back in Egypt again,
or tasting, among the Assyrians, unhallowed food.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Libation shall be none to win the Lord’s favour, nor any sacrifice;
bread of theirs shall be as the bread mourners eat, defiling to the
lips; fill their bellies it may, but into the Lord’s house it cannot
enter.

Lord’s festivals?

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Ruin fell on the citizens, and they are gone; Egypt the home of them
now, Memphis the tomb of them; bowers that shone with silver the
nettles have claimed, burdocks grow in the doorways.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Close at hand the audit-day, the doom close at hand! And wouldst
thou know, Israel, why prophet is turned fool, and he can but rave now
that once was inspired? God’s heavy plague is this for thy much
sinning;

"8" = ''':sup:`8` prophet of thine, watchman of thine, Ephraim, is a snare at every
turn, luring thee to thy ruin, and at God’s decree; he stands there in
God’s house, a plague to thee.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` So deep the canker of their sin; Gabaa itself never knew worse
wrong. For the remembered guilt of it they shall be called to account.✻

"10" = ''':sup:`10` When I kept tryst with Israel long ago, rare the encounter, as of
grapes out in the desert, of spring figs a-ripening high up on the
tree. And all at once to Beelphegor they betook themselves, sold honour
for shame, caught foul contagion from the things they loved!

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Light as bird on bough, Ephraim’s glory has come and gone; womb is
none that breeds, or, breeding, bears;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` ay, though they should bring sons to manhood, childless their race
shall be, nameless among men.Woe betide them indeed, when I withdraw my
presence from them!

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Ephraim’s land, so fair a garden, as I look out over it towards
Tyre! And must Ephraim rear her sons for the slaughter-house?✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thy gift to them, Lord, what is the best gift they can have of
thee? A womb, assuredly, that miscarries, and dried-up breasts!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` See where, at Galgal, their offence comes to a head; there it is
they have made an enemy of me. They shall dwell in my domain no longer,
claim love from me no longer; chieftains of theirs are no vassals of
mine.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` On Ephraim blight has fallen; withered the root now, wizened the
fruit; beget they, doom of death is on their offspring, so dearly
loved.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Cast away, my God, from thy presence, because heed thee they would
not, cast away to wander homeless through the world!

demonstrates the consequences of turning away from God (see also
9:3-6 - The desolation of the land is foretold, with crop failure and

prophets' words and their moral corruption. The hardness of their
hearts hinders their repentance, and God stands ready to act against
9:10-14 - God refers to Israel's sin by comparing it to a fig tree that
bore rotten fruit. He recalls Israel's unfaithfulness from its earliest
days and announces that the people will be punished with the loss of
9:15-17 - God exhorts the people of Israel to abandon idolatry and sin,
