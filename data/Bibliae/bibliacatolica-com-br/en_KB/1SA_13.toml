"1" = ''':sup:`1` Saul was (so many)✻ years old when he began to reign, and he had
reigned for two years over Israel
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` when he picked an army of three thousand men. Of these, two thousand
were under his own command, around Machmas and the hill country of
Bethel, and a thousand under Jonathan at Gabaa in Benjamin. The rest of
the people he sent back to their homes.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But now Jonathan overpowered the Philistine garrison at Gabaa, and
news of it was brought to the Philistines; whereupon Saul sounded an
alarm all through the country, Hebrews, here is news for you!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So the word went round that Saul had overpowered a Philistine
garrison, and Israel was at war with the Philistines; and they raised
their battle-cry under Saul’s command at Galgala.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Meanwhile the Philistines mustered their forces to make war on
Israel, their chariots thirty thousand, their horsemen six thousand
strong, and the rest of their host countless as the sand by the sea. On
they came, and encamped at Machmas, east of Bethaven.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And now the Israelite folk found themselves hard pressed; and their
evil plight drove them to take hiding in den and thicket, cave and
cleft and pit;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` there were Hebrews, too, that fled across Jordan into Gad and
Galaad. As for Saul, he stood his ground at Galgala, but it was a
dispirited army that followed him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For seven days he waited to keep tryst with Samuel, but still Samuel
did not come; and meanwhile, men were deserting from his ranks;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` so at last he bade them bring the victims for burnt-sacrifice and
welcome-offering, and performed the sacrifice himself.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And now, when the burnt-sacrifice was over, he saw Samuel coming,
and went out to greet him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` What is this thou hast done? Samuel asked. And he answered, I found
that men were deserting from my ranks; thou hadst not kept the tryst,
and already the Philistines had raised their standard at Machmas.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Can I let the Philistines sweep down on me here in Galgala, thought
I, without first winning the Lord’s favour? So I offered the
burnt-sacrifice; there was no other way.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But Samuel told him, This was great folly in thee, so to transgress
the commands which the Lord thy God had given thee. But for this, the
Lord would have destined thee, here and now, to found a line of kings
that should have ruled Israel for ever.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now thy dynasty shall fall with thee; the Lord has found a man to
fulfil his purposes, and rule his people instead of thee; such is the
reward of disobedience.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` With that, Samuel left him, returning from Galgala to Gabaa in
Benjamin. From Galgala, too, Saul and the forces that remained with him
went up to Gabaa and the hill-country of Benjamin, to meet the attack;
when he counted the roll, there were only some six hundred men to be
found in his company.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` There, at Gabaa, Saul and his son Jonathan encamped with their
followers, while the Philistines confronted them at Machmas.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Meanwhile, there were three parties of the Philistine army that
went out to find plunder; one of them to the Sual country, on the way
to Ephra,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` one by the Bethoron road, and one by the frontier path that looks
down on the valley of Seboim, going out towards the desert.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` (At this time, there were no workers in metal left in the whole of
Israel; the Philistines had taken good care that the Hebrews should not
be able to make sword or spear.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When a man would sharpen share or spade, axe or hoe, in whatever
part of the country he lived, he must go down into the Philistine lands
to do it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Blunted were share and spade, fork and axe; even the goads needed
to be straightened;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and in times of battle Saul and his son Jonathan were the only men
in the army that carried sword or lance.)
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` There was, too, a detachment of the Philistines that guarded the
pass to Machmas.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
13:1-4 - Saul rallies the army of Israel to fight the Philistines, but
when he attacks an enemy garrison, he provokes a fierce retaliation.
This event demonstrates the growing threat of the Philistines and the
13:5-7 - The Philistine army gathers in large numbers, frightening the
Israelites, who begin to hide in fear. This reflects Israel's lack of
faith in God's power in the face of adverse circumstances (see also
13:8-10 - Saul, impatient with Samuel's delay, offers the sacrifice
himself. His disobedience reveals his lack of trust in God and the
13:11-13 - Samuel rebukes Saul for not waiting and for disobeying God.
This mistake marks the beginning of the end of Saul's reign, as God
13:14 - Samuel prophesies that Saul's reign will not last and that God
has already chosen another man to be king. This prophecy anticipates
