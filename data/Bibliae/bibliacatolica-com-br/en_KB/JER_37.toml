"1" = ''':sup:`1` In place of Jechonias, that was son to Joachim, Nabuchodonosor king
of Babylon would have Sedecias, another of Josias’ sons, mount the
throne of Juda;

"2" = ''':sup:`2` but no heed would the new king give, nor his courtiers, nor his
subjects, to the warnings uttered in the Lord’s name by the prophet
Jeremias.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To him the king sent envoys, Juchal the son of Selemias and the
priest Sophonias, son of Maasias, bidding him pray to the Lord their
God for the common welfare.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Jeremias was still free to come and go as he pleased among his
fellow-citizens; they had not yet imprisoned him. At this time,
Pharao’s army was on the march, advancing from the Egyptian frontier;
and the Chaldaeans, this news reaching them, had raised the siege of
Jerusalem.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So the Lord’s word came to the prophet Jeremias:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Take back this message from the Lord God of Israel to the king who
sent you to consult me. Back home to Egypt it shall march, the army of
Pharao that has come out in your support;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` whereupon the Chaldaeans will return to the attack, will capture
this city and burn it to the ground.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Never cheat yourselves with the hope that the enemy will march away
and leave you alone; march away they will not, the Lord says.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Low though you should lay every Chaldaean that takes the field
against you, save for some few wounded, those wounded men shall rise up
from their tents, and burn this city to the ground notwithstanding.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And now, while Pharao still threatened, and the Chaldaeans had
raised the siege,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Jeremias took occasion to leave Jerusalem and make his way to
Benjamin, where he must divide up some property in the presence of his
fellow-citizens.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When he reached the Benjamin gate, the officer whose turn it was to
mount guard there, Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias,
put the prophet under arrest, under the charge of deserting to the
Chaldaeans.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In vain did Jeremias protest, What, I desert to the Chaldaeans?
There is no truth in it! Jerias led him away into the presence of the
nobles;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and these, in a rage, first had him beaten, then confined him in
the house of the secretary, Jonathan, who had charge of the prisoners
at this time.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So came Jeremias to a dungeon cell, and long remained there.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` It was king Sedecias who released him, sending for him and
questioning him privately in the palace. Has the Lord any message for
me? he asked. Yes, said Jeremias; that thou shalt be at the mercy of
Nabuchodonosor.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then he asked the king, What wrong have I done to thee, to thy
courtiers or thy subjects, that thou hast thrown me into prison?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Tell me, how have they sped, those prophets of yours who foretold
that the king of Babylon should never reach you, never invade this land
of yours?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Listen to me, my lord king, I entreat thee, and look favourably on
my suit. Do not send me back to the house of yonder secretary Jonathan,
for there I needs must die!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So king Sedecias had him confined in the court without, and given a
loaf of bread each day, with seasoning added,✻ as long as bread there
should be in the city. And there Jeremias was left, among the prisoners
in the courtyard.

Notas de rodapé:
37:1-2 - King Zedekiah, despite being submissive to Babylon, seeks
guidance from Jeremiah. This reveals the tension between obedience to
God and political pressures, showing how fear and insecurity can lead
17:13-15).
37:3-10 - Zedekiah sends emissaries to Jeremiah, asking for help in
times of crisis. Jeremiah, however, prophesies that the city will be
destroyed, challenging the expectation that Jerusalem will be saved.
37:11-21 - Jeremiah is imprisoned for announcing the fall of Jerusalem,
but he continues to proclaim God's message, even in the midst of
suffering. His faithfulness to God, even in the face of persecution,

yield, showing that, before God's decision, truth cannot be
manipulated. Jeremiah's courage in speaking the truth, even against the
