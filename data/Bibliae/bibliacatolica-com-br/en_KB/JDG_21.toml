"1" = ''':sup:`1` This, too, was part of the oath which the Israelites took at Maspha,
that none of them would wed his daughter to a man of Benjamin’s race.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And now they betook themselves to God’s house in Silo, and sat there
all day in his presence, weeping and making loud lament;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Lord God of Israel, they cried, what curse is this that has fallen
on thy people, that a whole tribe of us should disappear?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And when day dawned they built an altar, upon which they presented
burnt-sacrifice and welcome-offerings. And now the thought came to
them,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Was there any clan among all the tribes of Israel that did not go
out to fight in the Lord’s army? At Maspha, they had bound themselves
by a solemn oath that anyone who failed them should be exterminated.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But when, in remorse over their Benjamite brethren, they fell to
lamenting over the loss of a whole tribe to Israel,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and asking where wives could be found for the race to which they had
all sworn they would wed no daughter of theirs,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` the thought came afresh, Were there any of Israel’s tribesmen who
did not answer the Lord’s summons to Maspha? Then they remembered that
the men of Jabes-Galaad had sent no aid;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` nor were any of them to be found now, among the muster at Silo.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So ten thousand fighting men were sent out with orders to put the
citizens of Jabes-Galaad to the sword. Wives and children were to
perish with the rest;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but while they slew all the men-folk, and all the women who had had
commerce with man, they must be careful to spare the unwedded maids.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Four hundred was the toll of unwedded maids they took at
Jabes-Galaad, and when these had been brought across the river to the
encampment at Silo,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` they sent to the Benjamites at the rock of Remmon under
safe-conduct,✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` bidding them come and take their wives there and then, daughters of
Jabes-Galaad.But where could any more be found, to suffice them?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Still the whole of Israel was full of remorse, grieving over a
tribe lost to Israel;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` still the elders were at a loss what to do for the rest of the
Benjamites; Here are all their women-folk slain, they said,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and Israel must not lose a tribe, if care or thought of ours can
prevent it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Yet how should we find brides for them, pledged as we are by oath
and ban not to give our daughters to Benjamin?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` At last they bethought themselves of a feast that is held every
year in the Lord’s honour near Silo, at a place north of Bethel, south
of Lebona, and east of the road from Bethel to Sichem.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Go and hide in these vineyards, they told the Benjamites,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and before long you will see the maids of Silo come out to perform
their customary dances. Then spring out upon them from the vineyards on
a sudden, each of you carrying off a wife for himself, and so return to
the lands of Benjamin.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When their fathers and brethren come to make angry complaints of
you, we will say, Forgive them; they did not claim to carry the maids
off by right of conquest. You provoked them to this by refusing your
consent.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So the men of Benjamin did as they were bidden, each of them
carrying off a wife for himself when the maids came out dancing; and
when they were back in their own domain they built new cities to dwell
in.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And each son of Israel went back to the dwelling-place of his own
clan, his own family. This was in the days before any king ruled in
Israel, when men lived by the best light they had.
