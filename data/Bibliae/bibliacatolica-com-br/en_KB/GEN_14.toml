"5" = ''':sup:`5` So, in this fourteenth year, Chodorlahomor and the kings allied with
him came out to battle. They had defeated the Raphaim, in
Astaroth-Carnaim, and the Zuzim in their company;✻ the Emim, too, in
Save-Cariathaim,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` The Valley of the Forests contained many pools of asphalt, and
among these the Kings of Sodom and Gomorrha were overcome and routed;
those who survived took refuge in the hill country.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` All the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrha, and all their supply of food,

wealth that was his.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And now word came, by one of those who had escaped, to the Hebrew
chieftain Abram, where he lived in the valley of Mambre the Amorrhite,
brother of Escol and Aner; all these were confederate with Abram.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Abram himself, as soon as he heard that his kinsman Lot was a
prisoner, mustered the men he had in arms, all of his own household, to
the number of three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit all the
way to Dan.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Here he divided his confederates into companies, and fell upon the
enemy by night, routing them and driving them in their flight as far as
Hoba, to the left of Damascus;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and he brought back all that wealth with him, Lot, too, and the
wealth that was his, and the women, and the common folk.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thus he defeated Chodorlahomor, and the kings who were with him.
And as he came back, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the
Valley of Savé, which is the same as the Royal Valley;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Melchisedech, too, was there, the king of Salem. And he, priest as
he was of the most high God, brought out bread and wine with him,

high God, maker of heaven and earth,

"20" = ''':sup:`20` and blessed be that most high God, whose protection has brought thy
enemies into thy power. To him, Abram gave tithes of all he had won.✻

"21" = ''':sup:`21` As for the king of Sodom, he said to Abram, Give me these living
souls; all the rest thou mayest take for thyself.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` But Abram answered, By this hand, which I lift up to the Lord God,
the prince of heaven and earth,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` I will take nothing of thine, though it were but a thread from the
woof or the strap of a shoe. Never shalt thou say, Abram got his wealth
from me.
