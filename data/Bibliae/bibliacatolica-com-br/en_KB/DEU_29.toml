'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Moses gathered all Israel round him, and said to them, Your own eyes
have witnessed, in the land of Egypt, the Lord’s dealings with Pharao
and his court and all his kingdom;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` the challenge of all those wonders and portents, plain to your view.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But to this day the Lord has not enlightened your hearts; yours are
blind eyes, yours are deaf ears still.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Has he not been your guide all through those forty years in the
desert? And all that time the garments that covered you did not wear
out, the shoes on your feet did not perish with age;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` you had no bread with you, no wine or strong drink, but you ate and
drank your fill; and can you doubt that you have the Lord your God to
protect you?✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And here, at our journey’s end, it is still the same; Sehon King of
Hesebon and Og king of Basan came out to give us battle, but we
conquered them,

tribe of Manasses.
'''

you would order your lives as wise men do.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You stand here, all of you, in the presence of the Lord your God,
for a single purpose, leaders of tribes with their tribes around them,
elders, counsellors, the whole assembly of Israel;

"11" = ''':sup:`11` your children, your wives, and the aliens that share your camp;
servants, too, that hew wood and draw water at your bidding.
'''

covenant he would make with you this day;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` he would make you his people, and be himself your God; such is the
promise he has made to you, such was the oath he took to your fathers,
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And it is not only with you that I ratify this covenant, this oath;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` it is with others, too, that are not here to make it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Ours is a race, as you know, that has dwelt in Egypt; since then,
we have made our way through the midst of many peoples, and as we
passed
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` you saw detestable and shameful sights, saw how they worshipped
idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Pray God there may be no man or woman here, no household or tribe,
that is false at heart to the Lord our God, ready to forsake him and
serve those other, alien gods. From such a root as that, gall and
wormwood must needs spring.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Does such a man, listening to the terms of this oath, flatter
himself with the thought that all will be well with him, and that he
can go on in his perverse ways, till the damp ground imparts its
moisture to the dry?✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then the Lord will not spare him. The divine anger will burn high
in indignation against such a man, and all the curses of which this
book makes mention will fall upon him, till the Lord has effaced his
memory among living men,

end, for every curse that gives this law and covenant its sanction.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` A warning that land will be, which the Lord so visits with plague
and affliction; a warning to the next generation, and their children
after them, and to strangers who come from far off to see it.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Here is a land he has burnt up with brimstone and salty fumes, till
it is sown no more and no green thing grows there, overwhelmed as he
overwhelmed Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, when his anger raged
fierce against them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And all will ask, Why has the Lord treated this land so? What means
this anger, this terrible vengeance of his?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And the answer will come, It was because they forsook the covenant
which the Lord had made with their fathers when he rescued them out of
the land of Egypt;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` because they enslaved themselves to the worship of alien gods
unknown to them, gods that were no gods of theirs.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` That is why the Lord’s vengeance fell heavy on this land, and he
brought on them all the curses which the book of his law contained,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` so hot his anger burned, so fierce his indignation; dispossessing
them of their own land and banishing them into a country of strangers,
for all to see.
