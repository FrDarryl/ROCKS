thee; thou hast thy God with thee, taking thy part. So David welcomed
them, and made them captains in his army.

thought, that David should be king.

"39" = ''':sup:`39` There they spent three whole days in the royal presence, and of
food and drink had no lack, so well had their fellow tribesmen made
provision for them;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` nay, there were asses and camels and mules and oxen bringing them
food from their neighbours, as far away as Issachar, Zabulon and
