about among the cities of Juda, breaking the idols and cutting down the

Ephraim and Manasses, till none were left. Then the Israelites made
their way home to their own cities.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` and all who dwelt in Juda’s cities, men of Israel and of Juda alike,

up all around;

"7" = ''':sup:`7` from the third month to the sixth, ever greater grew these heaps,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` and when Ezechias and his nobles came to see them, they blessed the

"9" = ''':sup:`9` But when Ezechias asked the priests and Levites why the offerings
were left to lie in heaps thus,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` their answer was, they had eaten their fill ever since the

"18" = ''':sup:`18` together with all who belonged to them, wives and sons and
daughters, had their food duly allotted to them out of the consecrated
gifts.
