tabernacle to wait and work there.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` The sons of Caath, he said, there in the tabernacle, are to have the
holiest task of all.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When the order is given for marching, it is for Aaron and his sons
to go in and take down the veil at the sanctuary entrance, in which
they will wrap up the ark;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` then they will enfold it again in a covering of skins dyed violet,
and spread a cloth over it all of blue, and so they will put the poles
in to carry it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` They will spread another blue cloth over the table, which will have
its cups and bowls and dishes on it, and goblets for pouring out
libations, and the bread set forth there as always;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` a red cloth over that, and a covering dyed violet, and put the poles
in.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then, with a blue cloth, they will cover the lamp-stand, with its

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then when Aaron and his sons have wrapped up the sanctuary and all
its appurtenances ready for the march, the sons of Caath will enter and
carry them away in their wrappings; they are not to touch the things of
the sanctuary, on pain of death. Such charge will the sons of Caath
have over the tabernacle that attests my covenant;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and Eleazar, son of the high priest Aaron, will be in command of
them. Under his care is the oil for feeding the lamps, and the spices

used for anointing, and all that concerns the worship paid in the
tabernacle, and all the furniture of the sanctuary.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` This warning, too, the Lord gave to Moses and Aaron;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Would you have the family of Caath lost to Levi’s tribe?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If you value their lives, order their doings thus; death is the

"23" = ''':sup:`23` men between the ages of thirty and fifty, who went into the
tabernacle to work there.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The task of these sons of Gerson, he told them,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` is to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the second covering
that makes a roof over the place of covenant, and the purple canopy
over all, and the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` the hangings, too, of the court, and the screen at the entrance of
the court, opposite the tabernacle.✻ All that belongs to the altar, and
all the ropes, and the appurtenances that go with them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` shall be carried by the family of Gerson, as Aaron and his sons
shall direct; they will make known what burden falls to each.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` This is the charge which the sons of Gerson will have over the
tabernacle which attests my covenant, and Ithamar, son of the high

"29" = ''':sup:`29` The households and families of Merari’s line must also be

tabernacle that attests my covenant, and these too will be at the
disposal of Ithamar, son of the high priest Aaron.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` So Moses and Aaron and the chieftains registered the households and
families of Caath,

"36" = ''':sup:`36` of these there were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

"42" = ''':sup:`42` Then the Merarites;

"44" = ''':sup:`44` of these there were three thousand two hundred.✻
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` So that the full register of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron and

"47" = ''':sup:`47` men between thirty and fifty, fit to carry burdens and do the work
of the tabernacle,
