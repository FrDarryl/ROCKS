"1" = ''':sup:`1` This Roboam betook himself to Sichem; at Sichem the whole of Israel
had assembled to crown him king.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But meanwhile Jeroboam, son of Nabat, who had fled to Egypt to be
out of king Solomon’s reach, had come back home upon hearing the news
of his death;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and he, too, was summoned to meet them. He, and all Israel with him,
came to make a request of Roboam;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Thy father, they said, made us bear a bitter yoke. That cruel sway
of his, that hard yoke, do thou mitigate, and we will be thy servants
on that condition.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Give me two days, said he, and then come back to hear my answer. So,
when the people had left him,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` king Roboam asked advice first of the older men that had been
courtiers in the life-time of his father, king Solomon; what answer
should he make to the people?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why, they told him, if thou dost defer to them and do their will,
granting this request of theirs and speaking graciously to them, they
will never cease giving thee loyal service.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But he left their advice unheeded, and took counsel instead with the
younger men who had grown up with him;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` How think you, he asked, I should make answer to the people’s
request, that I would lighten the yoke my father laid on them?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And these, men of his own upbringing, gave him advice in their
turn. Do they complain that thy father laid a heavy yoke on them, and
ask for relief? Then tell them there is more strength in thy little
finger than in all the breadth of thy father’s back;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` if his yoke fell heavy on them, thine shall be heavier still; if
thy father’s weapon was the lash, thine shall be the scorpion.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So the third day came, and Jeroboam, with all the people at his
back, kept the tryst which the king had made with them for the third
day following.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the king, instead of heeding the advice which the older men had
given, spoke to the people harshly,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` with such words as the younger men had prescribed to him. If my
father’s yoke fell heavy on you, he told them, mine shall be heavier
still; if his weapon was the lash, mine shall be the scorpion.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thus the king refused to fall in with his people’s will; the Lord
had left him to his own devices, in fulfilment of the promise Ahias the
Silonite made, in his name, to Jeroboam son of Nabat.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when the people found that the king would not listen to them,
they were quick with their answer. David is none of ours, they cried;
not for us the son of Jesse; go back, men of Israel, to your homes! Let
David look to the affairs of his own tribe! And with that, the people
dispersed to their homes;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` none but the Israelites living in the cities of Juda would
acknowledge Roboam as king.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And now, when Adoram, who had charge of the levy, came to them in
the king’s name, the Israelites stoned him to death; whereupon Roboam
mounted his chariot and betook himself, with all speed, to Jerusalem.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` From that day to this, the men of Israel have refused allegiance to
the dynasty of David.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Hearing of Jeroboam’s return, they met and summoned him to be
present; and so they made him king of all Israel, leaving none to take
part with David’s line except the one tribe of Juda.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Roboam, indeed, upon reaching Jerusalem, mustered the whole tribe
of Juda, including Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand choice
warriors, to make war on the men of Israel; their cry was that Roboam,
Solomon’s heir, must be restored to his kingdom.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the Lord sent word to the prophet Semeias,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Here is a message for Roboam, son of Solomon, king of Juda, and for
the men of Juda and Benjamin, the loyal remnant of the people.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` You are not to march out, the Lord says, and make war upon the sons
of Israel, your own brethren; go home, every man of you; all this is my
doing. So they obeyed the Lord’s will, and gave up their journey at his
bidding.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` As for Jeroboam, he fortified Sichem, in the hill-country of
Ephraim, to be his capital; then he went on to fortify Phanuel.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And it came into his mind, The kingdom will go back to the dynasty
of David
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` if these subjects of mine are allowed to go and sacrifice in the
Lord’s house at Jerusalem. Their loyalties will go out again to their
old master, king Roboam of Juda; they will kill me, and return to his
allegiance.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And this was the plan he devised; he made two golden calves, and
said to the men of Israel, Here are your gods; the same gods that
rescued you from the land of Egypt; no need to make pilgrimage to
Jerusalem any more.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` One of the calves he set up at Bethel, and the other at Dan.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Here was great sin caused; all the way to Dan men would go on
pilgrimage, to worship a calf.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Jeroboam made shrines, too, on the hill-tops, and chose men to be
priests here and there and everywhere among the people, men that were
not of Levi’s race.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And he appointed a feast-day of his own, on the fifteenth day of
the month, to match the feast-day kept in Juda, but it was in the
eighth month. He too, in Bethel, would mount the steps of the altar and
do sacrifice, but to calf-gods of his own making. And at Bethel he
established the priests that served the hill-shrines he had made.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` On the fifteenth day, then, of the eighth month, his self-devised
feast-day for the sons of Israel, Jeroboam went up to the altar he had
built in Bethel, and began, standing there, to offer incense.

Notas de rodapé:
12:1-5 - Solomon's son, Rehoboam, consults the people about the
workload imposed by his father. This consultation is crucial, as
Rehoboam's decisions will determine the future unity of the kingdom. A
lack of sensitivity to the people's concerns was a factor that led to
12:6-11 - Rehoboam ignores the advice of his elders, choosing instead
to follow the advice of the young men who grew up with him, resulting
in a harsh decision against the people. This reflects the importance of
wisdom and prudence in leadership, and the disastrous consequences of
10:16).
12:12-15 - Rehoboam's harsh response to the people results in a revolt
among the northern tribes. Their rejection of wise counsel leads to the
dissolution of the kingdom, fulfilling the Lord's word given through
Ahijah to Jeroboam. The division is seen as part of God's judgment (see
12:16-19 - The ten tribes rebel against Rehoboam and secede from Judah,
forming the Northern Kingdom under Jeroboam. This marks the final
division of Israel into two kingdoms, a consequence of Solomon's
12:25-30 - Jeroboam sets up two golden calves to prevent the people
from going up to Jerusalem to worship, leading Israel into idolatry.
The establishment of rival shrines at Bethel and Dan marks the
beginning of a period of spiritual unfaithfulness in the Northern
