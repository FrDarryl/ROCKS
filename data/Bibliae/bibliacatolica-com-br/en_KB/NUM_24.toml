"1" = ''':sup:`1` But this time, seeing clearly that it was God’s purpose to bless
Israel, Balaam did not go apart, as before, to look for portents; he
turned towards the desert,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and there, looking about him, he saw Israel encamped, tribe upon
tribe. With that, the spirit of God fell upon him,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and he prophesied: Thus speaks Balaam, the son of Beor, thus speaks
the man who has seen with eyes blindfolded;✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` thus speaks the man who has heard the words of God himself, looked
on a vision sent from the Almighty, who has fallen into a trance, and
learned to see aright!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` How lovely, Jacob, are thy tents; Israel, how fair thy dwelling!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Fair as wooded valleys, as gardens fed by running streams, as bowers
of the Lord’s own planting,✻ as cedars on the river bank!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Like a bucket brimming over at the well, see how their posterity
spreads from one river-frontier to the next! The king that rules over
them shall rival Agag himself, and take away his kingdom from him.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` God has rescued them from Egypt, and made them like a wild ox for
strength; nations shall come and swallow up their enemies,✻ crush them
utterly, shoot them down with arrows.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Though Israel takes his rest, it is but as the crouching lion
sleeps; who dares disturb the lioness in her den? A blessing, Israel,
on all who bless, a curse on all who curse thee!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` At this, Balac clapped his hands together in vexation; It was to
curse my enemies, said he to Balaam, that I summoned thee, and thrice
thou hast blessed them instead;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` back home with thee! It was in my mind to raise thee to high
honours, but this Lord of thine has thwarted thee of thy ambition.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Balaam still answered, Did I not warn the messengers thou
sentest to me,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Though Balac should fill his house with silver and gold and offer
to give it me, I have no power to go beyond the Lord’s bidding by
uttering any word of my own, for good or ill; I can only deliver the
Lord’s message?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I will go back, then, to my own folk; but not till I have
instructed thee about the dealings there must be between this folk and
thine in the days that are coming.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And once more Balaam prophesied: Thus speaks Balaam, the son of
Beor, thus speaks the man who has seen with eyes blindfolded;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` who heard speech of God, most high, the Almighty, knew his mind,
had vision of him, and in a trance, learned to see aright!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` My vision is not of this time, is not of the things that meet my
eyes. I see a star that rises out of Jacob, a stem that springs from
Israel’s root; one who shall lay low the chiefs of Moab, shall bring
devastation on all the posterity of Seth.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Edom shall fall into his hands; the men of Seir will yield their
lands to the enemy. Brave deeds in Israel;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` such a ruler for Jacob as shall leave no remnant in the captured
city!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then he spoke of Amalec, Amalec, first-fruits of the nations, shall
have his very gleanings destroyed;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` spoke of the Cinites, Though strong be thy fastness, though high
thy nest,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` proud race of Cin, it shall not be for ever; Assur shall carry thee
away into exile.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And once more he prophesied: Alas, who can survive when God brings
all this about?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Men will come in ships of war from Italy, conquering the Assyrians,
laying the Hebrew land waste, doomed themselves, last of all, to
perish.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` With that, Balaam set out and made his way home; and Balac, too,
went back whence he came.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
24:1-2 - Balaam, now aware that God blesses Israel, no longer seeks
enchantments, but allows the Spirit of God to lead him. This shows that
the true prophet is one who submits to the control of the Holy Spirit
24:5-9 - Balaam, inspired by the Spirit, prophesies God's blessing upon
Israel, describing them as a prosperous and powerful nation. This
vision anticipates Israel's role as an instrument of divine blessing
24:10-11 - Balak, frustrated, drives Balaam out, because instead of
cursing, Balaam blessed Israel three times. This emphasizes that the
power of the prophetic word is in the hands of God, not man (see also
24:15-17 - Balaam prophesies the coming of a "star out of Jacob," a
messianic reference that points to the future king who will come from
Israel and defeat their enemies. This prophecy is often seen as a
24:18-19 - Balaam's prophecy continues, predicting Israel's final
victory over her enemies, symbolizing the triumph of God's Kingdom over
Corinthians 15:24-25).
