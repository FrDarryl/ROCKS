"1" = ''':sup:`1` James, a servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, sends greeting
to the members of the twelve tribes scattered throughout the world.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Consider yourselves happy indeed, my brethren, when you encounter
trials of every sort,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` as men who know well enough that the testing of their faith breeds
endurance.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Endurance must do its work thoroughly, if you are to be men
full-grown in every part, nothing lacking in you.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Is there one of you who still lacks wisdom? God gives to all, freely
and ungrudgingly; so let him ask God for it, and the gift will come.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` (Only it must be in faith that he asks, he must not hesitate; one
who hesitates is like a wave out at sea, driven to and fro by the wind;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` such a man must not hope to win any gift from the Lord.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` No, a man who is in two minds will find no rest wherever he goes.)
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Is one of the brethren in humble circumstances? Let him be proud of
it; it exalts him,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` whereas the rich man takes pride in what in truth abases him.✻ (The
rich man will pass by like the bloom on the grass;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` the sun gets up, and the scorching wind with it, which dries up the
grass, till the bloom on it falls, and all its fair show dies away; so
the rich man, with his enterprises, will disappear.)
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Blessed is he who endures under trials. When he has proved his
worth, he will win that crown of life, which God has promised to those
who love him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nobody, when he finds himself tempted, should say, I am being
tempted by God. God may threaten us with evil, but he does not himself
tempt anyone.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` No, when a man is tempted, it is always because he is being drawn
away by the lure of his own passions.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When that has come about, passion conceives and gives birth to sin;
and when sin has reached its full growth, it breeds death.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Beloved brethren, do not deceive yourselves over this.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Whatever gifts are worth having, whatever endowments are perfect of
their kind, these come to us from above; they are sent down by the
Father of all that gives light, with whom there can be no change, no
swerving from his course;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and it was his will to give us birth, through his true word,
meaning us to be the first-fruits, as it were, of all his creation.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You know this, my beloved brethren, well enough. It is for us men
to be ready listeners, slow to speak our minds, slow to take offence;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` man’s anger does not bear the fruit that is acceptable to God.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Rid yourselves, then, of all defilement, of all the ill-will that
remains in you; be patient, and cherish that word implanted in you
which can bring salvation to your souls.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Only you must be honest with yourselves; you are to live by the
word, not content merely to listen to it.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` One who listens to the word without living by it is like a man who
sees, in a mirror, the face he was born with;✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` he looks at himself, and away he goes, never giving another thought
to the man he saw there.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Whereas one who gazes into that perfect law, which is the law of
freedom, and dwells on the sight of it, does not forget its message; he
finds something to do, and does it, and his doing of it wins him a
blessing.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` If anyone deludes himself by thinking he is serving God, when he
has not learned to control his tongue, the service he gives is vain.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` If he is to offer service pure and unblemished in the sight of God,
who is our Father, he must take care of orphans and widows in their
need, and keep himself untainted by the world.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
1:2-4 - James exhorts Christians to count trials all joy, for they
produce perseverance and spiritual maturity. Perseverance is essential
1:5 - James encourages Christians to ask God for wisdom, and He
generously grants it. Divine wisdom is crucial for living according to
1:12-15 - The blessedness of those who persevere in temptation,
contrasted with the sin that arises from desire, reveals the internal
struggle between the flesh and the spirit. Temptation is an opportunity
1:19-20 - James emphasizes the importance of being quick to listen,
slow to speak, and slow to anger. Human anger does not promote God's
justice, and careful reflection is crucial in Christian communication
1:22-25 - James teaches that we should not only hear God's word, but
also practice it. The word is a mirror that reflects our true
condition, and obedience is the correct response to divine revelation
