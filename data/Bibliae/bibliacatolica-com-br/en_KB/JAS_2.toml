"1" = ''':sup:`1` Brethren, you believe that all glory belongs to our Lord Jesus
Christ; do not combine this faith of yours with flattery of human
greatness.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Suppose that a man comes into your place of meeting in fine clothes,
wearing a gold ring; suppose that a poor man comes in at the same time,
ill clad.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Will you pay attention to the well-dressed man, and bid him take
some place of honour; will you tell the poor man, Stand where thou art,
or Sit on the ground at my footstool?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` If so, are you not introducing divisions into your company? Have you
not shewn partiality in your judgement?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Listen to me, my dear brethren; has not God chosen the men who are
poor in the world’s eyes to be rich in faith, to be heirs of that
kingdom which he has promised to those who love him?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And here are you putting the poor man to shame. Is it not the rich
who use their power to oppress you? Are not they the very men who drag
you into court,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` the very men who speak evil of that honoured name, by which you are
called?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` True, you do well to observe, in their regard, the royal law you
find in the words of scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But if you flatter the great, you incur guilt; the law finds you out
in a transgression.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the man who has failed in one point, though he has kept the
rest of the law, is liable to all its penalties:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` he who forbids adultery has forbidden murder as well. The murderer,
though he be no adulterer, has yet transgressed the law.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` You must speak and act like men already on their trial before a law
of freedom.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The merciless will be judged mercilessly; mercy gives its judgement
an honourable welcome.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Of what use is it, my brethren, if a man claims to have faith, and
has no deeds to shew for it? Can faith save him then?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Here is a brother, here is a sister, going naked, left without the
means to secure their daily food;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` if one of you says to them, Go in peace, warm yourselves and take
your fill, without providing for their bodily needs, of what use is it?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thus faith, if it has no deeds to shew for itself, has lost its own
principle of life.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` We shall be inclined to say to him, Thou hast faith, but I have
deeds to shew. Shew me this faith of thine without any deeds to prove
it, and I am prepared, by my deeds, to prove my own faith.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Thou believest that there is only one God; that is well enough, but
then, so do the devils, and the devils shrink from him in terror.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Rash soul, wouldst thou be assured that faith without deeds to shew
has no life in it?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Think of our father Abraham; was it not by his deeds that he found
approval, when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` See how his faith conspired with deeds done, and through those
deeds his faith was realized.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thus he confirmed the words of scripture, which tell us, Abraham
put his faith in God, and it was reckoned virtue in him, and he earned
the title of God’s friend.✻
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` You see, then, that it takes deeds as well as faith if a man is to
be justified.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Or again, how did Rahab, the harlot, win God’s approval? Was it not
by her deeds, when she harboured the spies and sent them home by a
different way?✻
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Body separated from spirit is a dead body, and faith separated from
good deeds is a dead faith.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
2:1-7 - James warns against discrimination in church gatherings,
pointing out that God chose the poor to be rich in faith. Partiality
contradicts the love of Christ, which welcomes all equally (see also
2:8-13 - The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself is central
to the royal law of Christ. God's judgment is based on mercy, and
2:14-17 - James teaches that faith without works is dead. True faith is
demonstrated by concrete actions of love and service. The example of
Abraham and Rahab illustrates how faith and works must go together (see
2:18-20 - James challenges Christians to demonstrate their faith
through works. Faith without works is empty, and good works are the
3:18).
2:21-26 - James illustrates the relationship between faith and works
with the examples of Abraham and Rahab. Both demonstrated their faith
through bold and obedient actions toward God, reinforcing the truth
