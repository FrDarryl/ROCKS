second visit on a sad errand.✻

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Was I to make you sorry? It meant bringing sorrow on those who are
my own best source of comfort.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` And those were the very terms in which I wrote to you: I would not
come, if it meant finding fresh cause for sorrow where I might have
expected to find cause for happiness. I felt confidence in you all, I
knew that what made me happy would make you happy too.✻

"4" = ''':sup:`4` When I wrote to you, I wrote in great anguish and distress of mind,
with many tears. I did not wish to bring sorrow on you, only to assure
you of the love I bear you, so abundantly.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Well, if someone has caused distress, it is not myself that he has
distressed but, in some measure, all of you, so that I must not be too
hard on him.✻

"6" = ''':sup:`6` This punishment inflicted on him by so many of you is punishment
enough for the man I speak of,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` and now you must think rather of shewing him indulgence, and
comforting him; you must not let him be overwhelmed by excess of grief.

great opportunity open to me in the Lord’s service;✻

"13" = ''':sup:`13` but still I had no peace of mind, because I had not yet seen my
brother Titus; so I took my leave of them all, and pressed on into
