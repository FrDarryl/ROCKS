"1" = ''':sup:`1` News of this was brought to all the other kings that lived west of
Jordan, some in the hill country, some down on the plains, some on the
coast by the shores of the open sea, or on the spurs of Lebanon. And
all of them, Hethite and Amorrhite, Chanaanite and Pherezite, Hevite
and Jebusite,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` made common cause against Josue and the people of Israel; all were
minded to offer a common resistance,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` except the people of Gabaon. These, when they learned how Josue had
destroyed Jericho and Hai,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` devised a policy of their own, and a crafty one. They provided
themselves with food as if for a long journey, and this they put into
old sacks, and their wine into skins that were tattered and patched,
and loaded up their beasts with such things.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Their shoes were worn out, and cobbled as old shoes would be, their
clothes threadbare, the very bread they took with them for the journey
dry and crumbling.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In such guise, they made their way into the presence of Josue, who
was then in camp at Galgal.To him, and to the assembly of Israel, they
gave out that they had come from far away, to make an alliance. The
Israelites were in doubt of them;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Neighbours more like, they said, dwelling in this land which is our
home; we can have no alliance with you.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So they turned to Josue and said, We await thy commands. And when he
asked who they were and whence they had come,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` they answered, My Lord, we have come from a land far away, to do
honour to the name of the Lord thy God. How strong a God, we learned
from the story of all he did in Egypt,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` of all that befell the two Amorrhite kings beyond Jordan, Sehon
king of Hesebon, and Og king of Basan, who reigned once at Astaroth.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So the elders and the rest of our fellow-citizens bade us take
provisions to last us through our travels, and come to meet you,
assuring you of our humble duty and begging for an alliance.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Only look at the bread we took with us, hot from the oven at home,
when we set out to find you, how dry it is, how it crumbles after being
kept so long!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The new wine-skins we filled are all torn and leaking; the very
clothes we wear, the very shoes on our feet, have worn out in our
travels, and all but worn away.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The victuals passed from hand to hand, and the Lord was never asked
for guidance.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Josue gave them terms of peace, and made an alliance with them,
promising that their lives should be spared; the chieftains, too, bound
themselves to it by an oath,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and it was not till the treaty had been three days in force, that
they learned these men were close neighbours, and would share the land
with them.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The Israelites moved camp, and reached, two days later, the cities
where these men dwelt, Gabaon and Caphira and Beroth and Cariathiarim.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Shed blood they might not; had not the chieftains pledged
themselves by an oath in the name of the Lord God of Israel? When the
common folk assailed them with reproaches,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` the chieftains could only answer, We have taken an oath in the name
of the Lord God of Israel; how can we touch them?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Only one way is left; we must keep them alive, so as not to provoke
the Lord’s anger by forswearing ourselves,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but they must live to hew wood and draw water for the needs of our
company.Such was the voice they gave;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and thereupon Josue summoned the Gabaonites into his presence. What
means this trick you have played on us, he asked, telling us you lived
far away, when you are in truth our near neighbours?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` You shall lie under a ban; it shall ever be men of your race that
hew wood and draw water for the house of the God whom I serve.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And they answered, My Lord, we had heard of the promise made by the
Lord thy God to his servant Moses, that he would give you all these
lands for your own, and dispossess the inhabitants. In terror of our
lives at your approach, we devised this stratagem.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now we are at thy mercy; do what seems best, do what seems right to
thee.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So Josue made good his word; he would not let Israel slay them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` but there and then he decreed that they should undertake the
service of the Lord’s altar on behalf of the whole people, in the place
of his choice, hewing wood and drawing water as they do to this day.

Notas de rodapé:
9:1-2 - The kings of the Canaanite cities united against Israel upon
hearing of their conquests. This unity highlights the strength of the
coalition between enemies opposing God's plan for Israel, reflecting
the spiritual tension between God's people and the surrounding nations
9:3-6 - The Gibeonites, fearing destruction, deceive the Israelites by
posing as ambassadors from a distant land. This act of cunning
highlights the importance of discerning the intentions of others and
9:14-15 - The Israelites fail to consult God before making a covenant
with the Gibeonites, leading to unexpected consequences. This failure
to seek divine guidance highlights the importance of prayer and
9:16-20 - After discovering the truth, the Israelites decide to spare
the Gibeonites but make them their servants. This decision demonstrates
the complexity of covenants and the consequences of choices made
12:2).
9:21-27 - The Gibeonites become hewers of timber and aqueducts for the
congregation of Israel. This transformation from enemies to servants
demonstrates God's ability to use difficult situations to accomplish
