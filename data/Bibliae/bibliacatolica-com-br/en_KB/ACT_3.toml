given him.

thee what I can. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and
walk.

strength came to his feet and ankles;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he sprang up, and began walking, and went into the temple with them,
walking, and leaping, and giving praise to God.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` All the people, as they saw him walking and praising God,

Gate of the temple, and were full of wonder and bewilderment at what
had befallen him.

gathered about them in what is called Solomon’s Porch, beside
themselves with wonder.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Peter, when he saw it, addressed himself to the people; Men of
Israel, he said, why does this astonish you? Why do you fasten your
eyes on us, as if we had enabled him to walk through some power or
virtue of our own?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our
forefathers, who has thus brought honour to his Son Jesus. You gave him
up, and disowned him in the presence of Pilate, when Pilate’s voice was
for setting him free.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` You disowned the holy, the just, and asked for the pardon of a
murderer,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` while you killed the author of life. But God has raised him up
again from the dead, and we are here to bear witness of it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Here is a man you all know by sight, who has put his faith in that

comes through Jesus that has restored him to full health in the sight
of you all.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Come then, brethren, I know that you, like your rulers, acted in
ignorance;

'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Repent, then, and turn back to him, to have your sins effaced,

he will send out Jesus Christ, who has now been made known to you,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` but must have his dwelling-place in heaven until the time when all
is restored anew,✻ the time which God has spoken of by his holy
prophets from the beginning.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Thus, Moses said, The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet
like myself, from among your own brethren; to him, to every word of
his, you must listen.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` It is ordained that everyone who will not listen to the voice of
that prophet shall be lost to his people.✻

"24" = ''':sup:`24` And all the prophets who spoke to you, from Samuel onwards, have
foretold those days.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` You are the heirs of the prophets, and of the covenant which God
made with our fathers, when he said to Abraham, Every race on earth
shall receive a blessing through thy posterity.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` It is to you first of all that God has sent his Son, whom he raised
up from the dead to bring you a blessing, to turn away every one of you
from his sins.
