Notas de rodapé:
4:1-3 - Amos rebukes the women of Samaria, calling them "cows of
Bashan," for their luxury and oppression of the poor. He denounces the
hypocrisy of a life of excess while the people suffer. Criticism of
these practices reveals the spiritual and moral corruption of society
4:4-5 - The people are challenged to bring their offerings to Bethel
and Gilgal, but this is a critique of false religiosity. God condemns
empty rituals that do not reflect a sincere heart. True worship demands
6:5-6).
4:6-11 - Amos lists calamities sent by God to correct the people, but
without their repentance. This shows that, despite God's attempts at
discipline, the people persisted in sin. Insensitivity to repentance is
5:3).
4:12-13 - God declares that judgment will come against Israel and that
it will be an encounter with a God who is the Creator and Lord of all
creation. This emphasizes divine sovereignty and the inevitable
04:13 - Amos reminds us that God has the power to control all creation
and that He will reveal His power in judgment. This is a reaffirmation
of God's greatness and dominion over all things, challenging the pride
