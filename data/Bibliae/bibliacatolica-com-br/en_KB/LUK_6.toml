'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` How he went into the tabernacle, and ate the loaves set forth there

"32" = ''':sup:`32` Why, what credit is it to you, if you love those who love you? Even
sinners love those who love them.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` What credit is it to you, if you do good to those who do good to
you? Even sinners do as much.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` What credit is it to you, if you lend to those from whom you expect
repayment? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much in
exchange.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` No, it is your enemies you must love, and do them good, and lend to

the thankless and unjust.

will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Give, and gifts will be yours; good measure, pressed down and

"43" = ''':sup:`43` There is no sound tree that will yield withered fruit, no withered
tree that will yield sound fruit.

thorns, nor grapes gathered from brier bushes.
'''

the wicked man, from his heart’s store of wickedness, can utter nothing
but what is evil; it is from the heart’s overflow that the mouth

them out, I will tell you what he is like;
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` he is like a man that would build a house, who dug, dug deep, and
laid his foundation on rock. Then a flood came, and the river broke
upon that house, but could not stir it; it was founded upon rock.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` But the man who listens to what I say and does not carry it out is
