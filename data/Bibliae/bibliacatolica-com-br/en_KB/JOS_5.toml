on the west of Jordan, and the Chanaanite kings by the coast of the
great sea, that the Lord had dried up the stream of Jordan to let the
Israelites go across. And now their hearts failed them, and their

"3" = ''':sup:`3` So he did as the Lord bade him, and restored circumcision to Israel
at the Hill of the Foreskins.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` There was need to renew this rite, because the men of the older
generation, who were of age to bear arms at the time of the escape from
Egypt, had died in the course of their desert wanderings.

born

"6" = ''':sup:`6` during those forty years in the waste wilderness, remained
uncircumcised still. Those rebels, the Lord had sworn it, must never
reach the land that was all milk and honey; now they lay dead,

ceased, nor did the sons of Israel ever taste that food again; they ate
the crops which the land of Chanaan yielded that year.
