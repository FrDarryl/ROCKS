"1" = ''':sup:`1` Once justified, then, on the ground of our faith, let us enjoy peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` as it was through him that we have obtained access, by faith, to
that grace in which we stand. We are confident in the hope of attaining
glory as the sons of God;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` nay, we are confident even over our afflictions, knowing well that
affliction gives rise to endurance,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and endurance gives proof of our faith, and a proved faith gives
ground for hope.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Nor does this hope delude us; the love of God has been poured out in
our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom we have received.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Were that hope vain, why did Christ, in his own appointed time,
undergo death for us sinners, while we were still powerless to help
ourselves?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It is hard enough to find anyone who will die on behalf of a just
man, although perhaps there may be those who will face death for one so
deserving.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But here, as if God meant to prove how well he loves us, it was
while we were still sinners
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` that Christ, in his own appointed time, died for us. All the more
surely, then, now that we have found justification through his blood,
shall we be saved, through him, from God’s displeasure.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Enemies of God, we were reconciled to him through his Son’s death;
reconciled to him, we are surer than ever of finding salvation in his
Son’s life.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And, what is more, we can boast of God’s protection; always through
our Lord Jesus Christ, since it is through him that we have attained
our reconciliation.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It was through one man that guilt came into the world; and, since
death came owing to guilt, death was handed on to all mankind by one
man. (All alike were guilty men;✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` there was guilt in the world before ever the law of Moses was
given. Now, it is only where there is a law to transgress that guilt is
imputed,✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and yet we see death reigning in the world from Adam’s time to the
time of Moses, over men who were not themselves guilty of transgressing
a law, as Adam was.) In this, Adam was the type of him who was to come.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Only, the grace which came to us was out of all proportion to the
fault. If this one man’s fault brought death on a whole multitude, all
the more lavish was God’s grace, shewn to a whole multitude, that free
gift he made us in the grace brought by one man, Jesus Christ.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The extent of the gift is not as if it followed a single guilty
act; the sentence which brought us condemnation arose out of one man’s
action, whereas the pardon that brings us acquittal arises out of a
multitude of faults.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And if death began its reign through one man, owing to one man’s
fault, more fruitful still is the grace, the gift of justification,
which bids men enjoy a reign of life through one man, Jesus Christ.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Well then, one man commits a fault, and it brings condemnation upon
all; one man makes amends, and it brings to all justification, that is,
life.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` A multitude will become acceptable to God through one man’s
obedience, just as a multitude, through one man’s disobedience, became
guilty.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The law intervened, only to amplify our fault; but, as our fault
was amplified, grace has been more amply bestowed than ever;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` that so, where guilt held its reign of death, justifying grace
should reign instead, to bring us eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord.

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-2 - Justified by faith, Christians have peace with God and access
to His grace. Justification comes not by works, but by faith in Christ,

God's immeasurable love. Grace is given to all, not because we deserve

Transgression brings death, but God's grace through Jesus brings
