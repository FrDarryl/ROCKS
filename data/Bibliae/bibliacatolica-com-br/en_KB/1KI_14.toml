"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now Jeroboam’s son Abia fell sick.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Whereupon Jeroboam said to his wife, Here is a journey needs to be
made; but first disguise thyself, so that none may know thou art the
wife of Jeroboam. It is to Silo thou must go, where Ahias lives, the
prophet who foretold that I should be king of this realm;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` to him betake thyself, bearing ten loaves with thee, and some
pastry, and a pot of honey; from him thou wilt learn what is to become
of the boy.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Jeroboam’s wife did his bidding; to Silo she made her way, and
found Ahias’ house. Ahias had no sight left now, so dim were his eyes
grown with old age;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` but the Lord made it known to him that Jeroboam’s wife was coming to
ask him about her son, that had fallen sick, and told him what words he
must use to her. She, as she entered, would have given herself out to
be other than she was;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but Ahias, as soon as he heard the fall of her feet on the
threshold, cried out, Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why dost thou feign
thyself to be another? I am charged with bitter tidings for thee.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Go and give Jeroboam this message from the Lord God of Israel: Was
it for this I chose thee out among the common folk, and gave thee
command of my people Israel,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` tearing David’s kingdom asunder to enthrone thee? My servant David
was not such a man as thou art. He kept my commandments, obeying me
with all his heart, and doing my will.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And thou? Thou hast done more amiss than any who went before thee,
making thyself molten images of alien gods; me thou hast defied, me
thou hast rejected.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And I, in return, mean to bring ruin on all Jeroboam’s race,
smiting every man that belongs to it, bondman or free man, throughout
all Israel;✻ I mean to sweep away the last remnants of his race, like
the dung that must be swept away till all is clean.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Die they in the city, they shall be food for the dogs; die they in
the open country, they shall be food for all the birds of heaven; it is
the Lord’s decree.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Up, then, betake thyself home, and as thy feet cross the threshold
of the city, thy son will die.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Lament and burial he shall have from the people of Israel; in him
alone, of all Jeroboam’s race, some loyalty to the God of Israel is
found, and he alone, of all Jeroboam’s race, shall be carried to the
grave.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` This day, even as I speak, the Lord has marked out for the throne
of Israel one who shall destroy the race of Jeroboam.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And as for Israel itself, it shall tremble under the hand of the
Lord God, as a reed trembles in the water; he will root them out from
the fair land which he gave to their fathers, and scatter them beyond
the Great River, men that defied the Lord with forest-shrines of their
own fashioning.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And if the Lord abandons Israel thus, it is for the guilt of
Jeroboam, that sinned, and taught Israel to sin.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Jeroboam’s wife left him, and made her way back to Thersa, where
her feet no sooner crossed the threshold than her son died.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Burial he had, and all Israel mourned for him, as the prophet Ahias
had promised in the Lord’s name.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` What else Jeroboam did, how he fought and how he reigned, is to be
found written in the Annals of the kings of Israel.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When his reign had lasted twenty-two years, he was laid to rest
with his fathers, and the throne passed to his son Nadab.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Meanwhile king Solomon’s son Roboam was reigning in Juda. He was
forty-one years old when he came to the throne, and for seventeen years
he reigned as king at Jerusalem, the city which the Lord chose out of
all the cities of Israel to be the sanctuary of his name. His mother
was an Ammonitess called Naama.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` In his reign the men of Juda earned the Lord’s displeasure by
sinning against him more defiantly than their fathers ever had before
them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` They, like the men of Israel, raised altar and image and shrine, on
every high hill and under every spreading tree;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and these shrines had their prostitutes; they flourished again, all
the unnatural deeds of the heathen, whom the Lord dispossessed at
Israel’s coming.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` In Roboam’s fifth year, Sesac king of Egypt marched on Jerusalem,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and took away all the treasures from temple and palace, plundering
everywhere; took away, too, the shields of gold which Solomon had
fashioned.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` In place of these, Roboam made shields of bronze, which he
entrusted to the captains of his shield-bearers and palace guards;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` when he made a progress into the Lord’s house, they were carried by
the officers that marched before him, and afterwards taken back to the
shield-bearers’ armoury.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` What else Roboam did, all the history of his reign, is to be found
in the Annals of the kings of Juda.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` All through his reign there was war between him and Jeroboam.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So Roboam, son of the Ammonitess Naama, was laid to rest with his
fathers, with the Keep of David for his burying-place; and the throne
passed to his son Abiam.

Notas de rodapé:
14:1-4 - Jeroboam sends his wife in disguise to the prophet Ahijah to
inquire about his sick son. The disguise illustrates Jeroboam's
deception and distrust, but God sees all and reveals the truth to the
14:5-9 - The prophet Ahijah announces God's judgment on the house of
Jeroboam because of their idolatry and disobedience. This oracle

10:31 and 1 Kings 12:28-30).
14:10-14 - The sentence of destruction upon the house of Jeroboam is
pronounced. God promises to eliminate all of the king's descendants
because of their sin, reminding them that judgment is certain for those
14:15-16 - God prophesies Israel's exile because of the idolatry
promoted by Jeroboam. The warning against Israel's destruction as a
nation is a call to repentance (see also Deuteronomy 28:36-37 and 2
Kings 17:18-23).
14:21-24 - Rehoboam, king of Judah, also does what is evil in the sight
of the Lord. Idolatry and cultic prostitution spread throughout Judah,
