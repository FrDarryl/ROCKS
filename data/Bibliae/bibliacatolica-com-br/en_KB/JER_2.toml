"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then the Lord’s word came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Go and cry out so that all Jerusalem may hear, with this message
from the Lord: What memories I have of thee, gracious memories of thy
youth, of the love that plighted troth between us, when I led thee
through the desert; alone in the barren wastes, thou and I!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Israel was set apart for the Lord, first-fruits vowed to be his
revenue; he lay under a ban that plucked them, and must rue his
rashness, the Lord says.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Listen, then, to the Lord’s word, men of Jacob; listen, every clan
that bears the name of Israel,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` to the Lord’s message: What fault did they find in me, those fathers
of yours, that they should keep their distance from me, and court false
gods, false as themselves?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And never a thought to ask where I, the Lord, was, that rescued them
from Egypt, and led them on their way through the desert, wild and
solitary, parched and dead, far from haunt of traveller and the homes
of men!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Into a land of plenty I brought you, to enjoy the fruits and the
blessings of it; and you had no sooner entered it than you must needs
defile it, my own land, turn my chosen home into a place abominable.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Never a priest to ask where I, the Lord, was; never a man of law but
made a stranger of me, never a ruler but played me false, never a
prophet but took Baal for his oracle, and had recourse to powers that
were impotent.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Against you, the Lord says, my appeal still lies, and with your
children I will yet be at issue.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Sail the seas till you reach the isles of Cethim; send envoys out
to the wilds of Cedar; look for yourselves and make earnest enquiry, to
know if the like was ever heard!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` What nation ever changed its gods, though gods indeed they were
not? And should my people barter away the glory that dwelt among them,
for powers that power have none?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` In horror and dismay witness, you heavens, the sight; crumble in
ruins!✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Two wrongs this people of mine committed; me they forsook, the
fountain of living water, and thereupon they dug cisterns of their own,
leaking cisterns, that water had none to give them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` What, is the race of Israel a slave, a chattel, that it should pass
from hand to hand as the prize of war?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Roaring lions have claimed it for their prey; the land lies waste,
the cities burnt and desolate.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Even the Egyptians have come from Memphis and Taphne, to strip thee
bare;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` tell me, Israel, how came this? Was it not because thou hadst
forsaken the Lord thy God, that till then had led thee?✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` What, wouldst thou turn to Egypt, to Assyria, and slake thy thirst
with Nile or Euphrates?✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Here is the very proof of thy wickedness, the measure of thy
unfaithfulness; see how ill it has gone with thee, says the Lord, the
God of hosts, ever since thou didst forsake the Lord thy God, ever
since thou didst banish the fear of me!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` It is an old tale, now, how thou didst break in pieces the yoke of
my dominion, didst sever all the bonds between us, crying out, I will
serve no more! Thou wast off to play the wanton, the nearest hill-top
or secret forest for thy bower.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Alas, vineyard of mine, that I planted with such care, never a
worthless shoot! How is it thou hast played me false, and art no
vineyard of mine?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Ay, use nitre for thy cleansing, spread potash as thou mayst, foul
with guilt I shall still find thee, says the Lord God.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Nay, never boast that thou art undefiled, to countryside gods hast
no recourse; bethink thee of thy traffickings in Ben-Ennom valley, and
read there the story of thy doings. Camel never found its way so
lightly;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` wild ass in its familiar desert, scenting its mate, never obeyed
the fire in its blood more uncontrollably! Little search it needs to
find thy haunts, as its mate in spring-time.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Reckless of unshod feet, of parching throat, thou criest out
despairingly, Return I cannot; to alien gods all my heart is vowed, and
I must follow still!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Thief caught in the act has less cause to blush than the men of
Israel, king and prince, priest and prophet, with the rest.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Stock of wood and block of stone they hailed as the father that had
begotten them; on me they turned their backs, and gave me never a
glance. And now, in their distress, it is Up, Lord, and bring us
rescue!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Where are those other gods thou madest for thyself? Bid them rise
up and aid thee in the hour of peril; gods thou hadst a many; no city
of thine, Juda, but must have its own!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And would you still implead me? Nay, says the Lord, you have
forsaken me, one and all.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` In vain I have smitten them, all those sons of yours; still you
turned your swords against the prophets, bloodthirsty as lions.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Out upon this age! Here is the Lord’s message, give good heed to
it. Have I shewn myself unfriendly to Israel, like a desert, like a
land overcast by shadows, that my own people has resolved to keep its
distance, and come my way no more?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` What, should maid forget her jewels, bride her stomacher? And my
own people, all these long days, has forgotten me!
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` What avails it to justify thyself, in hope of winning back my love,
when thou thyself dost blazon so openly thy doings, thy foul misdoings?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` There is blood on thy hands, the blood of friendless folk and
innocent. It is not thieves I have found, but men guilty of such crimes
as these.✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And still thou declarest thyself innocent of any fault, still thou
biddest me withhold my vengeance! Come, let me answer thy plea of
innocence.

"36" = ''':sup:`36` How light a woman thou art, ever at thy old ways! Not less than thy
hopes of Assyria, thy hopes of Egypt shall be disappointed;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` thence, too, thou shalt come away wringing thy hands; all the
confidence thou hast the Lord means to destroy; thou shalt make no
shift with Egypt.
