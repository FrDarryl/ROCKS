Notas de rodapé:
1:1-2 - Obadiah's vision is a message of judgment against Edom, a
nation descended from Esau. The prophecy highlights God's sovereignty
over all nations and His judgment against pride and violence. Edom is
held accountable for its hostile attitude toward Israel, and the
message warns of the consequences of national pride (see also
1:3-4 - Edom's pride is condemned, as they relied on their geographical
position and wealth to feel invulnerable. God warns that, no matter how
high they are, nothing can prevent divine judgment. This passage
highlights human fragility before God's sovereign power, which brings
1:5-9 - The judgment against Edom is illustrated by a series of images
of destruction, such as looting and robbery, that come upon them. God

nation from imminent destruction. Edom's fall serves as an example that
trust in earthly forces is futile before God's power (see also
1:10-14 - Edom's betrayal during the attack on Jerusalem is emphasized.

1:15-21 - The prophecy concludes with a vision of Israel's victory over
its enemies, including restoration and victory over Edom. God promises
vengeance and the restoration of His people. The Kingdom of God will be

This vision points to the triumph of justice and God's eternal kingdom
