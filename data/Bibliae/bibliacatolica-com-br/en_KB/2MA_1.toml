"7" = ''':sup:`7` Time was, in the hundred and sixty-ninth year, when Demetrius was
a-reigning, we ourselves were writing to you in the midst of suffering
and alarms. Much had we to undergo, when Jason would betray his own
country, his own people;

"8" = ''':sup:`8` here was the gateway burnt to the ground, here were innocent lives
forfeited. Cried we upon the Lord, and all our prayers were answered;

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Great thanks we owe to God, that from the extreme of peril has
delivered us; ay, though we had such a king for our adversary,

"12" = ''':sup:`12` as could bring in hordes of men from Persia, both us and our holy
city to subdue.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What became of him, think you, the general that marched away into
Persia with a countless army at his heels?✻ He met his end in the

"15" = ''':sup:`15` The priests, then, had the money laid out in readiness; into the

the fire imparted to us, when Nehemias offered sacrifice at the
re-building of temple and altar.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Long ago, when our fathers were being carried off into the Persian
country, such priests of the true God as held office in those days took
away the fire from the altar, and hid it down in the valley, in a pit
both deep and dry, so well guarding their secret that none might know
where it was to be found.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Years passed, and God’s will was that Nehemias should come back,
holding the Persian king’s warrant. Nehemias it was that had search
made for the fire, and by the grandsons of those very priests that hid
it; but they made report, fire they could find none, only a puddle of
water.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And what did Nehemias? He would have some of the water drawn and
fetched to him; with this water, once the sacrifice was laid on the
altar, both the wood and the offerings themselves must be sprinkled.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Sprinkled they were, and when the sun shone out, that till now was
hidden by a cloud, all at once a great fire blazed up, astonishing the
beholders.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` To prayer fell the priests all around, while sacrifice was done,
Jonathan to lead them,✻ and the rest answering;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` to prayer fell Nehemias, and this was the manner of his praying:
Lord God, that all things madest, the terrible, the strong, the just,
the merciful, King gracious as none else;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` none else so kindly, none else so just, as thou, the almighty, the

thine; thy own domain keep inviolate.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` and to thy own sanctuary, as Moses foretold, thy own people

'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then, till the sacrifice was consumed, the priests went on with
their singing of hymns;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and when all was finished, Nehemias would have them drench great
stones with the water that was left.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Thereupon, a flame broke out from them, but died away when the
altar fires blazed up again over yonder.✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The news travelled, till the Persian king himself was told how
water appeared where exiled priests had hidden the fire, how, with this
water, Nehemias and his company had bathed the sacrifice.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Good heed he gave to the matter, and after due examination fenced
the ground in with a shrine, in witness of what befell there.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Largesse the priests had, and many were the gifts passed from hand
to hand, when the truth of the matter was proved.✻
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` As for the place, Nehemias himself called it Nephthar, which means
Purification; but the vulgar call it Nephi.

difficulties faced by the Jews under foreign rule. Political and
