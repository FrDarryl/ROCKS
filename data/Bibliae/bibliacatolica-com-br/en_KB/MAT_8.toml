"1" = ''':sup:`1` A great multitude followed him when he had come down from the
mountain;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and now, a leper came and knelt before him, and said, Lord, if it be
thy will, thou hast power to make me clean.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Jesus held out his hand and touched him, and said, It is my will; be
thou made clean. Whereupon his leprosy was immediately cleansed.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then Jesus said, Be sure thou dost not tell any man of it; rather go
and shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses
ordained, to make the truth known to them.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As he entered Capharnaum, a centurion came to him, asking for his
aid;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Lord, he said, I have a servant lying sick at my house, cruelly
tormented with the palsy.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But the centurion answered, Lord, I am not worthy to receive thee
under my roof; my servant will be healed if thou wilt only speak a word
of command.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I too know what it is to obey authority; I have soldiers under me,
and I say, Go, to one man, and he goes, or, Come, to another, and he
comes, or, Do this, to my servant, and he does it.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When he heard that, Jesus said to his followers in amazement,
Believe me, I have not found faith like this, even in Israel.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And this I tell you, that there are many who will come from the
east and from the west, and will take their places in the kingdom of
God with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` while that kingdom’s own sons are cast into the darkness without,
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And to the centurion Jesus said, Go then; let it be done to thee as
thy faith foretold. And at that hour his servant was healed.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Jesus went into Peter’s house, and found his wife’s mother
lying sick there with a fever.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He touched her hand, and the fever left her, so that she rose up
and ministered to them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when evening came, they brought to him many persons who were
possessed; and he cast out the evil spirits with his word, and healed
all that were sick,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` in fulfilment of the word spoken by Isaias the prophet, He took our
infirmities upon himself, and bore our sicknesses.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And now, seeing how great were the multitudes about him, he gave
the word for crossing to the other side.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Whereupon one of the scribes came to him, and said, Master, I will
follow thee wherever thou art going.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Jesus told him, Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air
their resting-places; the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, give me leave to go
home and bury my father before I come.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But to him Jesus said, Do thou follow me, and leave the dead to
bury their dead.✻
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So he took ship, and his disciples followed him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And suddenly a great storm arose on the sea, so that the waves rose
high over the ship; but he lay asleep.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And his disciples came and roused him, crying, Lord, save us, we
are sinking.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Jesus said to them, Why are you faint-hearted, men of little
faith? Then he rose up, and checked the winds, and the sea, and there
was deep calm.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So that all asked in amazement, What kind of man is this, who is
obeyed even by the winds and the sea?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So he reached the other shore, in the country of the Gerasenes; and
here he was met by two possessed creatures who came out of the rock
tombs, so exceedingly fierce that none could pass along that road.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And at once they cried aloud, Why dost thou meddle with us, Jesus,
Son of God? Hast thou come here to torment us before the appointed
time?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Some distance away, a great herd of swine was feeding;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and the devils asked a favour of him; If thou hast a mind to cast
us out, they said, send us into the herd of swine.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He said to them, Away with you; and they came out and went into the
herd of swine; and with that, all the herd rushed down the cliff into
the sea, and perished in its waters.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The swineherds fled to the city, and there told all that had
happened and the story of those who had been possessed.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And thereupon all the townspeople went out to meet Jesus; and when
they found him, they entreated him to leave their country.✻
