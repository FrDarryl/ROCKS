"1" = ''':sup:`1` Thus Joas came to the throne as a boy of seven years old, and his
reign at Jerusalem lasted forty years. His mother’s name was Sebia, a
woman of Bersabee.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` As long as the high priest Joiada was alive, Joas obeyed the Lord’s
will,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and it was Joiada who found him his two wives, that bore sons and
daughters to him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And now Joas had a mind to put the Lord’s house in repair.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He summoned priests and Levites, and bade them go round the cities
of Juda, collecting money from all that were of Israel’s race every
year, so as to repair the temple of the Lord their God; and this he
would have them do with all speed. But the Levites went about their
work slowly,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and the king must needs send for the high priest Joiada; Why hast
thou been at no pains, he asked, to make the Levites collect money
throughout Juda and Jerusalem, the same money which the Lord’s servant
Moses bade all Israel devote to the needs of the tabernacle?✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Here is God’s house all laid waste by Athalia, the godless queen,
and those sons of hers, that would deck Baal’s temple with all the
votive offerings that were once in the temple of the Lord.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the king bade them have a chest made, and this they put by the
outer gate of the Lord’s house.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And word went round Juda and Jerusalem that each man was to pay the
tax Moses enjoined on all Israel, out in the desert.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Gladly did chieftains and common folk together come in with their
gifts for the Lord’s treasury, piling the chest high till it was full.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When the Levites saw that a great sum was amassed, it was time they
should take it into the royal presence. The king’s secretary would come
in, and with him one that was appointed by the high priest; together
they poured out the money that was in the chest, which they then put
back in its place. Every day this was done, and the great sum thus
collected
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` was paid over by the king and Joiada to the master-builders, who
hired stone-cutters with it, and other craftsmen, to repair the Lord’s
house; workers, too, in iron and bronze, so as to prop up what was like
to fall down.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Busily these men went about their tasks, till the breach was healed
under their hands, and the building restored to its former state; the
house stood firm once more.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It was only when they had finished all this that the rest of the
money collected was brought before the king and Joiada; with this they
made all the appurtenances for worship and offering sacrifice in the
temple; bowls, too, and other ornaments of gold and silver.✻ All
through Joiada’s life-time burnt-sacrifice was offered in the Lord’s
house;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but at last he grew old, and the full tale of his years was
complete; he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And for his great services to Israel and to David’s house, they
buried him in David’s own Keep, among the kings.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But now that he was dead, the chieftains of Juda came in to do the
king reverence, and with their smooth speech won him over to another
mind;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` forgotten, now, was the Lord’s temple, God of their fathers though
he were; they must worship before forest shrines, and carved images.
This guilt of theirs brought the Lord’s vengeance on Juda and
Jerusalem;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` still he would send them prophets, to bring them back to him, but
their protest went unheeded.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` At last the divine spirit fell on the high priest Zacharias, that
was son to Joiada; full in the presence of the people he stood up and
gave them a message from the Lord God: What means it that you so
transgress the Lord’s command, to your peril, forsaking him, and by him
forsaken?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But they, at the king’s orders, gathered about him and stoned him,
there in the court of the Lord’s house.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Such was the gratitude of Joas; for the great services the father
had done him, the son must die. And as he died, he said, May the Lord
look on this, and exact the penalty.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` A year passed, and the army of Syria was on the march against Joas.
Into Juda, into Jerusalem they came, killed all that were of note among
the people, plundered, and sent back what they had plundered to their
master at Damascus.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` It was but a small force of Syrians that came, yet the Lord gave
them the mastery over a great host; and all because Juda had forsaken
the Lord God of their fathers. A shameful punishment Joas must undergo,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and when they left him, they left him a prey to heavy sickness.
Then, in vengeance for the murder of the high priest’s son, courtiers
of his own conspired against him and slew him in his bed. So dying, he
received burial in the Keep of David, but not in the burying-place of
the kings.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` It was Zabad, son of the Ammonitess Semmaath, and Josabad, son of
the Moabitess Semarith, that made the plot against him.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` What sons he had, what moneys he amassed, how he restored the house
of God, may all be found set out in the Records of the Kings; and the
throne passed to his son Amasias.

Notas de rodapé:
24:1-3 - Joash begins his reign at only seven years old and, under the
guidance of the priest Jehoiada, restores the temple of the Lord. This

24:4-7 - Joash orders money to be raised to repair the temple, but the
priests procrastinate. This inaction reveals the need for proper
management of resources dedicated to God and the importance of
24:8-14 - The collection of resources and the restoration of the temple
are accomplished, and Joash celebrates the dedication of the work. This
action symbolizes the restoration of true worship of God and the
importance of investing in the Lord's worship and house (see also
24:15-22 - Jehoiada the priest dies, and Joash turns away from the
Lord, leading the people into idolatry. This emphasizes the impact that
spiritual leaders have on a nation and how a lack of commitment to God
24:23-27 - Joash is assassinated by his own officers as a consequence
of his unfaithfulness. This tragic end highlights the seriousness of
rebellion against God and the judgment that can come upon those who
