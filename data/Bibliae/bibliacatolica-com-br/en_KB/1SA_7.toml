"1" = ''':sup:`1` So they came as they were bidden, the men of Cariathiarim, and
brought back the ark with them, housing it with a certain Abinadab in
Gabaa;✻ and they set apart his son Eleazar to keep watch over the
Lord’s ark.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Long time the ark remained in Cariathiarim; twenty years so passed,
and now the whole race of Israel sought rest from its troubles in
following the Lord.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Why then, Samuel told the Israelites, if your hearts are honestly
set on coming back to the Lord, you must rid yourselves of all alien
gods; no Baal for you, no Astaroth; your hearts must wait in readiness
on the Lord and serve him only; then he will deliver you from the
Philistine’s power.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Israel cast Baal and Astaroth aside, to serve none but the Lord.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Samuel would have all Israel meet at Masphath, so that he might
beg the Lord’s mercy for them there;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and at Masphath they assembled, and drew water which they poured out
before the Lord, and fasted that day, and made confession there to the
Lord of their sin. And Samuel sat in judgement over Israel at Masphath.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` This assembly at Masphath came to the ears of the Philistines, and
their chiefs came out to offer Israel battle. Whereupon the Israelites,
in great dread of them,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` bade Samuel pray to the Lord their God yet, if they were to be
rescued from the power of the Philistines.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So Samuel chose out a lamb still unweaned, and offered it whole to
the Lord in burnt-sacrifice, crying out to the Lord for Israel, and
obtaining an answer to his prayer.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It was at the very moment when Samuel was offering sacrifice that
the Philistines went to the attack; and the Lord volleyed his thunders
against the Philistines that day, crashing loud above them, so that
they were overcome with terror, and fell before Israel’s onslaught;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` from Masphath all the way to the slopes of Bethchar the Israelites
pursued them, cutting them down.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thereupon Samuel chose out a stone and set it up between Masphath
and Sen, calling the place, The Rock of Deliverance, in token that the
Lord was still their protector.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So cowed were the spirits of the Philistines, that they never
crossed the frontiers of Israel again; the Lord kept the Philistines in
check as long as Samuel lived.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` They must give back, too, all the cities they had wrested from
Israel, right up to Accaron and Geth; thus the Israelites freed their
territory from the Philistines’ power, and enjoyed peace with their
neighbours.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` To Samuel men came for judgement all his life long;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` year by year he would go round from Bethel to Galgala, from Galgala
to Masphath, holding assize in each of these cities,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` and so returning to his home at Ramatha; there, too, he sat in
judgement, and there he raised an altar to the Lord.
