"1" = ''':sup:`1` In his old age, Samuel appointed his sons to perform the judge’s
office in Israel;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` the elder was called Joel, and the younger Abia, and they held
assize at Bersabee.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But these sons of his did not follow in his footsteps; greed bent
them to take bribes, and to pervert justice.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So all the elders of Israel met Samuel at Ramatha;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thou hast grown old, they said to him, and thy sons do not follow in
thy footsteps. Give us a king, such as other nations have, to sit in
judgement over us.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` It was little to Samuel’s mind, this demand for a king to be their
judge; but when he betook himself to the Lord in prayer,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` the Lord said to him, Grant the people all they ask of thee. It is
my rule over them they are casting off, not thine.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` It has ever been the same, since the day when I rescued them from
Egypt; me they will ever be forsaking, to worship other gods; and now
it is thy turn.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Grant their request, but put thy protest on record; tell them what
rights their king will claim, when they have a king to rule over them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` In answer, then, to their request for a king, Samuel told the
people all the Lord had said to him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When you have a king to reign over you, he will claim the rights of
a king. He will take away your sons from you, to drive his chariots; he
will need horsemen, and outriders for his teams;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` regiments, too, with commanders and captains to marshal them,
ploughmen and reapers, armourers and wheelwrights.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is your daughters that will make his perfumes, and cook for him,
and bake for him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` All the best of your lands and vineyards and olive-yards he will
take away, and entrust to his own bailiffs;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and he will tithe the revenues of such crop and vintage as is left
you, to pay his own courtiers and his own retinue.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He will take away servants and handmaids of yours, all the lustiest
of the young men, all the asses that work for you, to work for him
instead;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` of your herds, too, he will take tithe. You will be his slaves;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and when you cry out for redress against the king you have chosen
for yourselves, the Lord will not listen to you; you asked for a king.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But Samuel could not gain the ear of the people; That will not
serve, they cried out; a king, we must have a king!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` We must be like other nations, with a king to decide our quarrels,
to lead us and be our champion in battle.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` So he listened to all this outcry of theirs, and brought it to the
Lord’s hearing.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Give them their will, the Lord answered; appoint a king to rule
over them. And Samuel bade the Israelites disperse, and go back to
their homes.

8:4-6 - The elders of Israel demand a king, rejecting God's direct
leadership and seeking a human ruler like the surrounding nations. This
desire for conformity to the Gentiles reflects a lack of trust in the
8:7-9 - God warns Samuel that the request for a king is actually a
rejection of Him as King. The search for human authority rather than
divine authority reflects the human tendency to rely on our own methods
8:10-18 - Samuel warns the people about the costs of having a king,
including the imposition of servitude and tribute. This prophecy shows
the consequences of choosing human rule over dependence on God (see
also Deuteronomy 28:36 and 1 Kings 12:11).
8:19-22 - Despite Samuel's warnings, the people insist on having a
