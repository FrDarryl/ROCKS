'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` In the first year of king Cyrus a royal decree was made about the

river, and Stharbuzanai, and the Apharsachites beyond the river, their
associates, should cease interfering with the Jews;

their temple-building, so that this house of God may be re-established

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And to the intent that these elders of the Jews may be able to
continue the said building without intermission, my will is that moneys
should be paid to them with all diligence out of the royal chest, and

be given them daily, without fail.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And may the God, who has made Jerusalem the shrine of his name,
destroy every kingdom and people which attempts to injure or destroy

this decree, and will have it carried out with all diligence.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Carry it out they did, and diligently, both Thathanai and
Stharbuzanai and all their partisans.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` As for the elders of the Jews, they built on, and all went
favourably; true prophets were Aggaeus and Zacharias son of Addo;
higher and higher the fabric rose, with the God of Israel for its
speed, with Cyrus for its speed, and Darius, (and Artaxerxes), kings of
Persia.

exiles, as they consecrated God’s house together.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The offerings they made at the dedication were a hundred calves,
two hundred rams, and four hundred lambs; besides twelve goats to atone
for the faults of all Israel, one for each of Israel’s tribes.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Row upon row the priests stood, turn and turn about the Levites
ministered, as the law of Moses bade them, doing the Lord’s errand
there at Jerusalem.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Afterwards, on the fourteenth day of the first month, Israel’s
sons, returned from captivity, kept the paschal feast.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` All the priests had rid themselves of defilement, and so had the

the returned exiles, and for their brethren the priests, and for
themselves besides.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` So the Israelites who had come back from Babylon ate the pasch; and
with them those others who had remained in the country, and been
defiled by contact with its inhabitants; now they united with their
brethren in having recourse to the Lord, the God of Israel.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And all through the week following they kept the feast of
unleavened bread, glad at heart. Glad indeed the Lord had made them,
Assyria’s king✻ no more their enemy, their task so lightened for them
in building a house for the Lord God of Israel.
