"1" = ''':sup:`1` Once, Saul gave the word to Jonathan and to all his servants that
they must put David to death. But Saul’s son Jonathan, who loved David
well,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` told him of the design; My father Saul, he said, means thy death; be
on the watch tomorrow, keep apart, and hide thyself.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Out in the open fields, close to thy hiding-place, I will stand
talking to my father and will speak to him of thee; and afterwards I
will tell thee what I have learned.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Jonathan pleaded David’s cause with his father Saul; Do no wrong
he said, to thy servant David, that has done thee no wrong, but is much
thy benefactor.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Did he not put his life in peril, that day when he slew the
Philistine, and the Lord gave the whole army of Israel a great victory?
Thou wast there to see it, and rejoice at it; and wilt thou bring on
thyself the guilt of blood wrongfully shed, by slaying David, who is
innocent of fault?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Saul listened to the plea of Jonathan, and relented; As the Lord is
a living God, said he, no harm shall befall him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So Jonathan called to David, and told him all that had passed; then
he brought him back into Saul’s presence, where he remained as he had
been ever wont.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when war broke out afresh, David went into battle against the
Philistines, and won a great victory, putting them to rout.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` One day, Saul was sitting in his house, lance in hand, with the evil
spirit upon him, divinely sent; and David was playing the harp before
him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He tried to pin David to the wall, and David escaped from his
presence, while the lance stuck in the wall, baulked of its aim. That
night, David fled for his life;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Saul had sent armed men to his house to make sure of him, for on
the morrow he must die. But Michol, David’s wife, warned him that death
awaited him next day if he did not escape then and there,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and let him down from a window. So David made good his escape that
night;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` meanwhile, Michol brought out a sacred image and laid it in his
bed, with goat’s hair at its head, and coverlets wrapped about it;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` when Saul’s pursuivants came to fetch David, they were told that he
lay sick.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But now they were sent back again to find David and bring him with
them, bed and all, to die in Saul’s presence;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` so they found, when they came in, an image lying on the bed, with
goat’s hair at the head of it.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` What is this trick thou hast played on me, Saul asked, helping my
enemy to escape? Why, answered Michol, he threatened to kill me if I
did not let him go.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So David reached safety, and went to Ramatha to find Samuel, and
tell him of Saul’s doings; and they retired, both of them, to live at
the Naioth.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Saul, when he heard from common report that David was there at
Ramatha, in the Naioth,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` sent pursuivants there to seize him. But all they found was a
company of prophets standing there in ecstasy, with Samuel, their
leader, at their head; and with that, the spirit of the Lord fell on
the pursuivants, and they were carried away in ecstasy like the rest.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Saul heard the news, and sent fresh messengers, these too fell
into ecstasy, and the like happened when he sent a third time; so, in
high displeasure,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Saul took the road for Ramatha himself. When he reached the Great
Well at Socho, he asked where Samuel and David were, and was told they
were at the Naioth in Ramatha,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` so to the Naioth in Ramatha he went; and on him, too, the spirit of
the Lord fell as he journeyed. Still in ecstasy he made his way to the
Naioth in Ramatha,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` where he stripped off his garments and stood before Samuel in
ecstasy with the rest; all that day and that night he lay on the ground
naked. And so the proverb went abroad, Has Saul, too, turned prophet?

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
19:1-7 - Jonathan intercedes for David, convincing Saul not to kill
him. Jonathan's loyalty, even before his father, is an example of true
friendship and fidelity to God's plan. This relationship illustrates
how God can use human alliances to protect His servants (see also
19:8-10 - Despite his promise to Jonathan, Saul again tries to kill
David. Saul's continued pursuit reveals the depth of his rebellion and
the growing paranoia that consumes him. David, however, continues to
22:1).
19:11-12 - Michal helps David escape Saul's assassination attempt. She
deceives the king's messengers, demonstrating that God can use even
those close to the enemy to protect his chosen ones (see also
19:18-20 - David flees to Ramah and takes refuge with the prophet
Samuel. Samuel's protection symbolizes God's prophetic intervention in
David's life, highlighting the role of prophets as guardians of the
divine covenant (see also 1 Kings 19:9-10 and 2 Kings 6:8-12).
19:21-24 - When Saul attempts to capture David, God's Spirit causes him
and his messengers to prophesy, thwarting their evil plans. This shows
that God can disarm even the greatest enemies and use situations to
4:28-30).
