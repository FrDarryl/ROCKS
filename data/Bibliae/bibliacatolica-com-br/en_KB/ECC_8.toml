"1" = ''':sup:`1` When a man is given wisdom, it shines out in his face; Omnipotence
will set a new stamp on his brow.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Mine to do a king’s bidding, to hold fast by an oath taken in the
name of God.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Do not hasten away from his presence, or rebelliously withstand him;
he can do all he will,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` with such authority his word runs; none may call his acts in
question.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Do as thou art bidden, and fear no harm. A time will come, the wise
man knows, when he shall win a hearing;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` time brings every man his chance, be his business what it may, only
this curse lies upon man,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` that he cannot learn from the past, cannot get word of the future.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The breath of life man must resign at last; the day of his death he
cannot determine; nor ever does war give release from service, nor sin
discharge to the sinner.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` This, too, I have marked, as I gave heed to all that befalls us,
here beneath the sun. There are times when man rules over man to his
undoing.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I have seen godless men go peacefully to the grave, that had lived
their lives out in haunts of holiness, and won the name of good men
from their fellow citizens; here, too, is frustration.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Because sentence is not pronounced upon the evil-doers without more
ado, men are emboldened to live sinfully.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And yet, though the sinner presume on the divine patience that has
borne with a hundred misdeeds, I know well enough that blessings are
for those who fear God, who fear his frown.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Never a blessing for sinners; never be it said they lived out their
full span of days! Reckless of God’s frown, see, they pass like a
shadow, and are gone!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Another kind of frustration, too, earth sees; there are upright men
that are plagued as though they lived the life sinners live, just as
there are sinners who take no more harm than if they could plead
innocence; I say this is frustration indeed.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For me, then, mirth! No higher blessing could man attain, here
under the sun, than to eat and drink and make merry; nothing else had
he to show for all those labours of his, for all that life-time God has
given him, here under the sun.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Should I cudgel my wits to grow wise, and know the meaning of all
earth’s tasks; be like the men that allow their eyes no sleep, day or
night?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Nay, I understood too well that God’s dealings with man, here under
the sun, are past all accounting for; the more a man labours to read
that riddle, the less he finds out, and he least of all, that boasts
himself wise in the reading of it.
