"3" = ''':sup:`3` His anger thus provoked, the Lord left Israel at the mercy of
Hazael, king of Syria, and his son Benadad, without respite;

"4" = ''':sup:`4` till at last Joachaz besought the Lord’s favour. (This prayer the

upon them;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` and he gave them a champion to set them free from the Syrian yoke.
Then once more the men of Israel could dwell in their old homes;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but even so they did not forgo the sins of Jeroboam, son of Nabat,
that taught Israel to sin; they clung to them still, and still the
forest-shrine had its place in Samaria.✻ )
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` In the time of Joachaz, nothing was left of the army but fifty
horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot-soldiers; such havoc the
king of Syria had made among them, sweeping them away like chaff on the
threshing-floor.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` What else Joachaz did, all his history, and the record of his great
deeds, is to be found in the Annals of the kings of Israel.

thirty-seventh year of Joas king of Juda; and his reign in Samaria

'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He defied the Lord’s will, and would not abandon the sins of

Annals of the kings of Israel.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He was laid to rest with his fathers, and the throne passed to his
son Jeroboam. (Joas was buried in Samaria, with the other Israelite

'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And now Eliseus lay sick in his mortal illness, and Joas, who was
then king of Israel, went to visit him; My father, my father, he said
weeping, Israel’s chariot and charioteer!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Eliseus bade him fetch bow and arrows, and when bow and arrows were
brought,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` he would have the king of Israel hold the bow in readiness. The bow
was stretched, and Eliseus put his own hands over the king’s hands;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now, said he, open the window that looks east, and he opened it;
Shoot, and he shot. Yonder shaft, Eliseus told him, betokens the divine

defeat the Syrians utterly, there at Aphec.

ravaged by freebooters from Moab.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Some of these appearing suddenly when a dead man was being carried
out to his funeral, the bearers took fright, and threw the corpse into

had it touched the prophet’s bones, than the dead man came to life
again, and rose to his feet.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` All through the life-time of Joachaz, king Hazael of Syria had
pressed Israel hard;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` but now the Lord relented and came to their aid once more. Faithful
to his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, he would not make an end
of them and cast them off utterly as yet.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So, when Hazael died, and his son Benadad succeeded him as king of

Notas de rodapé:
13:1-3 - Jehoahaz begins to reign over Israel, but he does what is evil
in the eyes of the Lord. Because of his idolatry, God allows Israel to
be oppressed by Hazael, king of Syria. This reflects God's justice in
13:4-6 - Jehoahaz seeks the Lord in his distress, and God sends a
deliverer to Israel. Even in the midst of idolatry, God shows mercy
107:19-20).
13:7-9 - Israel is severely weakened by its enemies, and the army is
reduced to a few troops. This weakening reflects the consequences of
rebellion against God and dependence on Him for victory (see also
Deuteronomy 28:25 and 2 Kings 17:20).
13:10-13 - Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, begins to reign in Israel.
Although he continues in the ways of his predecessors, doing what is
evil in the sight of the Lord, his history shows the continuing cycle
of sin and judgment in Israel (see also 1 Kings 16:2-3 and 2 Kings
14:24).
13:14-19 - The prophet Elisha, on his deathbed, prophesies Jehoash's
victory over the Syrians, but rebukes him for his lack of zeal. This
episode highlights the importance of faith and complete obedience in
4:17).
