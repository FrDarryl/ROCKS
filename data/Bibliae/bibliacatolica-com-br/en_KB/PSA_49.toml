Notas de rodapé:
49:1-4 - The psalmist calls all nations to listen to the wisdom and
teachings that come from God. This highlights the universality of God's
message and the importance of wisdom for human life (see also
49:5-9 - The fear of death and the futility of wealth are central
themes, showing that no man can redeem his life or buy salvation. The
psalmist emphasizes that true security is not found in material

49:21:00 - The psalmist's wisdom is addressed to the foolish who
believe their riches will save them. He warns that true understanding
comes from recognizing human frailty in the face of eternity (see also
