"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a famine in David’s reign that lasted three years
continuously; and when David consulted the Lord’s oracle he was told,
It is because of Saul; he slew the Gabaonites, and the guilt of blood
still rests upon his line.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The Gabaonites did not belong to Israel; they were of the old
Amorrhite stock, and their lives had been spared in fulfilment of an
oath, but Saul, jealous for the honour of Israel and of Juda, had tried
to exterminate them. So king David summoned them,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and asked what he could do to content them; what amends he could
make, to recover their good will for the Lord’s chosen people.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Of silver and gold, the Gabaonites told him, there is no question
here; our quarrel is with Saul and his kin; we would not take any toll
of Israelite lives. What would you have me do, then? the king asked.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And they said, We must efface the memory of the man who persecuted
us and wrongfully oppressed us, leaving none of his stock alive from
end to end of Israel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Hand over to us seven men of his line, and let us crucify them
before the Lord at Gabaa, that is named after him; there dwelt he when
the Lord chose him out to be king.✻ And David said, You shall have
them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But he spared Miphiboseth, the heir of Saul through Jonathan, to
honour the covenant which Jonathan, Saul’s son, had made with him;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he took two sons that were born to Saul by Respha, daughter of Aia,
one called Armoni and one that bore his cousin’s name of Miphiboseth,
and five sons of Michol, Saul’s daughter, that she bore to Hadriel, son
of Berzellai, at Molathi,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and handed these over to the Gabaonites. And the Gabaonites
crucified them before the Lord, there on the hillside. It was in the
first days of the harvest, when the barley was beginning to be cut,
that the seven of them perished, all at one time;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and Respha, the daughter of Aia, spread herself a covering of
sackcloth and sat there on the rock, from the beginning of harvest till
the first rains fell on them; bird by day nor beast by night should
touch them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The news of what Saul’s concubine, Respha the daughter of Aia, had
done, reached David’s ears.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And thereupon he recovered the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan
from the men of Jabes-Galaad, who had stolen them back when the
Philistines hung them up in the streets of Bethsan, soon after Saul’s
death on Gelboe;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` carried these away, and collected the bones, too, of the men
crucified at Gabaa,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and buried them. So they were laid in the tomb of Cis, that was
Saul’s father, in the Benjamite country, beside the bones of Saul and
his son Jonathan; all this was done at the king’s command. And now the
land was restored to God’s favour.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` War broke out again between Israel and the Philistines, and David
went to battle against them with his men. But David’s strength had left
him;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and he came near to being struck down by Jesbi-Benob, a man of the
Araphite breed, that had a spear-head of ten pounds weight, and a new
sword at his side.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It was Abisai, Sarvia’s son, that came to the king’s rescue, and
gave the Philistine his death-blow. But after that David’s men swore
that he should never go into battle with them again; that light must
not be lost to Israel.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` In another battle against the Philistines, at Gob, Saph, of the
giant breed of Arapha, was slain by Sobochai, from Husathi;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` in a third, also at Gob, Elehanan the son of Jaare, an embroiderer
from Bethlehem, slew Goliath of Geth, that had a shaft to his spear as
big as a weaver’s beam.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` In a fourth, at Geth, there was a man of huge stature that had
twelve fingers and twelve toes, another of the Araphite breed;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and he taunted Israel, till Jonathan, son of David’s brother Semma,
struck him down.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` All these four were Araphites from Geth, all slain by David and his
men.
