"2" = ''':sup:`2` A man cannot hope to implead God, even a man of perfect wisdom.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Just though thou be, how is God the better for knowing thou art

Notas de rodapé:
22:1-5 - Eliphaz responds to Job, asserting that his suffering must be
a consequence of his sins. This approach reflects retributive theology,
which seeks to link suffering to punishment without considering the
18:30).
22:6-9 - Eliphaz accuses Job of being greedy and oppressive, suggesting
that his misery is a result of his own actions. This accusation
reflects a superficial understanding of God's justice and ignores the
2:13).
22:10-11 - Eliphaz mentions that Job is surrounded by snares,
reinforcing the idea that he is under divine judgment. This view limits
our understanding of God's action and ignores His love and mercy (see
22:12-14 - Eliphaz speaks of God's greatness, emphasizing that He is
omnipresent and omniscient. This statement reinforces the idea that Job
cannot escape divine judgment, but it also highlights God's majesty and
22:15-20 - Eliphaz invites Job to turn to God in repentance, implying
that restoration depends on his attitude. This approach downplays God's
grace and the complexity of the relationship between sin, repentance,
