[22]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` And this was David’s song of thanksgiving when he found that the
Lord had rescued him from the power of Saul, and from his other
enemies:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The Lord is my rock-fastness, my bulwark, my rescuer.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It is my God that brings me aid, and gives me confidence; he is my
shield, my weapon of deliverance, my protector, my stronghold; he it is
that preserves me and frees me from wrong.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Praised be the Lord! When I invoke him I am secure from my enemies.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Death’s terrors were near at hand, deep flowed the tide of
wickedness, to daunt me;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` the toils of the grave were all about me, deadly snares had trapped
my feet.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` One cry to the Lord, in my affliction, one word of summons to my
God, and he, from his sanctuary, listens to my voice; the complaint I
make before him finds a hearing.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Earth shivered and shook, the very foundations of the hills quailed
and quaked before his anger;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` smoke went up before his indignant presence, and a consuming fire;
burning coals were kindled as he went.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He bade heaven stoop, and came down to earth, with mist at his
feet;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` he came, mounted on the cherubim, borne up on the wings of the
wind,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` shrouded in a pall of darkness, wringing out the rainstorm from the
clouds of heaven;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` burning coals were kindled by the lightning that went before him;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` the Lord, sending his thunder from heaven, the Most High, letting
his voice be heard.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` How they scattered when he rained down his arrows on them, fled in
confusion before his lightning!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The secret springs of ocean came to light, the very foundations of
the world were laid bare, when the Lord threatened them, blew upon them
with the breath of his anger.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then he reached down from heaven, caught hold of me,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` rescued me from that flood, saved me from triumphant malice, from
the enemies that held me at their mercy.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` In that evil day he came to my side; the Lord upheld me
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and brought me out into freedom again; his great love befriended
me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And still as he sees me dutiful, the Lord will requite me; as he
sees me guiltless in act, he will make return.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Have I not kept true to the Lord’s paths? Have I not been loyal to
my God?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` No law of his, but I have kept it before my eyes; no task he laid
upon me have I refused;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` ever stainless in his presence, ever watchful to keep myself clear
of guilt.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Surely the Lord will requite me as he sees me dutiful, as he sees
me guiltless in act.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Lovingly thou dost treat those who love thee, faithfully the
courageous;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` he that is thy own shall find thee his very own, from the man who
turns against thee thou wilt turn away.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` To humble folk thou wilt bring deliverance; the proud, with their
haughty looks, thou wilt bring down to earth.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Thou, Lord, art the lamp of my hope; thou, Lord, dost shine on the
darkness about me.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` In thy strength I shall run well girded; in the strength of my God
I will leap over a wall.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Such is my God, unsullied in his dealings; his promises are like
metal tried in the fire; he is the sure defence of all who trust in
him.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Who but the Lord is God? What other power can there be except our
God?
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` It is he that girds me with strength, he that makes me go on a
smooth way, untroubled.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` He makes me sure-footed as the deer, and gives me the freedom of
the hills;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` these hands, through him, are skilled in battle, these arms are a
match for any bow of bronze.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Thy saving power, Lord, is my defence, thy tender care fosters me.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Through thee, my steps are untrammelled as I go, foot of mine never
falters;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` I can master the enemies I pursue, and never turn home till I have
made an end of them;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` made an end of them, beating them to their knees, hurling them down
at my feet.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Thou girdest me about with a warrior’s strength; whatever power
challenges me thou dost subdue before me,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` putting my enemies to flight, and throwing all their malice into
confusion.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Loudly they cry out to the Lord, bereft of aid, but he makes no
answer to their cries.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` I can crush them to pieces, like dust on the ground, spurn and
trample them like mire in the streets.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Thou wilt deliver me, then, from sedition among my people; nay,
thou hast a higher destiny for me yet, to rule over other nations, with
alien folk for my subjects.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Aliens offering battle, and then brought to my allegiance,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` so feeble have they grown, so hard pinched by distress!
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Blessed be the living Lord who is my God, praised be the God who
rescues me!
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` It is thou, my God, that bringest me redress, that grantest me
dominion over my people,
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` that savest me from my enemies, so that I am high above the reach
of their assaults, proof against their violence.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Then, Lord, I will give thee thanks in the hearing of all nations,
singing in praise of thy name;
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` how powerful thou art to protect the king thou hast chosen, how
merciful thou art towards him thou hast anointed, towards David, and
David’s line for ever.✻
