"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now, for the first time since Israel’s home-coming, it was the
seventh month of the year; the people, with one consent, had gathered
at Jerusalem.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Josue son of Josedec and his brother priests, Zorobabel son of
Salathiel and his brother chiefs, must bestir themselves; the God of
Israel must have an altar built for him, if the law given by his
servant Moses was to be obeyed, by the offering of burnt-sacrifice.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` No more they dared to do, with hostile nations threatening them all
around, than erect God’s altar on its ruined base;✻ here, morning and
evening, burnt-sacrifice was offered,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and with that daily offering, with the due observance of each day as
it came, they held the feast of Tent-dwelling.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` After that, burnt-sacrifice went on uninterruptedly, on the feast
days set apart for the Lord, and on other days, too, when gifts were
brought to the Lord out of devotion.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` From the first day of this seventh month onwards the offering of
burnt-sacrifice to the Lord began; and still they had not laid the very
foundations of God’s temple.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` But meanwhile, money was being spent on quarrymen and stone-masons;
on food, too, and drink, and oil for the men of Tyre and Sidon, who
must convey cedar planks from Lebanon by sea to Joppe, in pursuance of
the Persian king’s decree.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And in the second month of the second year after their return to
God’s temple at Jerusalem, Zorobabel and Josue with their brethren,
priests and Levites and citizens returned from exile, began their task.
Levites that were above the age of twenty were appointed to hasten on
the execution of the divine command,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and at the head of these Levites, clansmen of Henadad’s clan, were
Josue’s clan and Cedmihel’s (and the men of Juda), insisting that they
should give the temple workmen no rest.✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So at last the masons laid the foundation of the Lord’s temple.
There stood the priests in full array with their trumpets; there stood
the Levites, come down from Asaph, with their cymbals, ready to praise
God as David bade them, that long ago was king of all Israel.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And as their hymn of praise went up to the Lord, The Lord is
gracious, his mercy to Israel endures for ever, the whole people raised
a great shout, thanking the Lord that now the foundation of his temple
was laid.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Among the priests and Levites and chiefs of clans there were many
older men who had seen the earlier temple when it stood built there. In
their eyes, that was the Temple,✻ and they cried aloud in lament, while
these others shouted and huzza’d for joy.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Shouts of folk rejoicing, and cries of folk lamenting, none could
tell them apart; it was all a confused uproar of men’s voices, that
echoed far away.

Notas de rodapé:
3:1-2 - Jeshua, the high priest, and Zerubbabel begin rebuilding God's

rubble of Jerusalem. The observance of the feasts reflects the people's
faithfulness in honoring God's ordinances despite hardships (see also

celebrate with praise to God, singing, "For He is good; His love for
Israel endures forever." Music and worship express gratitude for the

comparing them to Solomon's ancient Temple. This mixture of joy and
sadness reflects the complexity of restoration, where not all aspects
