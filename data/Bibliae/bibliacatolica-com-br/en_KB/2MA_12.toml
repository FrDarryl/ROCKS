"1" = ''':sup:`1` So all was agreed upon; Lysias was for the court again, and the
Jewish folk went back to their farms.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But neither rest nor respite might they have while Timotheus✻ and
Apollonius, son of Gennaeus, were left at their posts; Hieronymus, too,
and Demophon, and Nicanor that ruled in Cyprus.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This was a very foul deed done by the men of Joppe; they fitted out
certain vessels of theirs, and would have the neighbouring Jews go
aboard, with their wives and children, for all the world as if there
were no grudge between them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` It was the common wish of their fellow-citizens; how should the Jews
gainsay it? They were lovers of peace, and cause for suspicion had
none. Yet once they were on the high seas, they were cast overboard and
drowned, a full two hundred of them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Such tidings of cruel murder done upon men of his own race, Judas
could not hear unmoved; mustering his followers, and calling upon God,
that judges aright, to speed him,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` he marched out against the slayers of his brethren; at dead of night
he burned down their wharves, and set all the ships ablaze, nor any man
that escaped the fire but was put to the sword.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` This done, he left them, but threatening he would return, and leave
none alive in Joppe.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He had word, too, that the men of Jamnia meant to do the same by the
Jews in their part;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` so he fell on Jamnia, too, by night, and burnt both wharves and
ships there; the light of that blaze was seen at Jerusalem, thirty
miles off. …
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Nine furlongs they had marched, on their way to meet Timotheus,
when an Arab force engaged them, of five thousand foot and five hundred
horse.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Stern was the encounter, but with God’s help they won the day; and
the defeated remnant of the Arabs asked Judas for quarter, promising a
grant of pasture-lands, with other advantages.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And, beyond doubt, they could be many ways serviceable to him; so
he made terms with them. They swore friendship, and the Arabs went back
to their tents.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` A city there was called Casphin, moated and walled about for its
defence, and held by a rabble of many races; this, too, Judas attacked.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Such trust the defenders had in the strength of their ramparts, and
their plentiful supplies of food, they carried themselves recklessly,
hurling taunts at Judas, with blasphemies and other talk little fit to
be uttered.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But Machabaeus to that King made appeal, who needed neither engine
nor battering-ram, in Josue’s day, to bring Jericho down in ruins; a
fierce attack he delivered upon the walls,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and, so God willed, became master of the city. The slaughter in it
was past reckoning; there was a pool hard by, of two furlongs’ breadth,
that seemed as if it ran in full tide with the blood of slain men.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It needed a march of ninety-five miles to bring them to Charax,
where the Jews were whom they call Tubianaeans.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Yet could they not come up with Timotheus; he had retired, with
nothing achieved, leaving a strong garrison in one of the forts there;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` which garrison of his, ten thousand strong, was destroyed by two of
Machabaeus’ captains, Dositheus and Sosipater.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Machabaeus himself, with six thousand men at his heels, divided
into companies, pressed on against Timotheus, that had a hundred and
twenty thousand foot, and two thousand five hundred horse, under his
command.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` At the news of Judas’ coming, Timotheus was fain to send on women,
children, and stores, to Carnion, an impregnable fortress and one
difficult of approach, so narrow the pass was.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And now the first of Judas’ companies came in sight, and with it
the presence of the all-seeing God.✻ What fear fell upon the enemy, how
they scattered in flight, stumbling over their own fellows, wounded by
the point of their own swords!
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And all the while Judas pressed them hard, the scourge of
ill-doers; thirty thousand of them that day he slaughtered.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As for Timotheus, he fell into the hands of another force, under
Dositheus and Sosipater; of these he begged earnestly for his life,
telling them of Jewish hostages in his keeping, their own fathers and
brothers, that would get no quarter if he came by his death.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Many were the pledges he gave, covenanting for the restoration of
these hostages, and at last, for love of their brethren, they let him
go free.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Judas went on to Carnion, where the enemy lost twenty-five thousand
men,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` routed and slain; thence to Ephron, a fortified city, where stout
warriors of many different breeds manned the walls most valiantly, well
provided with engines and weapons.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Yet strength is none can hold its own against the Omnipotent; to
him the Jews made appeal, and so took the city, killing twenty-five
thousand of the defenders.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And thence to Scythopolis, at seventy-five miles’ distance from
Jerusalem;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` but here the Jews themselves bore witness, how kindly their
neighbours used them, and how honourably they carried themselves even
in troublous times.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Thanking all such, and desiring them they would continue their good
offices towards the Jewish folk, the army returned to Jerusalem, to
keep the festival of the Weeks.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then, after Pentecost, they marched away to meet Gorgias, that was
in command of Idumaea;✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` it was but a muster of three thousand foot and four hundred horse.✻
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Battle was joined, and some few Jews fell.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` As for Gorgias, one Dositheus, a great warrior that was in
Bacenor’s company of horse, kept close on his heels and would have
taken him alive; but one of the Thracian horsemen fell upon him and cut
off his arm at the shoulder, so Gorgias escaped safe to Maresa.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` A long fight Esdrin’s company had of it, and were full weary, when
Judas called upon the Lord to succour them and lead them onwards,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` battle-hymn and battle-cry raising in his own language; and so he
put Gorgias’ army to the rout.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And now, recalling his men from the pursuit, he made his way to the
city of Adollam; the week had gone round, and here, duly cleansed from
defilement, they kept the sabbath.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Next day, with Judas at their head, they went back to recover the
bodies of the slain, for burial among their own folk in their fathers’
graves;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` and what found they? Each of the fallen was wearing, under his
shirt, some token carried away from the false gods of Jamnia. Here was
defiance of the Jewish law, and none doubted it was the cause of their
undoing;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` none but praised the Lord for his just retribution, that had
brought hidden things to light;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and so they fell to prayer, pleading that the sin might go
unremembered. Judas himself, their gallant commander, gave public
warning to his men, of fault they should evermore keep clear, with the
fate of these transgressors under their eyes.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Then he would have contribution made; a sum of twelve thousand
silver pieces he levied, and sent it to Jerusalem, to have sacrifice
made there for the guilt of their dead companions. Was not this well
done and piously? Here was a man kept the resurrection ever in mind;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` he had done fondly and foolishly indeed, to pray for the dead, if
these might rise no more, that once were fallen!
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And these had made a godly end; could he doubt, a rich recompense
awaited them?
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` A holy and wholesome thought it is to pray for the dead, for their
guilt’s undoing.
