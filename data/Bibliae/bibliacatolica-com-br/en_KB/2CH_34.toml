"1" = ''':sup:`1` Josias was eight years old when he came to the throne, and his reign
at Jerusalem lasted thirty-one years;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` he was obedient to the Lord’s will, and followed the example of his
ancestor, king David, never swerving to right or left.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It was while he was still a boy, in the eighth year of his reign,
that he betook himself to the God his father David worshipped; and in
the twelfth year of his reign he rid Juda and Jerusalem of hill-shrine
and forest shrine, carved image and molten image.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` All the altars of the countryside gods must be destroyed in his
presence; sacred trees and statues he cut down everywhere and broke in
pieces, which he scattered on the tombs of their worshippers;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and on the altars that were raised to false gods he burned the bones
of their own priests, till Juda and Jerusalem were defiled no more.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then he must carry out the same work of destruction in the cities of
Manasses, Ephraim and Simeon, and all the way to Nephthali;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` altars were thrown down, images crushed to pieces, and shrines
demolished, all over the land of Israel; and so he returned to
Jerusalem.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then, in the eighteenth year of his reign, the land and the temple
now purged, he commissioned Saphan, son of Eselias, and Maasias that
was governor of the city, and Joha son of Joachaz, that kept the
records, to see that the house of the Lord their God was put in repair.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So they made their way to the high priest, Helcias, who handed over
to them the offerings collected by Levites and door-keepers for the
temple fabric; offerings from Manasses and Ephraim and all the rest of
Israel, as well as Juda, Benjamin and Jerusalem.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` These they paid out to the overseers of the Lord’s house, bidding
them restore it and put it in repair.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And they, in their turn, gave it to the craftsmen and masons, that
must buy stone from the quarries; wood, too, for joiner’s work, and for
roofing the buildings which earlier kings had left in ruins.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` All this was faithfully carried out; the work was hastened on by
these overseers, the Merarites Jahath and Abdias, the Caathites
Zacharias and Masollam, Levites all and musicians;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` the workmen that did but carry burdens at need were under the
command of the secretaries and the chief door-keepers.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It was just when they came to take away the temple offerings that
Helcias found a copy of the law which the Lord gave through Moses;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and he told Saphan, the secretary, how he had found, there in the
temple, a copy of the law, which he gave him to read.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Saphan took the book with him when he went to the king to report
that the commission had been faithfully executed.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They have collected all the money, said he, that was there in the
temple, and paid it out through the overseers to craftsmen and to
masons.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And here is a book the high priest, Helcias, has given me.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This book, then, Saphan read out in the royal presence; and the
king, upon hearing the terms of the law, rent his garments about him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then he gave orders to Helcias, and Ahicam son of Saphan, and Abdon
son of Micha, and Asaas, one of his courtiers;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Go and consult the Lord,✻ he told them, for me and all that is left
of Israel and Juda, about this new-found copy of the law. What wonder
if the Lord should rain down vengeance on us, a race that has left his
warnings unheeded, his bidding undone?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Helcias and his companions went on the king’s errand to the
prophetess Olda. She was wife to Sellum, son of Thecuath, son of Hasra,
that once kept the royal wardrobe; her dwelling was at Jerusalem, in
the new part of the city. So they told her their business,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and she, in return, gave them this message from the Lord God of
Israel for the man that sent them;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thus says the Lord, For this city and its citizens I have
punishments in store, all the punishments threatened in yonder book
which has been read out to the king of Juda.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The men of Juda have forsaken me, and offered sacrifice to alien
gods; all they do is done in defiance of me; the fire of my vengeance
must needs rain down on this city, and there is no quenching it.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But to the king of Juda, who sent you here to consult the Lord,
give this message from the Lord God of Israel: Well for thee thou didst
listen to the warnings this book gave thee!
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Well for thee that thy heart failed thee, and thou didst humble
thyself before God, at hearing him threaten city and citizens with
doom; that thou didst make amends, by tearing thy garments about thee,
and hadst recourse to me with tears.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And thou hast won my audience, the Lord says; I will lay thee to
rest with thy fathers, in quiet times thou shalt go to thy grave. Not
for thy eyes the great calamities I mean to bring on city and citizens
of thine.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` When they brought the king his answer, he summoned all the elders
of Juda and Jerusalem;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` then he went up to the Lord’s temple, and all the men of Juda bore
him company, all the citizens of Jerusalem, priest and Levite and
common folk high and low. There, in their hearing, he read the whole
book out to them.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Standing on the dais, he made a promise, there in the Lord’s
presence; they would make the Lord their leader, holding fast by
command and decree and observance of his, heart and soul, obeying all
the terms of the law they had listened to.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And he bound them by an oath, all the men of Jerusalem and of
Benjamin. This pact with the Lord God of their fathers was kept
loyally.✻
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So Josias swept away from the whole realm of Israel all detestable
worship, and made the remnant that were left in Israel obey the Lord
their God. Never again did they forsake the Lord, their fathers’ God,
while Josias’ life lasted.

Notas de rodapé:
34:1-3 - Josiah began his reign at only eight years old, and at sixteen

Israel reflects a search for true spiritual restoration in Judah, even
6:33).
34:4-7 - Josiah destroys the altars and idols of false gods, cleansing
the territory of Judah and Israel of idolatrous practices. This
purification reflects the importance of turning away from idolatry to
10:14).
34:8-13 - The restoration of the Lord's Temple symbolizes Josiah's
efforts to restore true worship. The care of the temple reflects the
importance of reverence for God's house and proper worship (see also
34:14-18 - The Book of God's Law is found in the Temple, leading Josiah
to realize the gravity of his people's spiritual situation. The
discovery of the Law highlights the importance of Scripture as a guide
Timothy 3:16).
34:19-28 - Josiah tears his clothes upon hearing the Law, a sign of
deep repentance. The prophetess Huldah confirms God's impending
judgment, but also promises mercy during Josiah's reign, showing the
