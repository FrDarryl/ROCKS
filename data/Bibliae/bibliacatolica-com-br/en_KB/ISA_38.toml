"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now Ezechias fell sick, and was at death’s door;✻ indeed, the
prophet Isaias, son of Amos, visited him with this message from the
Lord, Put thy affairs in order; it is death that awaits thee, not
recovery.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` At this Ezechias turned his face towards the wall, and prayed to the
Lord thus:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Remember, Lord, I entreat thee, a life that has kept true to thee,
an innocent heart; how I did ever what was thy will. And Ezechias wept
bitterly.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And thereupon the word of the Lord came to Isaias,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Go and tell Ezechias, Here is a message to thee from the Lord, the
God of thy father David. I have listened to thy prayer, and marked thy
tears; be it so, I will add fifteen years to thy life.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And I will save thee and thy city from the power of the Assyrian
king; I will be its protector.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` This sign, too, the Lord gives thee, in proof that he will make his
promise good;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` see how low the shadow has fallen, with sun-down, where the dial of
Achaz marks the hours! I will make it go ten hours back. And with that
the sun retraced ten hours of its descent.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` These are the words Ezechias king of Juda wrote, upon falling sick
and recovering of his illness.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It seemed as if I must go down to the gates of the world beneath,
in the noontide of my years; the remnant of life that I hoped for,
hoped for in vain.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No more (thought I) to lift up my eyes to the Lord God in this land
of the living, to see men’s faces, and quiet homes, no more!✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This familiar world✻ taken away from me, folded up like a
shepherd’s tent, my life cut short like the weaver’s thread! And he had
cut me off while the web was still in the making; before the day
reached its evening, he would make an end of me.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` All night long I lay still, as if he had been a lion that had
broken all my bones; before the day reached its evening he would make
an end of me.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` My voice was as feeble as the voice of a nestling swallow or
murmuring dove; my eyes wearied out with ever straining upwards. Lord,
I am in hard straits; win my release for me!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And yet, what words can I use, what answer can I expect, when it is
he himself that has brought this upon me? With bitter heart I pass all
my years in review.✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Lord, so frail a thing is life; on so little does my mortal breath
depend! Thou canst chastise me, thou canst make me live.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Bitter, bitter the discipline that brings me peace!And now thou
hast saved the life that was in peril, thrusting away all my sins out
of thy sight.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thou hast no praise in the world beneath, death cannot honour thee;
those who go down into the grave have no promise of thine to hope for;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` it is living men, as I am a living man to-day, that give thee
thanks, pass on from father to son the story of thy faithfulness.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Lord, be my saviour still; so, all day long, the Lord’s house shall
ring with the music of our psalms.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Note that Isaias bade them take a lump of figs, and make a plaster
of it for the king’s ulcer, and this is how he was healed.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And note that Ezechias had asked what sign should be given him, in
proof that he would set foot in the Lord’s house again.✻
