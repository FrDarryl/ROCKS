"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was after leaving Haseroth that the people encamped in the desert
of Pharan;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and here the Lord spoke to Moses,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` bidding him send out men of mark, one from each tribe, to survey
Israel’s promised inheritance, the land of Chanaan.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` This Moses did; and the names of the leading men he despatched from
the desert of Pharan were these:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Sammua son of Zechur from Ruben,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Saphat son of Huri from Simeon,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Caleb son of Jephone from Juda,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Igal son of Joseph from Issachar,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Osee son of Nun from Ephraim,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Phalti son of Raphu from Benjamin,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Geddiel son of Sodi from Zabulon,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Gaddi son of Susi from Manasses’ branch of the tribe of Joseph,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Ammiel son of Gemalli from Dan,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Sathur son of Michael from Aser,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Nahabi son of Vapsi from Nephthali,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Guel son of Machi from Gad.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Such were the names of the men Moses sent out to survey the land,
and to Osee, son of Nun, he gave the fresh name of Josue.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And these were the directions Moses gave them for their survey of
Chanaan: Make your way in by the south, and when you reach the hill
country
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` look well at the land about you. Are its inhabitants strong or
weak, many in number or few?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Is the land itself prosperous or starved, has it walled cities or
unwalled,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` fertile soil or barren, is it well wooded or bare? Take heart for
your enterprise, and bring back with you some sample of what the land
yields. (It was the season, then, at which early grapes are already fit
to eat.)
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So they surveyed the land all the way up from the desert of Sin to
Rohob, on the way to Emath.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` At the southern end of it, when they reached Hebron, they found the
sons of Enac there, Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai; Hebron had been
founded seven years before the Egyptian city of Tanis.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` They also made their way to the Ravine of Grapes and cut off a
branch with a cluster hanging from it, that needed two men with a pole
to carry it; these they brought with them, as well as some of the
pomegranates and figs that grew there.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It was from this cluster which the Israelites carried away that the
place got its name of Nehelescol, the Ravine of Grapes.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Forty days had passed before they returned from their survey, after
traversing the whole country,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` to find Moses and Aaron and all the people of Israel still in the
desert of Pharan, by Cades. To these and to the whole multitude they
made their report, and shewed them what fruit the land yielded.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And this was the story they told: When we reached the land where
our errand lay, we found it indeed a land all milk and honey, as this
fruit will prove to you;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` but it is a powerful race that dwells in it, with strong walled
cities; such were the sons of Enac, whom we saw there.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The south is occupied by Amelec, the mountain parts by Hethites,
Jebusites and Amorrhites; by the sea, and round the Jordan river, the
Chanaanites are in possession.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And now, to still the rising outcry against Moses, Caleb spurred
the people on to invade the land and conquer it; It is ready to fall
into your hands, he said.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But his companions told them, We cannot attack such a people as
this; they are too strong for us.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And they gave the Israelites an ill account of what they had seen
in Chanaan; This country we surveyed, they told them, has too many
inhabitants already.✻ Tall of frame are the men we viewed there;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` nay, some we saw, the race of Enac, of monstrous size as if they
were sprung from giants; we looked no bigger than locusts beside them.

Notas de rodapé:
13:1-3 - God commands Moses to send 12 spies to explore the land of
Canaan. This marks a time of preparation and confidence in the
fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Israel (see also
13:17-20 - Moses instructs the spies to observe the land, its people,
and its cities. This investigation anticipates the entry into Canaan
and emphasizes the importance of wisdom and strategy in fulfilling
13:25-29 - The spies return with a positive report about the land's
fertility, but they express fear because of the strong inhabitants.
This demonstrates the tension between God's promise and human fear (see
13:30-31 - Caleb encourages the people to trust God and take possession
of the land, while the other spies discourage the people, demonstrating
a lack of faith. This passage illustrates the importance of trusting
Corinthians 5:7).
13:32-33 - The spies' unbelief creates fear among the Israelites,
distorting reality with exaggerations about giants in the land. This
shows how a lack of faith can lead to despair and disobedience (see
