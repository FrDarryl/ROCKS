"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was evening when the two angels reached Sodom, and Lot was
sitting at the town gate. He rose up when he saw them, and went to meet
them, bowing down his face to the earth.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Pray, sirs, he said, turn in to my house and spend the night there;
wash your feet now, and go on your journey to-morrow. And when they
said, No, we will stay here in the open square,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he would take no denial, they must needs lodge with him. So they
went to his house, and he baked unleavened bread for them, which they
ate.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And before ever they had gone to rest, the townspeople laid siege to
the house, old and young, from every quarter of the city,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` calling for Lot, and crying out, Where are thy evening visitors?
Bring them out here, to minister to our lust.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Lot went out, shutting the door behind him, and said,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` No, brethren, I entreat you, do not be guilty of such a wrong.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I have two daughters here, that have as yet no knowledge of man;
these I will bring out, and you shall have your will with them, but do
these men no harm;✻ are they not guests under my roof?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What, said they, wouldst thou come here as a stranger, and then set
thyself up as a judge? Stand back, or it will be worse for thee than
for them. And they pushed Lot aside with great violence, trying to
break the door in.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So the two men reached out and pulled Lot back into the house,
shutting the door after him;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and they put a ban of blindness on the folk without, so that never
a man of them could find the entry.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now the two men asked Lot, Is there any here besides thyself,
son-in-law, or son, or daughter of thine? If so, take them out of the
city, all that are thine.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Our intent is to destroy this place; the ill repute of it goes from
bad to worse, and the Lord knows of it, and has sent us to destroy
them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So Lot went out, and spoke to the suitors who were betrothed to his
daughters;✻ Up, he said, leave this place; the Lord means to destroy
the city. But they thought he was speaking in jest.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then morning came, and the angels were urgent with him; Up, they
said, take thy wife with thee, and the two daughters who are still at
home, or else thou too wilt perish with the offending city.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when they found that he hung back, they pulled him away, with
his wife and his two daughters, so resolved was the Lord to spare him;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` led him out, and set him clear of the city. Here they said to him,
Flee for thy life, never once looking behind thee, never lingering once
in all the plain round about thee; take refuge in the hills, or thou,
too, wilt perish.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But now Lot pleaded with them, My Lord, he said, I entreat thee,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` as thou lovest thy servant, as thou hast shewn me signal mercy in
saving this life of mine, bethink thee that I have no strength to reach
the safety of the hills; calamity will overtake me first, and I must
die.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But there is a city close by that I may reach in safety, a little
city, but I can find refuge there. So small a city, and wilt thou not
grant me life if I go there?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Once again, said he, I yield to thy entreaty; I will not overthrow
the city thou pleadest for.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Only make haste, and take refuge there; I can do nothing till thou
hast reached it. That is how it came to be called the little city,
Segor.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Into Segor Lot entered as the sun rose over the earth;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and thereupon the Lord rained down brimstone and fire out of
heaven, the Lord’s dwelling-place,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and overthrew these cities, with all the plain about them, and all
those who dwelt there, and all that grew from their soil.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And Lot’s wife, because she looked behind her as she went, was
turned into a pillar of salt.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` That morning, Abraham rose up early, and from the place where but
now he had stood talking to the Lord,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` he looked out over Sodom and Gomorrha, and all the plain where they
stood, and saw nothing but smoke going up from the land, like the smoke
of a furnace.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` So it was that when he overthrew the cities in that plain God
remembered Abraham, and rescued Lot from the ruins of his chosen
dwelling-place.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But Lot left Segor, and went up to live in the hills, taking his
two daughters with him; he was afraid to live at Segor, and took up his
abode in a cave. There his two daughters dwelt with him,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and the elder of these said to the younger, Our father grows old,
and as for us, there is no one in the land to mate with us, after the
wont of human kind.✻
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Why then, let us give him wine and make him drunk, and so sleep
with him, to preserve our father’s posterity.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So that night they gave their father wine to drink; and the elder
went in and slept with her father, lying down beside him and rising up
without his knowledge.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And next day, the elder said to the younger, Last night it was I
that slept with our father; let us give him wine again to-night, and
thou shalt sleep with him, to preserve our father’s posterity.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` So that night too they gave their father wine to drink, and the
younger went in and slept with him, and still he knew nothing of it
when she lay down, or when she rose up.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Thus the two daughters of Lot were got with child by their father,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and the elder bore a son whom she called Moab, the ancestor of the
Moabite race that still survives;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` the younger, too, had a son, whom she called Ammon, as if she would
say Ben-ammi, the son of my people; his descendants still survive as
the Ammonites.
