"1" = ''':sup:`1` To Jeremias the word of the Lord still came, after the captain of
the bodyguard, Nabuzardan, had set him at liberty. This happened at
Rama, where he was singled out, still in chains, among the prisoners
from Jerusalem and Juda who were on their way to Babylon.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` As he took him apart from the rest, the captain of the bodyguard
said to him, With calamity the Lord thy God threatened this land of
thine,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and calamity he has brought upon it; his threat is fulfilled. What
guilt was this, to refuse the Lord obedience! And here is the issue.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` From thy hands I have struck the chains, as thou seest; bear me
company, if thou wilt, to Babylon, and I will take good care of thee;
if thou wilt not go my way, then abide where thou art. The whole land
is at thy disposal, and thou art free to take thy own path; none may
constrain thee to go with me.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Here is Godolias, son of Ahicam, son of Saphan, that is entrusted by
the king of Babylon with the charge of all Juda; dwell with him if thou
wilt, here among thy own people, or where thou hast a mind betake thee.
And with that, the captain of the bodyguard furnished him with
provisions, and made him a present besides, and so took leave of him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` It was to Godolias son of Ahicam, at Maspath, that Jeremias
repaired, and dwelt with him among the remnant of the land’s
inhabitants.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Men, women, and children, to Godolias son of Ahicam the king of
Babylon entrusted them, all these landless folk who had not been
carried off into exile. And when the news of this appointment reached
the army chieftains, scattered here and there with their men,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` they rallied to Godolias at Maspha. Here were Ismahel, son of
Nathanias, Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Caree, Sareas, son of
Thanehumeth, the sons of Ophi from Netophathi, and Jezonias, son of
Maachathi, all with men at their backs.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` To these, chiefs and men alike, Godolias son of Ahicam son of Saphan
took an oath. They need have no fear of living under Chaldaean rule;
let them remain in the country as the king of Babylon’s vassals, and
all should go well with them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I am living here in Masphath, said he, to take the orders sent me
from Chaldaea; it is for you to gather in vintage and harvest and
olive-yield, each of you abiding in the city he now occupies.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` There were other Jews living in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and the
countries round about; these, when they heard that the king of Babylon
had left a remnant in Juda, and put Godolias, son of Ahicam, son of
Saphan, in charge of them,

"12" = ''':sup:`12` came back from the countries where they had taken refuge into
Judaea, came to Godolias at Masphath; and abundant was the store they
brought in, of grapes and grain both.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And now, at Masphath, Godolias was visited by Johanan son of Caree,
and the other chieftains from the countryside,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` with this warning: We have information that Ismahel, son of
Nathanias, was sent here by Baalis, king of Ammon, to take thy life.
But Godolias would not believe it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When Johanan was at Masphath he took Godolias aside; Let me go and
make away with Ismahel secretly, he urged; if he should take thy life,
all the Jews that have rallied about thee will be scattered again, and
Juda have a remnant no more.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Godolias would have none of it; Nay, said he to Johanan, leave
off thy purpose; it is but a false report thou tellest me concerning
Ismahel.
