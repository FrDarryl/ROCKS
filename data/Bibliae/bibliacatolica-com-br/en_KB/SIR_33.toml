thy plea, and find audience for thy prayer; wilt recollect the teaching
given thee, and so satisfy thy questioner.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` A fool’s heart is but a wheel that turns; his are whirling thoughts.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Hast thou a friend that will ever be mocking? Be comforted; stallion

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why is it that one day which dawns, one year, takes precedence of
another, when all come of the same sun?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` God’s wisdom it was that so set them apart when he made the sun, and
gave it a law to keep;

stated times men must keep holiday.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` To some he would assign high dignity; others should be lost in the
common rabble of days. So it is that all men are built of the same
clay; son of Adam is son of earth;

gleaning a fruit here, a fruit there, after the vintagers have done.

have filled the wine-press, a vintager like the rest.

place in the assembly, never disdain to listen.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Long as thou livest, do not put thyself in the power of others,
though it be son or wife, kinsman or friend; do not make over thy goods
to another; it is ill to go a-begging for what is thy own.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` While life and breath is in thee, never change places with another;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Under duress he toils, what marvel if ease should tempt him? Leave
his hands idle, and he will seek to be his own master.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The stubborn ox yoke and rein will subdue; slave held to his task
is slave bowed to thy will;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` keep rack and stocks for one that is bent on mischief. To the task,
no hours of leisure!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Idleness is a great teacher of ill habit.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Toil first assign to him; toiling is his lot; then, if he disobeys
thee, with the stocks thou mayst tame him. Yet do not burden flesh and
blood more than it can bear, nor inflict more than lawful punishment
while the plea is still unheard.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Faithful slave if thou hast, make much of him as of thy own self;
treat him as if he were thy brother, as if thy own life were✻ the price
of his purchase.
