"1" = ''':sup:`1` Lands, too, must be allotted to Manasses, Joseph’s first-born. The
first-born of Manasses was Machir, that was father to Galaad, and he,
by feat of arms, made Galaad and Basan his possession.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But there were six other lines descended from Manasses through
Abiezer, Helec, Esriel, Sechem, Hegher, and Semida; all these were
heirs male to Manasses, and so to Joseph.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But Hepher (who was descended from Manasses through Galaad and
Machir) had a son, Salphaad, that died without male issue;✻ there were
five daughters, Maala, Noa, Hegla, Melcha, and Thersa.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` These appeared before the high priest Eleazar, and Josue the son of
Nun, and the chieftains, to claim the right the Lord had granted them
through Moses, of inheriting side by side with their father’s kinsmen.
So the Lord’s command was obeyed, and they were allowed to inherit;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` and now, apart from Galaad and Basan, beyond Jordan, ten portions of
territory must be allowed to Manasses.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` His other sons were provided for in Galaad, but five remained, and
the five heiresses must have their portion too.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The frontier of Manasses, from where it marched with Aser, came down
to Machmethath, opposite Sichem, and then turned to the right so as to
include the neighbourhood of the Springs of Taphua.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` (Taphua itself, close to the border of Manasses, belonged to
Ephraim, but Manasses held the adjoining lands.)
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then it went down to the southern side of the stream which flows
through the Valley of Reeds, through cities belonging to Ephraim, which
are here confused with those of Manasses. Thenceforward Manasses has a
true frontier, on the north side of the stream, reaching down to the
sea;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Ephraim lies to the south, Manasses to the north, both of them
bounded by the sea coast; their joint territory marches with Aser on
the north, and Issachar on the east.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Manasses also had lands in Issachar and in Aser, Bethsan, Jeblaam,
Dor, Endor, Thenac and Mageddo, with the villages dependent on them,
and a third part of Nopheth;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but they could not get the mastery of these cities; the Chanaanites
made bold to live on in their own country.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When the Israelites had grown stronger, they subdued the
Chanaanites and forced them to pay tribute, but did not exterminate
them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When the tribes descended from Joseph complained to Josue that he
had allotted to them only a single division of the country, although
the Lord’s blessing had made them so populous,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Josue replied, If there are so many of you, and the hill-country of
Ephraim does not suffice you, make your way into the forest-country,
and clear room for yourselves there, where the Pherezites and the
Raphaim live.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` We cannot go across to the hill-country, answered the sons of
Joseph; there is a valley in between, where Bethsan lies, with its
townships, and Jezrael; and on that low ground there are Chanaanites
who have chariots made of iron.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But Josue still told the sons of Joseph, the men of Ephraim and
Manasses, So great, so powerful a people as you are must not be content
with one lot.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Cross over to the hill-country and fell the trees, to make
yourselves room to dwell in; drive out these Chanaanites, for all their
iron chariots, for all their great strength, and you will spread your
frontiers further yet.
