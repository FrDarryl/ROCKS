"1" = ''':sup:`1` And so the work was begun, by Beseleel, and Oöliab, and all the
craftsmen to whom the Lord had given skill in their craft, so that they
should know how to make workmanlike provision for the sanctuary’s
needs, according to the prescriptions the Lord had given.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Moses summoned them, all these trained workmen who had been endowed
by the Lord with skill, and had offered their services freely;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and he handed over to them the contributions which the sons of
Israel made. Eagerly they set about their work, and every morning the
people brought their gifts,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` till at last the workmen must needs come to Moses,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and tell him, The people are offering more than is needed.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Moses bade the crier give out that no man or woman should offer
any more for the needs of the sanctuary; thus he put an end to the
bringing of gifts,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` because the contribution had already given them enough and to spare.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So, to carry out the fashioning of the tabernacle, all these skilful
workmen made ten curtains, of twisted linen thread, embroidered with
threads of blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` all of the same size, twenty-eight cubits in length and four in
width.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Beseleel joined five of these to each other, and the remaining
five in the same way.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And on the sides of one set of curtains, at its extreme edge, he
made loops of blue cord, and so with the other,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` so that loop could meet loop and be fastened to it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Afterwards he made fifty gold clasps, to catch the loops on the
curtains, so as to make a single tent of them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Next, he made eleven coverings of goats’ hair, to protect the
tapestry over the tabernacle.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The measurements of all these coverings were the same; each was
thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He joined together first five of these coverings, then the other
six in their turn.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he made fifty loops at the edge of the first set of coverings,
then fifty at the edge of the other, to join them together,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and fifty brazen clasps, so that the coverings would be tied
together, and the whole would form a single protecting roof.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He made a canopy, too, over the tabernacle, of rams’ fleeces dyed
red, and another canopy over that of skins dyed violet.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He made upright frames, too, of acacia wood to support the
tabernacle.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Each board was ten cubits high, and had a width of a cubit and a
half;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and at the sides of it, two tenon-pieces jutted out, so that each
might be mortised to the next; all the framework of the tabernacle he
made in this way.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Twenty frames were on the south, facing the midday sun,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` with forty silver sockets, two to each frame, fitting on each side
at the corners, where the mortising finished.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` There were twenty frames, too, on the side of the tabernacle which
looked north,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` with forty silver sockets, two to each frame.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For the western side of the tabernacle, looking towards the sea, he
made six frames,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and two in addition, for the corners at the extreme end of the
tabernacle.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` These were joined together, from bottom to top, with a single kind
of fastening; it was the same with the corners at each side,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` so that altogether there were eight frames, with sixteen silver
sockets, two at the foot of each.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then he made five poles of acacia wood, to hold the frames together
on one side of the tabernacle,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and five more to connect the frames on the opposite side, and on
the western side of the tabernacle, looking seawards, five more still.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And one pole he made that should reach right along the frames from
end to end.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The sockets he made of cast silver; the frames themselves he gilded
over, and made rings of gold through which the poles, those too plated
with gold, could pass.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` He made a veil, too, out of twisted linen thread, worked in threads
of blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed, with all the embroiderer’s
art,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and four posts of acacia wood, gilded and with gilt capitals, but
set in silver sockets.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And he made a screen out of twisted linen thread, embroidered with
threads of blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed, for the entrance of
the tabernacle,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and five posts of acacia wood which he gilded over, capitals and
all, fitting into sockets of moulded bronze.
'''
