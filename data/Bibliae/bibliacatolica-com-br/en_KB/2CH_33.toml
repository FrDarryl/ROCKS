"1" = ''':sup:`1` This Manasses was twelve years old when he came to the throne, and
his reign at Jerusalem lasted fifty-five years.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he defied the Lord’s will, by courting the false gods of those
nations which the Lord destroyed to make room for the sons of Israel.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He restored once again the hill-shrines which his father Ezechias
had overthrown; he raised altars to the gods of the country-side, and
set up sacred trees, and gave to all the host of heaven worship and
observance.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Nay, he must set up these altars of his in the temple itself, where
the Lord fulfilled his promise that Jerusalem should be the shrine of
his name for ever;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` altars there must be for all the host of heaven in the two temple
courts.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He consecrated his own sons by passing them through the fire in the
ravine of Benennom;✻ there was watching for dreams and taking of
auguries, there was practising of magical arts; he surrounded himself
with diviners and soothsayers, until this defiance of his provoked the
Lord’s anger.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He carved an image, too, and cast a sheath for it, and set this up
in the Lord’s house. And this was at Jerusalem, the Lord’s choice among
all the cities of Israel; this was in the temple that was to be the
everlasting shrine of his name; so he had promised David and Solomon,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Nevermore will I let the sons of Israel be dislodged from the land I
gave their fathers, if only they will be true to law and observance and
decree Moses enjoined on them in my name.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The very nations which the Lord destroyed to make room for the sons
of Israel were guilty of less wrong than Juda and Jerusalem did, when
they were led astray by the example of Manasses.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Warnings enough the Lord sent to him and to his people, but they
went unheeded;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and the next emissaries he sent to them were the captains of the
Assyrian army, who made Manasses their prisoner, and carried him away,
loaded with chains and fetters, to Babylon.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It was to his own God, the Lord, that he turned in this time of
distress; before him, the God of his fathers, he made humble amends,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and sought his favour with earnest prayer. That prayer the Lord
answered, and restored him to his throne at Jerusalem. Such good proof
had Manasses that the Lord only was God.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It was after this that he built the wall beyond David’s Keep, out
in the ravine west of Gihon, all the way round from the Fishmongers’
Gate to Ophel, raising it to a great height; set captains, too, on
garrison duty in all the fortified towns of Juda.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Meanwhile, there was an end of the false gods, of the idol that
stood in the Lord’s house, of the altars he had set up on the temple
hill and all over Jerusalem; he cast them away beyond the city walls.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The Lord’s altar must be restored; to this he brought his victims,
his welcome-offerings and thank-offerings, and bade Juda serve the
Lord, the God of Israel.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` None the less, men still sacrificed at the hill-shrines, but only
to the Lord their God.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` What else Manasses did, the prayer he offered to his God, and the
warnings that were given to him by prophets in the name of the Lord God
of Israel, may be found set down in the Record of the Israelite kings.✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The Chronicle of Hozai, too, tells of his prayer and how his prayer
was answered; of his defiance, and of all the places where he set up
hill-shrine and forest shrine and image, before the time of his
repentance.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So Manasses was laid to rest with his fathers, with his own house
for his burying-place, and the throne passed to his son Amon.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` This Amon was twenty-two years old when he came to the throne, and
his reign at Jerusalem lasted two years;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` he defied the Lord like his father Manasses. No idol Manasses had
made but Amon must sacrifice and pay worship to it;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` nor did he ever imitate his father by making humble amends, rather
he outwent him in guilt.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` He was slain in his own house, through a conspiracy among his own
servants;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` but the common folk put them to death, and gave the crown to the
son of Amon, that was called Josias.

Notas de rodapé:
33:1-6 - Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, turns away from God and promotes
idolatry, including abominable practices such as human sacrifice. His
apostasy highlights the consequences of corrupt leadership and the
gravity of sin (see also Deuteronomy 18:10-12 and 2 Kings 21:1-6).
33:7-9 - Manasseh places an idol in the temple, leading Judah to commit
more sins than the pagan nations. This shows how turning away from God
can lead a people into even greater spiritual decay (see also 1 Kings
12:28-30 and 2 Kings 23:26-27).
33:10-13 - After being captured by the Assyrians, Manasseh repents and
seeks the Lord, who hears and restores him. This story illustrates the
immense power of repentance and God's willingness to forgive even the
33:14-16 - After his restoration, Manasseh removes the idols and
restores worship to the Lord. This life transformation demonstrates
that God can redeem even the most lost and bring renewal (see also
33:21-25 - Amon, Manasseh's son, follows in his father's early
footsteps by promoting idolatry and is murdered. This contrasts with
Manasseh's repentance, showing that hardness of heart can lead to
