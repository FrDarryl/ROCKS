account.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Day after day they besiege me, arraign my dealings with them, a
nation, you would think, ever dutiful, one that never swerved from the
divine will. Proof they ask of my faithfulness, would fain bring a plea
against their God.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Why hadst thou no eyes for it, say they, when we fasted; why didst
thou pass by unheeding, when we humbled ourselves before thee?Fasting,
when you follow your own whim, distrain upon all your debtors!

a moment thy health shall find a new spring; divine favour shall lead
thee on thy journey, brightness of the Lord’s presence close thy ranks
behind.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then the Lord will listen to thee when thou callest on him; cry out,
and he will answer, I am here at thy side.Banish from thy midst
oppression, and the finger pointed scornfully, and the plotting of
harm,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` spend thyself giving food to the hungry, relieving the afflicted;
then shall light spring up for thee in the darkness, and thy dusk shall
be noonday;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` the Lord will give thee rest✻ continually, fill thy soul with
comfort, thy body with ease.✻ Not more secure the well-watered garden,
the spring whose waters never fail.

foundations of long ago; this thy task shall be, to repair the broken
walls, to reclaim the by-ways.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Walk warily, keep my sabbath unprofaned. Here is a day I have
sanctified, not for thy self-pleasing; a precious thing the Lord has
made holy and honourable; and wilt thou dishonour it? Wilt thou go thy
own way, use it for thy own pleasure, while it away in gossip?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thou shalt yet have joy in the Lord; I will carry thee aloft, high
above the high places of the land, satisfy thy longing for Jacob’s
patrimony; the Lord’s lips have promised it.
