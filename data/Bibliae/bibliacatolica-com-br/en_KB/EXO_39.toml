for Aaron to wear when he ministered in the holy place, as the Lord had
prescribed them to Moses.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He made a mantle of gold and blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed,
and of twisted linen thread,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` all embroidered work; to do this, he must needs cut up gold leaf and
spin it into threads, so that it could be worked into the rest of the
coloured woof.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` At the top, on either side, he made two shoulder-pieces joined
together,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and a band✻ of the same colours, as the Lord had prescribed to
Moses.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He also provided two onyx-stones, closely set in gold, and inscribed
by a gem-carver with the names of Israel’s sons;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` these, according to the prescription which the Lord had given Moses,
he let into the sides of the mantle, to keep the sons of Israel in
memory.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He made a burse, too, of embroidered work, of the same pattern as
the mantle itself, of gold and blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed,
and twisted linen thread,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` a folded square of a palm’s breadth either way.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And he set in it four rows of stones; in the first row a sardius, a
topaz, and an emerald;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` in the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper-stone;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` in the third, a jacynth, an agate, and an amethyst;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` in the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx-stone, and a beryl; all the
rows were closely set in gold.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And these stones were inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes
of Israel, one on each.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` On the burse, they put chains of pure gold, fastened together,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and two hooks, and two rings, all of gold. The rings they set on
either side of the burse,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` so that the two gold chains could hang from them, and these fitted
the hooks which stood out from the corners of the mantle.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They met before and behind in such a way that mantle and burse were
linked together,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` tied to the strongly fastened rings of the band by a blue cord, so
that they should not hang loose, and come apart; so the Lord had
prescribed to Moses.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` They made a tunic, too, to go with the mantle, all of blue,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` with an opening in the middle of it at the top, that had a woven
border round it.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Underneath, round the skirt of it, there were ornaments of blue
thread and purple and scarlet, and twisted linen thread,
pomegranate-shaped;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` bells, too, of pure gold, which they put in between the
pomegranates all round, at the edge of the tunic;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` first a golden bell, then a pomegranate. Such, according to the
prescription the Lord had given Moses, was to be the dress of the
priest when he went in to perform his sacred office.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` They made, too, woven robes of lawn for Aaron and his sons,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and mitres of lawn with rings about them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` breeches, too, woven of fine linen thread,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and a girdle of twisted linen thread, embroidered with threads of
blue and purple and scarlet twice-dyed, as the Lord had prescribed to
Moses.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` They also made a plate of pure gold, a thing most sacred, inscribed
with all the engraver’s skill, with the words, Set apart for the Lord;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and this, according to the prescription the Lord gave Moses, they
fastened with a blue cord to the mitre.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So the sons of Israel finished making the tabernacle, and all that
covered in the sacred record, carrying out all the prescriptions the
Lord had given to Moses.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent itself and all
its furniture, rings, frames, poles, posts and sockets;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` the canopy of rams’ fleeces dyed red, and the other canopy of skins
dyed violet;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` the veil, the ark with its poles, and the throne;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` the table with its appurtenances and the loaves that were to be set
out on it;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` the lamp-stand, with its lamps and its other appurtenances, and the
oil for it;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` the golden altar, the ointment, and the incense made from spices;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` the hanging for the tabernacle approach;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` the brazen altar, with its grate, its poles, and all its
appurtenances; the basin with its stand; the hangings for the court,
and the posts with their sockets;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` the hanging for the entrance of the court, its ropes and its pegs.
Nothing was missing of all the appurtenances that had been prescribed
for the needs of the tabernacle, the shrine of the covenant.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` The vestments, too, that were to be worn by the priests, both Aaron
himself and his sons, in the sanctuary,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` were brought to Moses by the Israelites, in fulfilment of the
Lord’s command.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And when Moses saw that they had completed all their task, he gave
them his blessing.
