"1" = ''':sup:`1` Word came to me from the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, tell thy fellow-countrymen this: Plague I a country with
war, some frontier-dweller is chosen by the citizens to be their
sentry.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Let such a man spy the invader’s approach, and sound the alarm with
his trumpet;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` whoever hears it must give good heed, or else the enemy may catch
him, and none but himself to blame.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` What, hear trumpet, and pay no heed? The fault is his. More
cautious, he should have found safety.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But what if sentry, when he sees the invader coming, sounds no alarm
to warn his neighbours? Here is some citizen overtaken by the enemy;
well, his guilt deserved it. But for his death I will hold the sentry
accountable.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So it is with thee, son of man; for the whole race of Israel thou
art my watchman; the warning thou hearest from my lips, to them pass
on.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Sinner if I threaten with death, and word thou give him none to
leave off his sinning, die he shall, as he deserves to die, but thou
for his death shalt answer to me.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` If warning thou givest, and he will not leave off his sinning, he
dies by his own fault, and thou shalt stand acquitted.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This be thy word, son of man, to the race of Israel: Think you no
hope of life is left, so burdened you are, so languish under the guilt
of your sins?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` This message give them from the Lord: As I am a living God, the
sinner’s death is none of my contriving! I would have him leave his
sinning, and live on. Come back, come back from your ill-doing; why
must you choose death, men of Israel?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And warn them, son of man, warn thy fellow-countrymen that, once
the upright man falls a-sinning, his uprightness shall nothing avail
him. Sinner that will leave his sinning, no harm shall he have; upright
man that sins, no life shall his uprightness bring him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Promise I the upright he shall live on, he must not by his own
uprightness be emboldened to sin; forgotten, all his good deserts, his
guilt shall be his undoing.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Threaten I the sinner with instant death, he has but to repent of
his sins, do innocently and uprightly,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` restore the debtor’s pledge, the ill-gotten gains, follow the
life-giving law, forswear ill-doing, and it shall be life, not death
for him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Forgotten, all his ill deserving; innocent and upright, he shall
live on.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And yet they say, these fellow-countrymen of thine, that the Lord’s
dealings are inconsiderate, when in truth it is they that deal
inconsiderately.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Death for the upright that is upright no more, and turns ill-doer;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` life for the sinner that will leave his sinning, upright and
innocent now!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Will you still have it that the Lord’s dealings are inconsiderate?
Nay, men of Israel, each of you shall have his deserts.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` It was in the twelfth year of the exile, on the fifth day of the
tenth month, that a fugitive came to me with the news that Jerusalem
had fallen.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The night before this man reached me, the power of the Lord had
visited me, to unseal my lips in readiness for his coming on the
morrow; so now I could speak out, and was dumb no longer.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And a message came to me from the Lord:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Son of man, what are they saying, the folk that now inhabit yonder
ruins of Israel? Enough of us, they say, to be the true heirs of this
land! Abraham was granted possession of it when he was all alone.✻
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Tell them this from the Lord God: You, that cook your meat with the
blood in it, that look to false gods for aid, that thrive by murder,
the land’s heirs!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` You, that live by the sword, that practise foul rites, that
dishonour your neighbours’ wives, the land’s heirs!
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` This is the Lord’s message to them: As I am a living God,
ruin-dwellers, the sword shall be your ruin! Or choose you the open
country, you shall be a prey to the wild beasts; choose you
mountain-fastness and cave, the pestilence shall take you.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` A lonely desert this land shall be, all its proud boast at an end;
the hill-country of Israel shall lie desolate, untrodden by wayfarers;

"29" = ''':sup:`29` desert and desolate their land must be, in punishment of all their
foul doings, before they learn to recognize my power.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And thou, son of man, listen to what they are saying of thee, as
they stand close to wall, huddled under doorway. Each says to other,
Come and find out whether the Lord has any message for us.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Ay, they come crowding about thee, this people of mine, and sit
here closeted with thee, listening to all thou sayest, but do thy
bidding they will not. No, they will have thee sing in their own tune,✻
and all their thought dwells upon gains ill-gotten.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` As well had it been some tuneful air, sung excellently well; better
listeners thou couldst not have, nor less achievement.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But when thy words come true, as come true they shall, none shall
doubt that they have had a prophet in their midst.

Notas de rodapé:

33:12-20 - God affirms that both the righteous and the wicked can fall
into sin, and that God's justice demands that each person be judged

ministry and the continuation of the mission of proclaiming the truth.

33:23-33 - The people of Israel remain in rebellion, hearing God's word
but failing to put it into practice. Disobedience brings consequences,
and God's words must be lived, not just heard. Neglecting to obey the
