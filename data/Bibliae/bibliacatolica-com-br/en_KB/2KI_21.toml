"1" = ''':sup:`1` Manasses was twelve years old when he came to the throne, and his
reign at Jerusalem lasted fifty-five years; his mother’s name was
Haphsiba.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This Manasses defied the Lord’s will, by courting the false gods of
those nations which the Lord destroyed to make room for the sons of
Israel.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He restored once again the hill-shrines which his father Ezechias
had overthrown; he raised altars to Baal, and set up sacred trees, like
Achab king of Israel, and gave to all the host of heaven worship and
observance.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Nay, he must set up these altars of his in the Lord’s own house, the
chosen shrine of his name;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` altars there must be for all the host of heaven in the two temple
courts.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He consecrated his own son by passing him through the fire; there
was watching for auguries and taking of omens, there was divination,
and sorcerers abounded, until this defiance of his provoked the Lord’s
anger.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He made an idol, too, after the fashion of the sacred trees, and set
it up there in the Lord’s temple. And this was at Jerusalem, the Lord’s
choice among all the cities of Israel; this was in the temple that was
to be the everlasting shrine of his name; so he had promised David and
Solomon,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Nevermore will I let the sons of Israel be dislodged from the land I
gave their fathers, if only they will be true to all the observances I
have enjoined, all the commands which my servant Moses taught them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` That warning went unheeded; the very nations which the Lord
destroyed to make room for the sons of Israel were guilty of less wrong
than they themselves did, when they were led astray by the example of
Manasses.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Thereupon word came from the Lord through his servants the
prophets:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` King Manasses of Juda shall not go unpunished for these deeds of
his, more detestable yet than any the Amorrhites did before him; by
which foul example Juda has become no less guilty than Israel.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This warning, then, the Lord God of Israel sends him: I mean to
bring such calamity upon Jerusalem and Juda as shall ring in the ears
of all who hear it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Level with Samaria shall Jerusalem lie, lean in ruin as the house
of Achab leans; I mean to efface Jerusalem as a wax tablet is effaced,
scraping it over and over with pen downwards turned.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I mean to abandon this poor remnant of the people that once was
mine, and let them fall into the hands of their enemies, so that every
rival of theirs can lay their land waste and plunder it;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` since the day when their race left Egypt, they have never ceased
defying me and provoking my anger.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And Manasses, not content with leading Juda into all these sins of
disobedience, took innocent lives without number, till all Jerusalem
was brimming with blood.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` What else Manasses did, his history, and the record of his crimes,
is to be found in the Annals of the kings of Juda.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So Manasses was laid to rest with his fathers, within the domains
of his own palace, in Oza’s garden, and the kingdom passed to his son
Amon.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Amon was twenty-two years old when he came to the throne, and his
reign at Jerusalem lasted two years; his mother’s name was Messalemeth,
daughter of Harus of Jeteba.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He disobeyed the Lord’s will, like his father Manasses before him;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` never a path his father had marked out but he must follow it, never
a shameful cult his father had honoured but he must be its slave;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` but the Lord, the God his ancestors had worshipped, he forsook
utterly, and followed his bidding never.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then there was a conspiracy among the courtiers, and the king was
slain in his own palace;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but these conspirators were overthrown by a rising of the common
people, who crowned Amon’s son Josias to succeed him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` What else Amon did, is to be found in the Annals of the kings of
Juda.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So they buried him in the tomb he had made for himself, in Oza’s
garden, and his son Josias came to the throne.

Notas de rodapé:
21:1-3 - Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, does what is evil in the sight of
the Lord, rebuilding pagan altars and leading Judah into idolatry. His
wicked leadership causes great spiritual damage to the nation (see also
21:4-7 - Manasseh desecrates the temple by building altars to other
gods and even placing a carved image inside the Lord's temple. This
represents a direct violation of the First Commandment and the

21:10-15 - God sends prophets to warn Judah that Manasseh's idolatry
will lead to destruction. The people's rejection of God will bring

idolatry. His wicked leadership is marked by violence and a rejection
of the principles of justice and mercy (see also 2 Kings 24:4 and
21:19-22 - The reign of Amon, son of Manasseh, follows the same pattern
of idolatry and disobedience. He abandons the Lord and continues to
