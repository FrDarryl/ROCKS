"1" = ''':sup:`1` And thus Job answered the Lord:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I acknowledge it, thou canst do all thou wilt, and no thought is too
difficult for thee.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Here indeed is one that clouds over the truth with his ignorance! I
have spoken as fools speak, of things far beyond my ken.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Henceforth it is my turn to speak, thine to listen; my turn to ask
questions, thine to impart knowledge!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I have heard thy voice now; nay, more, I have had sight of thee;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` now I am all remorse, I do penance in dust and ashes.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And now, his converse with Job finished, the Lord said to Eliphaz
the Themanite, You have earned my displeasure, thou and these two
friends of thine, by speaking amiss of me as my servant Job never did.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` To Job you must go for your ransoming, with seven bulls and seven
rams to offer in burnt-sacrifice; he, my servant, shall intercede for
you, and for his sake your folly shall be pardoned, that spoke amiss of
me when he spoke the truth.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` So away they went, Eliphaz the Themanite, Baldad the Suhite, and
Sophar the Naamathite, and did the Lord’s bidding. For Job’s sake the
Lord pardoned them;

"10" = ''':sup:`10` and, as he prayed for these friends of his, the Lord relented at
the sight of his penitence. So he gave back to Job twice over all that
he had lost.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Clansmen and clanswomen and all his old acquaintances gathered
about him now, and sat down as guests in his house, and made great ado
bemoaning all the afflictions the Lord had sent him; not one of them
but gave him presents, a sheep and a gold ear-ring apiece.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` A richer man the Lord made Job now than ever he had been in old
days; fourteen thousand sheep he had, and six thousand camels, and a
thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Seven sons he had, and three daughters,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` the first he called Fair as the Day, and the second Sweet as
Cassia, and the third Dark Eye-lids.✻
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Nowhere might women be found fair as Job’s daughters, and each had
the same patrimony as her brothers.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Job himself lived on for a hundred and forty years, to see sons and
grandsons and a new generation yet of his descendants; so he died at
last as old men die, that have taken their full toll of the years.
