"1" = ''':sup:`1` This was another message the Lord gave to Moses on the eastern bank
of Jordan opposite Jericho;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` he was to bid the Israelites make provision for the Levites out of
these lands of theirs.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The Levites were to have cities with precincts about them; cities
for the Levites themselves to live in, and precincts for their flocks
and cattle,✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` stretching a thousand yards beyond the city walls.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Two thousand cubits to the east, as many to the south, as many
towards the western sea, as many to the north;✻ the city was to lie in
the middle with precincts all round it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Six of the towns granted to the Levites would be sanctuaries for the
outlaw, offering a refuge to homicides, and there would be forty-two
more,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` making forty-eight cities in all, with precincts attached to them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` All these cities were to be a toll levied from the lands of the
Israelites, in greater number from those who held more, in less number
from those who held less; they would make their grant to the Levites
according to their several capacities.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the Lord spoke to Moses
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` giving him this message for the Israelites: When you have crossed
Jordan and reached Chanaan,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` you must decide which of your cities are to be sanctuaries for men
who have shed blood unwittingly.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Such a man, if he takes refuge there, will be beyond the reach of
avenging clansmen, until such time as he can appear and have his cause
decided by the people.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Of the cities appointed as sanctuaries,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` three must lie beyond the Jordan, three in Chanaan itself;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and they shall be open not only to Israelites but to the aliens
that lodge or dwell among you, as a refuge for all who have shed blood
unwittingly.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` In such causes, anyone who struck a deadly blow with a weapon of
iron must be reckoned a murderer, and put to death;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and the penalty is all the same if the deadly blow was struck with
a stone,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` or with a piece of wood.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Any kinsman of the dead man may strike the murderer down, strike
him down without more ado as soon as he meets him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Anyone, that is, who thrusts at a man out of malice, or lies in
wait for him and discharges a weapon at him,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` or makes a deadly assault on him because they are enemies, is a
murderer, to be struck down by the kinsmen of the dead man as soon as
they meet him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But if it was by chance, without any malice
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` or feud between them,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and this is proved in the hearing of the people, after due
consideration of the pleas brought by the slayer and by the dead man’s
kin,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` then he is innocent, and must be rescued from the avenger’s power.
He must be taken back, by award of the court, to his city of refuge,
and make his abode there until the death of the high priest then
anointed.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Once the slayer leaves the confines of the sanctuary town,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` anyone who has a feud against him may strike him down wherever he
meets him, without incurring guilt;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` he should have remained in his city of refuge until the high priest
died. On the high priest’s death, the slayer is free to return home.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` These laws shall hold good among you everywhere and always.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Witnesses are needed before the murderer can be punished; the word
of a single witness does not suffice for his condemnation.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` You are not to accept blood-money from the murderer; he is to be
put to death there and then.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Nor, upon any condition, must you allow the outlaw who has taken
sanctuary to return home until the high priest’s death;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` this would bring pollution on the land that is yours. The blood of
an innocent man involves the whole land in such guilt as can only be
expiated by the murderer’s own blood;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and you must keep your territory clean of such defilement if I am
to dwell among you; the Lord himself is the guest of Israel.

Notas de rodapé:
35:1-5 - God commands the setting aside of cities for the Levites, who
did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes. This
emphasizes the Levites' role as priests and ministers dedicated
Deuteronomy 18:1-2).
35:6-8 - Six cities of refuge are established to protect those who
accidentally kill, revealing God's mercy and justice in handling
homicide cases. These cities symbolize divine grace and protection (see
35:9-12 - Cities of refuge are described as places of safety until a
case is tried. This reflects the justice and compassion of God, who
provides refuge for the innocent and judgment for the guilty (see also
35:16-21 - The law on intentional murder is defined, with the death
penalty established for those guilty. This highlights God's value on
35:30-34 - The importance of witnessing and cleansing the land from
spilled blood is emphasized. God demands justice for innocent blood,
showing that sin affects not only individuals but also the environment
