[44]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Here is a message that was sent through Jeremias to all the Jews
living in Egypt, whether in Magdalus or Taphnis or Memphis or the
Phatures country:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts: You have seen for yourselves
what calamity I brought on Jerusalem and the cities of Juda, how this
day they are empty of inhabitants.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` By their own guilt they earned it, when they defied my vengeance,
courting the sacrifices and the worship of alien gods they had never
known till then, they and you and your fathers alike.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Early to your doors I sent those prophets that were servants of
mine, bidding you leave off such foul doings of yours, doings most
hateful to me;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` but heed and hearing they gave me none, still went astray, to alien
gods still made sacrifice.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` At last my angry vengeance blazed up, and lit such a fire in the
townships of Juda, in the streets of Jerusalem, as has left them, this
day, a barren wilderness.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And now, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, what of
yourselves? Would you fasten a noose round your own necks, court death
for man and woman, child and weanling, till remnant of Juda there is
none?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For rivals must I have images of your own making? Will you sacrifice
to gods not yours, there in Egypt? Why would you take refuge there, to
your own undoing, to be a name all the world should curse by and
revile?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Have you forgotten them, ill deeds done in your fathers’ days by
king and queen, by man and wife, throughout Juda and the streets of
Jerusalem?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Alas, to this day there is no amending; no dread of me, no living
by the divine law, by the rule I held up for a pattern to you and to
your fathers!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus, then he threatens you, he, the Lord of hosts, the God of
Israel: It is my frown you shall see henceforward; the whole of Juda
shall be cut away.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The remnant that looked to find a refuge in Egypt, in Egypt shall
perish, sword and famine their undoing, sword and famine for all of
them, high and low. Theirs shall be a name of execration and of wonder,
a name to curse by and to revile.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Sword, famine and pestilence, so I called Jerusalem to account, and
so I will call Egypt to account;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` for those Jewish survivors that have taken refuge in Egypt there is
no escaping with their lives, no returning to Juda, home of their eager
desire; only fugitives shall return.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Jeremias did not go unanswered; there were men there who knew well
their wives made offering to alien gods; of the women themselves, many
were standing by. They had but one thought, all these exiles that were
making their home at Phatures in Egypt;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Ay, so the Lord bids thee tell us, but we will have none of it.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Sworn we are, and by that oath we mean to stand, that we will do
sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and make offering of cakes to her, as
we ever did, we and our fathers, kings and rulers of ours, in the
townships of Juda and in Jerusalem streets; bread we had in those days
to our heart’s content, and all went well with us; bad times we never
saw.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It is only since we left off doing sacrifice to the queen of
heaven, and paid tribute of cakes no more, that all is woe and want,
sword wasting us and famine.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Sacrifice when we women make to the queen of heaven, and pour
libation to her, be sure our men-folk know in whose honour cake is
made, and wine is poured!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Jeremias turned upon them all, men and women alike, all that
had given him his answer.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Nay, said he, when you did sacrifice all through Juda and in
Jerusalem streets, and your fathers before you, king and noble and
plain citizen, be sure the Lord was heeding you, and marked it well.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` It was when the Lord could bear no longer with false aims and foul
deeds of yours, that your land became a wilderness, a thing of wonder,
a name to curse by, a land empty of inhabitants, as it is this day.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` It was because you sacrificed, in the Lord’s despite, to false
gods, because you would not obey him, would not follow law and decree
and ordinance of his, that all the calamity of these times has come
upon you.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` This, too, Jeremias said to the crowd about him, and to their
women-folk besides: Jews of Egypt, listen to the message he sends you,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` he, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel. So you will be as good as
your word; sacrifice and libation you have vowed to the queen of
heaven, and must pay it; all is accomplished, will has turned into act!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then listen, Jews of Egypt, to the doom which the Lord pronounces:
By the honour of my own name I have sworn it, the Lord says, never Jew
shall be heard more taking his oath by the living God, in all this land
of Egypt!
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For woe, not for weal, these eyes of mine shall watch over them,
till sword and famine have done their work, and Jew in Egypt is none.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` To Juda from Egypt they shall return, such few as have escaped the
sword’s point, and the remnant that took refuge here shall learn to
their cost whose prophecy was fulfilled, theirs or mine.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Here is a sign I mean to give you, the Lord says, here in this
land, in proof that my threats shall be accomplished.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus says the Lord: I, that gave up Sedecias of Juda to
Nabuchodonosor, his mortal enemy, will give up to his mortal enemies
yonder Ephree,✻ that is now Pharao in Egypt.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
44:1-10 - God reveals that the people of Judah, who went to Egypt, are
worshiping foreign gods. Idol worship reflects their alienation from
God and their spiritual blindness, as they seek protection in powerless
44:11-14 - God announces severe judgment for idolaters, stating that
they will not escape punishment. Idolatry brings destruction and ruin,
highlighting the consequences of rejecting God and His authority (see
44:15-19 - The people insist on continuing to worship the queen of
heaven, refusing to repent. This hardening of hearts in the face of
divine warning reflects the harsh reality of lack of repentance, which
44:20-30 - God reaffirms His judgment on Judah and announces that Egypt
will be delivered into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. This demonstrates
God's sovereignty over the destinies of nations and how His justice is
47:1-15).
