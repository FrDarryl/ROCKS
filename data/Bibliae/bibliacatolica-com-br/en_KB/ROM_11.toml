"1" = ''':sup:`1` Tell me, then, has God disowned his people? That is not to be
thought of. Why, I am an Israelite myself, descended from Abraham;
Benjamin is my tribe.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` No, God has not disowned the people which, from the first, he
recognized as his. Do you not remember what scripture tells us about
Elias? The complaint, I mean, which he made before God about Israel:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and overthrown thy altars; I am
the only one left, and my life, too, is threatened.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And what does the divine revelation tell him? There are seven
thousand men I have kept true to myself, with knees that never bowed to
Baal.✻
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So it is in our time; a remnant has remained true; grace has chosen
it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And if it is due to grace, then it is not due to observance of the
law; if it were, grace would be no grace at all.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` What does it mean, then? Why, that Israel has missed its mark; only
this chosen remnant has attained it, while the rest were blinded;✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` so we read in scripture, God has numbed their senses, given them
unseeing eyes and deaf ears, to this day.✻
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` David, too, says, Let their feasting be turned into a trap, a snare,
a spring to recoil upon them;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` let their eyes be dim, so that they cannot see, keep their backs
bowed down continually.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Tell me, then, have they stumbled so as to fall altogether? God
forbid; the result of their false step has been to bring the Gentiles
salvation, and the result of that must be to rouse the Jews to emulate
them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Why then, if their false step has enriched the world, if the
Gentiles have been enriched by their default, what must we expect, when
it is made good?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` (I am speaking now to you Gentiles.)✻ As long as my apostolate is
to the Gentiles, I mean to make much of my office,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` in the hope of stirring up my own flesh and blood to emulation, and
saving some of them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If the losing of them has meant a world reconciled to God, what can
the winning of them mean, but life risen from the dead?✻
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When the first loaf is consecrated, the whole batch is consecrated
with it; so, when the root is consecrated, the branches are consecrated
too.✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The branches have been thinned out, and thou, a wild olive, hast
been grafted in among them; sharest, with them, the root and the
richness of the true olive.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` That is no reason why thou shouldst boast thyself better than the
branches; remember, in thy mood of boastfulness, that thou owest life
to the root, not the root to thee.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Branches were cut away, thou wilt tell me, so that I might be
grafted in.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` True enough, but it was for want of faith that they were cut away,
and it is only faith that keeps thee where thou art; thou hast no
reason for pride, rather for fear;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` God was unforgiving with the branches that were native to the tree,
what if he should find occasion to be unforgiving with thee too?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` There is graciousness, then, in God, and there is also severity.
His severity is for those who have fallen away, his graciousness is for
thee, only so long as thou dost continue in his grace; if not, thou too
shalt be pruned away.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Just so they too will be grafted in, if they do not continue in
their unbelief; to graft them in afresh is not beyond God’s power.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Indeed, it was against nature when thou wast grafted on to the true
olive’s stock, thou, who wert native to the wild olive; it will be all
the easier for him to graft these natural branches on to their own
parent stock.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I must not fail, brethren, to make this revelation known to you; or
else you might have too good a conceit of yourselves. Blindness has
fallen upon a part of Israel, but only until the tale of the Gentile
nations is complete;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` then the whole of Israel will find salvation, as we read in
scripture, A deliverer shall come from Sion, to rid Jacob of his
unfaithfulness;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and this shall be the fulfilment of my covenant with them, when I
take away their sins.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` In the preaching of the gospel, God rejects them, to make room for
you; but in his elective purpose he still welcomes them, for the sake
of their fathers;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` God does not repent of the gifts he makes, or of the calls he
issues.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` You were once rebels, until through their rebellion you obtained
pardon;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` they are rebels now, obtaining pardon for you, only to be pardoned
in their turn.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Thus God has abandoned all men to their rebellion, only to include
them all in his pardon.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` How deep is the mine of God’s wisdom, of his knowledge; how
inscrutable are his judgements, how undiscoverable his ways!
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Who has ever understood the Lord’s thoughts, or been his
counsellor?✻
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Who ever was the first to give, and so earned his favours?✻
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` All things find in him their origin, their impulse, the centre of
their being; to him be glory throughout all ages, Amen.✻

Notas de rodapé:
11:1-6 - Paul affirms that God has not rejected Israel, for he himself,
as a Jew, is an example that God still maintains a faithful remnant.
Election by grace, not works, is the basis of salvation (see also 1
11:7-10 - Israel's unbelief does not hinder God's plan. He gave them a
spirit of perversion, but He did not completely abandon His people,
allowing the Gentiles to be incorporated into His plan of salvation
11:11-15 - The fall of Israel resulted in the salvation of the
Gentiles, but Paul points out that this is for the salvation of the
Jews as well. The introduction of the Gentiles to the gospel is a
blessing, but the ultimate goal is the restoration of Israel (see also
11:16-24 - Paul uses the metaphor of the olive tree to illustrate the
relationship between Jews and Gentiles. The Gentiles have been grafted
into the olive tree, but they must remain humble and watchful, for the
tree can be cut down if they do not remain faithful to the faith (see
11:25-36 - Paul speaks of the mystery of Israel's salvation and how the
Jews' partial blindness will be removed at the end of time. He
concludes with a hymn of praise to God's wisdom and sovereignty (see
