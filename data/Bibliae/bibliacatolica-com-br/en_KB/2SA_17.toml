"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now, said Achitophel to Absalom, let me pick twelve thousand men,
and set out in pursuit of David this very night;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` so I shall overtake him and easily defeat him, weary as he is and
unnerved; first scatter the company that went with him, and then strike
him down, with none to aid him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` All the people I will bring round to thy cause, as easily as I would
persuade a single man; thou hast but one enemy, the rest of the people
will be well content.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Both Absalom and all the elders of Israel liked his counsel well;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` but Absalom would have them summon Chusai the Arachite, to find out
his opinion too.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Chusai the Arachite came in, and Absalom told him what Achitophel
had said; Were it well done? he asked. What advice givest thou?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Chusai answered, No, it will not serve our turn, this counsel
Achitophel has given.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Bethink thee now, what brave warriors they are, thy father and the
men he leads; how fierce in their anger, fierce as the she-bear that
lurks in a wood, when her cubs have been taken away from her; thy
father is a fighting man, he will not remain there among the common
folk.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` No, by now he is hidden in some pit under ground, or some other
vantage-point. A few deaths among his pursuers, and the word will go
round, Absalom’s followers are routed!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then the most lion-hearted will be overcome with sudden fear; well
all the people of Israel knows that thy father and the warriors that
bear him company are men of mettle.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No, here is a plan more to my liking, that thou shouldst summon all
Israel, from Dan to Bersabee, an army countless as the sand, and
thyself march out with it.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Hide he where he may, we will find him, and we will be all about
him, covering the earth like dew; never a man of his company shall
escape us.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Why, even if he should defend himself behind city walls, this great
army of Israel could wind ropes round it and drag it down into the
nearest valley, till never a stone was to be found of it!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thereupon Absalom and all the men of Israel agreed that Chusai the
Arachite had given better counsel than Achitophel. Whereas in truth
Achitophel’s advice was the more to their purpose, but the Lord foiled
it, to compass Absalom’s ruin.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Chusai told the priests, Sadoc and Abiathar, what Achitophel’s
counsel had been, and what his own;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Send a message to David, said he, with all speed, telling him not
to linger in the desert plain this night, but cross Jordan without
delay; else he and all that are with him may be overwhelmed.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Jonathan and Achimaas stood at their post by the spring of Rogel,
and a maid-servant must go and give them the message before they could
take it to king David; they did not dare shew themselves in the city.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Even so a lad saw them, and told Absalom, and they must turn aside
with all speed into the house of a man at Bahurim, that had a well by
the porch of it, and climb down into this for safety.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Nor was their hiding-place discovered; a woman came and spread a
cloth over the mouth of the well, as if she would dry her barley-groats
there;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and when Absalom’s men reached the house, asking her where were
Jonathan and Achimaas, she said they had gone quickly on their way,
only stopping for a mouthful of water; so their pursuers returned
baffled to Jerusalem.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` These gone, Jonathan and Achimaas climbed up out of the well, and
brought king David word; Bestir yourselves, they said, and cross the
river without more ado; and told what advice Achitophel had given.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So king David and all that bore him company took the road, and were
across Jordan before ever dawn broke; not a man was left west of the
river.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` As for Achitophel, when he found that his advice was not followed,
he saddled his ass and went home to Gilon; there he put his affairs in
order, and hanged himself. So there they buried him, in his father’s
tomb.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` David made his way to the Encampment; and now Absalom crossed the
Jordan after him, with all Israel at his back.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` In Joab’s place, Absalom gave the command of his army to Amasa,
that was son to a man called Jethra, of Jezrahel; he had mated with
Abigail, daughter of Naas, that was sister to Joab’s mother Sarvia.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So Israel, and Absalom with them, pitched their tents in the
country of Galaad.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Meanwhile, upon David’s coming to the Encampment, Sobi son of Naas
the Ammonite, and Machir son of Ammihel from Lodabar, and Berzellai
that dwelt in Galaad, at Rogelim,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` brought him presents; beds and coverlets and earthenware, wheat and
barley, flour and parched corn, beans and lentils and fried pulse,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` honey and butter, sheep and fattened calves. So they made provision
for David and his followers, that were like to be hard pressed with
hunger and thirst, there in the desert.
