"1" = ''':sup:`1` The sixth year of King Sedecias✻ came; and on the fifth day of the
sixth month, as I sat in my house with the elders of Juda for my
company, the power of the Lord God came over me there.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I had a vision; a figure was there before me all aglow, fire beneath
where his loins shewed, and from the loins upwards, brightness made
visible, like amber to see.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It seemed as if an outstretched hand caught me by a lock of my hair;
and with that, a force lifted me up between heaven and earth, and I was
carried away in a divine transport to Jerusalem. There was the gateway
of the inner court, looking northwards, and there was that image of
rival deity God sees and hates.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` There, too, was the bright presence of Israel’s God, as I had seen
it earlier on the river plain;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Son of man, he told me, look northwards; so northwards I looked from
the altar-gate, and saw the image of rival deity standing at the very
entrance.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Foul deeds a-doing, son of man, said he; little wonder if I was fain
to withdraw from my sanctuary, where the men of Israel do me such
wrong. But thou art not finished with them; thou hast fouler yet to
see.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And with that, he brought me close up to the door of the court,
where I found a hole in the wall.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then he would have me dig through the wall; so dig I did, and there
was a door facing me.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Now go in, he told me, and see for thyself what foul deeds are done
here.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when I went in to look, what should I find painted on the walls
but likenesses of reptile and of beast! A very foul sight it was; no
idol Israel worships but it was there;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and in front of these pictures stood Jezonias, the son of Saphan,
with seventy elders of Israel about him, censer in hand each of them,
so that a thick cloud of incense went up.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now, son of man, he told me, thou canst see for thyself what work
they make in the darkness, these elders of Israel, each hidden where
hide he may; Fear is none, they say, the Lord should see us; he has
forsaken the land for good and all, the Lord has.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Thou hast not seen all yet, he told me; thou shalt see still fouler
things done;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and he took me through the northern gate of the temple, and there
what found I but women that sat weeping for Adonis?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Hast thou marked it well, son of man? he asked. Prepare thyself for
a sight fouler yet.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then he took me into the inner court of the temple, and there, at
the door of the Lord’s own house, between porch and altar, some five
and twenty men were standing with their backs to the temple, that
worshipped the eastern sun.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Hast thou marked it well, son of man? he asked. And are they not
content, the men of Juda, with such detestable doings as these, that
they must provoke me further yet, filling the whole land with wrong?
See how they hold branch to nostril!✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For their busy wickedness, busy shall my vengeance be; unmelting
this eye, this heart unpitying, deaf these ears to their cry of
complaint.
