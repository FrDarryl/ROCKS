thee, the Lord God says.

God says.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then, too, Gog shall have a burying-place named after him, there in

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Even when the seven months are over, some there will be whose
office it is to search ever the country-side, finding those remains and
burying them, to rid the land of defilement;

feast on the uplands of Israel, flesh to eat, blood for your drinking!

God.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` All the world shall know why it was that Israel went into
banishment, why I turned my back on them and gave them up to massacre;
that it was because they wronged me and deserted me;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` that it was foul crime of theirs bade me disown them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I mean to restore Jacob from exile, the Lord God says, and extend
my mercy to the whole race of Israel; the honour of my name demands it.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The disgrace, the punishment of all their guilt, they needs must
bear …✻ … when they are dwelling safely in their own land, free from
all alarms;

"27" = ''':sup:`27` when I have brought them back from banishment among strangers, in
hostile countries, and so, before the whole world’s eyes, retrieved my
honour.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` They shall know at last that I, the Lord, am their God: if it was I
