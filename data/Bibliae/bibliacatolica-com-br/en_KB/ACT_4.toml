resurrection of Jesus from the dead,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` laid hands on them, and put them in prison (for it was already
evening) until the next day.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` (Meanwhile, many of those who had listened to their preaching had

"15" = ''':sup:`15` so they ordered them out of the council-chamber, and conferred
together.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` What are we to do with these men? they asked. It is commonly known

'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now that they were set free, they went back to their company, and
told them all the chief priests and elders had said.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` Look down upon their threats, Lord, now as of old; enable thy
servants to preach thy word confidently,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` by stretching out thy hand to heal; and let signs and miracles be
performed in the name of Jesus, thy holy Son.

resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and great was the grace that

'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` to lay it at the apostles’ feet, so that each could have what share
of it he needed.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` There was a Levite called Joseph, a Cypriot by birth, to whom the
apostles gave the fresh name of Barnabas, which means, the man of
