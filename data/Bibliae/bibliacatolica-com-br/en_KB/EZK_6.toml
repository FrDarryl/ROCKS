"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now the Lord’s word came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Turn thy eyes, son of man, towards the hills of thy own country, and
prophesy their doom.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Mountains of Israel, thou shalt say, listen to the word of the Lord
God; here is a message from the Lord God to mountain and hill, to rocky
slope and river-bed. I mean to let the sword loose on you, pull shrine
down,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` overthrow altar, break column, pile corpses before the false god’s
feet;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` before every idol, sons of Israel prostrate in death, before every
altar, the ground strewn with their bones.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In all your confines, every city desolate, every shrine wrecked and
ruined; deserted and defaced the altars, forlorn the idols, shattered
the columns, obliterated all the work of man;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and ever the dead lying in the midst of you. Will you doubt, then,
the power of the Lord?✻

"8" = ''':sup:`8` I will leave a remnant of you; some shall escape the sword, to live
on among the Gentiles, dispersed far and wide;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and these survivors, in their land of exile, shall once again
bethink themselves of me. Wanton heart that played me false, eyes that
hankered still after idols, shall be tamed now; they will look back
with loathing on all the foul wrong they did,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` and confess it was no empty boast, when I threatened this
calamity.✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Clap hands and stamp feet, the Lord God says, and cry aloud, Out
upon the foul wrong the men of Israel did, that are now doomed to
perish by sword, famine and pestilence!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Keep they their distance, the plague shall smite them, come they to
grips, the sword; safe behind the battlements, they shall die of
famine; so shall my vengeance take toll of them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Who shall doubt the Lord’s power, when the dead lie thick at the
feet of your idols and about your altars; on hill-top and mountain
height, in forest covert and under spreading oak, where once men would
burn fragrant incense to their false gods?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When the blow falls, I will make their countryside, once so thickly
inhabited, into a wilderness; Deblatha✻ itself is not more forlorn. And
who shall doubt the Lord’s power?
