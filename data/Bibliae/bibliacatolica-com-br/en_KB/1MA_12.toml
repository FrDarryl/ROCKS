"1" = ''':sup:`1` Here was a posture of affairs suited Jonathan well enough; yet would
he send delegates to confirm and renew his alliance with the Romans;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Lacedaemon, too, and other countries should have letters of the same
tenour.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To Rome, then, his messengers went, gained audience of the senate,
and told how the high priest Jonathan and the Jewish people had sent
them to renew their old treaty of friendship;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and the Romans gave them such letters of recommendation to this
country or that, as should bring them home to Juda under safe conduct.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The message Jonathan sent to the men of Sparta was in these terms
following.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The high priest Jonathan, with the elders and priests and all the
people of the Jews, to their brethren the Spartans, greeting.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Long since, your king Arius wrote to our own high priest, Onias,
claiming kinship between us, as witness the copy here subjoined;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` an honourable welcome Onias gave to this messenger of yours, and
accepted the proposal of friendly alliance.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For ourselves, we have little need of such friendship; seek we
comfort, it is in the sacred books committed to our charge.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Yet we thought it best to treat with you for the renewal of this
brotherly compact, before any estrangement should arise between us;
your embassy to us is of long ago.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Never feast-day passes, nor day apt for remembrance, but you are
remembered, as brothers should be, in sacrifice and prayer we offer;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` renown of yours is pride of ours still.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In wars and calamities much involved of late, powerful kings for
our neighbours and our enemies,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` we would not embroil you, nor other allies of ours, in these
quarrels.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Now, by the grace of heaven, we are delivered; our enemies lie
crushed;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` delegates of ours, Numenius son of Antiochus and Antipater son of
Jason, are on their way to Rome, friendship and alliance of former days
to confirm afresh;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and should we send them with no errand to you, no greeting, no word
from us of brotherhood revived?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Pray you, send us fair answer in your turn.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And, for Arius’ letter to Onias, thus the copy of it ran,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Arius, king of the Spartans, to the high priest Onias, greeting.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Spartan and Jew, written record shews it, come of one blood,
Abraham’s.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Apprised of this, we would fain know how you do; pray tell us.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And take this message in return, Cattle and whatever else is ours,
is yours, and yours ours; of that, the bearer of this letter brings you
assurance.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then came news to Jonathan that the chiefs of Demetrius’ faction
were returning to the attack, and in greater force than ever;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` so out he marched, and met them in the Amathite country; respite he
would not give them, to invade his own.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Spies of his went out into the enemy’s camp, and reported, all was
ready for a night attack;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` so, when the sun was down, Jonathan would have his men keep watch,
ready armed all night for battle, and posted sentries round his lines.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The enemy, hearing of such preparedness on their part, took alarm
and let cowardly counsels prevail;✻ they were at pains to leave
watchfires burning in their camp,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` so that Jonathan and his men, deceived by the glow of light, knew
nothing of their plans till morning;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and when he gave chase, it was too late to catch them; already they
had crossed the river Eleutherus.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Thereupon he turned his attack against the Zabadeans, an Arabian
tribe, defeating them and taking spoils from them;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and so, harnessing his waggons, pressed on to Damascus, patrolling
all the country round about.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Meanwhile, Simon had marched out to Ascalon and the neighbouring
strongholds; thence he turned aside to Joppe, and took possession of
it;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` rumour had reached him, the townsfolk would yield the citadel to
Demetrius’ party, and he must have a garrison there of his own.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` When Jonathan returned, he summoned the elders of the people, and
took counsel with them, how best to raise strongholds in Judaea,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and build up walls in Jerusalem itself. Height these must have,
above all, between the Citadel and the rest of the town; he would have
it cut off from the rest, standing by itself, with no opportunity to
buy and sell.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` A great muster there was for the city’s rebuilding; and where the
wall had tumbled down, over the ravine on the east, he made it good; it
is the part called Caphetetha.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Meanwhile, Simon rebuilt Adiada in the Sephela and fortified it;
bolt and bar it should have thenceforward.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And what of Tryphon? Lordship of all Asia he coveted, and a royal
crown; it should be Antiochus’ turn next.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` The danger was, Jonathan would refuse his assent, and resort to
arms; Jonathan first he must seize and put to death. So he moved his
quarters to Bethsan,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` where Jonathan came out to meet him with forty thousand men, picked
warriors all of them, at his back.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Here was a great retinue; and Tryphon, daunted by this show of
force,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` was fain to give him an honourable welcome. He would admit Jonathan
among his closest friends, and bestow gifts on him; let Jonathan give
orders, and Tryphon’s soldiers would obey.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Then he asked, What needs it, such a host of men should go
campaigning, when threat of war is none?
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` It were better to disband them, and choose out a few for thy own
retinue. That done, bear me company to Ptolemais; city and strongholds
and troops and officers I will hand over into thy charge and so get me
gone home; it was on that errand I came.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` What did Jonathan? He fell into the trap, sent his men back to
Juda,
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` and kept but three thousand under arms; of these, he left two
thousand in Galilee, and took but a thousand in his company.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` No sooner had he entered Ptolemais than the townsfolk shut the
gates behind him, secured his person, and put his retinue to the sword.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Horse and foot Tryphon sent out to Galilee, to find the rest of his
followers in the Great Plain, and make an end of them;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` but these, hearing that Jonathan and his men had been caught and
murdered, resolved to put a bold front on it, and marched in battle
array.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Finding them ready to sell their lives dearly, their pursuers
abandoned the chase,
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` and all reached Juda safe and sound. For Jonathan and his
companions they made great dole, and loudly all Israel echoed their
lament.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Neighbouring people was none but went about to overthrow them, and
no wonder;
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` their chieftain, their champion gone, now was the time to fall upon
them, and rid earth of their memory.
