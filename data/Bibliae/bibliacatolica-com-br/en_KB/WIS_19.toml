"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was not so with their impious enemies; with them, God decreed
that pitiless justice should run its course, knowing well what
ill-doing of theirs lay yet in store;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` how the very men who had allowed the Israelites to depart, nay, set
them eagerly on their way, would soon repent of it and march out in
pursuit.✻
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The business of mourning still in hand, the grave-sides of the dead
still calling for their tears, they must needs betake themselves to a
fresh desperate shift; they would hunt down as fugitives the unwelcome
guests of yesterday.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Fitting destiny, that lured them to a fitting doom, made them forget
the past, and led them on to complete their tale of suffering and of
punishment!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For thy people, a strange sea-faring; for those others, an
unexampled manner of death!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Each form of nature, in its own proper sphere, was formed anew as
from the beginning, obedient to the new laws thou hadst given it, for
the greater safety of thy children.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Such was the cloud that over-shadowed their camp; such the dry land
that appeared where water stood before; the Red Sea unlaboriously
crossed, a grassy floor spread out amid the surging billows!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So, sheltered by thy hand, they passed on their way, a whole nation
of them, strange marvels seen in their passage;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` lighthearted as horse at pasture or frisking lamb, they chanted
praises to thee, Lord, their rescuer.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Such, too, were their memories of Egypt itself; memories of the
land that bred lice and could breed no beasts else, the river that
could spawn frogs, yet never a fish lived there.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Later on, they were to see how birds could be the subject of a new
creation, when their appetites craved for richer fare,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and quails came up from the sea to content them.Nor were the
Egyptians punished without warning; the thunders that terrified them
were but echoes of the past. Did not their own wickedness deserve the
pains they suffered,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` a race even more inhospitable than the men of Sodom before them?
These did but refuse a welcome when strangers came to their doors; the
Egyptians condemned their own guests, their own benefactors, to
slavery.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It is one thing to be called to account for unfriendly treatment of
alien folk;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but these Egyptians had received the Israelites into their midst
with rejoicing, had admitted them to rights of citizenship, and then
turned on them with savage ill-treatment.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` No wonder blindness fell on them, as upon the men of Sodom at Lot’s
door! But in Egypt the darkness was so bewildering that a man could not
find his way through the doors of his own house.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` All the elements may be transposed among themselves, keeping up the
same answering rhythm, like the notes of a harp altering their mood; so
much we may infer with certainty from the sights that have been
witnessed in the past.✻

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Land-beasts turned to water-beasts, and the firm ground was trodden
by creatures born to swim.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` then fire, in its turn, could not waste the frail flesh of living
creatures that traversed it, nor melt that heavenly food that melted
easily as ice. No means wouldst thou neglect, Lord, to magnify thy
people and win them renown; never wouldst thou leave them unregarded,
but always and everywhere camest to their side.✻

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
19:1-3 - The hardening of the Egyptians' hearts even after so many
plagues is a sign of divine justice. God allows them to persist in
their stubbornness, resulting in their final destruction in the Red Sea
19:6-7 - Creation collaborates with God to free His people, altering
its natural laws to benefit the righteous. The sea parts to allow the
Israelites to pass, showing that nature is also subject to God's will
19:9-10 - The Israelites pass through the sea as if walking on dry
land, while the Egyptians meet their doom. Their safe crossing
symbolizes God's salvation and trust in His protection (see also
19:13-14 - The Egyptians suffer the plagues because they persecuted
God's people. Those who reject God's mercy and persecute the righteous
19:22 - In all these events, God demonstrates His justice and mercy. He
acts distinctly to save the righteous and punish the wicked, showing
that His providence is perfect and His judgment infallible (see also
