"1" = ''':sup:`1` Josias was eight years old when he came to the throne, and his reign
at Jerusalem lasted thirty-one years; his mother’s name was Idida, the
daughter of Hadaia of Besecath.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` He was obedient to the Lord’s will, and followed in all things the
example of his ancestor, king David, never swerving to right or left.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` In the eighteenth year of his reign, Josias had an errand for the
controller of the temple, Saphan, son of Aslia, son of Messula.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He was to bid the high priest Helcias reckon up the sum collected by
the temple door-keepers for the needs of the Lord’s house,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and pay it out to the workmen through the temple overseers. Pay must
be given to these workmen, engaged on making good the temple fabric,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` carpenters, masons, and builders alike; there was timber to be
bought, too, and stone from the quarries, before the Lord’s temple
could be repaired.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` No account need be kept of these expenses; the overseers could be
trusted with full disposal of the money.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` It was then that the high priest Helcias told Saphan he had found,
there in the temple, a copy of the law, which he gave him to read.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Saphan, going back to the king with news of his errand, to
report that the temple offerings had been reckoned up and paid over to
the temple overseers, for distribution to the workmen,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` added that he had a book which the high priest Helcias had given
him.This book, then, Saphan read out in the royal presence;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and the king, upon hearing the terms of the Lord’s law, rent his
garments about him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then he gave his orders to Helcias, and Ahicam son of Saphan, and
Achobor son of Micha, and Saphan the controller of the temple, and
Asaia, one of his courtiers;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Go and consult the Lord, he told them, in my name, and in the name
of this whole people of Juda, about this new-found copy of the law.
Fiercely the Lord’s anger burns against us, that the words of this book
should have fallen on deaf ears, and our race should have disobeyed the
commands enjoined upon us.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So Helcias, Ahicam, Achobor, Saphan and Asaia betook themselves to
the prophetess Holda. She was wife to Sellum, son of Thecua, son of
Araas, that once kept the royal wardrobe; her dwelling was at
Jerusalem, in the new part of the city. So they told her their
business,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and she, in return, gave them this message from the Lord God of
Israel for the man that sent them:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thus says the Lord, For this city and its citizens I have
punishments in store, all the punishments threatened in yonder book the
king of Juda has read.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The men of Juda have forsaken me, and offered sacrifice to alien
gods; all they do is done in defiance of me; the fire of my vengeance
must needs break out against this city, and there is no quenching it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But to the king of Juda, who sent you here to consult the Lord,
give this message from the Lord God of Israel: Well for thee thou didst
listen to the warnings this book gave thee!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Well for thee that fear caught at thy heart, and thou didst humble
thyself before the Lord, at hearing him threaten city and citizens with
despair and doom; that thou didst rend thy garments, and hadst recourse
to me in tears! And thou hast won my audience, the Lord says;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I will lay thee to rest with thy fathers, in quiet times thou shalt
go to thy grave; not for thy eyes to witness the great calamities I
mean to bring on this city of thine.
