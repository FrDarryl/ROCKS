"3" = ''':sup:`3` Beloved, as one who is ever ready to write to you about that
salvation which is your common concern, I am compelled to send you this

"7" = ''':sup:`7` So with Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities round them, which fell
into the same debauchery as their neighbours and pursued unnatural

their dispute over the body of Moses, he did not venture to accuse him
insultingly; he was content to say, May the Lord rebuke thee.)✻

beasts they derive knowledge only from their senses, and it serves to
corrupt them.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Woe betide them, they have followed in the path of Cain; greed,
that led Balaam astray, has been their ruin; they have taken part in
the fatal rebellion of Core.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` What defilement there is in their banquets, as they fare
sumptuously at your side, shepherds that feed themselves without
scruple! They are clouds with no water in them, driven before the

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But as for you, beloved, keep in mind the warnings given you long
since by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

last age, who would make their own ungodly appetites into a rule of
life.✻

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Such are the men who now keep themselves apart; animal natures,
without the life of the Spirit.

of our Lord Jesus Christ, with eternal life for your goal.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` To some you must give a hearing, and confute them;

of what the flesh has defiled must be hateful to you.✻

"24" = ''':sup:`24` There is one who can keep you clear of fault, and enable you to
stand in the presence of his glory, triumphant and unreproved, when our
Lord Jesus Christ comes;✻
