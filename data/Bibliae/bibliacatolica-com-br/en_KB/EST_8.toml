"1" = ''':sup:`1` That same day, Assuerus made a present to Esther of Aman’s house,
that was the Jews’ enemy, and gave audience to Mardochaeus; for now
Esther had told him that this was her uncle.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He took back, too, the ring he had bade Aman wear, and gave it to
Mardochaeus instead; and Mardochaeus was given charge of Esther’s
house.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Nor would Esther be content, till she had fallen weeping at the
king’s feet and prayed him to prevent the mischief Aman had thought to
do by his false plotting against the Jews.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The golden sceptre was held out, in sign of the royal favour, and
she rose to her feet and stood fronting him.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Please it the king’s grace, she said, to look favourably on my suit,
and find nothing in it to his disadvantage. I would have new dispatches
sent out, to revoke the order made by Aman, our crafty enemy, for the
slaying of the Jews in all thy domains.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` How can I bear to see my own people exterminated by massacre?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Nay, said the king to Esther and Mardochaeus; Aman’s house I have
granted to Esther, and Aman himself I have sent to the gallows, for
daring to lift his hand against the Jews.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But letters sent in the king’s name and signed with his ring, by the
custom of the realm, none must ever revoke.✻ Write rather in my name,
under the royal seal, orders for the Jewish people to obey, in whatever
sense likes you best.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So, on the twenty-third day of the third month, Siban, they summoned
notary and scribe of the royal household, and at Mardochaeus’ bidding
they issued orders to the Jewish people. Letters were sent to all the
chieftains, governors and judges who ruled the hundred and twenty-seven
provinces between India and Ethiopia, written to each province or tribe
in the characters it used and in the language it spoke; to the Jews, in
their own characters and their own language.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And these letters, written under the royal seal in the king’s name,
were sent out by post-boys, that must carry them from province to
province before the earlier decree could be executed.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` City by city the Jews must be brought together, so that they could
muster their whole number and fight for their lives. They might slay
their enemies till they made an end of them, with their wives and
children and all their households, and divide their goods as plunder.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The day fixed everywhere for this act of retribution was the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar ….
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` A copy of the letter warning the Jews everywhere in Assuerus’
empire, to be prepared for vengeance ….✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Swiftly the post-boys went about their errand, and in Susan the
royal edict was hung up for all to see.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` When Mardochaeus came out from his audience with the king,
resplendent in royal robes of violet and white, a gold crown on his
head, his cloak of purple and lawn, the whole city welcomed him with
rejoicing and applause;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` for the Jews, it was a dawn of new hope, a day of gladness and
triumphant glory.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` As each tribe, city and province received the royal letter, there
was feasting and carousal and holiday; and many there were, of alien
race and alien creed, that submitted themselves to Jewish rite and
observance; such terror the name of Jewry struck into their hearts.
