"1" = ''':sup:`1` At this time Antiochus was preparing once more for a campaign
against Egypt.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And all about the city of Jerusalem, by the space of forty days
together, there were strange sights appearing. High up in air, horsemen
were seen riding this way and that, in vesture of gold, and spears they
carried as if they went to battle;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` now riding in ordered ranks, now engaged in close combat. In long
array they moved past, shields and helmeted heads and drawn swords;
flew javelin and flashed golden harness, a whole armoury of shining
mail.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` No wonder if the prayer was on all men’s lips, good not ill such
high visions might portend.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now a false rumour went abroad, Antiochus had come by his death.
Jason’s ears it reached, and all at once, with full a thousand men at
his back, he delivered an assault upon the city. Let the townsfolk man
the walls as they would, at last it fell, and Menelaus must take refuge
within the citadel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` As for Jason, he fell upon his own fellow-countrymen, and that
without mercy. His own flesh and blood to vanquish, what was this but
shameful defeat? Ay, but to him friend was foe, were there spoil for
the winning!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Yet high priesthood he got none; disappointed of his scheming, back
he must go to the Ammonite country,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and there, marked down for death by king Aretas of the Arabians,
fled from city to city. An outlaw, hated and shunned by his kind, of a
whole land, of a whole race, the common foe, he was driven out into
Egypt;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and so making his way to Lacedaemon, as if to find refuge there by
right of kinship, died miserably. In exile he died, that had brought
exile on so many;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` cast away without dole or tomb, that left so many tombless; in a
strange land unburied, that might have rested in his fathers’ grave.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Here was news to make the king doubt whether the Jews were loyal to
him, and back he came from Egypt in a great taking of rage. He occupied
the city, and that by force of arms;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` then he bade his troops go about killing, with no quarter for any
they met; let a man but shew his face on the house-top, he must be
slaughtered with the rest.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Fell young and old alike; children with their mothers must die, nor
maidenhood was spared, nor helpless infancy.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` By the end of three days, eighty thousand had been massacred, forty
thousand held as prisoners, and as many more sold into slavery.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Nor might all this content him; with Menelaus for his guide, that
was traitor to faith and folk, what must he do but make his way into
God’s temple, holier in all the world is none?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` What, should those sacred ornaments, dedicated by kings and peoples
for the more splendour and worthiness of it, be caught up in his
impious hands, pawed and defiled by his touch?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Surely he had taken leave of his wits, this Antiochus; how should
he know that this sanctuary, for once, would lack the divine
protection? And only because, for a little, God’s anger was provoked by
sins of the men that dwelt there!
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Free had they been from the meshes of such guilt, Antiochus, too,
should have been greeted with a drubbing, as Heliodorus was, the man
king Seleucus sent to rob the treasury, and should have learned to
leave his rash purpose.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But what would you? People it was God chose, and city for people’s
sake;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` chastisement that fell on the people, city must rue, and anon share
its good fortune. He, the omnipotent, the ruler of all, would leave
Jerusalem forlorn in his anger, would raise her to heights of glory,
his anger once appeased.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Antiochus, then, came away from the temple a thousand and eight
hundred talents the richer; and back he went to Antioch, all at
reckless speed; he had a mind to sail his fleet over the plain, march
his troops across the sea, his heart so swelled with pride in his
doings.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` As for the Jewish folk, he left viceroys of his own to harry them;
in Jerusalem Philip, that was a Phrygian born, and outdid his own
master in cruelty;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` at Garizim Andronicus and Menelaus, heaviest burden of all for the
folk to bear.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But he would do worse by the Jews yet; or why did he send out
Apollonius, the arch-enemy, and a force of twenty-two thousand, to cut
off manhood in its flower, women and children to sell for slaves?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` This Apollonius, when he reached Jerusalem, was all professions of
friendship, and nothing did until the sabbath came round, when the Jews
kept holiday. Then he put his men under arms,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and butchered all that went out to keep festival; to and fro he
went about the streets, with armed fellows at his heels, and made a
great massacre.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Meanwhile Judas Machabaeus, and nine others with him, went out into
the desert, where they lived like wild beasts on the mountain-side;
better lodge there with herbs for food, than be party to the general
defilement.

5:15-16 - Antiochus desecrates the Temple, removing sacred objects and
desecrating the place of worship. This action demonstrates the
violation of the sanctity of the Temple and symbolizes the struggle

5:17-20 - Despite the people's suffering, the author reminds us that
God allows these trials to correct Israel, but He never abandons them
completely. The Temple, even though desecrated, will be restored in due
and Lamentations 3:31-33).

Antiochus, hiding in the mountains with other believers. This marks the
beginning of the Jewish struggle for freedom and the right to practice
