"1" = ''':sup:`1` All that night the king could not sleep; so he would have the annals
of his reign brought to him, the record of times past, and they began
to read these out in his presence.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In the reading of them, they came upon the story of the plot made by
two chamberlains, Bagathan and Thares, to murder the king, and how
Mardochaeus gave information of it.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And for this loyalty, the king asked, what honours or rewards were
given to Mardochaeus? But page and courtier were agreed, Mardochaeus
was never the better for it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Who is out there in the court? the king asked. It was Aman, come
into the inner court to find audience with the king, and have
Mardochaeus hanged on his gallows;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` so when they told him it was Aman, Let him come in, the king said.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Aman, said Assuerus, when he came in, what should a king do, if his
heart is set on raising one of his subjects to great honour? And Aman,
casting about in his mind, could think of no other man that would be so
marked out for the royal favour, but himself.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why, said he, if such a man is to be honoured indeed,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he should be dressed in royal robes, mounted on the king’s own
horse, and crowned with the royal crown;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and let him ride through the city streets, with the noblest of all
the king’s vassals crying out at his bridle-rein, So he rides, whom
most the king would honour.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Lose no time, then, the king answered; bring robe and horse, and do
as much thyself for the Jew Mardochaeus, that sits there at the palace
gates. And have a care that none of the ceremonies thou speakest of
goes unobserved.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So Aman must bring robe and horse, must dress Mardochaeus and mount
him, and then go through the city streets at his bridle-rein, crying
out, So he rides, whom most the king would honour.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` That done, Mardochaeus went back to his post at the palace gates,
while Aman made the best of his way home, weeping loud and hiding away
his head.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` To his wife Zares and to all his friends he told the story of what
befell; but from wife and counsellors he could get no comfort. If he is
of the Jewish race,✻ they said, this Mardochaeus who has begun to
outmatch thee, thou wilt never get the better of him; yield to him thou
must.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And even as they spoke, in came the royal chamberlains, and hurried
him off to the feast the queen had prepared for him.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
6:1-2 - The king, unable to sleep, requests that the records be read.
This demonstrates God's sovereignty, using even insomnia to promote
6:3-4 - The king discovers that Mordecai was not rewarded for saving
his life. This revelation highlights the importance of recognizing and
rewarding good deeds, showing that God does not forget what we do in
6:5-11 - Haman is used as an unwitting instrument to honor Mordecai,
revealing divine irony. This turn of events shows how God can turn
6:12-14 - Mordecai returns to the palace, and Haman is humiliated. This
humiliation is a reminder that pride leads to downfall, while humility
is rewarded. God's sovereignty prevails over human arrogance (see also
06:14 - Haman receives warning of the impending calamity that awaits
him. This underscores the idea that evil plots against God's people
will not prosper and that divine justice always prevails (see also
