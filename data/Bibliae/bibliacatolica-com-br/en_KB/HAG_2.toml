year of Darius.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Afterwards, on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the Lord
sent another message through the prophet Aggaeus.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` To Zorobabel, and Josue, and all the people with them his word was:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Tell me, those of you who saw this house in its former brightness,
what make you of it now? It is no better in your eyes than a very
nothing.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Take heart, Zorobabel; Josue, son of Josedec, take heart! And you,
too, people of the land, the Lord of hosts bids you put heart into the
work; is not he, the Lord of hosts, at your side?…
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` the promise I gave when you escaped from Egypt; my own spirit shall
be among you, do not be afraid.✻
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` A little while now,✻ the Lord of hosts says, and I mean to set
heaven and earth, sea and dry land rocking;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` stirred all the nations shall be, hither shall come the prize the
whole world treasures,✻ and I will fill this temple with the brightness
of my presence, says the Lord of hosts.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Silver or gold, what matters it? the Lord of hosts says. Both are
mine!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Bright this new temple shall be, he tells you, as never the first
was; here, he tells you, his blessing shall rest.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then, on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in this second
year of king Darius, another message came from the Lord to the prophet
Aggaeus,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` bidding him, in the name of the Lord of hosts, make enquiry of the
priests upon a matter touching the law.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the question was this: Here is one carries consecrated meat in
the fold of his garment, and with this same fold chances to touch bread
or broth, wine or oil, or what food you will; does this food become
consecrated thereby? And the priests said No.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Why then, Aggaeus went on, let some other man touch this food, one
that is contaminated by the contact of a dead thing, will the food be
defiled? And they answered, Defiled it is.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Aggaeus opened his mind to them: Here is a whole people, a
whole race, the Lord says, that shews defiled under my scrutiny. Never
an enterprise of theirs, never an offering they bring, but is defiled.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But now, mark well how you thrive henceforward. Whilst none would
be at pains to set pillar on base, here in the Lord’s temple,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` how fared it with yonder twenty-bushel heap of corn? Look closer,
and it was but ten bushels. Did you think to press fifty quarts into
the vat? There were but twenty.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Sirocco I sent and mildew, smote all your crops with hail, and you
would not come back to me, the Lord says.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Mark well how you thrive henceforward, from this twenty-fourth day
of the ninth month, when you laid the foundations of the Lord’s
temple;✻ mark it well.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Not yet has the corn ripened, not yet have vine and fig,
pomegranate and olive, had time to blossom; but on all these my
blessing lies henceforward.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And this further message Aggaeus had from the Lord, on that
twenty-fourth day of the month,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` for Zorobabel, the governor of Juda: Earth and heaven both I mean
to set rocking;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` royal thrones shall be overturned, and the power of Gentile
kingdoms brought to nothing; overthrown they lie, chariot and
charioteer, down come horse and rider, friend turning his sword against
friend;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but thou, son of Salathiel, says the Lord of hosts, thou,
Zorobabel, art my servant still; on that day I will take thee to my
side, keep thee there, close as signet-ring; it is a divine choice that
has fallen on thee, says the Lord of hosts.
