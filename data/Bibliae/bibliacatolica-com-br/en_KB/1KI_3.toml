"1" = ''':sup:`1` By now, Solomon’s power was firmly established, and he allied
himself by mar-riage to the king of Egypt, whose daughter he wedded. He
took her to live in the Keep of David; not yet had he built his own
palace, or the Lord’s house; not yet had he finished walling in
Jerusalem.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In those days, the Lord had no temple built for him, and men used to
sacrifice on hill-tops.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Great love had Solomon for the Lord, and followed the counsel of his
father David, though indeed he too went to mountain shrines, to
sacrifice and offer up incense.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Once he had betaken himself to Gabaon, where there was a famous
mountain shrine, to worship there; a thousand victims king Solomon
offered in burnt-sacrifice, there on the altar at Gabaon.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And that night the Lord appeared to him in a dream, bidding him
choose what gift he would.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Thou hast been very merciful, answered Solomon, to my father David,
a servant of thine that ever shewed himself loyal and observant, and
kept his heart true to thee; and one great mercy thou didst keep till
the last; thou hast granted the succession to a son of his own, the man
thou seest.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Yes, Lord God, thou hast bidden this servant of thine reign where
his father reigned; but, Lord, what am I? No better than a little
child, that has no skill to find its way back and forth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And here am I, thy servant, lost among the thousands of the people
thou hast chosen, a people whose numbers are beyond all count and
reckoning.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Be this, then, thy gift to thy servant, a heart quick to learn, so
that I may be able to judge thy people’s disputes, and discern between
good and ill. How else should a man sit in judgement over such a people
as this, great as thy people is great?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The Lord listened well pleased, and looked with favour on the
choice he had made.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For this request of thine, he told Solomon, thou shalt be rewarded.
Thou didst not ask for a long life, or riches, or vengeance upon thy
enemies, but for wisdom to administer justice.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thy prayer is granted; hereby I grant thee a heart full of wisdom
and discernment, beyond all that went before thee or shall come after
thee.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And I grant thee moreover all thou didst not ask for; in wealth, in
glory, no king that ever was may compare with thee.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And if thou wilt follow the paths I have chosen for thee, as thy
father did, keeping charge and commandment of mine, long life thou
shalt have too.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` With that, Solomon awoke; it was a dream. But when he came back to
Jerusalem, he stood before the ark that bears record of the Lord’s
covenant, and brought burnt-sacrifice, and made welcome-offerings, with
a great feast for all his servants.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And now two women, harlots both of them, came and stood in the
royal presence.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Justice, my lord! said one of them. This woman and I share a single
house, and there, in her presence, I gave birth to a child;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` three days after my delivery, she too gave birth. We were still
living together; none else was in the house but we two.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then, one night, she overlay her child as she slept, and it died.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So, rising at dead of night, when all was still, she took my son
from beside me, my lord, while I slept, put him in her own bosom, and
her dead son in mine.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` In the morning, when I raised myself to give my child suck, a dead
child was there; and it was not till I looked at it more closely under
the full light of day that I found this was never the child I bore.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And when the other woman said, No, it is thy child that is dead,
mine that is alive, she persisted in answering, Thou liest; it is my
child that lives, thine that is dead. Such was the angry debate they
held in the king’s presence.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` See, said the king, it is all, My child lives and thine is dead, on
the one side, and Thy child is dead and mine lives, on the other.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Bring me a sword. So a sword was brought out before the king.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Cut the living child in two, he said, and give half to one, half to
the other.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Whereupon the true mother of the living child, whose heart went out
to her son, cried out, No, my lord, give her the living child; never
kill it! Not so the other; Neither mine nor thine, she said; let it be
divided between us.✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` No, said the king, do not kill the living child, give It to the
first; she is its mother.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` This award was talked of throughout all Israel, and men feared the
king, that was so inspired by divine wisdom in the judgements he gave.

Notas de rodapé:
3:3-4 - Solomon loves the Lord and follows David's precepts, but still
worships in high places. This reveals a transition in his faith, which
will later be refined by the centralized temple in Jerusalem (see also
3:5-9 - In a dream, God offers Solomon whatever he asks for, and
Solomon chooses wisdom to rule. This reflects his humility and
spiritual discernment in putting the good of the people above his own
3:10-14 - God is pleased with Solomon's request for wisdom and grants
him not only that but also riches and honor. This reinforces that the
pursuit of divine wisdom is rewarded with abundant blessings (see also
3:16-28 - Solomon judges wisely in the case of the two women and the
baby. This episode shows the depth of wisdom God has given him,

public recognition strengthens his authority and shows that his
