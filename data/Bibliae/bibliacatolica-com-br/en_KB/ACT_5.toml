"1" = ''':sup:`1` But there was a man called Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira, sold
an estate,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and kept back some of the money, with his wife’s knowledge, only
bringing a part of it to lay at the feet of the apostles.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Whereupon Peter said, Ananias, how is it that Satan has taken
possession of thy heart, bidding thee defraud the Holy Spirit by
keeping back some of the money that was paid thee for the land?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Unsold, the property was thine; after the sale, the money was at thy
disposal; what has put it into thy heart so to act? It is God, not man,
thou hast defrauded.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` At these words, Ananias fell down and died; and a great fear came
upon all those who heard it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So the young men rose and took him up, and carried him out to
burial.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It was about three hours later that his wife came in, knowing
nothing of what had happened;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and Peter said to her, Tell me, woman, was it for so much that you
sold the estate? Yes, she said, for so much.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Peter said to her, What is this conspiracy between you, to put
the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Even now I hear at the door the
footsteps of those who have been burying thy husband; they will carry
thee out too.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And all at once she fell at his feet and died; so that when the
young men came in they found her a corpse, and carried her out to bury
her with her husband.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Great fear came upon the church and upon all who heard the story.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And there were many signs and miracles done by the apostles before
the people. They used to gather with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` No one else✻ dared to join them, although the people held them in
high honour,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and the number of those who believed in the Lord, both men and
women, still increased;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` they even used to bring sick folk into the streets, and lay them
down there on beds and pallets, in the hope that even the shadow of
Peter, as he passed by, might fall upon one of them here and there, and
so they would be healed of their infirmities.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` From neighbouring cities, too, the common people flocked to
Jerusalem, bringing with them the sick and those who were troubled by
unclean spirits; and all of them were cured.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This roused the high priest and those who thought with him, that
is, the party of the Sadducees.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Full of indignation, they arrested the apostles and shut them up in
the common gaol.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But, in the night, an angel of the Lord came and opened the prison
doors, and led them out;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Go, he said, and take your stand in the temple; preach fully to the
people the message of true life.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So, at his word, they went into the temple at dawn, and began
preaching. Meanwhile the high priest and his followers met, and
summoned the Council, with all the elders of the Jewish people; and
they sent to the prison-house to have them brought in.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When they came to look in the prison, the officers could not find
them there; so they went back and reported,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` We found the prison-house locked up with all due care, and the
guards at their posts before the door; but when we opened it there was
no one to be found within.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` At hearing this, the temple superintendent and the chief priests
were at a loss to know what had become of them;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` until an eye-witness told them, The men you put in prison are
standing in the temple, teaching the people there.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So the superintendent and his officers went and fetched them, using
no violence, because they were afraid of being stoned by the people;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and they brought them in and bade them stand before the Council,
where the high priest questioned them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` We warned you in set terms, he said, not to preach in this man’s
name, and you have filled all Jerusalem with your preaching; you are
determined to lay this man’s death at our door.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Peter and the other apostles answered, God has more right to be
obeyed than men.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It was the God of our fathers that raised up Jesus, the man you
hung on a gibbet to die.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` It is God that has raised him up to his own right hand, as the
prince and Saviour who is to bring Israel repentance, and remission of
sins.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Of this, we are witnesses; we and the Holy Spirit God gives to all
those who obey him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` On hearing this they were cut to the quick, and designed to kill
them.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But now one of the Pharisees in the Council, a lawyer named
Gamaliel, who was held in esteem by all the people, rose and bade them
send the apostles out for a little;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` then he said to them, Men of Israel, think well what you mean to do
with these men.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` There was Theodas, who appeared in days gone by and claimed to be
someone of importance, and was supported by about four hundred men; he
was killed, and all his followers were dispersed, and came to nothing.✻
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And after him Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the
registration; he persuaded the people to rebel under his leadership,
but he too perished, and all his followers were scattered.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And my advice is still the same; have nothing to do with these men,
let them be. If this is man’s design or man’s undertaking, it will be
overthrown;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` if it is God’s, you will have no power to overthrow it. You would
not willingly be found fighting against God. And they fell in with his
opinion;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` so they sent for the apostles and, after scourging them, let them
go with a warning that they were not on any account to preach in the
name of Jesus.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And they left the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had
been found worthy to suffer indignity for the sake of Jesus’ name.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And every day, both in the temple and from house to house, their
teaching and their preaching was continually of Jesus Christ.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
5:1-11 - Ananias and Sapphira lie to the Holy Spirit about the sale of
a property, resulting in their death. This episode emphasizes God's
holiness and the seriousness of being honest with Him (see also
5:12-16 - Many miracles are performed by the apostles, and the people
seek them in faith. This section shows the growth of the church by the
5:19-20 - An angel of the Lord frees the apostles from prison,
commanding them to continue preaching. This event highlights divine
12:7-10).
5:29-32 - Peter affirms that it is necessary to obey God rather than
men. He proclaims the resurrection of Jesus as the basis of the
5:40-42 - After being flogged, the apostles continued preaching with
joy. This perseverance reflected their commitment to Christ's mission
