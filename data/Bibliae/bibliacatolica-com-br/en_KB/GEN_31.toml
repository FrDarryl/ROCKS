"1" = ''':sup:`1` Meanwhile, Laban’s sons were complaining, Our father has been robbed
of all his goods by Jacob, who has become rich at his expense.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Jacob was aware of this; he found, too, that Laban looked on him
more coldly than hitherto.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But what moved him most was that the Lord had bidden him, Return to
the land of thy fathers, to thy own kindred, and I will be with thee.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So he sent word to Rachel and Lia to meet him on the pasture-ground
where he was feeding his flocks,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and said to them, I find that your father looks on me more coldly
than hitherto; and all because the God of my father has prospered me.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` You know well that I have worked for your father with all my might,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` whereas he has defrauded me, altering, time and again, his bargain
with me; it was only God’s mercy that prevented him doing me an injury.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` As it was, whenever he said, The speckled beasts shall be thy wages,
it was to speckled lambs that all my ewes gave birth; when he changed
about, and said, Thou shalt have all the white lambs for thy pay, all
my flocks bore white.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` That is how God has taken away your father’s wealth and given it to
me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I had a dream at the time when my ewes were mating; as I looked
round, I could see none but speckled and spotted and blotched rams
coupling with the ewes.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And in my dream, an angel of God called me by name, and when I
answered, I am here, at thy command,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` he said, Look about thee, and mark well that all the sires coupling
with the dams are speckled, spotted, or blotched; that is because I
have taken good note of all Laban’s dealings with thee.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I am the God who dwells at Bethel, where thou didst anoint the
stone, and didst take a vow to me. It is time for thee, now, to bestir
thyself, to leave this country, and go back to the country of thy
birth.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Why, answered Rachel and Lia, we have no reversion left to us in
all our father’s wealth and possessions.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He has treated us as if we were no kindred of his, putting us up
for sale, and keeping the price for himself.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And now, it seems, God has taken away our father’s wealth from him,
and given it to us and to our children. Why then, do as the Lord has
bidden thee.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Upon this, Jacob waited no longer; he mounted his children and
wives on the camels, and set out on his journey;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` taking with him all his possessions, his cattle and all the wealth
he had gained in Mesopotamia; he would return to his father Isaac, and
the land of Chanaan.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Meanwhile, in the absence of her father Laban, who had gone to
shear his sheep, Rachel stole his household gods from him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Jacob had given his father-in-law no warning of his flight,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and it was not till he and all that belonged to him had gone away,
and crossed the Euphrates, and were making for the hills of Galaad,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` that a message came to Laban, three days too late, Jacob has fled.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So now he took his kinsmen with him and gave chase; and he had been
on the road seven days before he overtook him on the hills of Galaad.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Here, in his sleep, he had a vision of God warning him, Have a care
thou dost not speak to Jacob harshly.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Jacob had already pitched his tent on the hills, and now Laban,
coming up with his kinsmen in pursuit, encamped in these same hills of
Galaad.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` What meanest thou, he asked Jacob, by thus tricking me, and
carrying off my daughters as if they were prisoners of war?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Why wouldst thou run away when my back was turned, instead of
warning me of it, so that I could have sped thee on thy way with good
cheer, with singing, and music of timbrel and harp?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But no, thou wouldst not even let me part from my own grandsons and
daughters with a kiss. This was a rash act of thine, and see where it
has brought thee.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Thou art in my power, and I could repay the injury if I would; but
the God who protects thy father’s race warned me yesterday, Have a care
thou dost not speak harshly to Jacob.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thou wert hastening to return to thy own kindred? Thou wert longing
for thy home? Tell me then, why hast thou carried away my household
gods with thee?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` To this Jacob answered, If I left thee unawares, it was because I
was afraid thou wouldst rob me of thy daughters by violence.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But as for thy charge of theft, whoever is found with these gods of
thine in his possession shall pay for it with his life. Make search in
the presence of thy kinsmen and mine, and take away with thee all thou
findest here that belongs to thee. Of Rachel’s carrying off the images,
Jacob knew nothing.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and Lia’s, and the tents of both
the serving-women, but found nothing. At last he came to Rachel’s tent;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and Rachel, who had quickly hidden the images among the harness of
her camel, now sat down upon the harness. As her father looked in vain
all through the tent,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` she said, Forgive me, sir, if I do not rise to greet thee; the
common lot of women has come upon me; and so the anxious search came to
nothing.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And now Jacob broke out into angry reproaches against Laban. For
what fault, what guilt of mine, hast thou so hotly pursued me,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and made this search of all my goods? What treasure hast thou found
here, of all the treasures in thy house? Bring it out here, before my
brethren and thine, and let them judge between us.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Was it for this that I spent twenty years in thy service? All that
time, thy ewes and she-goats were never barren, no wether lamb of thine
did I take for my own eating.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` If wild beasts preyed on them, I made good the damage, instead of
bringing it to shew thee; I must needs give account to thee of all that
was lost by theft.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Burning heat by day, and biting frost at nights, till my eye-lids
lost the power of sleep;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` thus it was that I spent twenty years as a servant in thy
household, fourteen years for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks;
time and again thou didst alter thy bargain with me.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Why, if the God of my father Abraham, the God before whom Isaac
trembles, had not prospered me, thou wouldst have sent me away
penniless; as it is, God has taken account of my wretchedness, and the
toil these hands have borne; that is why he gave thee, yesterday, his
warning.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And Laban answered, These are my daughters, these boys are mine, as
thy flocks, and all thou seest before thee, are mine; something I must
do to protect my own daughters, my own grandchildren.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Come, let us make a covenant, which shall stand on record between
us.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` So Jacob took a stone, and set it up there as a monument;
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` he said, too, to his kinsmen, Bring stones here. And they gathered
stones, and made them into a heap; and over that heap they took food
together.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Laban called it the Cairn of Record, and Jacob called it the
Witness-heap, each according to the usage of his own tongue.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Laban had said Let this heap bear record of our covenant to-day;
that is how it came to be called Galaad, the Witness-heap.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Let the Lord keep watch, he said, and see justice done between us,
when our ways have parted.✻
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` If thou dost treat these daughters of mine amiss, and bringest home
other wives instead of them, there will be no one else to bear witness
of what we have said, but God will bear witness; he is here to see us.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` He said further to Jacob, Look at this heap, this stone which I
have set up between us;✻
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` these shall be witnesses, heap and stone shall be there to accuse
us, if I pass by them on my way to thee, or thou on thy way to me, with
harmful intent.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` May the God who is Abraham’s God and Nachor’s, the God of their
common father✻ see justice done between us. Then Jacob swore by the God
his father Isaac held in reverence,
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` and summoned his kinsmen, when sacrifice had been done on the hill,
to take food there. So they took their meal, and remained there,
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` while Laban rose up at daybreak, kissed his grandsons and his two
daughters, and blessed them, and went back to his home.
