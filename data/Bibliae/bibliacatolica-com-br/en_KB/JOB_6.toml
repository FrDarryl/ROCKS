"4" = ''':sup:`4` Deep the Lord’s arrows rankle in me, draining my life; all his
terrors are arrayed against me.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Brays the wild ass, be sure he lacks pasture; lows the ox, he stands
before an empty crib.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Would you have me relish food unseasoned, lick my lips over the
taste that brings death?

"7" = ''':sup:`7` The food I had no stomach for, in my hard straits eat I must.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Might it be granted, this is the boon I long for, this the request I
would make of God,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` that he would finish what he has begun, crush me altogether, strike
a full blow and make an end of me!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Consolation enough, if he will but torment me to my death; no
repining, then, against his will!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` In what strength should I hold out? In what hope repose?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Have I the endurance of flint? Is my flesh brass?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Help in myself is none; human aid keeps its distance from me now.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Nay, who defies the Lord’s vengeance more surely than friend who
refuses compassion to a friend?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` See how the men that are my brothers have failed me, fickle as the
mountain brooks that run headlong down their ravines;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` first shrivelled with frost, then piled high with snow,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` then, when the snows melt, gone, vanished away at the first touch
of the heat!

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Some hope I had in my friends, but all is disappointment; with eyes
that will not meet mine, they come to visit me.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Ay, you have come, but finding me so sorely smitten you dread my
company.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` It was little enough I asked; I never bade you diminish your own
wealth by bringing gifts to me,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` never begged your aid to rid me of some enemy that was too strong
for me.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Come, be my instructors; I will hear you out in silence; tell me
what is the fault I have committed, all unknowing?

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Ill fare the claims of truth with such as you; not one of you can
shew me in the wrong,

"26" = ''':sup:`26` yet for very love of reproof you must be reproving still, all your
words wasted on the air.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Is it well done, to make a prey of the defenceless, to conspire
against the good name of your friend?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Browbeat me, then, at your pleasure; try if close scrutiny can
prove me false;

"29" = ''':sup:`29` only let there be no contentiousness in your pleadings; in all
honesty bring your complaint.
