"1" = ''':sup:`1` Time, then, that Michael should be up and doing; Michael, that high
lord who is guardian of thy race. Distress shall then be, such as never
was since the world began; and in that hour of distress thy
fellow-countrymen shall win deliverance, all whose names are found
written when the record lies open.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Many shall wake, that now lie sleeping in the dust of earth, some to
enjoy life everlasting, some to be confronted for ever with their
disgrace.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Bright shall be the glory of wise counsellors, as the radiance of
the sky above; starry-bright for ever their glory, who have taught many
the right way.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` For thyself, Daniel, keep this revelation locked away; sealed up the
record of it must be until the hour appointed. Leave others to hasten
to and fro, in search of knowledge.✻

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thus he spoke; and now, looking up, I saw two others that stood
there, one on either bank of the stream.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But he, the man clad in linen, stood there yet over the river
itself; and when I asked how long these wondrous doings should last,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` it was from him I had my answer. Both hands raised to heaven, he
swore by the God who lives for ever that there should be an end to it;
it should last for a space of time, and for twice as long, and for half
as long, no more. Strength of God’s holy people must be broken utterly;
when that is over, all is over and done.✻
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So I had my answer, but still could not tell the meaning of it; Ay,
my Lord, I said, but what shall be the end of it all?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Nay, Daniel, said he, no more of this; needs must that this
revelation be shut away and sealed up, till the appointed hour comes;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and still there shall be chosen souls a many, that are purged by
the fire’s assaying, and still there are sinners that will not leave
their sinning. The riddle, for these others, a riddle must remain, but
wise counsellors there be that will find the clue to it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Of this be sure; after the time when the daily sacrifice is
abrogated, and all becomes defilement and desolation, twelve hundred
and ninety days must pass.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Blessed shall his lot be that waits patiently till thirteen hundred
and thirty-five days are over.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And for thyself, Daniel, go thy way … till the end; till the end of
the days rest thou shalt, and rise to fulfil thy appointed destiny.✻
