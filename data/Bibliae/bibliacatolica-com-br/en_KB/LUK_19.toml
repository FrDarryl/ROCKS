"1" = ''':sup:`1` He had entered Jericho, and was passing through it;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and here a rich man named Zacchaeus, the chief publican,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` was trying to distinguish which was Jesus, but could not do so
because of the multitude, being a man of small stature.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So he ran on in front, and climbed up into a sycamore tree, to catch
sight of him, since he must needs pass that way.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Jesus, when he reached the place, looked up and saw him; Zacchaeus,
he said, make haste and come down; I am to lodge to-day at thy house.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he came down with all haste, and gladly made him welcome.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When they saw it, all took it amiss; He has gone in to lodge, they
said, with one who is a sinner.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But Zacchaeus stood upright and said to the Lord, Here and now,
Lord, I give half of what I have to the poor; and if I have wronged
anyone in any way, I make restitution of it fourfold.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Jesus turned to him and said, To-day, salvation has been brought to
this house; he too is a son of Abraham.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` That is what the Son of Man has come for, to search out and to save
what was lost.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` While they stood listening, he went on and told them a parable;
this was because he had now nearly reached Jerusalem, and they supposed
that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He told them, then, There was a man of noble birth, who went away
to a distant country, to have the royal title bestowed on him, and so
return.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And he summoned ten of his servants, to whom he gave ten pounds,
and said to them, Trade with this while I am away.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But his fellow citizens hated him, and sent ambassadors after him
to say, We will not have this man for our king.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Afterwards, when he came back as king, he sent for the servants to
whom he had entrusted the money, to find out how much each of them had
gained by his use of it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The first came before him and said, Lord, thy pound has made ten
pounds.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he said to him, Well done, my true servant: since thou hast
been faithful over a very little, thou shalt have authority over ten
cities.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The second came and said, Lord, thy pound has made five pounds;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and to him he said, Thou too shalt have authority, over five
cities.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then another came and said, Lord, here is thy pound; I have kept it
laid up in a handkerchief.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I was afraid of thee, knowing how exacting a man thou art; thou
dost claim what thou didst never venture, dost reap what thou didst
never sow.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he said to him, Thou false servant, I take thy judgement from
thy own lips. Thou knewest that I was an exacting man, claiming what I
never ventured and reaping what I never sowed;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` then why didst thou not put my money into the bank, so that I might
have recovered it with interest when I came?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then he gave orders to those who stood by, Take the pound away from
him, and give it to the man who has ten pounds.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` (They said to him, Lord, he has ten pounds already.)
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Nay, but I tell you, if ever a man is rich, gifts will be made to
him, and his riches will abound; if he is poor, even the little he has
will be taken from him.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But as for those enemies of mine, who refused to have me for their
king, bring them here and kill them in my presence.✻
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And when he had spoken thus, he went on his way, going up to
Jerusalem.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` After this, when he was approaching Bethphage and Bethany, close to
the mountain which is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples on an
errand;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Go into the village that faces you, he told them, and as you enter
it you will find a colt tethered there, one on which no man has yet
ridden; untie it and bring it here.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And if anybody asks you, Why are you untying it? this must be your
answer, The Lord has need of it.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So the two he had appointed went on their way, and found the colt
standing there, just as he had told them.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` As they were untying it, its owners asked them, Why are you untying
the colt?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` So they brought the colt to Jesus, and spread out their garments on
it, and bade Jesus mount.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` As he went, they strewed the road with their garments;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and when he drew near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole
company of his disciples began rejoicing and praising God for all the
miracles they had seen.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Blessed is the king, they said, who comes in the name of the Lord;
peace in heaven, glory above.✻
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Some of the Pharisees who were among the multitude said to him,
Master, rebuke thy disciples;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` but he answered, I tell you, if they should keep silence, the
stones will cry out instead.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And as he drew near, and caught sight of the city, he wept over it,
and said:
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Ah, if thou too couldst understand, above all in this day that is
granted thee, the ways that can bring thee peace! As it is, they are
hidden from thy sight.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` The days will come upon thee when thy enemies will fence thee round
about, and encircle thee, and press thee hard on every side,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` and bring down in ruin both thee and thy children that are in thee,
not leaving one stone of thee upon another; and all because thou didst
not recognize the time of my visiting thee.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Then he went into the temple, and began driving out those who sold
and bought there;
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` It is written, he told them, My house is a house of prayer; and you
have made it into a den of thieves.✻
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And he taught in the temple daily. The chief priests and scribes
and the leading men among the people were eager to make away with him,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` but they could not find any means to do it, because all the people
hung upon his words.✻
