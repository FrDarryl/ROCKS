"1" = ''':sup:`1` Soon after this, one of the Lord’s feast-days came round, and
Tobias, his table richly spread,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` would have his son go out and invite fellow-tribesmen and
fellow-worshippers of theirs, to share the banquet.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Go out he did, but came back bearing ill news; he had found an
Israelite lying murdered in the open street. His father, without more
ado, sprang up from where he sat, leaving his dinner untasted; he would
not break his fast till he had found the body,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` wrapped it about and carried it home with him, to bury it in secret
when night fell.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` A sad and anxious meal was his, with such a guest hidden under his
roof;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` he remembered those words the Lord had put into the mouth of Amos,
Your feast-days shall end in lamentation and sad thoughts.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Night fell at last, and the body was buried in safety;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` but his neighbours shook their heads over it, Here was sentence of
death passed on thee for such doings of thine; from that sentence thou
wast barely reprieved, and art thou back at thy grave-digging?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But still Tobias feared God much, and the king little; still the
bodies of murdered men were stolen away, hidden in his house, and at
dead of night buried.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But toil brought weariness, and one morning, when he came home, he
threw himself down in the shadow of the wall, and quickly fell asleep.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` As he slept, warm droppings from a swallow’s nest fell into his
eyes, and he became blind.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This was but a trial which the Lord allowed to befall him, so that
he might leave to later ages, as God’s servant Job did, a document of
patience.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Here was a man that had feared God and obeyed his commandments from
infancy; he was smitten with blindness; did he thereupon complain, God
was using him ill?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` No, he remained as stout-hearted a worshipper of God as before, and
never a day passed but he returned thanks for the gift of life.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Kinsman and clansman might taunt him, as Job was taunted by his
fellow chieftains; might call him a fool for his pains,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and ask whether this was the reward he had hoped for when he gave
alms, and went a-burying;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Tobias took them up short. Nay, said he, never talk thus;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` we come of holy stock, you and I, and God has life waiting for us
if we will but keep faith with him.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` His wife Anna went every day to work at the loom, bringing home
what earnings she could;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and one day it was a kid that was given her for her wages. When she
brought this home,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` and its bleating reached her husband’s ears, he made great ado for
fear it had been stolen; Nay, he said, this must be restored to its
owner; never shall it be said that we ate stolen food, or soiled our
hands with theft!

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Fine talk,✻ said she, but the like hopes have played thee false
already; what hast thou to shew, now, for all thy almsgiving?

"23" = ''':sup:`23` With such taunts as these even his wife assailed him.✻
