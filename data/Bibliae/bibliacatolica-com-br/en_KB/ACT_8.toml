"1" = ''':sup:`1` The church in Jerusalem was much persecuted at this time, and all
except the apostles were scattered about over the countryside of Judaea
and Samaria.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Stephen was buried by devout men, who mourned greatly over him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Saul, meanwhile, was making havoc of the church; he made his way
into house after house, carrying men and women off and committing them
to prison.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Those who had been driven away spread the gospel as they went from
place to place;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and Philip, who had gone down to one of the cities of Samaria,
preached Christ there.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The multitude listened with general accord to what Philip said, as
their own eyes and ears witnessed the miracles he did.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` There were many possessed by unclean spirits, and these came out,
crying aloud;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` many, too, were healed of the palsy, and of lameness,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and there was great rejoicing in that city. And there was a man
called Simon, who had been in the city before Philip came there,
misleading the people of Samaria with sorcery, and pretending to have
great powers,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` so that high and low hung upon his words; This, they said, is an
angel called the great angel of God.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Long misled by his sorceries, they continued to pay attention to
him,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` until Philip came and preached to them about God’s kingdom. Then
they found faith and were baptized, men and women alike, in the name of
Jesus Christ;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and Simon, who had found faith and been baptized with the rest,
kept close to Philip’s side; he was astonished by the great miracles
and signs he saw happening.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And now the apostles at Jerusalem, hearing that Samaria had
received the word of God, sent Peter and John to visit them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So these two came down and prayed for them, that they might receive
the Holy Spirit,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` who had not, as yet, come down on any of them; they had received
nothing so far except baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then the apostles began to lay their hands on them, so that the
Holy Spirit was given them,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and Simon, seeing that the Holy Spirit was granted through the
imposition of the apostles’ hands, offered them money;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Let me too, he said, have such powers that when I lay my hands on
anyone he will receive the Holy Spirit. Whereupon Peter said to him,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Take thy wealth with thee to perdition, thou who hast told thyself
that God’s free gift can be bought with money.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` There is no share, no part for thee in these doings; thy heart is
not true in the sight of God.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Repent of this baseness of thine, and pray to God, in the hope of
finding pardon for the thought which thy heart has conceived.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` I see plainly that a bitter poison has taken hold of thee; thou art
the bondsman of iniquity.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Simon answered, Pray for me to the Lord, that none of this harm
you have spoken of may fall upon me.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So, when they had borne their full witness and preached the word of
the Lord, they began their journey back to Jerusalem, carrying the
gospel into many Samaritan villages.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Meanwhile, Philip was commanded by an angel of the Lord, Rise up,
and go south to meet the road which leads from Jerusalem to Gaza, out
in the desert.✻
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So he rose up and went; and found there an Ethiopian. This man was
a eunuch, a courtier of Candace, queen of Ethiopia, and had charge of
all her wealth; he had been up to worship at Jerusalem,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and was now on his way home, driving along in his chariot and
reading the prophet Isaias.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The Spirit said to Philip, Go up to that chariot and keep close by
it.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Philip, as he ran up, heard him reading the prophet Isaias, and
asked, Canst thou understand what thou art reading?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` How could I, said he, without someone to guide me? And he entreated
Philip to come up and sit beside him.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The passage of scripture which he was reading was this; He was led
away like a sheep to be slaughtered; like a lamb that is dumb before
its shearer, he would not open his mouth.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He was brought low, and all his rights taken away; who shall tell
the story of his age? His life is being cut off from the earth.✻
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And the eunuch turned to Philip, and said, Tell me, about whom does
the prophet say this? Himself, or some other man?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then Philip began speaking, and preached to him about Jesus, taking
this passage as his theme.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` As they went on their way, they came to a piece of water, and the
eunuch said, See, there is water here; why may I not be baptized?
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Philip said, If thou dost believe with all thy heart, thou mayest.
And he answered, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.✻
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` So he had the chariot stopped, and both of them, Philip and the
eunuch, went down into the water, and Philip baptized him there.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` But when they came up from the water, Philip was carried off by the
spirit of the Lord, and the eunuch did not see him any longer; he went
on his way rejoicing.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` As for Philip, he was next heard of at Azotus; and from there he
went preaching all round the villages, until he reached Caesarea.
