"3" = ''':sup:`3` How sayest thou? Should not we two hurry on together, and leave thy

her husband, Thy son! He is coming!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thy home once reached, Raphael said to Tobias, pay worship to the
Lord thy God first, and return thanks to him. Then go up to thy father,
and embrace him,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` and rub on his eyes, without more ado, some of the fish’s gall thou

"18" = ''':sup:`18` It was a week before his daughter-in-law Sara reached Nineve, with

her, and the camels, and all the money she was dowered with, besides
the sum paid over by Gabelus.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Meanwhile, her husband told his parents the whole story; all the
mercies God had shewn him through the man that was his guide.
