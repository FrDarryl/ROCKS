"1" = ''':sup:`1` Once this earthly tent-dwelling of ours has come to an end, God, we
are sure, has a solid building waiting for us, a dwelling not made with
hands, that will last eternally in heaven.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And indeed, it is for this that we sigh, longing for the shelter of
that home which heaven will give us,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` if death, when it comes, is to find us sheltered, not defenceless
against the winds.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yes, if we tent-dwellers here go sighing and heavy-hearted, it is
not because we would be stripped of something; rather, we would clothe
ourselves afresh; our mortal nature must be swallowed up in life.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For this, nothing else, God was preparing us, when he gave us the
foretaste of his Spirit.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` We take heart, then, continually, since we recognize that our
spirits are exiled from the Lord’s presence so long as they are at home
in the body,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` with faith, instead of a clear view, to guide our steps.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` We take heart, I say, and have a mind rather to be exiled from the
body, and at home with the Lord;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` to that end, at home or in exile, our ambition is to win his favour.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` All of us have a scrutiny to undergo before Christ’s
judgement-seat, for each to reap what his mortal life has earned, good
or ill, according to his deeds.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` It is, then, with the fear of the Lord before our minds that we try
to win men over by persuasion; God recognizes us for what we are, and
so I hope, does your better judgement.✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` No, we are not trying to recommend ourselves to your favour afresh;
we are shewing you how to find material for boasting of us, to those
who have so much to boast of outwardly, and nothing inwardly.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Are these wild words? Then take them as addressed to God. Or sober
sense? Then take them as addressed to yourselves.✻
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` With us, Christ’s love is a compelling motive, and this is the
conviction we have reached; if one man died on behalf of all, then all
thereby became dead men;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Christ died for us all, so that being alive should no longer mean
living with our own life, but with his life who died for us and has
risen again;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and therefore, henceforward, we do not think of anybody in a merely
human fashion; even if we used to think of Christ in a human fashion,
we do so no longer;✻
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` it follows, in fact, that when a man becomes a new creature in
Christ, his old life has disappeared, everything has become new about
him.✻
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` This, as always, is God’s doing; it is he who, through Christ, has
reconciled us to himself, and allowed us to minister this
reconciliation of his to others.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Yes, God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,
establishing in our hearts his message of reconciliation, instead of
holding men to account for their sins.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` We are Christ’s ambassadors, then, and God appeals to you through
us; we entreat you in Christ’s name, make your peace with God.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Christ never knew sin, and God made him into sin for us, so that in
him we might be turned into the holiness of God.
