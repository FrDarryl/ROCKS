haste all that is in thy heart. God sees as heaven sees, thou as earth;
few words are best.

comes ill-considered speech.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Vow to God if thou utterest, without delay perform it, he will have
no light and rash promises; vow made must be vow paid.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Far better undertake nothing than undertake what thou dost not
fulfil.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Wouldst thou defile thy whole nature through the tongue’s fault?
Wouldst thou find thyself saying, with God’s angel to hear thee, No
thought I gave to it?✻ Little wonder if God disappoints every ambition
of the man who speaks so.

thyself rather with the fear of God.✻

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thou seest, it may be, in this province or that, oppression of the
poor, false award given, and wrong unredressed? Let not such things
bewilder thee; trust me, authority is watched by higher authority,
subject in turn to higher authority yet;

"9" = ''':sup:`9` What is his decree? Why, that covetousness should never fill its own
maw; never did he that loved money taste the enjoyment of his money;✻
here is frustration once again.

Notas de rodapé:
5:1-2 - The author advises caution when speaking and making promises
before God. Words have power, and reverence when entering God's
presence is essential. God values sincerity in worship and prayer (see
5:4-5 - Keeping vows to God is a key principle. Breaking promises can
have spiritual consequences, demonstrating that it is better not to
promise than to promise and not fulfill (see also Deuteronomy 23:21 and
05:10 - The relentless pursuit of wealth never brings complete
satisfaction. The love of money can lead to an insatiable cycle of
desire, contrasting with the true joy that comes from God (see also
05:12 - Honest work brings peace, while accumulated wealth often brings
unrest and worry. This highlights the importance of being content with
4:11-12).
5:18-20 - The author concludes that true blessing lies in enjoying the
work and blessings God provides. Contentment in God is the key to a
128:2).
