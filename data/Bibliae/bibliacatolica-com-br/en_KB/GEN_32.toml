"1" = ''':sup:`1` Jacob, too, set out to continue his journey, and as he went, God’s
angels met him.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This is God’s encampment, he said when he saw them, and called the
place Mahanaim, which means a Camp.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And now he sent messengers of his own on before him, to greet his
brother Esau in the country of Seir, which is Edom’s territory.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` These were his directions, You are to tell my lord Esau this, from
his brother Jacob: I have been living abroad, on a visit to Laban, and
am but just returned.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I have brought back oxen and asses and sheep, men-servants and
women-servants with me. And now, my lord, I have sent these envoys to
thee, to secure thy good will.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And this was the news the messengers brought back with them, We
found thy brother Esau; even now he comes hastening to meet thee, with
four hundred men.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` At this, Jacob was overcome with terror, and in his extremity he
divided up his followers, the flocks of sheep, too, and the cattle, and
the camels, into two companies;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` If Esau, he thought, should meet with one company, and fall upon it,
at least the other will come through safely.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And now Jacob said, O God of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, thou,
Lord, who hast bidden me return to my own country, the land of my
birth, and hast offered to bless me,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I, thy servant, am not worthy of all the mercies thou hast shewn
me, the faithful observance of thy promises. I had nothing but this
staff with me, when I crossed the Jordan, and now I have come back with
two companies behind me.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Save me now from the power of my brother Esau; I fear grievously
that when he comes he will spare neither women nor children.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Hast thou not promised me thy continued favour, and a posterity
spread wide as the sand by the sea, that is beyond all counting?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he had slept the night there, he chose out of all his
possessions a present for his brother Esau,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` two hundred she-goats and twenty buck-goats, two hundred ewes and
twenty rams,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` thirty camels in milk with their colts, forty cows and twenty
bulls, and twenty she-asses with ten colts.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` All these he sent on, with their drivers; Go on in front of me, he
told his men, and leave a space between one herd and the next.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And to the first of these, his directions were, If thou shouldst
encounter my brother Esau, and he should ask, Whose man art thou? or
Whither goest thou? or Whose are these beasts thou tendest?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` thy answer is to be, They belong to thy servant Jacob, who is
sending them as a present to my lord Esau; and he himself follows
behind us.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then he bade the second do the like, and the third, and all the
drovers in turn; these same words you are to use, he said, when you
fall in with Esau,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and be sure to add, Thy servant Jacob follows on behind us. I will
not see him, he thought, until I have disarmed his anger with the gifts
I have sent before me; then perhaps he will be well disposed towards
me!✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So the gifts went on in advance of him, and he waited in the camp
all night.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But before dawn he rose, and took his two wives, their
serving-women, and his eleven sons, across the ford of Jaboc.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And now he had set down all that was his on the further side,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and he was left there alone. And there one appeared to him who
wrestled with him until the day broke.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` At last, finding that he could not get the better of Jacob, he
touched the sinew of his thigh, which all at once withered;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` then he said, Let me go, the dawn is up. But Jacob answered, I will
not let thee go until thou givest me thy blessing.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` What is thy name? asked the other, and when he heard that it was
Jacob,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Jacob, he said, is no name for thee, thou shalt be called Israel,
one that prevails with God.✻ If thou hast held thy own with God, how
wilt thou prevail over men!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Tell me, asked Jacob, what is thy own name? Why wouldst thou know
my name? he answered, and gave him there and then, his blessing.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So Jacob called the place Phanuel, the Face of God; I have seen God
face to face, he said, and my life was not forfeit.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` As soon as he passed beyond Phanuel, the sun rose, and he went
limping on one foot;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` that is why the race of Israel, to this day, will not eat the sinew
of the thigh, in which Jacob’s strength failed him, the sinew of his
thigh that withered when it was touched.
