'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Came the Assyrian from the northern hills in his great strength, the
valleys choked with his marching columns, the mountain glens black with
his horses;

"6" = ''':sup:`6` to send fire through our country-side, put our warriors to the
sword, mark down our children for slavery, our maidens for spoil.

woman’s power for his death-blow.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Not by warriors’ hands the tyrant fell; not giants smote him, not
heroes of the old time barred his path; it was Judith, Merari’s

"13" = ''':sup:`13` loud rang the cry of the Assyrian camp, when the hard-pressed
defenders sallied out against them, parched with thirst!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Slaves, did they call us? But we gave them cold steel; cut them
down where, like slaves, they ran; one glance from the Lord our God,
and the battle was lost.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` A hymn, a new hymn, sing we to the Lord our God.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Great and glorious thou art, Lord Adonai; there is no outmatching
thy wondrous power.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Let all thy creatures do thee service; were they not made at thy
word, fashioned by a breath from thee? When thou commandest, none but

they must and bear their pain for ever.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` And now, their victory won, all went to Jerusalem to worship the
Lord there; once they were cleansed of defilement, burnt-sacrifice was
done, vow and promise were paid by all alike.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` As for Judith, she kept none of Holofernes’ spoil, that the people
had given her, nor the canopy she had carried off from his
banqueting-room, for herself; she offered them up as a thing forfeit.✻

three whole months they solemnized their victory, and Judith among
them.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then they dispersed to their homes, and Judith, back at Bethulia,
was held in great renown; in all Israel, none so honoured as she.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So well, in her, did chastity mate with valour; once her husband
was dead, she never had knowledge of man again.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When she left her house on festival days, great reverence was hers
indeed.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And for the serving-maid, Judith let her go free.There, then,
Judith lived on in her husband’s dwelling-place, and a hundred and five
years had passed before she was laid to rest at his side at Bethulia;
