"1" = ''':sup:`1` And this is the rule which governs the offering of a victim for
wrong done.✻ Such a victim is set apart for holy uses,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and must be immolated where burnt-sacrifices are immolated; its
blood must be poured round the altar.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The parts which must be offered are the tail, and the fat which
covers the entrails,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the two kidneys and the fat that is close to them, and with the
kidneys the caul of the liver.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All these the priest will burn on the altar, as a burnt-sacrifice to
the Lord in amends for the wrong done;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` the flesh of the victim is set apart for holy uses, but it may be
eaten by any male person belonging to the priestly family.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Victims are to be offered for a wrong done just as they are for a
fault; the rule is the same for either, and either victim belongs to
the priest who offers it.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The priest who offers a victim in burnt-sacrifice, may keep the skin
for himself;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and every offering of flour cooked in the oven, or prepared with
gridiron or pan, is made over to the priest who offers it;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` kneaded with oil or dry, such gifts must be divided equally between
all the men of Aaron’s race.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And this is the rule which governs the welcome-offerings that are
brought to the Lord.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` If it is a thank-offering, there must be loaves of unleavened bread
kneaded with oil, unleavened cakes with oil poured over them, pastry
kneaded with oil,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and loaves, too with leaven in them. All these must go with the
victim which is immolated as a welcome-offering in thanksgiving;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and one of each must be offered to the Lord as first-fruits, so
that it will belong to the priest who sheds the victim’s blood.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The flesh of the victim must be eaten the same day, none of it left
till the morrow.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If the offering is made in performance of a vow, or simply from
devotion, it should be eaten on the same day; but if any is left till
the morrow, it may still be eaten;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` whatever the third day finds still unfinished must be destroyed by
fire.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` If any such flesh is eaten on the third day, the offering will be
null and void, and the giver will have no advantage from it; indeed,
whoever contaminates himself by eating such food is guilty of an
offence.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If it has touched anything unclean, it must be destroyed by fire,
not eaten. Only one who is free from defilement may partake of it;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` the man who eats any of the victim for a welcome-offering, when he
is himself defiled, is lost to his people;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and he, too, who eats such flesh after touching any defilement left
by man or beast, or anything that makes him unclean.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the Lord spoke to Moses,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` giving him this message for the sons of Israel: You are not to eat
the fat of sheep or ox or goat;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but you may keep the fat of anything that falls dead or is killed
by a wild beast, for various uses.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Anyone who eats the fat which ought to be offered, as part of the
Lord’s burnt-sacrifice, is lost to his people.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Nor must you use the blood of any living thing, bird or beast, as
food;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` whoever consumes the blood, is lost to his people.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And the Lord spoke to Moses
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` giving him this message, too, for the sons of Israel: The man who
brings the Lord a welcome-offering must surrender, in doing so, his
sacrificial due, the choice portions of the victim.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He will carry with him the fat and the breast of the victim, and
both these, when they have been held up in sign of consecration to the
Lord, he will hand over to the priest,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` who will burn the fat on the altar, while the breast belongs, as
their due, to Aaron and his sons.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The right shoulder of the victim slain in welcome-offering is also
the priest’s prerogative;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` whichever of Aaron’s sons offers the blood and the fat, is to have
the right shoulder for his portion.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The breast that is held up in sign of consecration, the shoulder
that is separated from the rest, are the portions of the
welcome-offering which I demand of the Israelites; making them over to
Aaron, my priest, and to his descendants, as a right due to them at all
times from the sons of Israel.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Such are the privileges✻ Aaron and his sons enjoy in the worship
offered to the Lord, ever since the day when Moses presented them to
him to be his priests;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` such gifts the Lord bade the Israelites bestow upon them by a right
unalterable, age after age.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Thus far the rules which govern burnt-sacrifice,✻ and sacrifices
for a fault or a wrong done, for the hallowing of priests, and for the
victims used in welcome-offering,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` as the Lord prescribed them to Moses on mount Sinai, when he
commanded the sons of Israel, there in the desert of Sinai, to bring
him their offerings.

Notas de rodapé:
7:1-7 - The rules for guilt offerings reinforce the need for atonement
and restitution. God demands reparation for those who have been
wronged, which underscores His just and merciful character (see also
7:8-10 - The priests received specific portions of the sacrifices,
showing that their sustenance came directly from their service to the
Lord. This principle reflects God's provision for those who serve Him
7:11-15 - The offering of thanksgiving reflects recognition of God's
blessings and His constant care. The act of offering sacrifices in
gratitude is a reminder that everything we have comes from God (see
7:16-18 - The offering of freewill sacrifice highlights the value of
giving willingly to the Lord. God appreciates offerings made from a
50:14).
7:19-21 - The prohibition against eating unclean meat emphasizes the
holiness God requires of His people. Ceremonial purity symbolizes
separation from sin and commitment to a righteous life before God (see
