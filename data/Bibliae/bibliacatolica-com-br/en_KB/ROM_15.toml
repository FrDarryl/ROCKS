[15]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` No, we who are bold in our confidence ought to bear with the
scruples of those who are timorous; not to insist on having our own
way.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Each of us ought to give way to his neighbour, where it serves a
good purpose by building up his faith.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Christ, after all, would not have everything his own way; Was it not
uttered against thee, says the scripture, the reproach I bore?✻
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` (See how all the words written long ago were written for our
instruction; we were to derive hope from that message of endurance and
courage which the scriptures bring us.)
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` May God, the author of all endurance and all encouragement, enable
you to be all of one mind according to the mind of Christ Jesus,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` so that you may all have but one heart and one mouth, to glorify
God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` You must befriend one another, as Christ has befriended you, for
God’s honour.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I would remind those who are circumcised, that Christ came to
relieve their needs; God’s fidelity demanded it; he must make good his
promises to our fathers.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And I would remind the Gentiles to praise God for his mercy. So we
read in scripture, I will give thanks to thee for this, and sing of thy
praise, in the midst of the Gentiles;✻
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and again it says, You too, Gentiles, rejoice with his own people;✻
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the nations
of the world do him honour;✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and once more Isaias says, A root shall spring from Jesse, one who
shall rise up to rule the Gentiles; the Gentiles, in him, shall find
hope.✻
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` May God, the author of our hope, fill you with all joy and peace in
your believing; so that you may have hope in abundance, through the
power of the Holy Spirit.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It is not that I have any doubt of you, my brethren; I know that
you are full of good will, knowing all you need to know, so that you
can give advice to one another if need be;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and yet I have written to you, here and there, somewhat freely, by
way of refreshing your memory. So much I owe to the grace which God has
given me,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` in making me a priest of Jesus Christ for the Gentiles, with God’s
gospel for my priestly charge, to make the Gentiles an offering worthy
of acceptance, consecrated by the Holy Spirit.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I have, then, through Christ Jesus, some reason for confidence in
God’s sight.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It is not for me to give you any account of what Christ has done
through agents other than myself to secure the submission of the
Gentiles, by word and action,✻
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` in virtue of wonders and signs, done in the power of the Holy
Spirit. My own work has been to complete the preaching of Christ’s
gospel, in a wide sweep from Jerusalem as far as Illyricum.✻
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` It has been a point of honour with me to preach the gospel thus,
never in places where Christ’s name was already known; I would not
build on the foundation another man had laid,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but follow the rule of scripture, He shall be seen by those who had
had no tidings of him, he shall be made known to those who had never
heard of him.✻
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` This was the chief reason which prevented me from visiting you; it
has kept me back until now.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But now I can find no further scope in these countries, and I have
been eager, these many years past, to find my way to you;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` as soon, then, as I can set out on my journey to Spain, I hope to
see you in passing; and you shall put me on my way, when you have done
something to gratify this longing of mine.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` As I write, I am making a journey to Jerusalem, with an errand of
relief to the saints there.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` You must know that Macedonia and Achaia have thought fit to give
those saints at Jerusalem who are in need some share of their wealth;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` they have thought fit to do it, I say, and indeed, they are in
their debt. The Gentiles, if they have been allowed to share their
spiritual gifts, are bound to contribute to their temporal needs in
return.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When that is done, and I have seen this revenue safely in their
hands, you shall be a stage on my journey to Spain;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and I am well assured that when I visit you, I shall be able to
visit you in the fulness of Christ’s blessing.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Only, brethren, I entreat you by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the
love of the Holy Spirit, to give me the help of your prayers to God on
my behalf.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Pray that I may be kept safe from those who reject the faith in
Judaea, and that my mission to Jerusalem may be well received by the
saints there;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` so that I may reach you, God willing, glad at heart, and make
holiday with you.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` May God, the author of peace, be with you all, Amen.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
15:1-2 - Paul exhorts those who are strong in faith to bear with the
weaknesses of the weak, for the sake of building up the body of Christ.
The spirit of service and edification is essential for the unity of the
15:5-6 - Paul's prayer is that Christians would be of one mind and
glorify God with one heart and voice. Church unity is a priority in
15:13 - Paul asks the God of hope to fill Christians with joy and
peace, so that hope may abound by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Christian hope is a motivating force in times of difficulty (see also
