"1" = ''':sup:`1` At another time he went to Gaza, and would pass the night with a
harlot he had seen there.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The news came to the ears of the Philistines that Samson was in the
town, and they cut him off from escape by posting guards at the city
gate; no need to do anything while night lasted, they could kill him
next morning on his way out.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Samson slept on till midnight; then he rose up to go. Finding the
gates locked, he took them up, bar, gate-posts and all, put them on his
shoulder, and carried them to the top of the hill which looks down
towards Hebron.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` His next love was a woman called Dalila, who lived in the valley of
Sorec.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` To her the chiefs of the Philistines had recourse; Use all thy arts,
they said, and find out from him what it is that makes him so strong;
how we can get the better of him, make him a prisoner and have him at
our mercy. Do this for us, and each of us will give thee eleven hundred
pieces of silver.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Dalila asked Samson, Tell me, what makes thee so strong? What
bonds should a man use to bind thee, if he would have thee at his
mercy?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Bind me with seven strands of gut, still fresh and undried, Samson
told her, and I shall be no stronger than other men.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Such a cord the Philistine chiefs brought her, and she bound Samson
with it;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` meanwhile they lay concealed in her house, waiting in an inner room
to see what came of it. Samson, she cried, the Philistines! Whereupon
he broke through his bonds, as if they had been made of the refuse of
tow, and scorched besides. And about that strength of his, none was the
wiser.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It was but a jest, then, said Dalila; thou wert tricking me? Tell
me the truth this time; what bonds can bind thee?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` New ropes, he answered, that have never yet been used; bind me with
those, and never a man so weak as I.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So once more Dalila bound him, once more she cried, Samson, the
Philistines! And the men hidden in the inner room saw him break his
bonds like a thread.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` What, cried Dalila, still mocking me, still at thy lying? Tell me
what the right bonds are. Why, answered Samson, if thou shouldst weave
seven of the hairs on my head into that web of thine, and tie them to
the peg of the loom, and make it fast in the ground, then I should be
weak enough.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` This, too, Dalila did; but when she awoke him by crying Samson, the
Philistines! he rose to his feet carrying away peg and web and all.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Come, said Dalila, thou dost pretend to love me; wilt thou not let
me share thy thoughts? Three times thou hast put me off with lies,
instead of telling me the secret of thy great strength.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thus did she torment him, plying him with questions day after day,
and giving him no peace, till at last she crushed his spirit
altogether, and made life a burden to him;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and at last he told her the truth. I am a Nazirite, he said; that
is to say, I am consecrated to God from birth, and this hair of mine
has never felt the touch of steel. If my hair were cut, my strength
would leave me; I should lose it all, and become like other men.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` She could tell, now, that he was keeping nothing back from her, and
she sent a message to the Philistine chiefs, Come to my house this once
more; he has told me everything. So they came, and brought with them
the money they had promised her.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And now she made him lie down to sleep at her knees, with his head
in her lap, and called her manservant in.✻ And she cut off the seven
locks of Samson’s hair, resolved now to cast him off and spurn his
love.✻ All at once his strength left him;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and when she awoke him with her cry, Samson, the Philistines! it
was in vain that he sought to escape by shaking off his bonds as of
old.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The Lord was at his side no longer, and the Philistines held him
fast. First they blinded him, and then carried him off bound to Gaza,
where they made him work as a prisoner at the mill.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But now the hair began to grow again on the shorn head.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` After a while, the chiefs of the Philistines met to offer their god
Dagon high sacrifice, and to hold a banquet. What an enemy, they said,
was this Samson! And our god has given us the mastery of him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thereupon the common folk took up the same cry of praise; Our god
has given us the mastery, they said, over this enemy of ours, that so
ruined our lands, that slew so many.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And in their mirth, as they drank together after the banquet was
eaten, they had Samson brought in to provide sport for them. Provide
sport for them he did, set free for a while from his prison, standing
between two pillars, where they had made place for him.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then he said to the boy who was leading him about, Now guide my
hands to the two pillars that support the building; I would lean my
weight on them and rest a little.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The building was thronged with men and women both; all the chiefs
of the Philistines were there, and from the roof, with its balcony,
some three thousand men and women looked on while Samson provided them
with sport.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And now he called the Lord to his aid; Lord God, he said, bethink
thyself of me, and give me back, for this once, the strength I had of
old. One stroke of vengeance, my God, on the enemies who have robbed me
of both my eyes!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And with that, he caught the two pillars the building rested on,
one in his right hand and one in his left,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` crying out, Now, Samson, die with the Philistines! And he shook the
pillars with such force that the whole building fell and crushed the
chiefs of the Philistines, crushed all the throng that was there about
him. Great toll Samson took of them in his life-time, but greater as he
died.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And all his brethren and kindred went down to carry off his body,
which they buried in the tomb of his father Manue, between Saraa and
Esthaol. His rule over Israel had lasted twenty years.
