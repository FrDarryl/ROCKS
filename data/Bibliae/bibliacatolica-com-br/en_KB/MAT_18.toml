"1" = ''':sup:`1` The disciples came to Jesus at this time and said, Tell us, who is
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Whereupon Jesus called to his side a little child, to whom he gave a
place in the midst of them,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and said, Believe me, unless you become like little children again,
you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He is greatest in the kingdom of heaven who will abase himself like
this little child.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He who gives welcome to such a child as this in my name, gives
welcome to me.✻
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And if anyone hurts the conscience of one of these little ones, that
believe in me, he had better have been drowned in the depths of the
sea, with a mill-stone hung about his neck.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Woe to the world, for the hurt done to consciences! It must needs be
that such hurt should come, but woe to the man through whom it comes!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` If thy hand or thy foot is an occasion of falling to thee, cut it
off and cast it away from thee; better for thee to enter into life
crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet when thou art cast
into eternal fire.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And if thy eye is an occasion of falling to thee, pluck it out and
cast it away from thee; better for thee to enter into life with one
eye, than to have two eyes when thou art cast into the fires of hell.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` See to it that you do not treat one of these little ones with
contempt; I tell you, they have angels of their own in heaven, that
behold the face of my heavenly Father continually.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Tell me this, if a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has
gone astray, does he not leave those ninety-nine others on the
mountain-side, and go out to look for the one that is straying?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And if, by good fortune, he finds it, he rejoices more, believe me,
over that one, than over the ninety-nine which never strayed from him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So too it is not your heavenly Father’s pleasure that one of these
little ones should be lost.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If thy brother does thee wrong,✻ go at once and tax him with it, as
a private matter between thee and him; and so, if he will listen to
thee, thou hast won thy brother.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If he will not listen to thee, take with thee one or two more, that
the whole matter may be certified by the voice of two or three
witnesses.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If he will not listen to them, then speak of it to the church; and
if he will not even listen to the church, then count him all one with
the heathen and the publican.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` I promise you, all that you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,
and all that you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And moreover I tell you, that if two of you agree over any request
that you make on earth, it will be granted them by my Father who is in
heaven.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there in
the midst of them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then Peter came to him and asked, Lord, how often must I see my
brother do me wrong, and still forgive him; as much as seven times?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Jesus said to him, I tell thee to forgive, not seven wrongs, but
seventy times seven.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Here is an image of the kingdom of heaven; there was a king who
resolved to enter into a reckoning with his servants,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and had scarcely begun the reckoning, when one was brought before
him who was ten thousand talents in his debt.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He had no means of making payment; whereupon his master gave orders
that he should be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had,
and so the debt should be paid.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` With that the servant fell at his feet and said, Have patience with
me, and I will pay thee in full.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And his master, moved with pity for him, let the servant go and
discharged him of his debt.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So the servant went out, and met with a fellow servant of his, who
owed him a hundred pieces of silver; whereupon he caught hold of him
and took him by the throat, and said, Pay me all thou owest me.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` His fellow servant went down on his knees in entreaty; Have
patience with me, he said, and I will pay thee in full.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But the other refused; he went away and committed him to prison for
such time as the debt was unpaid.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The rest of the servants were full of indignation when they saw
this done, and went in to tell their master what had happened.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And so he was summoned by his master, who said to him, I remitted
all that debt of thine, thou wicked servant, at thy entreaty;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` was it not thy duty to have mercy on thy fellow servant, as I had
mercy on thee?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And his master, in anger, gave him over to be tortured until the
debt was paid.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` It is thus that my heavenly Father will deal with you, if brother
does not forgive brother with all his heart.
