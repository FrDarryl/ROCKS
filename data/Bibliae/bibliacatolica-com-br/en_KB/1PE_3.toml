these still refuse credence to the word; it is for their wives to win
them over, not by word but by example;

'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Your beauty must lie, not in braided hair, not in gold trinkets, not
in the dress you wear,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` but in the hidden features of your hearts, in a possession you can
never lose, that of a calm and tranquil spirit; to God’s eyes, beyond
price.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` It was thus that the holy women of old time adorned themselves,
those women who had such trust in God, and paid their husbands such
respect.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Think how obedient Sara was to Abraham, how she called him her lord;
if you would prove yourselves her children, live honestly, and let no
anxious thoughts disturb you.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` You, too, who are husbands must use marriage considerately, paying
homage to woman’s sex as weaker than your own. The grace of eternal
life belongs to both, and your prayers must not suffer interruption.✻

"8" = ''':sup:`8` In a word, think the same thoughts, all of you, and share the same
feelings; be lovers of the brethren. I would see you tender-hearted,
modest, and humble,

"9" = ''':sup:`9` not repaying injury with injury, or hard words with hard words, but
blessing those who curse you. This God’s call demands of you, and you
will inherit a blessing in your turn.

ambitions?

"14" = ''':sup:`14` If, after all, you should have to suffer in the cause of right,
yours is a blessed lot. Do not be afraid or disturbed at their threats;

"15" = ''':sup:`15` enthrone Christ as Lord in your hearts. If anyone asks you to give
an account of the hope which you cherish, be ready at all times to
answer for it,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` but courteously and with due reverence. What matters is that you
should have a clear conscience; so the defamers of your holy life in
Christ will be disappointed in their calumny.

behalf of our sins, he the innocent for us the guilty, so as to present

who lay in prison.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Long before, they had refused belief, hoping that God would be
patient with them, in the days of Noe. That ark which Noe was then
building, in which a few souls, eight in all, found refuge as they
passed through the waves,✻

"22" = ''':sup:`22` He sits, now, at the right hand of God, annihilating death, to make
us heirs of eternal life; he has taken his journey to heaven, with all
the angels and powers and princedoms made subject under his feet.✻
