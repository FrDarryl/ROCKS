"1" = ''':sup:`1` So ready I to answer, and ask they will not; so easy to be found,
and search for me is none! A people that will not call on my name; else
my own voice should whisper, I am here, I am close at hand.✻
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Outstretched these hands of mine, all the day long, to a nation of
rebels, straying this way and that as the mood takes them,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` openly defying me. Shrines hidden away in gardens, altars of brick!
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` See how they lodge in tombs, pass the night in the precincts of
strange gods;✻ eat swine’s flesh, and stew themselves broth of
forbidden things!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And all the while so scrupulous: Touch of thine would defile me!
What marvel, if my indignation smoulders yet? Nay, fire it is that
burns continually.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` See where the decree stands written in my presence, This shall not
be passed over; I will take vengeance, pour it out into their laps.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Sin of yours, the Lord says, sin of your fathers, that sacrificed on
mountain-tops, worshipped on the hill-sides in defiance of me; for all
these I must repay due measure, poured out into the lap; that is my
first task.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Thus says the Lord: If one sound grape is found in a cluster, the
cry is, Do not destroy it, there is a blessing in it. And I, for the
sake of my true servants, will not destroy root and branch;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I will leave Jacob a stock to breed from, settlers enough in Juda
for these mountains of mine; the men of my choice shall have their
portion, my servant shall dwell there.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Flocks there shall be, folded on the Plain,✻ and cattle resting in
the valley of Achor; of my people none shall be disappointed that had
recourse to me.
'''

forgotten, spread a table for the Powers of Fortune, and poured out
wine at it,✻
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` fortune that awaits you is the sword, you shall bow down to death.
My call unanswered, my voice unheard, you did ever what I forbade,
chose ever what I hated.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` This, then, is the sentence the Lord God pronounces; you shall be
hungry, while my servants have food, you shall be thirsty, while my
servants drink,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` you shall be disappointed, while my servants are glad. My servants
shall be light-hearted and sing, while you, with sad hearts, cry aloud,
groan in the heaviness of your spirits.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` A name you shall leave behind you to serve my chosen people as a
curse; the Lord God takes full toll. For his own servants he will have
a new name instead;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` By the God of truth shall be the blessing men invoke, By the God of
truth shall be the oath men take, in this land of mine henceforward.✻
Forgotten, the sorrows of past days, hidden away from my eyes.

remembered no longer, have no place in men’s thoughts.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Joy of yours, pride of yours, this new creation shall be; joy of
mine, pride of mine, Jerusalem and her folk, created anew.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I will rejoice in Jerusalem, take pride in my people, and the sound
of weeping and lament shall be heard among them no more.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` None shall die there unweaned from life; never an old man but lives
out his full time; young he dies that dies a hundred years old; so
brief a span, it shall be the curse pronounced on a sinner.✻
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Live they now to occupy the houses they built, enjoy the fruit of
the vines they planted,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` that once built houses for others to occupy, planted what others
should enjoy; my people shall live to the age of trees and see the work
of their own hands wear out before them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Not in vain they shall toil, these, my chosen, nor beget children
to see them overwhelmed by calamity; their race the Lord blesses, their
children shall be spared to them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Answer shall come ere cry for help is uttered, prayer find audience
while it is yet on their lips.

mountain, my sanctuary, there shall be no hurt done, the Lord says, no
life shall be forfeit.
