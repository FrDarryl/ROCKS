"1" = ''':sup:`1` And now, in the hundred and sixtieth year, came Alexander, a son of
Antiochus the Illustrious, and took possession of Ptolemais, where he
was received with royal honours.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` A great force king Demetrius levied, when he heard of it, and went
out to give him battle;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` at the same time, he wrote to Jonathan, in such loving terms as
should flatter his dignity.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` No time to be lost, thought he, in making friends with this man,
before he takes to comforting Alexander against us;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` for wrong done to himself, and his brother, and all his race, he
bears us a grudge yet.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So he empowered Jonathan to muster an army, and to make weapons of
war, as the ally of Syria; the hostages, too, in the citadel were to be
given back to him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read this letter aloud, not to
the townsfolk only, but to the citadel garrison,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` great was the fear fell on all who listened; here was Jonathan
commissioned to levy troops by the king’s own order!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The hostages were surrendered without more ado, and given back to
their parents;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and he himself took up his quarters in Jerusalem, where he set
about building up the city and repairing it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` It was the walls needed rebuilding, so he told his workmen; on
every side, the hill of Sion must be defended with hewn stone; and
punctually they obeyed him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` As for the alien folk that guarded the strongholds Bacchides had
left, they fled incontinently;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` what matter if their posts were abandoned? They were for home.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Only Bethsura was garrisoned now, and that by traitors to God’s law
and commandment; it was all the refuge they had.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` King Alexander heard of these overtures made by Demetrius; heard,
too, the story of Jonathan and his brethren, battles fought, and deeds
done, and labours endured.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Why, said he, this man has not his match anywhere; time it is we
should court his friendship and alliance.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` With that, he wrote him a letter, and these were the terms of it:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` King Alexander, to Jonathan his brother-prince, greeting!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` We have heard tell of thee, a man so valiant, and so well worthy of
our friendship;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` in token whereof, we appoint thee high priest of thy own race
henceforward, and to have the title of the King’s Friend. With that, he
sent him a purple robe and a gold crown; Take ever our part, said he,
and hold fast the bond of friendship.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So, when the seventh month came round, in the hundred and sixtieth
year, Jonathan clad himself with the sacred vesture at the feast of
Tent-dwelling; an army he levied besides, and made weapons of war in
great abundance.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Sick and sorry Demetrius was when he heard of these doings;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Here is an ill day’s work, said he, to let Alexander forestall us
in making alliance with the Jews, to his great comfort!
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` From me, too, they shall have a message of entreaty, they shall
have honours and gifts; the Jews shall be my good friends yet.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And thus he wrote: King Demetrius, to the people of the Jews,
greeting!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Here is welcome news we have of you; right well you have kept troth
with us, honouring the treaty when you might have taken part with our
enemies.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` In that loyal mind continue, and your good offices shall not go
unrewarded;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` much immunity you shall enjoy, much largesse receive.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` By these presents, I exempt both you and all Jews from the
poll-tax; salt-tax and coronation dues I remit and forgo, with my right
to a third part of your seed-corn,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and half your fruit-crop. From this day forward, now and for ever,
I resign all this; from Juda and from the three cantons of Samaria and
Galilee✻ lately added to it, there shall be no toll taken.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` For Jerusalem, it shall be a place set apart, a free city with its
own confines, mistress of its own tithe and tribute;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` nor claim I any rights over the citadel there, I make it over to
the high priest, to garrison it as he will.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` All persons of Jewish blood in all my realm that were taken away as
prisoners from Juda shall now be set free gratuitously, and no
distraint made on their revenues or cattle.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Feast-day and new moon and sabbath, and all other such solemnities
as are appointed to be observed, with the three days before and after
the feast itself, shall be days of immunity and respite for all the
Jews in my realm;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` nor any business done or debate moved to their detriment at such
times.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` In the king’s army, Jews may be enrolled up to the number of thirty
thousand, paid according to the common rate of the royal troops; and
the same shall be free to serve in all the fortified towns of our
empire.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Jews may be employed besides in all positions of trust, and
appointed governors,✻ yet live still by their own laws, that have royal
sanction in the land of Juda.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` The three cantons taken from Samaria and added to Judaea shall be
accounted part of Juda, under a single government, with no allegiance
but to the high priest.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Ptolemais, with all the country that lies about it, I hereby convey
as a free gift to the temple precincts at Jerusalem, to defray the
temple expenses.✻
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` To this gift I add a sum of fifteen thousand silver sicles yearly,
out of the royal dues that belong to me.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` With this sum, arrears shall be made good in payments for the
temple building, withheld till now by such as had charge of the matter;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and restitution made, to the priests now in office, for the five
thousand sicles that were confiscated year by year from the temple
treasury.✻
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Debtor to the king, whatever be the charge against him, that takes
sanctuary in the temple or its precincts, shall be left at liberty, and
no distraint made upon goods of his within these dominions.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Payment shall be made besides from the royal treasury for the
finishing and repairing of the temple fabric;
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` as also for building up and making strong the walls of Jerusalem,
and restoring the fortresses of Judaea.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` But in vain were such promises made to Jonathan and the Jewish
folk, nor credence found they any nor assent. Could they forget all the
mischief Demetrius had done in Israel, all the tyranny they had
endured?
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Alexander it was had all their good wishes; his was the first offer
of terms that reached them, and all the while it was his cause they
cherished.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` By this, Alexander had mustered a great force, and marched against
Demetrius.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` When the two kings met, it was Demetrius’ men took to their heels,
and Alexander gave chase, pressing them hard;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` fiercely the battle raged till sun-down, and before the day was
over, Demetrius fell.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Hereupon Alexander sent an embassy to Ptolemy, king of Egypt,
addressing him in these terms following.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Take notice I have returned to my kingdom, and sit now on the
throne of my fathers, in full possession of my princely rights. Would I
regain Syria, needs must I should overthrow Demetrius;
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` overthrow him I did, on field of battle, with all his army, and
here I sit in his place.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` And should we not be upon terms of friendship, thou and I? Let me
have thy daughter to wife; a niggardly wooer thou shalt not find me,
nor she either.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` And what answer made king Ptolemy? An auspicious day, said he, this
day of thy return to the land and throne of thy fathers!
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` Boon thy letter asks of me thou shalt have; but first meet we
together, face to face, yonder at Ptolemais; there will I pledge my
word to the articles thou namest.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` So here was king Ptolemy come from Egypt, with his daughter
Cleopatra, all the way to Ptolemais, in the hundred and sixty-second
year;
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` and there king Alexander met him and took his daughter Cleopatra to
wife, and they held the wedding with great magnificence, as kings will.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` King Alexander had sent word to Jonathan, he should come and keep
tryst with him;
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` so to Ptolemais Jonathan went with great state, and met the two
kings there. Gifts a many he made them, of silver and gold and much
else, and was high in favour with them.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` It chanced that certain Israelites, pestilent fellows of the
traitorous party, came there to bring charges against him. But to these
the king would not listen;
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` he would have Jonathan change his garments, and go clad in purple,
and when this was done, a seat he must have beside the king himself.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` Take him out into the heart of the city, Alexander said to his
vassals, and there make proclamation, none may bring charge against him
on any pretext, or in any fashion molest him.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` No thought had his accusers, when they heard such proclamation
made, and saw Jonathan there dressed in purple, but to escape, one and
all, as best they could;
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` he himself was loaded with honours, enrolled among the king’s chief
friends, and made a prince, with a share in the governance of the
kingdom.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` So Jonathan made his way back to Jerusalem undisturbed, and well
content.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` Then, in the hundred and sixty-fifth year, came Demetrius, son of
that other Demetrius, from the island of Crete, and landed in his
native country;
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` ill hearing indeed for Alexander, who returned at once to Antioch.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` Demetrius✻ gave command of his army to Apollonius, that was
governor of Coelesyria, and a great array it was he levied. From
Jamnia, where he took up his quarters, this Apollonius sent word to the
high priest Jonathan:
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` What, wilt thou defy us, and all alone? Here am I mocked and
flouted by the resistance offered me, up yonder in the hills!
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` Nay, if such confidence thou hast in thy own resources, come down
and meet us in the plain; try we conclusions there! Trust me, I am
master of the field;
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` what I am, what my troops are, thou shalt learn upon a little
enquiry; stand thou canst not, they will tell thee, before onslaught of
ours. Twice, on their native soil, thy fathers fled in disorder,
'''
"73" = ''':sup:`73` and wilt thou make head against such an array of horse and foot,
here in the plain, where rock is none, nor gravel-bed, to aid thy
flight?
'''
"74" = ''':sup:`74` Roused by this challenge, Jonathan marched out from Jerusalem with
a muster of ten thousand men; his brother Simon joined hands with him;
'''
"75" = ''':sup:`75` and together they appeared before the gates of Joppe. Enter they
might not, for Apollonius had a garrison there, but must needs attack
it;
'''
"76" = ''':sup:`76` whereupon the citizens took alarm, and themselves opened the gates.
Thus came Joppe into the power of Jonathan;
'''
"77" = ''':sup:`77` the news reached Apollonius, and he brought up three thousand
horse, with a great array of men besides.
'''
"78" = ''':sup:`78` To Azotus he marched, as if he meant to pass them by, but all the
while he was luring them on into the plain;✻ in horse lay his strength
and his confidence. To Azotus Jonathan followed him, and battle was
joined.
'''
"79" = ''':sup:`79` Apollonius, by a secret feint, had left a thousand horsemen
encamped in their rear;
'''
"80" = ''':sup:`80` so all at once Jonathan found himself cut off by an ambush. Round
his army they rode, casting javelins into the ranks, from morning till
night-fall;
'''
"81" = ''':sup:`81` but ever it stood firm, at Jonathan’s bidding, till the horses were
tired out at last.
'''
"82" = ''':sup:`82` Then, the force of the cavalry once spent, out came Simon with his
troops to attack the main body, which thereupon broke and fled.
'''
"83" = ''':sup:`83` Scattered over the open country, in vain they rallied at Azotus,
and took refuge in the precincts of their god Dagon;
'''
"84" = ''':sup:`84` both Azotus and all the neighbouring cities Jonathan burnt and
plundered, and Dagon’s temple, with all that took shelter there, was
burnt with the rest.
'''
"85" = ''':sup:`85` So perished, by sword and fire, some eight thousand men;
'''
"86" = ''':sup:`86` as for Jonathan, he had no sooner encamped before Ascalon, than the
townsfolk opened the gates to him, and gave him honourable welcome.
'''
"87" = ''':sup:`87` So Jonathan came back to Jerusalem, and the army behind him, laden
with spoils.
'''
"88" = ''':sup:`88` More than ever, when he heard of it, did king Alexander heap
honours upon him;
'''
"89" = ''':sup:`89` a buckle of gold he sent him, ever the gift kings make to men of
blood royal, and Accaron, with all the countryside about it, granted
him for his domain.
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
10:1-4 - Alexander Balas declares himself king of Syria, bringing
political uncertainty. Jonathan, however, uses this division to gain
influence and gain more power in favor of the Jews, demonstrating
10:15-20 - Alexander Balas offers Jonathan the position of high priest
as a tactic to secure his loyalty. This reflects Jonathan's skill in
negotiating with foreign powers to secure the religious and political
5:4).
10:21-25 - Jonathan accepts the title of high priest and leads the
celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles. This action solidifies his
position as religious and political leader, uniting the faith and
8:14-18).
10:46-50 - Jonathan confronts Demetrius's armies and achieves a
significant victory. This victory reaffirms the Maccabees' military
prowess and God's hand in their struggle for survival and freedom (see
10:66-69 - Jonathan strengthens alliances with foreign leaders and
expands his influence. This period of growth and security reflects
God's blessing on those who remain faithful in times of persecution
