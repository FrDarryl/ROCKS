"1" = ''':sup:`1` What then shall we say? Shall we persist in sin that grace may
abound? Of course not!
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` How can we who died to sin yet live in it?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Or are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were
baptized into his death?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that,
just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we
too might live in newness of life.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his,
we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` We know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful
body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to
sin.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For a dead person has been absolved from sin.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also
live with him.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death no
longer has power over him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` As to his death, he died to sin once and for all; as to his life,
he lives for God.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as (being) dead to
sin and living for God in Christ Jesus.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Therefore, sin must not reign over your mortal bodies so that you
obey their desires.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And do not present the parts of your bodies to sin as weapons for
wickedness, but present yourselves to God as raised from the dead to
life and the parts of your bodies to God as weapons for righteousness.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For sin is not to have any power over you, since you are not under
the law but under grace.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under
grace? Of course not!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do you not know that if you present yourselves to someone as
obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin,
which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But thanks be to God that, although you were once slaves of sin,
you have become obedient from the heart to the pattern of teaching to
which you were entrusted.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your
nature. For just as you presented the parts of your bodies as slaves to
impurity and to lawlessness for lawless ness, so now present them as
slaves to righteousness for sanctification.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` For when you were slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But what profit did you get then from the things of which you are
now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` But now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of
God, the benefit that you have leads to sanctification, and its end is
eternal life.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - God's grace should not be used as an excuse for sin, because as
Christians, we have died to sin. Life transformation is evidenced by
6:3-4 - Baptism symbolizes union with Christ in His death and
resurrection, being an act of rebirth to a new life in Christ (see also
6:6-7 - The old human nature was crucified with Christ, so that we are
now freed from the dominion of sin. Justification brings the freedom to
4:22-24).
6:12-14 - The Christian must not allow sin to reign in his mortal body,
but instead offer himself to God as an instrument of righteousness.
Corinthians 6:19-20).
06:23 - The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus. This verse is a crucial contrast between the fate of
3:16).
