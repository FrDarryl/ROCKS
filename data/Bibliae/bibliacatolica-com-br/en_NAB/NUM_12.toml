"1" = ''':sup:`1` While they were in Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on
the pretext of the marriage he had contracted with a Cushite woman.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` They complained, "Is it through Moses alone that the LORD speaks?
Does he not speak through us also?" And the LORD heard this.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now, Moses himself was by far the meekest man on the face of the
earth.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So at once the LORD said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, "Come out,
you three, to the meeting tent." And the three of them went.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then the LORD came down in the column of cloud, and standing at the
entrance of the tent, called Aaron and Miriam. When both came forward,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` he said, "Now listen to the words of the LORD: Should there be a
prophet among you, in visions will I reveal myself to him, in dreams
will I speak to him;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Not so with my servant Moses! Throughout my house he bears my trust:
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` face to face I speak to him, plainly and not in riddles. The
presence of the LORD he beholds. Why, then, did you not fear to speak
against my servant Moses?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So angry was the LORD against them that when he departed,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and the cloud withdrew from the tent, there was Miriam, a
snow-white leper! When Aaron turned and saw her a leper,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "Ah, my lord!" he said to Moses, "please do not charge us with the
sin that we have foolishly committed!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Let her not thus be like the stillborn babe that comes forth from
its mother's womb with its flesh half consumed."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Moses cried to the LORD, "Please, not this! Pray, heal her!"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But the LORD answered Moses, "Suppose her father had spit in her
face, would she not hide in shame for seven days? Let her be confined
outside the camp for seven days; only then may she be brought back."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the
people did not start out again until she was brought back.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` After that the people set out from Hazeroth and encamped in the
desert of Paran.

Notas de rodap√©:
12:1-2 - Miriam and Aaron criticize Moses because of his Cushite wife
and question his authority. This reflects the human tendency toward
jealousy and power struggles, even among those called by God (see also
12:3 - The description of Moses as the humblest man on earth
underscores the importance of humility in spiritual leadership. Moses
serves as an example of total dependence on God despite criticism (see
12:5-8 - God defends Moses, affirming his uniqueness as a prophet to
whom He speaks directly. This highlights Moses' distinctiveness and the
seriousness of questioning established divine authority (see also
12:9-10 - Miriam is struck with leprosy as punishment for her
rebellion. This shows that God takes disloyalty and defiance of His
authority seriously, but He also provides an opportunity for repentance
(see also 2 Kings 5:27 and Deuteronomy 28:27).
12:13-15 - Moses intercedes for Miriam, and God heals her after seven
days outside the camp. This demonstrates the power of intercession and
Moses' compassionate heart, and it also underscores the value of
1:9).
