"8" = ''':sup:`8` Oh, that I might have my request, and that God would grant what I
long for:

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Even that God would decide to crush me, that he would put forth his
hand and cut me off!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then I should still have consolation and could exult through

your possessions,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` Or to deliver me from the enemy, or to redeem me from oppressors?
