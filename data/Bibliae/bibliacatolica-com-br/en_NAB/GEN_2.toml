"1" = ''':sup:`1` Thus the heavens and the earth and all their array were completed.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Since on the seventh day God was finished with the work he had been
doing, he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had
undertaken.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he
rested from all the work he had done in creation.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Such is the story of the heavens and the earth at their creation. At
the time when the LORD God made the earth and the heavens--
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` while as yet there was no field shrub on earth and no grass of the
field had sprouted, for the LORD God had sent no rain upon the earth
and there was no man to till the soil,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but a stream was welling up out of the earth and was watering all
the surface of the ground--
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` the LORD God formed man out of the clay of the ground and blew into
his nostrils the breath of life, and so man became a living being.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and he
placed there the man whom he had formed.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Out of the ground the LORD God made various trees grow that were
delightful to look at and good for food, with the tree of life in the
middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` A river rises in Eden to water the garden; beyond there it divides
and becomes four branches.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The name of the first is the Pishon; it is the one that winds
through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The gold of that land is excellent; bdellium and lapis lazuli are
also there.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The name of the second river is the Gihon; it is the one that winds
all through the land of Cush.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The name of the third river is the Tigris; it is the one that flows
east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The LORD God then took the man and settled him in the garden of
Eden, to cultivate and care for it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The LORD God gave man this order: "You are free to eat from any of
the trees of the garden
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` except the tree of knowledge of good and bad. From that tree you
shall not eat; the moment you eat from it you are surely doomed to
die."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The LORD God said: "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will
make a suitable partner for him."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So the LORD God formed out of the ground various wild animals and
various birds of the air, and he brought them to the man to see what he
would call them; whatever the man called each of them would be its
name.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The man gave names to all the cattle, all the birds of the air, and
all the wild animals; but none proved to be the suitable partner for
the man.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So the LORD God cast a deep sleep on the man, and while he was
asleep, he took out one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The LORD God then built up into a woman the rib that he had taken
from the man. When he brought her to the man,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` the man said: "This one, at last, is bone of my bones and flesh of
my flesh; This one shall be called 'woman,' for out of 'her man' this
one has been taken."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his
wife, and the two of them become one body.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The man and his wife were both naked, yet they felt no shame.
