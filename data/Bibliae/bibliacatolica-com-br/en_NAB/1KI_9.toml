Notas de rodap√©:
9:1-3 - God appears to Solomon for the second time after the completion
of the Temple and the palace. He reaffirms His covenant, promising
blessings if Solomon and the people are obedient, but also warning of
the consequences of disobedience. God's faithfulness to His promises
9:4-5 - God promises Solomon that if he and his descendants walk before
Him with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David did, there will
always be a descendant on the throne of Israel. The importance of
obedience to the covenant is central to the prosperity of the kingdom
9:6-9 - God warns that if the people of Israel stray and worship other
gods, the Temple will be destroyed and Israel will become a disgrace
among the nations. This warning illustrates the conditional nature of
God's blessing, depending on the people's faithfulness (see also
9:10-14 - Solomon gives twenty cities in Galilee to Hiram, king of
Tyre, in exchange for his help in building the Temple. However, Hiram
is not pleased with the cities. This episode reflects the diplomatic
aspects of Solomon's reign and his complex political alliances (see
9:26-28 - Solomon establishes a fleet at Ezion Geber, which brings
great wealth to Israel. Solomon's naval success demonstrates his
commercial and economic dominance, strengthening the kingdom through
72:10).
