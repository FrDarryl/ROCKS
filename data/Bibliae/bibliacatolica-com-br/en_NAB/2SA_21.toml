"1" = ''':sup:`1` During David's reign there was a famine for three successive years.
David had recourse to the LORD, who said, "There is bloodguilt on Saul
and his family because he put the Gibeonites to death."
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the
Gibeonites were not Israelites, but survivors of the Amorites; and
although the Israelites had given them their oath, Saul had attempted
to kill them off in his zeal for the men of Israel and Judah.)
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` David said to the Gibeonites, "What must I do for you and how must I
make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of the LORD?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The Gibeonites answered him, "We have no claim against Saul and his
house for silver or gold, nor is it our place to put any man to death
in Israel." Then he said, "I will do for you whatever you propose."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They said to the king, "As for the man who was exterminating us and
who intended to destroy us that we might have no place in all the
territory of Israel,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` let seven men from among his descendants be given to us, that we may
dismember them before the LORD in Gibeon, on the LORD'S mountain." The
king replied, "I will give them up."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The king, however, spared Meribbaal, son of Jonathan, son of Saul,
because of the LORD'S oath that formed a bond between David and Saul's
son Jonathan.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But the king took Armoni and Meribbaal, the two sons that Aiah's
daughter Rizpah had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Saul's daughter
Merob that she had borne to Adriel, son of Barzillai the Meholathite,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and surrendered them to the Gibeonites. They then dismembered them
on the mountain before the LORD. The seven fell at the one time; they
were put to death during the first days of the harvest--that is, at the
beginning of the barley harvest.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, took sackcloth and spread it out for
herself on the rock from the beginning of the harvest until rain came
down on them from the sky, fending off the birds of the sky from
settling on them by day, and the wild animals by night.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When David was informed of what Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, the
concubine of Saul, had done,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` he went and obtained the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan from
the citizens of Jabesh-gilead, who had carried them off secretly from
the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them
at the time they killed Saul on Gilboa.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he had brought up from there the bones of Saul and of his son
Jonathan, the bones of those who had been dismembered were also
gathered up.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan were buried in the
tomb of his father Kish at Zela in the territory of Benjamin. After all
that the king commanded had been carried out, God granted relief to the
land.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` There was another battle between the Philistines and Israel. David
went down with his servants and fought the Philistines, but David grew
tired.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Dadu, one of the Rephaim, whose bronze spear weighed three hundred
shekels, was about to take him captive. Dadu was girt with a new sword
and planned to kill David,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` but Abishai, son of Zeruiah, came to his assistance and struck and
killed the Philistine. Then David's men swore to him, "You must not go
out to battle with us again, lest you quench the lamp of Israel."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` After this there was another battle with the Philistines in Gob. On
that occasion Sibbecai, from Husha, killed Saph, one of the Rephaim.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` There was another battle with the Philistines in Gob, in which
Elhanan, son of Jair from Bethlehem, killed Goliath of Gath, who had a
spear with a shaft like a weaver's heddle-bar.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` There was another battle at Gath in which there was a man of large
stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each
foot--twenty-four in all. He too was one of the Rephaim.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And when he insulted Israel, Jonathan, son of David's brother
Shimei, killed him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` These four were Rephaim in Gath, and they fell at the hands of
David and his servants.
