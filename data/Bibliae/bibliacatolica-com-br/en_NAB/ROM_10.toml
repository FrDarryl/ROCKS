"1" = ''':sup:`1` Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God on their behalf is for
salvation.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I testify with regard to them that they have zeal for God, but it is
not discerning.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For, in their unawareness of the righteousness that comes from God
and their attempt to establish their own (righteousness), they did not
submit to the righteousness of God.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For Christ is the end of the law for the justification of everyone
who has faith.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from (the) law, "The
one who does these things will live by them."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But the righteousness that comes from faith says, "Do not say in
your heart, 'Who will go up into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ
down)
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` or 'Who will go down into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up
from the dead)."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in
your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we preach),
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` for, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe
in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For one believes with the heart and so is justified, and one
confesses with the mouth and so is saved.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For the scripture says, "No one who believes in him will be put to
shame."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is
Lord of all, enriching all who call upon him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But how can they call on him in whom they have not believed? And
how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how can
they hear without someone to preach?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And how can people preach unless they are sent? As it is written,
"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring (the) good news!"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But not everyone has heeded the good news; for Isaiah says, "Lord,
who has believed what was heard from us?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thus faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes
through the word of Christ.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But I ask, did they not hear? Certainly they did; for "Their voice
has gone forth to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the
world."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But I ask, did not Israel understand? First Moses says: "I will
make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a senseless nation
I will make you angry."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Isaiah speaks boldly and says: "I was found (by) those who
were not seeking me; I revealed myself to those who were not asking for
me."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But regarding Israel he says, "All day long I stretched out my
hands to a disobedient and contentious people."

10:9-13 - Confessing faith in Jesus Christ is fundamental to salvation.
Paul emphasizes the importance of believing and confessing with the
mouth, emphasizing that there is no distinction between Jews and
10:14-17 - The preaching of the gospel is essential for salvation, and
Paul emphasizes the need to send preachers so that everyone can hear
the message of Christ. Faith comes by hearing the word of Christ (see
10:18-21 - Paul asserts that the gospel has already been proclaimed to
all, and Israel's refusal to accept Christ fulfills Scripture.
Rejection of God and rejection of the gospel are recurring themes in
10:1-2 - Paul expresses the desire for his fellow Jews to be saved, but
notes that they seek righteousness through works of the law rather than
10:5-8 - Paul contrasts righteousness based on the law with
righteousness by faith. Righteousness by faith in Christ is accessible
to all, requiring no great deeds, but merely the acceptance of the
