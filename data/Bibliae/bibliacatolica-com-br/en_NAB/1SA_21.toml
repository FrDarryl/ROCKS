"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then David departed on his way, while Jonathan went back into the
city.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` David went to Ahimelech, the priest of Nob, who came trembling to
meet him and asked, "Why are you alone? Is there no one with you?"
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` David answered the priest: "The king gave me a commission and told
me to let no one know anything about the business on which he sent me
or the commission he gave me. For that reason I have arranged a meeting
place with my men.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now what have you on hand? Give me five loaves, or whatever you can
find."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But the priest replied to David, "I have no ordinary bread on hand,
only holy bread; if the men have abstained from women, you may eat some
of that."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` David answered the priest: "We have indeed been segregated from
women as on previous occasions. Whenever I go on a journey, all the
young men are consecrated--even for a secular journey. All the more so
today, when they are consecrated at arms!"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So the priest gave him holy bread, for no other bread was on hand
except the showbread which had been removed from the LORD'S presence
and replaced by fresh bread when it was taken away.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` One of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD;
his name was Doeg the Edomite, and he was Saul's chief henchman.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` David then asked Ahimelech: "Do you have a spear or a sword on hand?
I brought along neither my sword nor my weapons, because the king's
business was urgent."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The priest replied: "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you
killed in the Vale of the Terebinth, is here (wrapped in a mantle)
behind an ephod. If you wish to take that, take it; there is no sword
here except that one." David said: "There is none to match it. Give it
to me!"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` That same day David took to flight from Saul, going to Achish, king
of Gath.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But the servants of Achish said, "Is this not David, the king of
the land? During their dances do they not sing, 'Saul has slain his
thousands, but David his ten thousands'?"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` David took note of these remarks and became very much afraid of
Achish, king of Gath.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So, as they watched, he feigned insanity and acted like a madman in
their hands, drumming on the doors of the gate and drooling onto his
beard.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Finally Achish said to his servants: "You see the man is mad. Why
did you bring him to me?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do I not have enough madmen, that you bring in this one to carry on
in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?"
