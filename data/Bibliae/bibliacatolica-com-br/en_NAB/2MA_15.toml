"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Nicanor learned that Judas and his companions were in the
territory of Samaria, he decided to attack them in all safety on the
day of rest.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The Jews who were forced to follow him pleaded, "Do not massacre
them in that way, like a savage barbarian, but show respect for the day
which the All-seeing has exalted with holiness above all other days."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` At this the thrice-sinful wretch asked if there was a ruler in
heaven who prescribed the keeping of the sabbath day.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When they replied that there was indeed such a ruler in heaven, the
living LORD himself, who commanded the observance of the sabbath day,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` he said, "I, on my part, am ruler on earth, and my orders are that
you take up arms and carry out the king's business." Nevertheless he
did not succeed in carrying out his cruel plan.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In his utter boastfulness and arrogance Nicanor had determined to
erect a public monument of victory over Judas and his men.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Maccabeus remained confident, fully convinced that he would
receive help from the LORD.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He urged his men not to fear the enemy, but mindful of the help they
had received from Heaven in the past, to expect that now, too, victory
would be given them by the Almighty.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` By encouraging them with words from the law and the prophets, and by
reminding them of the battles they had already won, he filled them with
fresh enthusiasm.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Having stirred up their courage, he gave his orders and pointed out
at the same time the perfidy of the Gentiles and their violation of
oaths.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When he had armed each of them, not so much with the safety of
shield and spear as with the encouragement of noble words, he cheered
them all by relating a dream, a kind of vision, worthy of belief.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` What he saw was this: Onias, the former high priest, a good and
virtuous man, modest in appearance, gentle in manners, distinguished in
speech, and trained from childhood in every virtuous practice, was
praying with outstretched arms for the whole Jewish community.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then in the same way another man appeared, distinguished by his
white hair and dignity, and with an air about him of extraordinary,
majestic authority.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Onias then said of him, "This is God's prophet Jeremiah, who loves
his brethren and fervently prays for his people and their holy city."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Stretching out his right hand, Jeremiah presented a gold sword to
Judas. As he gave it to him he said,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Accept this holy sword as a gift from God; with it you shall crush
your adversaries."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Encouraged by Judas' noble words, which had power to instill valor
and stir young hearts to courage, the Jews determined not to delay, but
to charge gallantly and decide the issue by hand-to-hand combat with
the utmost courage, since their city and its temple with the sacred
vessels were in danger.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They were not so much concerned about their wives and children or
their brothers and kinsmen; their first and foremost fear was for the
consecrated sanctuary.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Those who remained in the city suffered a like agony, anxious as
they were about the battle in the open country.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Everyone now awaited the decisive moment. The enemy were already
drawing near with their troops drawn up in battle line, their elephants
placed in strategic positions, and their cavalry stationed on the
flanks.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Maccabeus, contemplating the hosts before him, their elaborate
equipment, and the fierceness of their elephants, stretched out his
hands toward heaven and called upon the LORD who works miracles; for he
knew that it is not through arms but through the LORD'S decision that
victory is won by those who deserve it.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He prayed to him thus: "You, O LORD, sent your angel in the days of
King Hezekiah of Judea, and he slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand
men of Sennacherib's army.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel now to spread fear and
dread before us.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` By the might of your arm may those be struck down who have
blasphemously come against your holy people!" With this he ended his
prayer.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Nicanor and his men advanced to the sound of trumpets and battle
songs.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Judas and his men met the army with supplication and prayers.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Fighting with their hands and praying to God with their hearts,
they laid low at least thirty-five thousand, and rejoiced greatly over
this manifestation of God's power.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When the battle was over and they were joyfully departing, they
discovered Nicanor lying there in all his armor;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` so they raised tumultuous shouts in their native tongue in praise
of the divine Sovereign.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then Judas, who was ever in body and soul the chief defender of his
fellow citizens, and had maintained from youth his affection for his
countrymen, ordered Nicanor's head and whole right arm to be cut off
and taken to Jerusalem.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When he arrived there, he assembled his countrymen, stationed the
priests before the altar, and sent for those in the citadel.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He showed them the vile Nicanor's head and the wretched
blasphemer's arm that had been boastfully stretched out against the
holy dwelling of the Almighty.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He cut out the tongue of the godless Nicanor, saying he would feed
it piecemeal to the birds and would hang up the other wages of his
folly opposite the temple.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` At this, everyone looked toward heaven and praised the Lord who
manifests his divine power, saying, "Blessed be he who has kept his own
Place undefiled!"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Judas hung up Nicanor's head on the wall of the citadel, a clear
and evident proof to all of the Lord's help.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` By public vote it was unanimously decreed never to let this day
pass unobserved, but to celebrate it on the thirteenth day of the
twelfth month, called Adar in Aramaic, the eve of Mordecai's Day.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Since Nicanor's doings ended in this way, with the city remaining
in possession of the Hebrews from that time on, I will bring my own
story to an end here too.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If it is well written and to the point, that is what I wanted; if
it is poorly done and mediocre, that is the best I could do.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Just as it is harmful to drink wine alone or water alone, whereas
mixing wine with water makes a more pleasant drink that increases
delight, so a skillfully composed story delights the ears of those who
read the work. Let this, then, be the end.
