Notas de rodapé:
3:1-8 - The Preacher presents a famous poem about time, asserting that
there is a time for everything under heaven. Life is composed of
seasons, and each event is under God's sovereignty, illustrating divine
17:26).
3:9-11 - Although man is aware of time and eternity, he cannot grasp
God's complete plan. This highlights human limitation and the mystery
of God's purposes, but also the beauty of God's creation (see also
3:12-13 - The Preacher affirms that the best thing a human being can do

3:14-15 - What God does is eternal and unchanging. Everything that

God's plan. This highlights divine sovereignty and the reverence we
4:15).
3:16-17 - The Preacher reflects on the injustice and evil in the world,
but reaffirms that God will judge all actions in due time. God's
ultimate justice is certain, even if it is not currently visible (see
