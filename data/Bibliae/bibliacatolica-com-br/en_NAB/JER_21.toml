Maaseiah, with this request:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Inquire for us of the LORD, because Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,
is attacking us. Perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all
his wonderful works, so that he will withdraw from us.

Zedekiah:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I will turn back in your

giving you a choice between life and death.

'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For I have turned against this city, for its woe and not for its

'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Beware! I am against you, Valley-site, Rock of the Plain, says the
