whose name is LORD:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Call to me, and I will answer you; I will tell to you things great
beyond reach of your knowledge.
'''

city and the palaces of Judah's kings, which are being destroyed in the
face of siegeworks and the sword:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` men come to battle the Chaldeans, and these houses will be filled
with the corpses of those whom I slay in my anger and wrath, when I
hide my face from this city for all their wickedness.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Behold, I will treat and assuage the city's wounds; I will heal
them, and reveal to them an abundance of lasting peace.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I will change the lot of Judah and the lot of Israel, and rebuild
them as of old.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I will cleanse them of all the guilt they incurred by sinning
against me; all their offenses by which they sinned and rebelled
against me, I will forgive.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Jerusalem shall be my joy, my praise, my glory, before all the
nations of the earth, as they hear of all the good I will do among
them. They shall be in fear and trembling over all the peaceful
benefits I will give her.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Thus says the LORD: In this place of which you say, "How desolate
it is, without man, without beast!" and in the cities of Judah, in the
streets of Jerusalem that are now deserted, without man, without
citizen, without beast, there shall yet be heard
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` the cry of joy, the cry of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom,
the voice of the bride, the sound of those who bring thank offerings to
the house of the LORD, singing, "Give thanks to the LORD of hosts, for
the LORD is good; his mercy endures forever." For I will restore this
country as of old, says the LORD.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thus says the LORD of hosts: In this place, now desolate, without
man or beast, and in all its cities there shall again be sheepfolds for
the shepherds to couch their flocks.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the cities of the hill country, of the foothills, and of the
Negeb, in the land of Benjamin and the suburbs of Jerusalem, and in the
cities of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who
counts them, says the LORD.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The days are coming, says the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise
I made to the house of Israel and Judah.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` In those days, in that time, I will raise up for David a just
shoot; he shall do what is right and just in the land.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` In those days Judah shall be safe and Jerusalem shall dwell secure;
this is what they shall call her: "The LORD our justice."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For thus says the LORD: Never shall David lack a successor on the
throne of the house of Israel,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` nor shall priests of Levi ever be lacking, to offer holocausts
before me, to burn cereal offerings, and to sacrifice victims.This word
of the LORD also came to Jeremiah:
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Thus says the LORD:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` If you can break my covenant with day, and my covenant with night,
so that day and night no longer alternate in sequence,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` then can my covenant with my servant David also be broken, so that
he will not have a son to be king upon his throne, and my covenant with
the priests of Levi who minister to me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Like the host of heaven which cannot be numbered, and the sands of
the sea which cannot be counted, I will multiply the descendants of my
servant David and the Levites who minister to me.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` This word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Have you not noticed what these people are saying: "The LORD has
rejected the two tribes which he had chosen"? They spurn my people as
if it were no longer a nation in their eyes.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Thus says the LORD: When I have no covenant with day and night, and
have given no laws to heaven and earth,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` then too will I reject the descendants of Jacob and of my servant
David, so as not to take from his descendants rulers for the race of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will change their lot and show them
mercy.
