"1" = ''':sup:`1` The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "If someone has on his skin a scab or pustule or blotch which
appears to be the sore of leprosy, he shall be brought to Aaron, the
priest, or to one of the priests among his descendants,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` who shall examine the sore on his skin. If the hair on the sore has
turned white and the sore itself shows that it has penetrated below the
skin, it is indeed the sore of leprosy; the priest, on seeing this,
shall declare the man unclean.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` If, however, the blotch on the skin is white, but does not seem to
have penetrated below the skin, nor has the hair turned white, the
priest shall quarantine the stricken man for seven days.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` On the seventh day the priest shall again examine him. If he judges
that the sore has remained unchanged and has not spread on the skin,
the priest shall quarantine him for another seven days,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and once more examine him on the seventh day. If the sore is now
dying out and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall declare the
man clean; it was merely eczema. The man shall wash his garments and so
become clean.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But if, after he has shown himself to the priest to be declared
clean, the eczema spreads at all on his skin, he shall once more show
himself to the priest.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Should the priest, on examining it, find that the eczema has indeed
spread on the skin, he shall declare the man unclean; it is leprosy.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "When someone is stricken with leprosy, he shall be brought to the
priest.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Should the priest, on examining him, find that there is a white
scab on the skin which has turned the hair white and that there is raw
flesh in it,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` it is skin leprosy that has long developed. The priest shall
declare the man unclean without first quarantining him, since he is
certainly unclean.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` If leprosy breaks out on the skin and, as far as the priest can
see, covers all the skin of the stricken man from head to foot,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` should the priest then, on examining him, find that the leprosy
does cover his whole body, he shall declare the stricken man clean;
since it has all turned white, the man is clean.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But as soon as raw flesh appears on him, he is unclean;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` on observing the raw flesh, the priest shall declare him unclean,
because raw flesh is unclean; it is leprosy.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If, however, the raw flesh again turns white, he shall return to
the priest;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` should the latter, on examining him, find that the sore has indeed
turned white, he shall declare the stricken man clean, and thus he will
be clean.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` "If a man who had a boil on his skin which later healed,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` should now in the place of the boil have a white scab or a pink
blotch, he shall show himself to the priest.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` If the latter, on examination, sees that it is deeper than the skin
and that the hair has turned white, he shall declare the man unclean;
it is the sore of leprosy that has broken out in the boil.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But if the priest, on examining him, finds that there is no white
hair in it and that it is not deeper than the skin and is already dying
out, the priest shall quarantine him for seven days.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` If it has then spread on the skin, the priest shall declare him
unclean; the man is stricken.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But if the blotch remains in its place without spreading, it is
merely the scar of the boil; the priest shall therefore declare him
clean.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "If a man had a burn on his skin, and the proud flesh of the burn
now becomes a pink or a white blotch,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` the priest shall examine it. If the hair has turned white on the
blotch and this seems to have penetrated below the skin, it is leprosy
that has broken out in the burn; the priest shall therefore declare him
unclean and stricken with leprosy.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But if the priest, on examining it, finds that there is no white
hair on the blotch and that this is not deeper than the skin and is
already dying out, the priest shall quarantine him for seven days.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Should the priest, when examining it on the seventh day, find that
it has spread at all on the skin, he shall declare the man unclean and
stricken with leprosy.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` But if the blotch remains in its place without spreading on the
skin and is already dying out, it is merely the scab of the burn; the
priest shall therefore declare the man clean, since it is only the scar
of the burn.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` "When a man or a woman has a sore on the head or cheek,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` should the priest, on examining it, find that the sore has
penetrated below the skin and that there is fine yellow hair on it, the
priest shall declare the person unclean, for this is scall, a leprous
disease of the head or cheek.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But if the priest, on examining the scall sore, finds that it has
not penetrated below the skin, though the hair on it may not be black,
the priest shall quarantine the person with scall sore for seven days,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and on the seventh day again examine the sore. If the scall has not
spread and has no yellow hair on it and does not seem to have
penetrated below the skin,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` the man shall shave himself, but not on the diseased spot. Then the
priest shall quarantine him for another seven days.

"34" = ''':sup:`34` If the priest, when examining the scall on the seventh day, finds
that it has not spread on the skin and that it has not penetrated below
the skin, he shall declare the man clean; the latter shall wash his
garments, and thus he will be clean.

"35" = ''':sup:`35` But if the scall spreads at all on his skin after he has been
declared clean,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` the priest shall again examine it. If the scall has indeed spread
on the skin, he need not look for yellow hair; the man is surely
unclean.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` If, however, he judges that the scall has remained in its place and
that black hair has grown on it, the disease has been healed; the man
is clean, and the priest shall declare him clean.

"38" = ''':sup:`38` "When the skin of a man or a woman is spotted with white blotches,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` the priest shall make an examination. If the blotches on the skin
are white and already dying out, it is only tetter that has broken out
on the skin, and the person therefore is clean.

"40" = ''':sup:`40` "When a man loses the hair of his head, he is not unclean merely
because of his bald crown.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` So too, if he loses the hair on the front of his head, he is not
unclean merely because of his bald forehead.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` But when there is a pink sore on his bald crown or bald forehead,
it is leprosy that is breaking out there.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` The priest shall examine him; and if the scab on the sore of the
bald spot has the same pink appearance as that of skin leprosy of the
fleshy part of the body,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` the man is leprous and unclean, and the priest shall declare him
unclean by reason of the sore on his head.

"45" = ''':sup:`45` "The one who bears the sore of leprosy shall keep his garments rent
and his head bare, and shall muffle his beard; he shall cry out,
'Unclean, unclean!'

"46" = ''':sup:`46` As long as the sore is on him he shall declare himself unclean,
since he is in fact unclean. He shall dwell apart, making his abode
outside the camp.

anything made of leather,

"49" = ''':sup:`49` if the infection on the garment or hide, or on the woven or knitted
material, or on any leather article is greenish or reddish, the thing
is indeed infected with leprosy and must be shown to the priest.

infected article for seven days.

"51" = ''':sup:`51` "On the seventh day the priest shall again examine the infection.
If it has spread on the garment, or on the woven or knitted material,
or on the leather, whatever be its use, the infection is malignant
leprosy, and the article is unclean.

"52" = ''':sup:`52` He shall therefore burn up the garment, or the woven or knitted
material of wool or linen, or the leather article, whatever it may be,
which is infected; since it has malignant leprosy, it must be destroyed
by fire.

not spread on the garment, or on the woven or knitted material, or on
the leather article,

"54" = ''':sup:`54` he shall give orders to have the infected article washed and then
quarantined for another seven days.

"55" = ''':sup:`55` "Then the priest shall again examine the infected article after it
has been washed. If the infection has not changed its appearance, even
though it may not have spread, the article is unclean and shall be
destroyed by fire.

"56" = ''':sup:`56` But if the priest, on examining the infection, finds that it is
dying out after the washing, he shall tear the infected part out of the
garment, or the leather, or the woven or knitted material.

"57" = ''':sup:`57` If, however, the infection again appears on the garment, or on the
woven or knitted material, or on the leather article, it is still
virulent and the thing infected shall be destroyed by fire.

"58" = ''':sup:`58` But if, after the washing, the infection has left the garment, or
the woven or knitted material, or the leather article, the thing shall
be washed a second time, and thus it will be clean.

"59" = ''':sup:`59` This is the law for leprous infection on a garment of wool or
linen, or on woven or knitted material, or on any leather article, to
determine whether it is clean or unclean."

Notas de rodapé:
12:1-4 - After the birth of a child, a mother goes through a period of
purification. This emphasizes the need for purity in worship and daily
life, and the idea that birth, though a divine gift, involves spiritual
12:5 - The period of purification is longer when a daughter is born,
reinforcing the purity rituals and cultural traditions of ancient
Israel. The law reflects the distinction between men and women in terms

12:6-7 - The mother offers a sin offering and a burnt offering after
the period of purification, symbolizing renewal and thanksgiving for
new life. This sacrifice highlights the value of birth and spiritual
12:8 - For poor families, the offering of two turtledoves or two young
pigeons is permitted instead of a lamb. This demonstrates God's
provision for all, regardless of their economic status, and the
