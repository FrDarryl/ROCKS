"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Simon heard that Trypho was gathering a large army to invade
and ravage the land of Judah,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and saw that the people were in dread and terror, he went up to
Jerusalem. There he assembled the people
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and exhorted them in these words: "You know what I, my brothers, and
my father's house have done for the laws and the sanctuary; what
battles and disasters we have been through.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` It was for the sake of these, for the sake of Israel, that all my
brothers have perished, and I alone am left.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Far be it from me, then, to save my own life in any time of
distress, for I am not better than my brothers.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Rather will I avenge my nation and the sanctuary, as well as your
wives and children, for all the nations out of hatred have united to
destroy us."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` As the people heard these words, their spirit was rekindled.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They shouted in reply: "You are our leader in place of your brothers
Judas and Jonathan.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Fight our battles, and we will do everything that you tell us."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So Simon mustered all the men able to fight, and quickly completing
the walls of Jerusalem, fortified it on every side.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He sent Jonathan, son of Absalom, to Joppa with a large force;
Jonathan drove out the occupants and remained there.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Trypho moved from Ptolemais with a large army to invade the
land of Judah, bringing Jonathan with him as a prisoner.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But Simon pitched his camp at Adida, facing the plain.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Trypho learned that Simon had succeeded his brother Jonathan,
and that he intended to fight him, he sent envoys to him with this
message:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "We have detained your brother Jonathan on account of the money
that he owed the royal treasury in connection with the offices that he
held.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Therefore, if you send us a hundred talents of silver, and two of
his sons as hostages to guarantee that when he is set free he will not
revolt against us, we will release him."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Although Simon knew that they were speaking deceitfully to him, he
gave orders to get the money and the boys, for fear of provoking much
hostility among the people, who might say
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` that Jonathan perished because Simon would not send Trypho the
money and the boys.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So he sent the boys and the hundred talents; but Trypho broke his
promise and would not let Jonathan go.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Next he began to invade and ravage the country. His troops went
around by the road that leads to Adora, but Simon and his army moved
along opposite him everywhere he went.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The men in the citadel sent messengers to Trypho, urging him to
come to them by way of the desert, and to send them provisions.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Although Trypho got all his cavalry ready to go, there was a heavy
fall of snow that night, and he could not go. So he left for Gilead.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When he was approaching Baskama, he had Jonathan killed and buried
there.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then Trypho returned to his own country.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Simon sent for the remains of his brother Jonathan, and buried him
in Modein, the city of his fathers.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` All Israel bewailed him with solemn lamentation, mourning over him
for many days.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then Simon erected over the tomb of his father and his brothers a
monument of stones, polished front and back, and raised high enough to
be seen at a distance.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` He set up seven pyramids facing one another for his father and his
mother and his four brothers.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For the pyramids he devised a setting of big columns, on which he
carved suits of armor as a perpetual memorial, and next to the armor he
placed carved ships, which could be seen by all who sailed the sea.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` This tomb which he built at Modein is there to the present day.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Trypho dealt treacherously with the young King Antiochus. He killed
him
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and assumed the kingship in his place, putting on the crown of
Asia. Thus he brought much evil on the land.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Simon, on his part, built up the strongholds of Judea,
strengthening their fortifications with high towers, thick walls, and
gates with bars, and he stored up provisions in the fortresses.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Simon also sent chosen men to King Demetrius with the request that
he grant the land a release from taxation, for all that Trypho did was
to plunder the land.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` In reply, King Demetrius sent him the following letter:
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` "King Demetrius sends greetings to Simon the high priest, the
friend of kings, and to the elders and the Jewish people.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` We have received the gold crown and the palm branch that you sent.
We are willing to be on most peaceful terms with you and to write to
our official to grant you release from tribute.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Whatever we have guaranteed to you remains in force, and the
strongholds that you have built shall remain yours.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` We remit any oversights and defaults incurred up to now, as well as
the crown tax that you owe. Any other tax that may have been collected
in Jerusalem shall no longer be collected there.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` If any of you are qualified for enrollment in our service, let them
be enrolled. Let there be peace between us."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Thus in the year one hundred and seventy, the yoke of the Gentiles
was removed from Israel,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and the people began to write in their records and contracts, "In
the first year of Simon, high priest, governor, and leader of the
Jews."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` In those days Simon besieged Gazara and surrounded it with troops.
He made a siege machine, pushed it up against the city, and attacked
and captured one of the towers.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` The men who had been on the siege machine jumped down into the city
and caused a great tumult there.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` The men of the city, joined by their wives and children, went up on
the wall, with their garments rent, and cried out in loud voices,
begging Simon to grant them peace.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` "Do not treat us according to our evil deeds," they said, "but
according to your mercy."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So Simon came to terms with them and did not destroy them. He made
them leave the city, however, and he purified the houses in which there
were idols. Then he entered the city with hymns and songs of praise.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` After removing from it everything that was impure, he settled there
men who observed the law. He improved its fortifications and built
himself a residence.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` The men in the citadel in Jerusalem were prevented from going out
into the country and back for the purchase of food; they suffered
greatly from hunger, and many of them died of starvation.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` They finally cried out to Simon for peace, and he gave them peace.
He expelled them from the citadel and cleansed it of impurities.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` On the twenty-third day of the second month, in the year one
hundred and seventy-one, the Jews entered the citadel with shouts of
jubilation, waving of palm branches, the music of harps and cymbals and
lyres, and the singing of hymns and canticles, because a great enemy of
Israel had been destroyed.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Simon decreed that this day should be celebrated every year with
rejoicing. He also strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill
alongside the citadel, and he and his companions dwelt there.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Seeing that his son John was now a grown man, Simon made him
commander of all his soldiers, with his residence in Gazara.
