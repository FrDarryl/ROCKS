"1" = ''':sup:`1` Thus the word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, propose a riddle, and speak this proverb to the house of
Israel:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Thus speaks the Lord GOD: The great eagle, with great wings, with
long pinions, with thick plumage, many-hued, came to Lebanon. He took
the crest of the cedar,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` tearing off its topmost branch, And brought it to a land of
tradesmen, set it in a city of merchants.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then he took some seed of the land, and planted it in a seedbed; A
shoot by plentiful waters, like a willow he placed it,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` To sprout and grow up a vine, dense and low-lying, Its branches
turned toward him, its roots lying under him. Thus it became a vine,
produced branches and put forth shoots.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But there was another great eagle, great of wing, rich in plumage;
To him this vine bent its roots, sent out its branches, That he might
water it more freely than the bed where it was planted.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` In a fertile field by plentiful waters it was planted, to grow
branches, bear fruit, and become a majestic vine.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Say: Thus says the Lord GOD: Can it prosper? Will he not rather tear
it out by the roots and strip off its fruit, so that all its green
growth will wither when he pulls it up by the roots? (No need of a
mighty arm or many people to do this.)
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` True, it is planted, but will it prosper? Will it not rather
wither, when touched by the east wind, in the bed where it grew?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus the word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Son of man, say now to the rebellious house: Do you not understand
what this means? It is this: The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and
took away its king and princes with him to Babylon.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then he selected a man of the royal line with whom he made a
covenant, binding him under oath, while removing the nobles of the
land,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` so that the kingdom would remain a modest one, without aspirations,
and would keep his covenant and obey him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But this man rebelled against him, sending envoys to Egypt to
obtain horses and a great army. Can he prosper? Can he who does such
things escape? Can he break a covenant and still go free?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` As I live, says the Lord GOD, in the home of the king who set him
up to rule, whose oath he spurned, whose covenant with him he broke,
there in Babylon I swear he shall die!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When ramps are cast up and siege towers are built for the
destruction of many lives, he shall not be saved in the conflict by
Pharaoh with a great army and numerous troops.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He spurned his oath, breaking his covenant. Though he gave his hand
in pledge, he did all these things. He shall not escape!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Therefore say: Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, my oath which he
spurned, my covenant which he broke, I swear to bring down upon his
head.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare. I
will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there over
his breaking faith with me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` All the crack troops among his forces shall fall by the sword, and
the survivors shall be scattered in every direction. Thus you shall
know that I, the LORD, have spoken.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Therefore say: Thus says the Lord GOD: I, too, will take from the
crest of the cedar, from its topmost branches tear off a tender shoot,
And plant it on a high and lofty mountain;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` on the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it. It shall put
forth branches and bear fruit, and become a majestic cedar. Birds of
every kind shall dwell beneath it, every winged thing in the shade of
its boughs.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the LORD, Bring
low the high tree, lift high the lowly tree, Wither up the green tree,
and make the withered tree bloom. As I, the LORD, have spoken, so will
I do.
