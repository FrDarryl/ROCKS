"1" = ''':sup:`1` About that time Antiochus retreated in disgrace from the region of
Persia.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He had entered the city called Persepolis and attempted to rob the
temple and gain control of the city. Thereupon the people had swift
recourse to arms, and Antiochus' men were routed, so that in the end
Antiochus was put to flight by the natives and forced to beat a
shameful retreat.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` On his arrival in Ecbatana, he learned what had happened to Nicanor
and to Timothy's forces.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Overcome with anger, he planned to make the Jews suffer for the
injury done by those who had put him to flight. Therefore he ordered
his charioteer to drive without stopping until he finished the journey.
Yet the condemnation of Heaven rode with him, since he said in his
arrogance, "I will make Jerusalem the common graveyard of the Jews as
soon as I arrive there."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him down with an
unseen but incurable blow; for scarcely had he uttered those words when
he was seized with excruciating pains in his bowels and sharp internal
torment,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` a fit punishment for him who had tortured the bowels of others with
many barbarous torments.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Far from giving up his insolence, he was all the more filled with
arrogance. Breathing fire in his rage against the Jews, he gave orders
to drive even faster. As a result he hurtled from the dashing chariot,
and every part of his body was racked by the violent fall.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Thus he who previously, in his superhuman presumption, thought he
could command the waves of the sea, and imagined he could weigh the
mountaintops in his scales, was now thrown to the ground and had to be
carried on a litter, clearly manifesting to all the power of God.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The body of this impious man swarmed with worms, and while he was
still alive in hideous torments, his flesh rotted off, so that the
entire army was sickened by the stench of his corruption.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Shortly before, he had thought that he could reach the stars of
heaven, and now, no one could endure to transport the man because of
this intolerable stench.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` At last, broken in spirit, he began to give up his excessive
arrogance, and to gain some understanding, under the scourge of God,
for he was racked with pain unceasingly.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When he could no longer bear his own stench, he said, "It is right
to be subject to God, and not to think one's mortal self divine."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then this vile man vowed to the Lord, who would no longer have
mercy on him,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` that he would set free the holy city, toward which he had been
hurrying with the intention of leveling it to the ground and making it
a common graveyard;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` he would put on perfect equality with the Athenians all the Jews,
whom he had judged not even worthy of burial, but fit only to be thrown
out with their children to be eaten by vultures and wild animals;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` he would adorn with the finest offerings the holy temple which he
had previously despoiled; he would restore all the sacred vessels many
times over; and would provide from his own revenues the expenses
required for the sacrifices.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Besides all this, he would become a Jew himself and visit every
inhabited place to proclaim there the power of God.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But since God's punishment had justly come upon him, his sufferings
were not lessened, so he lost hope for himself and wrote the following
letter to the Jews in the form of a supplication. It read thus: Death
of Antiochus
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "To my esteemed Jewish citizens, Antiochus, their king and general,
sends hearty greetings and best wishes for their health and happiness.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` If you and your children are well and your affairs are going as you
wish, I thank God very much, for my hopes are in heaven.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Now that I am ill, I recall with affection the esteem and good will
you bear me. On returning from the regions of Persia, I fell victim to
a troublesome illness; so I thought it necessary to form plans for the
general welfare of all.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Actually, I do not despair about my health, since I have great
hopes of recovering from my illness.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Nevertheless, I know that my father, whenever he went on campaigns
in the hinterland, would name his successor,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` so that, if anything unexpected happened or any unwelcome news
came, the people throughout the realm would know to whom the government
had been entrusted, and so not be disturbed.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I am also bearing in mind that the neighboring rulers, especially
those on the borders of our kingdom, are on the watch for opportunities
and waiting to see what will happen. I have therefore appointed as king
my son Antiochus, whom I have often before entrusted and commended to
most of you, when I made hurried visits to the outlying provinces. I
have written to him the letter copied below.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Therefore I beg and entreat each of you to remember the general and
individual benefits you have received, and to continue to show good
will toward me and my son.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` I am confident that, following my policy, he will treat you with
mildness and kindness in his relations with you."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So this murderer and blasphemer, after extreme sufferings, such as
he had inflicted on others, died a miserable death in the mountains of
a foreign land.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` His foster brother Philip brought the body home; but fearing
Antiochus' son, he later withdrew into Egypt, to Ptolemy Philometor.
