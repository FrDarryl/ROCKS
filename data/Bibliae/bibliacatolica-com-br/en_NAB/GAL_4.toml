"1" = ''':sup:`1` I mean that as long as the heir is not of age, he is no different
from a slave, although he is the owner of everything,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but he is under the supervision of guardians and administrators
until the date set by his father.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` In the same way we also, when we were not of age, were enslaved to
the elemental powers of the world.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a
woman, born under the law,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` to ransom those under the law, so that we might receive adoption.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` As proof that you are children, God sent the spirit of his Son into
our hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if a child then also
an heir, through God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` At a time when you did not know God, you became slaves to things
that by nature are not gods;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by
God, how can you turn back again to the weak and destitute elemental
powers? Do you want to be slaves to them all over again?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You are observing days, months, seasons, and years.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I am afraid on your account that perhaps I have labored for you in
vain.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I implore you, brothers, be as I am, because I have also become as
you are. You did me no wrong;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` you know that it was because of a physical illness that I
originally preached the gospel to you,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and you did not show disdain or contempt because of the trial
caused you by my physical condition, but rather you received me as an
angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Where now is that blessedness of yours? Indeed, I can testify to
you that, if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes
and given them to me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So now have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They show interest in you, but not in a good way; they want to
isolate you, so that you may show interest in them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now it is good to be shown interest for good reason at all times,
and not only when I am with you.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` My children, for whom I am again in labor until Christ be formed in
you!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I would like to be with you now and to change my tone, for I am
perplexed because of you.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not listen to the
law?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman
and the other by the freeborn woman.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The son of the slave woman was born naturally, the son of the
freeborn through a promise.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Now this is an allegory. These women represent two covenants. One
was from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; this is Hagar.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Hagar represents Sinai, a mountain in Arabia; it corresponds to the
present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery along with her children.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But the Jerusalem above is freeborn, and she is our mother.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For it is written: "Rejoice, you barren one who bore no children;
break forth and shout, you who were not in labor; for more numerous are
the children of the deserted one than of her who has a husband."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of the promise.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` But just as then the child of the flesh persecuted the child of the
spirit, it is the same now.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But what does the scripture say? "Drive out the slave woman and her
son! For the son of the slave woman shall not share the inheritance
with the son" of the freeborn.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Therefore, brothers, we are children not of the slave woman but of
the freeborn woman.

4:1-7 - Paul explains that before Christ, Christians were like servants
under the law, but now, as adopted children of God, they have the
freedom of the Spirit. Adoption is a central theme in Pauline theology
4:8-11 - Paul expresses his concern for the Galatians, warning them
about the risk of returning to the practices of the law and abandoning
grace. True freedom is found in Christ, not in keeping the law (see

them and his love for them. This conversation about the travails of a
spiritual father reflects Paul's concern for the purity of the gospel

freedom that comes from Christ with the slavery of the law. The
allusion to Mount Sinai shows that the law creates slavery, while the

promise, not of slavery. The new covenant in Christ brings true freedom
