"1" = ''':sup:`1` The words of David's son, Qoheleth, king in Jerusalem:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Vanity of vanities, says Qoheleth, vanity of vanities! All things
are vanity!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` What profit has man from all the labor which he toils at under the
sun?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` One generation passes and another comes, but the world forever
stays.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The sun rises and the sun goes down; then it presses on to the place
where it rises.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Blowing now toward the south, then toward the north, the wind turns
again and again, resuming its rounds.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` All rivers go to the sea, yet never does the sea become full. To the
place where they go, the rivers keep on going.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` All speech is labored; there is nothing man can say. The eye is not
satisfied with seeing nor is the ear filled with hearing.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What has been, that will be; what has been done, that will be done.
Nothing is new under the sun.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Even the thing of which we say, "See, this is new!" has already
existed in the ages that preceded us.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` There is no remembrance of the men of old; nor of those to come
will there be any remembrance among those who come after them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I, Qoheleth, was king over Israel in Jerusalem,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and I applied my mind to search and investigate in wisdom all
things that are done under the sun. A thankless task God has appointed
for men to be busied about.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold, all
is vanity and a chase after wind.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is missing cannot
be supplied.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Though I said to myself, "Behold, I have become great and stored up
wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem, and my mind has
broad experience of wisdom and knowledge";
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` yet when I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge, madness
and folly, I learned that this also is a chase after wind.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For in much wisdom there is much sorrow, and he who stores up
knowledge stores up grief.

Notas de rodap√©:

of the vanity and futility of earthly life. He questions the value of
human accomplishments, highlighting the impermanence of everything done
1:4-7 - The Preacher observes the repetitive cycles of nature to
illustrate the monotony of human existence. Creation, despite its
constancy, offers no lasting meaning to life, emphasizing human
1:8-11 - Dissatisfaction is a recurring theme. No achievement or
experience is enough to fill the inner void, and the forgetfulness of
past generations demonstrates the transience of human achievements (see
1:12-14 - The Preacher shares his quest for wisdom and knowledge, only
to discover that this too is "vanity." Human wisdom, however valuable,
cannot eliminate life's difficulties, but rather enhances our awareness
1:15-18 - Increased knowledge brings increased sorrow, for wisdom
exposes the difficulties and limitations of human existence. This
contrast between wisdom and sorrow highlights the weakness of wisdom
