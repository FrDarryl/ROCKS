Elisha insists on accompanying him. This reflects Elisha's loyalty and
and 1 Kings 19:19-21).
2:8-10 - Elijah parts the waters of the Jordan with his mantle,
demonstrating God's power working through him. Elisha requests a double
portion of Elijah's spirit, seeking to continue the work with the same
2:11-12 - Elijah is taken up to heaven in a whirlwind in a chariot of
fire, a unique event that reaffirms the sacredness of his mission and
2:13-14 - Elisha receives Elijah's mantle and performs his first
miracle by dividing the Jordan, showing that God's power is now upon
him. This confirms his succession as Israel's prophet (see also
2:23-25 - Young men mock Elisha, and he curses them in the name of the
Lord, resulting in his death by two she-bears. This incident teaches us
about the respect that should be given to God's servants and the
Chronicles 36:16).
