for the gospel of God,

scriptures,

flesh,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` but established as Son of God in power according to the spirit of
holiness through resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Through him we have received the grace of apostleship, to bring
about the obedience of faith, for the sake of his name, among all the
Gentiles,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` among whom are you also, who are called to belong to Jesus Christ;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` to all the beloved of God in Rome, called to be holy. Grace to you
and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you,
because your faith is heralded throughout the world.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in proclaiming the
gospel of his Son, that I remember you constantly,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` always asking in my prayers that somehow by God's will I may at
last find my way clear to come to you.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For I long to see you, that I may share with you some spiritual
gift so that you may be strengthened,

faith, yours and mine.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to
come to you, though I was prevented until now, that I might harvest
some fruit among you, too, as among the rest of the Gentiles.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` To Greeks and non-Greeks alike, to the wise and the ignorant, I am
under obligation;

"15" = ''':sup:`15` that is why I am eager to preach the gospel also to you in Rome.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For I am not ashamed of the gospel. It is the power of God for the
salvation of everyone who believes: for Jew first, and then Greek.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Ever since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes of
eternal power and divinity have been able to be understood and
perceived in what he has made. As a result, they have no excuse;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` for although they knew God they did not accord him glory as God or
give him thanks. Instead, they became vain in their reasoning, and
their senseless minds were darkened.

their hearts for the mutual degradation of their bodies.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and revered and worshiped
the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their
females exchanged natural relations for unnatural,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and
burned with lust for one another. Males did shameful things with males
and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their
perversity.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God handed them
over to their undiscerning mind to do what is improper.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` They are filled with every form of wickedness, evil, greed, and
malice; full of envy, murder, rivalry, treachery, and spite. They are
gossips

"30" = ''':sup:`30` and scandalmongers and they hate God. They are insolent, haughty,
boastful, ingenious in their wickedness, and rebellious toward their
parents.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` They are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Although they know the just decree of God that all who practice
