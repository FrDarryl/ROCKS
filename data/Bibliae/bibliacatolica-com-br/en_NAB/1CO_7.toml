[7]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now in regard to the matters about which you wrote: "It is a good
thing for a man not to touch a woman,"
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but because of cases of immorality every man should have his own
wife, and every woman her own husband.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The husband should fulfill his duty toward his wife, and likewise
the wife toward her husband.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` A wife does not have authority over her own body, but rather her
husband, and similarly a husband does not have authority over his own
body, but rather his wife.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Do not deprive each other, except perhaps by mutual consent for a
time, to be free for prayer, but then return to one another, so that
Satan may not tempt you through your lack of self-control.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` This I say by way of concession, however, not as a command.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Indeed, I wish everyone to be as I am, but each has a particular
gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Now to the unmarried and to widows, I say: it is a good thing for
them to remain as they are, as I do,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but if they cannot exercise self-control they should marry, for it
is better to marry than to be on fire.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` To the married, however, I give this instruction (not I, but the
Lord): a wife should not separate from her husband
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` --and if she does separate she must either remain single or become
reconciled to her husband--and a husband should not divorce his wife.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` To the rest I say (not the Lord): if any brother has a wife who is
an unbeliever, and she is willing to go on living with him, he should
not divorce her;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he is
willing to go on living with her, she should not divorce her husband.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the
unbelieving wife is made holy through the brother. Otherwise your
children would be unclean, whereas in fact they are holy.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If the unbeliever separates, however, let him separate. The brother
or sister is not bound in such cases; God has called you to peace.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband; or
how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Only, everyone should live as the Lord has assigned, just as God
called each one. I give this order in all the churches.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Was someone called after he had been circumcised? He should not try
to undo his circumcision. Was an uncircumcised person called? He should
not be circumcised.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Circumcision means nothing, and uncircumcision means nothing; what
matters is keeping God's commandments.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Everyone should remain in the state in which he was called.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Were you a slave when you were called? Do not be concerned but,
even if you can gain your freedom, make the most of it.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For the slave called in the Lord is a freed person in the Lord,
just as the free person who has been called is a slave of Christ.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` You have been purchased at a price. Do not become slaves to human
beings.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Brothers, everyone should continue before God in the state in which
he was called.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now in regard to virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but
I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So this is what I think best because of the present distress: that
it is a good thing for a person to remain as he is.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek a separation. Are you free of
a wife? Then do not look for a wife.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` If you marry, however, you do not sin, nor does an unmarried woman
sin if she marries; but such people will experience affliction in their
earthly life, and I would like to spare you that.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` I tell you, brothers, the time is running out. From now on, let
those having wives act as not having them,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` those weeping as not weeping, those rejoicing as not rejoicing,
those buying as not owning,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` those using the world as not using it fully. For the world in its
present form is passing away.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` I should like you to be free of anxieties. An unmarried man is
anxious about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But a married man is anxious about the things of the world, how he
may please his wife,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and he is divided. An unmarried woman or a virgin is anxious about
the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in both body and
spirit. A married woman, on the other hand, is anxious about the things
of the world, how she may please her husband.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` I am telling you this for your own benefit, not to impose a
restraint upon you, but for the sake of propriety and adherence to the
Lord without distraction.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` If anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, and
if a critical moment has come and so it has to be, let him do as he
wishes. He is committing no sin; let them get married.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` The one who stands firm in his resolve, however, who is not under
compulsion but has power over his own will, and has made up his mind to
keep his virgin, will be doing well.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` So then, the one who marries his virgin does well; the one who does
not marry her will do better.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her
husband dies, she is free to be married to whomever she wishes,
provided that it be in the Lord.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` She is more blessed, though, in my opinion, if she remains as she
is, and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

Notas de rodap√©:
7:1-7 - Paul speaks about celibacy and marriage, emphasizing that
celibacy is an option of service to God, but that marriage is also
honorable, as it is a remedy against sexual immorality (see also
7:10-16 - Paul instructs Christian couples to remain married, even if
one partner is not a Christian, and to live in peace. Marriage is a
sacred institution and should be maintained, but separation is
3:1-2).
7:25-35 - Paul addresses the issue of singleness, recommending celibacy
for the service of God, but recognizing that marriage is also a valid
and good choice for those who cannot control their desires (see also
