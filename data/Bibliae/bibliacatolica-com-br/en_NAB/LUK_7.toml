'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They approached Jesus and strongly urged him to come, saying, "He
deserves to have you do this for him,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` for he loves our nation and he built the synagogue for us."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Jesus went with them, but when he was only a short distance from
the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, "Lord, do not
trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but say
the word and let my servant be healed.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For I too am a person subject to authority, with soldiers subject to
me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come here,'
and he comes; and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and, turning, said to the
crowd following him, "I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such
faith."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave in
good health.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Soon afterward he journeyed to a city called Nain, and his
disciples and a large crowd accompanied him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` As he drew near to the gate of the city, a man who had died was
being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A
large crowd from the city was with her.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` When the Lord saw her, he was moved with pity for her and said to
her, "Do not weep."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He stepped forward and touched the coffin; at this the bearers
halted, and he said, "Young man, I tell you, arise!"

"15" = ''':sup:`15` The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his
mother.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Fear seized them all, and they glorified God, exclaiming, "A great

'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This report about him spread through the whole of Judea and in all
the surrounding region.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The disciples of John told him about all these things. John
summoned two of his disciples

"19" = ''':sup:`19` and sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who is to come,
or should we look for another?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When the men came to him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us
to you to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for
another?'"

spirits; he also granted sight to many who were blind.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And he said to them in reply, "Go and tell John what you have seen
and heard: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good
news proclaimed to them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When the messengers of John had left, Jesus began to speak to the
crowds about John. "What did you go out to the desert to see--a reed
swayed by the wind?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then what did you go out to see? Someone dressed in fine garments?
Those who dress luxuriously and live sumptuously are found in royal
palaces.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and
more than a prophet.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` This is the one about whom scripture says: 'Behold, I am sending my
messenger ahead of you, he will prepare your way before you.'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` I tell you, among those born of women, no one is greater than John;
yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` (All the people who listened, including the tax collectors, and who
were baptized with the baptism of John, acknowledged the righteousness
of God;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` but the Pharisees and scholars of the law, who were not baptized by
him, rejected the plan of God for themselves.)
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "Then to what shall I compare the people of this generation? What
are they like?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` They are like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one
another, 'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a
dirge, but you did not weep.'
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` For John the Baptist came neither eating food nor drinking wine,
and you said, 'He is possessed by a demon.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The Son of Man came eating and drinking and you said, 'Look, he is
a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But wisdom is vindicated by all her children."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` A Pharisee invited him to dine with him, and he entered the
Pharisee's house and reclined at table.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Now there was a sinful woman in the city who learned that he was at
table in the house of the Pharisee. Bringing an alabaster flask of
ointment,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his
feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them,
and anointed them with the ointment.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself,
"If this man were a prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman
this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Jesus said to him in reply, "Simon, I have something to say to
you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` "Two people were in debt to a certain creditor; one owed five
hundred days' wages and the other owed fifty.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Since they were unable to repay the debt, he forgave it for both.
Which of them will love him more?"
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Simon said in reply, "The one, I suppose, whose larger debt was
forgiven." He said to him, "You have judged rightly."
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this
woman? When I entered your house, you did not give me water for my
feet, but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with her
hair.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` You did not give me a kiss, but she has not ceased kissing my feet
since the time I entered.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` You did not anoint my head with oil, but she anointed my feet with
ointment.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; hence, she has
shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves
little."
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` The others at table said to themselves, "Who is this who even
forgives sins?"
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` But he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
