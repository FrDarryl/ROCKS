"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when he does find it, he sets it on his shoulders with great joy

"7" = ''':sup:`7` I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven

"13" = ''':sup:`13` After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings and
set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a

"14" = ''':sup:`14` When he had freely spent everything, a severe famine struck that

"15" = ''':sup:`15` So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Coming to his senses he thought, 'How many of my father's hired

"18" = ''':sup:`18` I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him, "Father,

"27" = ''':sup:`27` The servant said to him, 'Your brother has returned and your father
