their sins.

God; They ask me to declare what is due them, pleased to gain access to
God.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` "Why do we fast, and you do not see it? afflict ourselves, and you
take no note of it?" Lo, on your fast day you carry out your own
pursuits, and drive all your laborers.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yes, your fast ends in quarreling and fighting, striking with wicked
claw. Would that today you might fast so as to make your voice heard on
high!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Is this the manner of fasting I wish, of keeping a day of penance:
That a man bow his head like a reed, and lie in sackcloth and ashes? Do
you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?

help, and he will say: Here I am! If you remove from your midst
oppression, false accusation and malicious speech;

Then light shall rise for you in the darkness, and the gloom shall
become for you like midday;

breach," they shall call you, "Restorer of ruined homesteads."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` If you hold back your foot on the sabbath from following your own
pursuits on my holy day; If you call the sabbath a delight, and the
LORD'S holy day honorable; If you honor it by not following your ways,
seeking your own interests, or speaking with malice--
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then you shall delight in the LORD, and I will make you ride on the
heights of the earth; I will nourish you with the heritage of Jacob,
your father, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
