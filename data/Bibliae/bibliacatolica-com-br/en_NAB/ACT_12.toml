"3" = ''':sup:`3` and when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he proceeded to
arrest Peter also. (It was (the) feast of Unleavened Bread.)
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He had him taken into custody and put in prison under the guard of

secured by double chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, while
outside the door guards kept watch on the prison.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shone in the
cell. He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, "Get up
quickly." The chains fell from his wrists.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The angel said to him, "Put on your belt and your sandals." He did
so. Then he said to him, "Put on your cloak and follow me."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So he followed him out, not realizing that what was happening
through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron

him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then Peter recovered his senses and said, "Now I know for certain
that (the) Lord sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod
and from all that the Jewish people had been expecting."

John who is called Mark, where there were many people gathered in

"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he knocked on the gateway door, a maid named Rhoda came to
answer it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` She was so overjoyed when she recognized Peter's voice that,
instead of opening the gate, she ran in and announced that Peter was
standing at the gate.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They told her, "You are out of your mind," but she insisted that it
was so. But they kept saying, "It is his angel."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Peter continued to knock, and when they opened it, they saw him
and were astounded.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet and explained (to
them) how the Lord had led him out of the prison, and said, "Report
this to James and the brothers." Then he left and went to another
place.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` At daybreak there was no small commotion among the soldiers over
what had become of Peter.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Herod, after instituting a search but not finding him, ordered the
guards tried and executed. Then he left Judea to spend some time in
Caesarea.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He had long been very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, who
now came to him in a body. After winning over Blastus, the king's
chamberlain, they sued for peace because their country was supplied
with food from the king's territory.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` On an appointed day, Herod, attired in royal robes, (and) seated on
the rostrum, addressed them publicly.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The assembled crowd cried out, "This is the voice of a god, not of
a man."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` At once the angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not
ascribe the honor to God, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his
last.

'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` After Barnabas and Saul completed their relief mission, they
returned to Jerusalem, taking with them John, who is called Mark.
