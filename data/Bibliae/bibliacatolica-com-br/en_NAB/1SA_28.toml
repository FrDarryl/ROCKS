"1" = ''':sup:`1` In those days the Philistines mustered their military forces to
fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, "You realize, of course,
that you and your men must go out on campaign with me to Jezreel."
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` David answered Achish, "Good! Now you shall learn what your servant
can do." Then Achish said to David, "I shall appoint you my permanent
bodyguard."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now Samuel had died and, after being mourned by all Israel, was
buried in his city, Ramah. Meanwhile Saul had driven mediums and
fortune-tellers out of the land.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The Philistine levies advanced to Shunem and encamped. Saul, too,
mustered all Israel; they camped on Gilboa.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was dismayed and lost
heart completely.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He therefore consulted the LORD; but the LORD gave no answer,
whether in dreams or by the Urim or through prophets.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Saul said to his servants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, to
whom I can go to seek counsel through her." His servants answered him,
"There is a woman in Endor who is a medium."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So he disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and set out with
two companions. They came to the woman by night, and Saul said to her,
"Tell my fortune through a ghost; conjure up for me the one I ask you
to."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But the woman answered him, "You are surely aware of what Saul has
done, in driving the mediums and fortune-tellers out of the land. Why,
then, are you laying snares for my life, to have me killed?"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As the LORD lives, you shall
incur no blame for this."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then the woman asked him, "Whom do you want me to conjure up?" and
he answered, "Samuel."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When the woman saw Samuel, she shrieked at the top of her voice and
said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But the king said to her, "Have no fear. What do you see?" The
woman answered Saul, "I see a preternatural being rising from the
earth."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` "What does he look like?" asked Saul. And she replied, "It is an
old man who is rising, clothed in a mantle." Saul knew that it was
Samuel, and so he bowed face to the ground in homage.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Samuel then said to Saul, "Why do you disturb me by conjuring me
up?" Saul replied: "I am in great straits, for the Philistines are
waging war against me and God has abandoned me. Since he no longer
answers me through prophets or in dreams, I have called you to tell me
what I should do."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` To this Samuel said: "But why do you ask me, if the LORD has
abandoned you and is with your neighbor?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The LORD has done to you what he foretold through me: he has torn
the kingdom from your grasp and has given it to your neighbor David.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Because you disobeyed the LORD'S directive and would not carry out
his fierce anger against Amalek, the LORD has done this to you today.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Moreover, the LORD will deliver Israel, and you as well, into the
clutches of the Philistines. By tomorrow you and your sons will be with
me, and the LORD will have delivered the army of Israel into the hands
of the Philistines."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, for he was badly
shaken by Samuel's message. Moreover, he had no bodily strength left,
since he had eaten nothing all that day and night.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then the woman came to Saul, and seeing that he was quite
terror-stricken, said to him: "Remember, your maidservant obeyed you: I
took my life in my hands and fulfilled the request you made of me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Now you, in turn, please listen to your maidservant. Let me set
something before you to eat, so that you may have strength when you go
on your way."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But he refused, saying, "I will not eat." However, when his
servants joined the woman in urging him, he listened to their
entreaties, got up from the ground, and sat on a couch.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The woman had a stall-fed calf in the house, which she now quickly
slaughtered. Then taking flour, she kneaded it and baked unleavened
bread.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` She set the meal before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then
they stood up and left the same night.
