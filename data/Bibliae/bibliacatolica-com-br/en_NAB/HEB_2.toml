"1" = ''':sup:`1` Therefore, we must attend all the more to what we have heard, so
that we may not be carried away.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For if the word announced through angels proved firm, and every
transgression and disobedience received its just recompense,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? Announced
originally through the Lord, it was confirmed for us by those who had
heard.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` God added his testimony by signs, wonders, various acts of power,
and distribution of the gifts of the holy Spirit according to his will.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For it was not to angels that he subjected the world to come, of
which we are speaking.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Instead, someone has testified somewhere: "What is man that you are
mindful of him, or the son of man that you care for him?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you crowned
him with glory and honor,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` subjecting all things under his feet." In "subjecting" all things
(to him), he left nothing not "subject to him." Yet at present we do
not see "all things subject to him,"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but we do see Jesus "crowned with glory and honor" because he
suffered death, he who "for a little while" was made "lower than the
angels," that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For it was fitting that he, for whom and through whom all things
exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the leader to
their salvation perfect through suffering.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He who consecrates and those who are being consecrated all have one
origin. Therefore, he is not ashamed to call them "brothers,"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` saying: "I will proclaim your name to my brothers, in the midst of
the assembly I will praise you";
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and again: "I will put my trust in him"; and again: "Behold, I and
the children God has given me."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now since the children share in blood and flesh, he likewise shared
in them, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power
of death, that is, the devil,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and free those who through fear of death had been subject to
slavery all their life.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Surely he did not help angels but rather the descendants of
Abraham;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` therefore, he had to become like his brothers in every way, that he
might be a merciful and faithful high priest before God to expiate the
sins of the people.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Because he himself was tested through what he suffered, he is able
to help those who are being tested.
