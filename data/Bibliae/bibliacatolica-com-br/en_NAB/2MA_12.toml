"1" = ''':sup:`1` After these agreements were made, Lysias returned to the king, and
the Jews went about their farming.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But some of the local governors, Timothy and Apollonius, son of
Gennaeus, as also Hieronymus and Demophon, to say nothing of Nicanor,
the commander of the Cyprians, would not allow them to live in peace.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Some people of Joppa also committed this outrage: they invited the
Jews who lived among them, together with their wives and children, to
embark on boats which they had provided. There was no hint of enmity
toward them;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` this was done by public vote of the city. When the Jews, not
suspecting treachery and wishing to live on friendly terms, accepted
the invitation, the people of Joppa took them out to sea and drowned at
least two hundred of them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As soon as Judas heard of the barbarous deed perpetrated against his
countrymen, he summoned his men;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and after calling upon God, the just judge, he marched against the
murderers of his kinsmen. In a night attack he set the harbor on fire,
burnt the boats, and put to the sword those who had taken refuge there.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When the gates of the town were shut, he withdrew, intending to come
back later and wipe out the entire population of Joppa.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` On hearing that the men of Jamnia planned to give like treatment to
the Jews who lived among them,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` he attacked the Jamnian populace by night, setting fire to the
harbor and the fleet, so that the glow of the flames was visible as far
as Jerusalem, thirty miles away.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When the Jews had gone about a mile from there in the campaign
against Timothy, they were attacked by Arabs numbering at least five
thousand foot soldiers, and five hundred horsemen.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` After a hard fight, Judas and his companions, with God's help, were
victorious. The defeated nomads begged Judas to make friends with them
and promised to supply the Jews with cattle and to help them in every
other way.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Realizing that they could indeed be useful in many respects, Judas
agreed to make peace with them. After the pledge of friendship had been
exchanged, the Arabs withdrew to their tents.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He also attacked a certain city called Caspin, fortified with
earthworks and ramparts and inhabited by a mixed population of
Gentiles.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Relying on the strength of their walls and their supply of
provisions, the besieged treated Judas and his men with contempt,
insulting them and even uttering blasphemies and profanity.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But Judas and his men invoked the aid of the great Sovereign of the
world, who, in the day of Joshua, overthrew Jericho without
battering-ram or siege machine; then they furiously stormed the
ramparts.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Capturing the city by the will of God, they inflicted such
indescribable slaughter on it that the adjacent pool, which was about a
quarter of a mile wide, seemed to be filled with the blood that flowed
into it.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When they had gone on some ninety miles, they reached Charax, where
there were certain Jews known as Toubiani.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But they did not find Timothy in that region, for he had already
departed from there without having done anything except to leave behind
in one place a very strong garrison.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But Dositheus and Sosipater, two of Maccabeus' captains, marched
out and destroyed the force of more than ten thousand men that Timothy
had left in the stronghold.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Meanwhile, Maccabeus divided his army into cohorts, with a
commander over each cohort, and went in pursuit of Timothy, who had a
force of a hundred and twenty thousand foot soldiers and twenty-five
hundred horsemen.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Timothy learned of the approach of Judas, he sent on ahead of
him the women and children, as well as the baggage, to a place called
Karnion, which was hard to besiege and even hard to reach because of
the difficult terrain of that region.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But when Judas' first cohort appeared, the enemy was overwhelmed
with fear and terror at the manifestation of the All-seeing. Scattering
in every direction, they rushed away in such headlong flight that in
many cases they wounded one another, pierced by the swords of their own
men.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Judas pressed the pursuit vigorously, putting the sinners to the
sword and destroying as many as thirty thousand men.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Timothy himself fell into the hands of the men under Dositheus and
Sosipater; but with great cunning, he asked them to spare his life and
let him go, because he had in his power the parents and relatives of
many of them, and could make these suffer.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When he had fully confirmed his solemn pledge to restore them
unharmed, they let him go for the sake of saving their brethren.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Judas then marched to Karnion and the shrine of Atargatis, where he
killed twenty-five thousand people.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` After the defeat and destruction of these, he moved his army to
Ephron, a fortified city inhabited by people of many nationalities.
Robust young men took up their posts in defense of the walls, from
which they fought valiantly; inside were large supplies of machines and
missiles.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But the Jews, invoking the Sovereign who forcibly shatters the
might of his enemies, got possession of the city and slaughtered
twenty-five thousand of the people in it.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then they set out from there and hastened on to Scythopolis,
seventy-five miles from Jerusalem.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But when the Jews who lived there testified to the good will shown
by the Scythopolitans and to their kind treatment even in times of
adversity,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Judas and his men thanked them and exhorted them to be well
disposed to their race in the future also. Finally they arrived in
Jerusalem, shortly before the feast of Weeks.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` After this feast called Pentecost, they lost no time in marching
against Gorgias, governor of Idumea,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` who opposed them with three thousand foot soldiers and four hundred
horsemen.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` In the ensuing battle, a few of the Jews were slain.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` A man called Dositheus, a powerful horseman and one of Bacenor's
men, caught hold of Gorgias, grasped his military cloak and dragged him
along by main strength, intending to capture the vile wretch alive,
when a Thracian horseman attacked Dositheus and cut off his arm at the
shoulder. Then Gorgias fled to Marisa.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` After Esdris and his men had been fighting for a long time and were
weary, Judas called upon the Lord to show himself their ally and leader
in the battle.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Then, raising a battle cry in his ancestral language, and with
songs, he charged Gorgias' men when they were not expecting it and put
them to flight.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Judas rallied his army and went to the city of Adullam. As the week
was ending, they purified themselves according to custom and kept the
sabbath there.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas
and his men went to gather up the bodies of the slain and bury them
with their kinsmen in their ancestral tombs.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred
to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it
was clear to all that this was why these men had been slain.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` They all therefore praised the ways of the Lord, the just judge who
brings to light the things that are hidden.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Turning to supplication, they prayed that the sinful deed might be
fully blotted out. The noble Judas warned the soldiers to keep
themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what
had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to
two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for
an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and
noble way, inasmuch as he had the resurrection of the dead in view;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would
have been useless and foolish to pray for them in death.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits
those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious
thought.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be freed from
this sin.
