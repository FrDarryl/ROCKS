"1" = ''':sup:`1` Paul, an apostle not from human beings nor through a human being but
through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` who gave himself for our sins that he might rescue us from the
present evil age in accord with the will of our God and Father,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I am amazed that you are so quickly forsaking the one who called you
by (the) grace (of Christ) for a different gospel
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` (not that there is another). But there are some who are disturbing
you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach (to you) a
gospel other than the one that we preached to you, let that one be
accursed!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone preaches to
you a gospel other than the one that you received, let that one be
accursed!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Am I now currying favor with human beings or God? Or am I seeking
to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not
be a slave of Christ.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is
not of human origin.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For I did not receive it from a human being, nor was I taught it,
but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For you heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I persecuted
the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and progressed in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my
race, since I was even more a zealot for my ancestral traditions.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when (God), who from my mother's womb had set me apart and
called me through his grace, was pleased
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` to reveal his Son to me, so that I might proclaim him to the
Gentiles, I did not immediately consult flesh and blood,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me;
rather, I went into Arabia and then returned to Damascus.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to confer with Kephas
and remained with him for fifteen days.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But I did not see any other of the apostles, only James the brother
of the Lord.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` (As to what I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not
lying.)
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And I was unknown personally to the churches of Judea that are in
Christ;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` they only kept hearing that "the one who once was persecuting us is
now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So they glorified God because of me.
