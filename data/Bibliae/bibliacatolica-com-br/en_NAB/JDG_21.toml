"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah that none of them would
give his daughter in marriage to anyone from Benjamin.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So the people went to Bethel and remained there before God until
evening, raising their voices in bitter lament.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They said, "LORD, God of Israel, why has it come to pass in Israel
that today one tribe of Israel should be lacking?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Early the next day the people built an altar there and offered
holocausts and peace offerings.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then the Israelites asked, "Are there any among all the tribes of
Israel who did not come up to the LORD for the assembly?" For they had
taken a solemn oath that anyone who did not go up to the LORD at Mizpah
should be put to death without fail.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The Israelites were disconsolate over their brother Benjamin and
said, "Today one of the tribes of Israel has been cut off.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` What can we do about wives for the survivors, since we have sworn by
the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when they asked whether anyone among the tribes of Israel had
not come up to the LORD in Mizpah, they found that none of the men of
Jabesh-gilead had come to the encampment for the assembly.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` A roll call of the army established that none of the inhabitants of
that city were present.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The community, therefore, sent twelve thousand warriors with orders
to go to Jabesh-gilead and put those who lived there to the sword,
including the women and children.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` They were told to include under the ban all males and every woman
who was not still a virgin.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Finding among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young
virgins, who had had no relations with men, they brought them to the
camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the whole community sent a message to the Benjaminites at the
rock Rimmon, offering them peace.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Benjamin returned at that time, they gave them as wives the
women of Jabesh-gilead whom they had spared; but these proved to be not
enough for them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The people were still disconsolate over Benjamin because the LORD
had made a breach among the tribes of Israel.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the elders of the community said, "What shall we do for wives
for the survivors? For every woman in Benjamin has been put to death."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They said, "Those of Benjamin who survive must have heirs, else one
of the Israelite tribes will be wiped out.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Yet we cannot give them any of our daughters in marriage, because
the Israelites have sworn, 'Cursed be he who gives a woman to
Benjamin!'"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then they thought of the yearly feast of the LORD at Shiloh, north
of Bethel, east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and
south of Lebonah.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And they instructed the Benjaminites, "Go and lie in wait in the
vineyards.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When you see the girls of Shiloh come out to do their dancing,
leave the vineyards and each of you seize one of the girls of Shiloh
for a wife, and go to the land of Benjamin.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we
shall say to them, 'Release them to us as a kindness, since we did not
take a woman apiece in the war. Had you yourselves given them these
wives, you would now be guilty.'"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The Benjaminites did this; they carried off a wife for each of them
from their raid on the dancers, and went back to their own territory,
where they rebuilt and occupied the cities.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Also at that time the Israelites dispersed; each of them left for
his own heritage in his own clan and tribe.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what he
thought best.
