[31]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` On the first day of the third month in the eleventh year, the word
of the LORD came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to his hordes:
What are you like in your greatness?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Behold, a cypress (cedar) in Lebanon, beautiful of branch, lofty of
stature, amid the very clouds lifted its crest.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Waters made it grow, the abyss made it flourish, sending its rivers
round where it was planted, turning its streams to all the trees of the
field.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thus it grew taller than every other tree of the field, and longer
of branch because of the abundant water.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In its boughs nested all the birds of the air, under its branches
all beasts of the field gave birth, in its shade dwelt numerous peoples
of every race.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It became beautiful and stately in its spread of foliage, for its
roots were turned toward abundant water.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The cedars in the garden of God were not its equal, nor could the
fir trees match its boughs, Neither were the plane trees like it for
branches; no tree in the garden of God matched its beauty.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I made it beautiful, with much foliage, the envy of all Eden's trees
in the garden of God.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because it became lofty in
stature, raising its crest among the clouds, and because it became
proud in heart at its height,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I have handed it over to the mightiest of the nations, which has
dealt with it in keeping with its wickedness. I humiliated it.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Foreigners, the most ruthless of the nations, cut it down and left
it on the mountains. Its foliage was brought low in all the valleys,
its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land, and all the
peoples of the land withdrew from its shade, abandoning it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` On its fallen trunk rested all the birds of the air, and by its
branches were all the beasts of the field.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thus no tree may grow lofty in stature or raise its crest among the
clouds; no tree fed by water may stand by itself in its loftiness. For
all of them are destined for death, for the land below, For the company
of mortals, those who go down into the pit.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day he went down to the nether world
I made the abyss close up over him; I stopped its streams so that the
deep waters were held back. I cast gloom over Lebanon because of him,
so that all the trees in the land drooped on his account.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` At the crash of his fall I made the nations rock, when I cast him
down to the nether world with those who go down into the pit. In the
land below, all Eden's trees were consoled, Lebanon's choice and best,
all that were fed by water.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They too have come down with him to the nether world, to those
slain by the sword; those who dwelt in his shade are dispersed among
the nations.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Which was your equal in glory or size among the trees of Eden? Yet
you have been brought down with the trees of Eden to the land below.
You shall lie with the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.
Such are Pharaoh and all his hordes, says the Lord GOD.

Notas de rodap√©:
31:1-9 - The allegory of the cedar tree of Lebanon is used to describe
Egypt, which, though great and strong, will be overthrown. The tree
symbolizes the Egyptian power, which was exalted but which, before God,
31:10-14 - The fall of the great tree (Egypt) will be a spectacle for
all nations, who will learn from God's judgment. The destruction of
human empires serves as a warning to all nations that no human
31:15-17 - The fall of Egypt will be like the fall of other great
nations that have fallen in the past. This reinforces the theme of the
ephemerality of human kingdoms and the fact that all are susceptible to
31:18:00 - Egypt, like the fallen tree, will be forgotten by all
nations, and its greatness will be remembered only by its fall. The
pride and self-sufficiency of powerful nations are temporary, for only
