LORD been revealed?

earth; There was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him, nor
appearance that would attract us to him.

the LORD laid upon him the guilt of us all.

evildoers, Though he had done no wrong nor spoken any falsehood.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` (But the LORD was pleased to crush him in infirmity.) If he gives
his life as an offering for sin, he shall see his descendants in a long
life, and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Because of his affliction he shall see the light in fullness of
days; Through his suffering, my servant shall justify many, and their

divide the spoils with the mighty, Because he surrendered himself to
