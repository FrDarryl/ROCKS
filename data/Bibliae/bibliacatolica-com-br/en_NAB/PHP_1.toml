"1" = ''':sup:`1` Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the holy ones in
Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and ministers:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I give thanks to my God at every remembrance of you,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` praying always with joy in my every prayer for all of you,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` because of your partnership for the gospel from the first day until
now.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you
will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It is right that I should think this way about all of you, because I
hold you in my heart, you who are all partners with me in grace, both
in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the affection
of Christ Jesus.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And this is my prayer: that your love may increase ever more and
more in knowledge and every kind of perception,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` to discern what is of value, so that you may be pure and blameless
for the day of Christ,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus
Christ for the glory and praise of God.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I want you to know, brothers, that my situation has turned out
rather to advance the gospel,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` so that my imprisonment has become well known in Christ throughout
the whole praetorium and to all the rest,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and so that the majority of the brothers, having taken
encouragement in the Lord from my imprisonment, dare more than ever to
proclaim the word fearlessly.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Of course, some preach Christ from envy and rivalry, others from
good will.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The latter act out of love, aware that I am here for the defense of
the gospel;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not from pure
motives, thinking that they will cause me trouble in my imprisonment.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` What difference does it make, as long as in every way, whether in
pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed? And in that I
rejoice. Indeed I shall continue to rejoice,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` through your prayers and support from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` My eager expectation and hope is that I shall not be put to shame
in any way, but that with all boldness, now as always, Christ will be
magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For to me life is Christ, and death is gain.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` If I go on living in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me.
And I do not know which I shall choose.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` I am caught between the two. I long to depart this life and be with
Christ, (for) that is far better.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Yet that I remain (in) the flesh is more necessary for your
benefit.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And this I know with confidence, that I shall remain and continue
in the service of all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` so that your boasting in Christ Jesus may abound on account of me
when I come to you again.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Only, conduct yourselves in a way worthy of the gospel of Christ,
so that, whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear news of
you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind struggling
together for the faith of the gospel,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` not intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is proof to them
of destruction, but of your salvation. And this is God's doing.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For to you has been granted, for the sake of Christ, not only to
believe in him but also to suffer for him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Yours is the same struggle as you saw in me and now hear about me.
