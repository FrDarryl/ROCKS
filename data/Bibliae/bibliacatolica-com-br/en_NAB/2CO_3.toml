"1" = ''':sup:`1` Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some
do, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` You are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by all,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` shown to be a letter of Christ administered by us, written not in
ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on
tablets that are hearts of flesh.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Such confidence we have through Christ toward God.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Not that of ourselves we are qualified to take credit for anything
as coming from us; rather, our qualification comes from God,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` who has indeed qualified us as ministers of a new covenant, not of
letter but of spirit; for the letter brings death, but the Spirit gives
life.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, was so
glorious that the Israelites could not look intently at the face of
Moses because of its glory that was going to fade,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` how much more will the ministry of the Spirit be glorious?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, the ministry of
righteousness will abound much more in glory.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Indeed, what was endowed with glory has come to have no glory in
this respect because of the glory that surpasses it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For if what was going to fade was glorious, how much more will what
endures be glorious.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Therefore, since we have such hope, we act very boldly
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the
Israelites could not look intently at the cessation of what was fading.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Rather, their thoughts were rendered dull, for to this present day
the same veil remains unlifted when they read the old covenant, because
through Christ it is taken away.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` To this day, in fact, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over
their hearts,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` but whenever a person turns to the Lord the veil is removed.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is freedom.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` All of us, gazing with unveiled face on the glory of the Lord, are
being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the
Lord who is the Spirit.

Notas de rodap√©:
3:2-3 - Paul praises the Corinthians as living epistles of Christ,
known and read by all. Their spiritual transformation is visible and
3:4-6 - Paul speaks of the confidence we have before God, not because
we are sufficient, but because God empowers us through the Spirit.
Grace is the foundation of Christian ministry, which is based not on
3:7-11 - Paul contrasts the old covenant, which brought death, with the
new covenant in Christ, which brings life and glory. The superiority of
the new covenant is evidenced by the abiding and effective Spirit (see
03:18 - As we behold the glory of Christ, we are transformed from glory
to glory, reflecting the image of God. Sanctification is an ongoing
process in the believer's life, driven by the Spirit's action (see also
