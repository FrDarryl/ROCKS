Israel:

"2" = ''':sup:`2` What a lioness was your mother, a lion of lions! Among young lions
she couched to rear her whelps.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` One whelp she raised up, a young lion he became; He learned to seize
prey, men he devoured.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then nations raised cries against him, in their pit he was caught;
They took him away with hooks to the land of Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then she saw that in vain she had waited, her hope was destroyed.
She took another of her whelps, him she made a young lion.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He prowled among the lions, a young lion he became; He learned to
seize prey, men he devoured;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He ravaged their strongholds, their cities he wasted. The land and
all in it were appalled at the noise of his roar.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Nations laid out against him snares all about him; They spread their
net to take him, in their pit he was caught.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` They put him in a cage and took him away to the king of Babylon, So

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Your mother was like a vine planted by the water; Fruitful and
branchy was she because of the abundant water.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` One strong branch she put out as a royal scepter. Stately was her
height amid the dense foliage; Notably tall was she with her many
clusters.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But she was torn up in fury and flung to the ground; The east wind
withered her up, her fruit was torn off; Then her strong branch
withered up, fire devoured it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So now she is planted in the desert, in a land dry and parched,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For fire came out of the branch and devoured her shoots; She is now
without a strong branch, a ruler's scepter. This is a lamentation and
serves as a lamentation.
