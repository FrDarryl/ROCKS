"1" = ''':sup:`1` was drawing near,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to put him
to death, for they were afraid of the people.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then Satan entered into Judas, the one surnamed Iscariot, who was
counted among the Twelve,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and he went to the chief priests and temple guards to discuss a plan
for handing him over to them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They were pleased and agreed to pay him money.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He accepted their offer and sought a favorable opportunity to hand
him over to them in the absence of a crowd.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When the day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread arrived, the day for
sacrificing the Passover lamb,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he sent out Peter and John, instructing them, "Go and make
preparations for us to eat the Passover."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` They asked him, "Where do you want us to make the preparations?"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And he answered them, "When you go into the city, a man will meet
you carrying a jar of water. Follow him into the house that he enters
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and say to the master of the house, 'The teacher says to you,
"Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my
disciples?"'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He will show you a large upper room that is furnished. Make the
preparations there."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then they went off and found everything exactly as he had told
them, and there they prepared the Passover.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When the hour came, he took his place at table with the apostles.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with
you before I suffer,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` for, I tell you, I shall not eat it (again) until there is
fulfillment in the kingdom of God."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said, "Take this and share it
among yourselves;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` for I tell you (that) from this time on I shall not drink of the
fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then he took the bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to
them, saying, "This is my body, which will be given for you; do this in
memory of me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup is the
new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "And yet behold, the hand of the one who is to betray me is with me
on the table;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` for the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined; but woe
to that man by whom he is betrayed."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they began to debate among themselves who among them would do
such a deed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then an argument broke out among them about which of them should be
regarded as the greatest.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them and
those in authority over them are addressed as 'Benefactors';
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` but among you it shall not be so. Rather, let the greatest among
you be as the youngest, and the leader as the servant.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For who is greater: the one seated at table or the one who serves?
Is it not the one seated at table? I am among you as the one who
serves.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` It is you who have stood by me in my trials;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father has conferred one
on me,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will
sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like
wheat,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you
have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He said to him, "Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die
with you."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But he replied, "I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day,
you will deny three times that you know me."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` He said to them, "When I sent you forth without a money bag or a
sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?" "No, nothing," they
replied.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He said to them, "But now one who has a money bag should take it,
and likewise a sack, and one who does not have a sword should sell his
cloak and buy one.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, namely,
'He was counted among the wicked'; and indeed what is written about me
is coming to fulfillment."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Then they said, "Lord, look, there are two swords here." But he
replied, "It is enough!"
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Then going out he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives,
and the disciples followed him.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` When he arrived at the place he said to them, "Pray that you may
not undergo the test."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` After withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling, he
prayed,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` saying, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me;
still, not my will but yours be done."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` (And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` He was in such agony and he prayed so fervently that his sweat
became like drops of blood falling on the ground.)
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` When he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples, he found
them sleeping from grief.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` He said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you
may not undergo the test."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` While he was still speaking, a crowd approached and in front was
one of the Twelve, a man named Judas. He went up to Jesus to kiss him.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a
kiss?"
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` His disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked,
"Lord, shall we strike with a sword?"
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And one of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his
right ear.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` But Jesus said in reply, "Stop, no more of this!" Then he touched
the servant's ear and healed him.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` And Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards and elders
who had come for him, "Have you come out as against a robber, with
swords and clubs?
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Day after day I was with you in the temple area, and you did not
seize me; but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness."
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` After arresting him they led him away and took him into the house
of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it,
and Peter sat down with them.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` When a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him
and said, "This man too was with him."
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` But he denied it saying, "Woman, I do not know him."
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` A short while later someone else saw him and said, "You too are one
of them"; but Peter answered, "My friend, I am not."
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` About an hour later, still another insisted, "Assuredly, this man
too was with him, for he also is a Galilean."
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` But Peter said, "My friend, I do not know what you are talking
about." Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` and the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the
word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows today,
you will deny me three times."
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` He went out and began to weep bitterly.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` The men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` They blindfolded him and questioned him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is
it that struck you?"
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` And they reviled him in saying many other things against him.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` When day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief
priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` They said, "If you are the Messiah, tell us," but he replied to
them, "If I tell you, you will not believe,
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` and if I question, you will not respond.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right
hand of the power of God."
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied to them,
"You say that I am."
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` Then they said, "What further need have we for testimony? We have
heard it from his own mouth."
