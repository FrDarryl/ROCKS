Enharod with all his soldiers. The camp of Midian was in the valley
north of Gibeath-hammoreh.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many soldiers with you for me
to deliver Midian into their power, lest Israel vaunt itself against me
and say, 'My own power brought me the victory.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now proclaim to all the soldiers, 'If anyone is afraid or fearful,
let him leave.'" When Gideon put them to this test on the mountain,
twenty-two thousand of the soldiers left, but ten thousand remained.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many soldiers. Lead
them down to the water and I will test them for you there. If I tell
you that a certain man is to go with you, he must go with you. But no
one is to go if I tell you he must not."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Gideon led the soldiers down to the water, the LORD said to
him, "You shall set to one side everyone who laps up the water as a dog
does with its tongue; to the other, everyone who kneels down to drink."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Those who lapped up the water raised to their mouths by hand
numbered three hundred, but all the rest of the soldiers knelt down to
drink the water.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The LORD said to Gideon, "By means of the three hundred who lapped
up the water I will save you and will deliver Midian into your power.
So let all the other soldiers go home."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Their horns, and such supplies as the soldiers had with them, were
taken up, and Gideon ordered the rest of the Israelites to their tents,
but kept the three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was beneath him
in the valley.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` That night the LORD said to Gideon, "Go, descend on the camp, for I
have delivered it up to you.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your aide
Purah.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When you hear what they are saying, you will have the courage to
descend on the camp." So he went down with his aide Purah to the
outposts of the camp.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The Midianites, Amalekites, and all the Kedemites lay in the
valley, as numerous as locusts. Nor could their camels be counted, for
these were as many as the sands on the seashore.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Gideon arrived, one man was telling another about a dream. "I
had a dream," he said, "that a round loaf of barley bread was rolling
into the camp of Midian. It came to our tent and struck it, and as it
fell it turned the tent upside down."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` "This can only be the sword of the Israelite Gideon, son of Joash,"
the other replied. "God has delivered Midian and all the camp into his
power."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When Gideon heard the description and explanation of the dream, he
prostrated himself. Then returning to the camp of Israel, he said,
"Arise, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian into your power."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and provided
them all with horns and with empty jars and torches inside the jars.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` "Watch me and follow my lead," he told them. "I shall go to the
edge of the camp, and as I do, you must do also.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When I and those with me blow horns, you too must blow horns all
around the camp and cry out, 'For the LORD and for Gideon!'"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of
the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after the posting
of the guards. They blew the horns and broke the jars they were
holding.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` All three companies blew horns and broke their jars. They held the
torches in their left hands, and in their right the horns they were
blowing, and cried out, "A sword for the LORD and Gideon!"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They all remained standing in place around the camp, while the
whole camp fell to running and shouting and fleeing.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the three hundred men kept blowing the horns, and throughout
the camp the LORD set the sword of one against another. The army fled
as far as Beth-shittah in the direction of Zarethan, near the border of
Abel-meholah at Tabbath.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The Israelites were called to arms from Naphtali, from Asher, and
from all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Gideon also sent messengers throughout the mountain region of
Ephraim to say, "Go down to confront Midian, and seize the water
courses against them as far as Beth-barah, as well as the Jordan." So
all the Ephraimites were called to arms, and they seized the water
courses as far as Beth-barah, and the Jordan as well.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` They captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, killing
