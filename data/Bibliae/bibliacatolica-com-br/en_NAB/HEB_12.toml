the heavenly Jerusalem, and countless angels in festal gathering,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` and the assembly of the firstborn enrolled in heaven, and God the
judge of all, and the spirits of the just made perfect,

"24" = ''':sup:`24` and Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and the sprinkled blood
that speaks more eloquently than that of Abel.

created things, so that what is unshaken may remain.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` Therefore, we who are receiving the unshakable kingdom should have
gratitude, with which we should offer worship pleasing to God in
reverence and awe.
