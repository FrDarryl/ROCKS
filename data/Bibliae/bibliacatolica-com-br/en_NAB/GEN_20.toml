between Kadesh and Shur. While he stayed in Gerar,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` he said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So Abimelech, king of
Gerar, sent and took Sarah.

are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she has a
husband."

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Abimelech, who had not approached her, said: "O Lord, would you slay
a man even though he is innocent?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He himself told me, 'She is my sister,' and she herself also stated,
'He is my brother.' I did it in good faith and with clean hands."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` God answered him in the dream: "Yes, I know you did it in good
faith. In fact, it was I who kept you from sinning against me; that is
why I did not let you touch her.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore, return the man's wife--as a spokesman he will intercede

this to us! What wrong did I do to you that you should have brought
such monstrous guilt on me and my kingdom? You have treated me in an
intolerable way.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` What were you afraid of," he asked him, "that you should have done
such a thing?"

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Besides, she is in truth my sister, but only my father's daughter,
not my mother's; and so she became my wife.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When God sent me wandering from my father's house, I asked her:
'Would you do me this favor? In whatever place we come to, say that I
am your brother.'"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then Abimelech took flocks and herds and male and female slaves and
gave them to Abraham; and after he restored his wife Sarah to him,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` he said, "Here, my land lies at your disposal; settle wherever you
please."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` To Sarah he said: "See, I have given your brother a thousand
shekels of silver. Let that serve you as a vindication before all who
are with you; your honor has been preserved with everyone."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Abraham then interceded with God, and God restored health to
Abimelech, that is, to his wife and his maidservants, so that they
could bear children;

account of Abraham's wife Sarah.
