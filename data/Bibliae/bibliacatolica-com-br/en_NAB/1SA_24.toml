Saul's mantle.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing
to my master, the LORD'S anointed, as to lay a hand on him, for he is
the Lord's anointed."

into my grasp in the cave. I had some thought of killing you, but I
took pity on you instead. I decided, 'I will not raise a hand against
my lord, for he is the LORD'S anointed and a father to me.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Look here at this end of your mantle which I hold. Since I cut off
an end of your mantle and did not kill you, see and be convinced that I
plan no harm and no rebellion. I have done you no wrong, though you are

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Great is the generosity you showed me today, when the LORD
delivered me into your grasp and you did not kill me.

sovereignty over Israel shall come into your possession,

"22" = ''':sup:`22` swear to me by the LORD that you will not destroy my descendants
and that you will not blot out my name and family."
