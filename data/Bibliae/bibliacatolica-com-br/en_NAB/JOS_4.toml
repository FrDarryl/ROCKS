"5" = ''':sup:`5` Joshua said to them: "Go to the bed of the Jordan in front of the

that they will equal in number the tribes of the Israelites.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` In the future, these are to be a sign among you. When your children

"8" = ''':sup:`8` The twelve Israelites did as Joshua had commanded: they took up as

up from the Jordan."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Joshua did so,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and when the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD
had come up from the bed of the Jordan, as the soles of their feet
regained the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan resumed their course
and as before overflowed all its banks.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first
month, and camped in Gilgal on the eastern limits of Jericho.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` At Gilgal Joshua set up the twelve stones which had been taken from
the Jordan,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` For the LORD, your God, dried up the waters of the Jordan in front

the Red Sea, which he dried up in front of us until we crossed over;

"24" = ''':sup:`24` in order that all the peoples of the earth may learn that the hand
of the LORD is mighty, and that you may fear the LORD, your God,
forever."

Notas de rodap√©:
4:1-3 - God instructs Joshua to collect stones from the Jordan as a
memorial. Creating markers is crucial to remembering God's
interventions and strengthening the faith of future generations (see

of Israel of God's miracle. This act of remembrance is a vital practice
in the life of faith, helping to cultivate gratitude and hope (see also
4:9 - Joshua also erects a monument in the middle of the Jordan,
showing that God's presence should be remembered even in places where
He has worked mightily. This highlights the importance of recognizing
Timothy 1:6-7).
04:14 - God exalts Joshua before Israel, confirming his leadership.
This shows that true authority is established by God and that respect
4:20-24 - Joshua's instruction to teach his children about what God did
at the Jordan is an example of the importance of passing on faith.
Stories of how God works in our lives should be shared to encourage the
