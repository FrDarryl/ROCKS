Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - Paul exhorts the Corinthians not to receive God's grace in
vain, emphasizing the urgency of salvation. The "today" of salvation is
a continual invitation to personal transformation and conversion (see
6:3-10 - Paul describes the hardships and sufferings he and the other
apostles faced, but reaffirms that, despite them, he remained faithful
to God's calling. The Christian life is marked by trials, but also by
Corinthians 4:11-13).
6:14-18 - Paul warns Christians about the incompatibility of
righteousness and wickedness. Separation from the world and commitment
06:17 - Come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord.
Sanctification requires turning away from sin, reflecting the
transformation God brings about in the lives of believers (see also
06:18 - God promises to be the Father of His people, a deep bond of
relationship that characterizes the new covenant. Fellowship with God
