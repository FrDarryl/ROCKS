calling us when you went to fight against Midian?" And they quarreled
bitterly with him.

What have I been able to do in comparison with you?" When he said this,

army?"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Gideon said, "Very well; when the LORD has delivered Zebah and
Zalmunna into my power, I will grind your flesh in with the thorns and
briers of the desert."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He went up from there to Penuel and made the same request of them,
but the men of Penuel answered him as had the men of Succoth.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So to the men of Penuel, too, he said, "When I return in triumph, I
will demolish this tower."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their force of about

'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, "Where now are the men you
killed at Tabor?" "They all resembled you," they replied. "They
appeared to be princes."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "They were my brothers, my mother's sons," he said. "As the LORD
lives, if you had spared their lives, I should not kill you."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then he said to his first-born, Jether, "Go, kill them." Since
Jether was still a boy, he was afraid and did not draw his sword.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Come, kill us yourself, for a man's

their camels.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` The Israelites then said to Gideon, "Rule over us--you, your son,
and your son's son--for you rescued us from the power of Midian."

"23" = ''':sup:`23` But Gideon answered them, "I will not rule over you, nor shall my
son rule over you. The LORD must rule over you."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Gideon went on to say, "I should like to make a request of you.
Will each of you give me a ring from his booty?" (For being
Ishmaelites, the enemy had gold rings.)

"25" = ''':sup:`25` "We will gladly give them," they replied, and spread out a cloak

"26" = ''':sup:`26` The gold rings that he requested weighed seventeen hundred gold

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Gideon made an ephod out of the gold and placed it in his city
Ophrah. However, all Israel paid idolatrous homage to it there, and
caused the ruin of Gideon and his family.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Thus was Midian brought into subjection by the Israelites; no
longer did they hold their heads high. And the land had rest for forty
years, during the lifetime of Gideon.
