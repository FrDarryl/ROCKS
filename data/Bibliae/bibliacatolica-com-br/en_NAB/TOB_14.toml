received an honorable burial in Nineveh.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He was sixty-two years old when he lost his eyesight, and after he
recovered it he lived in prosperity, giving alms and continually
blessing God and praising the divine Majesty.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Just before he died, he called his son Tobiah and Tobiah's seven
sons, and gave him this command: "Son, take your children
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and flee into Media, for I believe God's word which was spoken by
Nahum against Nineveh. It shall all happen, and shall overtake Assyria
and Nineveh; indeed, whatever was said by Israel's prophets, whom God
commissioned, shall occur. Not one of all the oracles shall remain
unfulfilled, but everything shall take place in the time appointed for
it. So it will be safer in Media than in Assyria or Babylon. For I know
and believe that whatever God has spoken will be accomplished. It shall
happen, and not a single word of the prophecies shall prove false. "As
for our kinsmen who dwell in Israel, they shall all be scattered and
led away into exile from the Good Land. The entire country of Israel
shall become desolate; even Samaria and Jerusalem shall become
desolate! God's temple there shall be burnt to the ground and shall be
desolate for a while.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But God will again have mercy on them and bring them back to the
land of Israel. They shall rebuild the temple, but it will not be like
the first one, until the era when the appointed times shall be
completed. Afterward all of them shall return from their exile, and
they shall rebuild Jerusalem with splendor. In her the temple of God
shall also be rebuilt; yes, it will be rebuilt for all generations to
come, just as the prophets of Israel said of her.

the Israelites who are to be saved in those days will truly be mindful
of God, they shall be gathered together and go to Jerusalem; in
security shall they dwell forever in the land of Abraham, which will be
given over to them. Those who sincerely love God shall rejoice, but
those who become guilty of sin shall completely disappear from the
land.

'''

bless his name sincerely and with all their strength.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The day you bury your mother next to me, do not even stay overnight
within the confines of the city. For I see that people here shamelessly
commit all sorts of wickedness and treachery. Think, my son, of all
that Nadab did to Ahiqar, the very one who brought him up: Ahiqar went
down alive into the earth! Yet God made Nadab's disgraceful crime
rebound against him. Ahiqar came out again into the light, but Nadab
went into the everlasting darkness, for he had tried to kill Ahiqar.
Because Ahiqar had given alms to me, he escaped from the deadly trap
Nadab had set for him. But Nadab himself fell into the deadly trap, and
it destroyed him.
