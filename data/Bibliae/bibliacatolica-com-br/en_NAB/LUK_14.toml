Notas de rodap√©:
14:1-6 - Jesus heals the man with dropsy on the Sabbath, challenging
the idea that the law should be followed inflexibly, without regard for
mercy. He teaches that God's mercy should be more important than blind
14:7-14 - The parable of the guests at the feast teaches about humility
and service. Jesus encourages the practice of humility, suggesting that
we should put others in a position of honor before ourselves (see also
14:15-24 - The parable of the great supper illustrates how the Kingdom
of God is open to all, especially to the marginalized. The rejection of
the invitation by those initially called reflects the rejection of the
19:9).
14:25-33 - Jesus challenges those who desire to follow Him to count the
cost of discipleship. A true disciple must be willing to give up
everything, including their own interests and relationships, to follow
14:34-35 - Jesus speaks of salt that has lost its flavor, emphasizing
that disciples must be effective in their mission. If they lose their
ability to be salt on earth, they will be of no value to the Kingdom of
