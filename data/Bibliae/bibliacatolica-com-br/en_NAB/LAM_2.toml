has torn down in his anger the fortresses of daughter Judah; He has
brought to the ground in dishonor her king and her princes.

strength; He withheld the support of his right hand when the enemy
approached; He blazed up in Jacob like a flaming fire devouring all
about it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Like an enemy he made taut his bow; with his arrows in his right
hand He took his stand as a foe, and slew all on whom the eye doted;
Over the tent of daughter Zion he poured out his wrath like fire.

his dwelling; In Zion the LORD has made feast and sabbath to be
forgotten; He has scorned in fierce wrath both king and priest.

of her towers he has handed over to the enemy, Who shout in the house
of the LORD as on a feast day.
'''

like a torrent day and night; Let there be no respite for you, no
repose for your eyes.

hands to him for the lives of your little ones (Who faint from hunger
