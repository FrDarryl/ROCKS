"1" = ''':sup:`1` Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In the third year, however, King Jehoshaphat of Judah came down to
the king of Israel,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` who said to his servants, "Do you not know that Ramoth-gilead is
ours and we are doing nothing to take it from the king of Aram?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you come with me to fight against
Ramoth-gilead?" Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel, "You and I are
as one, and your people and my people, your horses and my horses as
well."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "Seek the word of the
LORD at once."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The king of Israel gathered together the prophets, about four
hundred of them, and asked, "Shall I go to attack Ramoth-gilead or
shall I refrain?" "Go up," they answered. "The LORD will deliver it
over to the king."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Jehoshaphat said, "Is there no other prophet of the LORD here
whom we may consult?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The king of Israel answered, "There is one other through whom we
might consult the LORD, Micaiah, son of Imlah; but I hate him because
he prophesies not good but evil about me." Jehoshaphat said, "Let not
your majesty speak of evil against you."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So the king of Israel called an official and said to him, "Get
Micaiah, son of Imlah, at once."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were seated, each
on his throne, clothed in their robes of state on a threshing floor at
the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were
prophesying before them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron and said,
"The LORD says, 'With these you shall gore Aram until you have
destroyed them.'"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The other prophets prophesied in a similar vein, saying: "Go up to
Ramoth-gilead; you shall succeed. The LORD will deliver it over to the
king."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The messenger who had gone to call Micaiah said to him, "Look now,
the prophets are unanimously predicting good for the king. Let your
word be the same as any of theirs; predict good."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` "As the LORD lives," Micaiah answered, "I shall say whatever the
LORD tells me."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When he came to the king, the king said to him, "Micaiah, shall we
go to fight against Ramoth-gilead, or shall we refrain?" "Go up," he
answered, "you shall succeed! The LORD will deliver it over to the
king."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But the king answered him, "How many times must I adjure you to
tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Micaiah said: "I see all Israel scattered on the mountains, like
sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD saying, 'These have no master!
Let each of them go back home in peace.'"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell you he
prophesies not good but evil about me?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Micaiah continued: "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the
LORD seated on his throne, with the whole host of heaven standing by to
his right and to his left.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The LORD asked, 'Who will deceive Ahab, so that he will go up and
fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said this, another that,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` until one of the spirits came forth and presented himself to the
LORD, saying, 'I will deceive him.' The LORD asked, 'How?'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He answered, 'I will go forth and become a lying spirit in the
mouths of all his prophets.' The LORD replied, 'You shall succeed in
deceiving him. Go forth and do this.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So now, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these
prophets of yours, but the LORD himself has decreed evil against you."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thereupon Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, came up and slapped Micaiah
on the cheek, saying, "Has the spirit of the LORD, then, left me to
speak with you?"
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` "You shall find out," Micaiah replied, "on that day when you
retreat into an inside room to hide."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The king of Israel then said, "Seize Micaiah and take him back to
Amon, prefect of the city, and to Joash, the king's son,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and say, 'This is the king's order: Put this man in prison and feed
him scanty rations of bread and water until I return in safety.'"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But Micaiah said, "If ever you return in safety, the LORD has not
spoken through me."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went up to
Ramoth-gilead,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will disguise myself
and go into battle, but you put on your own clothes." So the king of
Israel disguised himself and entered the fray.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` In the meantime the king of Aram had given his thirty-two chariot
commanders the order, "Do not fight with anyone at all except the king
of Israel."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they cried out, "That
must be the king of Israel!" and shifted to fight him. But Jehoshaphat
shouted his battle cry,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and the chariot commanders, aware that he was not the king of
Israel, gave up pursuit of him.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Someone, however, drew his bow at random, and hit the king of
Israel between the joints of his breastplate. He ordered his
charioteer, "Rein about and take me out of the ranks, for I am
disabled."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The battle grew fierce during the day, and the king, who was
propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans, died in the evening. The
blood from his wound flowed to the bottom of the chariot.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` At sunset a cry went through the army, "Every man to his city,
every man to his land,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` for the king is dead!" So they went to Samaria, where they buried
the king.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` When the chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria, the dogs licked
up his blood and harlots bathed there, as the LORD had prophesied.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The rest of the acts of Ahab, with all that he did, including the
ivory palace and all the cities he built, are recorded in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Ahab rested with his ancestors, and his son Ahaziah succeeded him
as king.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Jehoshaphat, son of Asa, began to reign over Judah in the fourth
year of Ahab, king of Israel.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He followed all the ways of his father Asa unswervingly, doing what
was right in the LORD'S sight.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Nevertheless, the high places did not disappear, and the people
continued to sacrifice and to burn incense on the high places.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, with his prowess, what he did
and how he fought, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` He removed from the land the rest of the cult prostitutes who had
remained in the reign of his father Asa.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` There was no king in Edom, but an appointed regent.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Jehoshaphat made Tarshish ships to go to Ophir for gold; but in
fact the ships did not go, because they were wrecked at Ezion-geber.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Then Ahaziah, son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants
accompany your servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat would not agree.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors; he was buried in his
forefathers' City of David. His son Jehoram succeeded him as king.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Ahaziah, son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the
seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; he reigned two years
over Israel.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` He did evil in the sight of the LORD, behaving like his father, his
mother, and Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` He served and worshiped Baal, thus provoking the LORD, the God of
Israel, just as his father had done.

Notas de rodap√©:
22:5-9 - Before going to war against Ramoth-gilead, Jehoshaphat, king
of Judah, asks Ahab to inquire of the word of the Lord. Micaiah, the
true prophet of God, is called, highlighting the importance of seeking
divine guidance before making significant decisions (see also
22:15-18 - Micaiah prophesies Israel's defeat, but Ahab rejects his
message and chooses to follow false prophets. This demonstrates how
refusing to listen to God's truth can lead to destruction (see also
22:19-23 - Micaiah reveals the vision of the heavenly council, where a
lying spirit is sent to deceive Ahab. This vision illustrates God's
sovereign control over all events and God's permissiveness in the face
Thessalonians 2:11-12).
22:29-34 - Despite his precautions, Ahab is mortally wounded in battle,
fulfilling Micaiah's prophecy. This shows that human plans cannot
thwart God's purposes, and God's word always comes true (see also
22:37-40 - Ahab's death and the judgment upon his house are fulfilled
according to the word of the Lord. His reign is marked by idolatry and
disobedience, and his death brings to mind the consequences of sin (see
