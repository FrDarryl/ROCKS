"1" = ''':sup:`1` The following day Holofernes ordered his whole army, and all the
allied troops that had come to his support, to move against Bethulia,
seize the mountain passes, and engage the Israelites in battle.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` That same day all their fighting men went into action. Their forces
numbered a hundred and seventy thousand infantry and twelve thousand
horsemen, not counting the baggage train or the men who accompanied it
on foot-a very great army.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They encamped at the spring in the valley near Bethulia, and spread
out in breadth toward Dothan as far as Balbaim, and in length from
Bethulia to Cyamon, which faces Esdraelon.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When the Israelites saw how many there were, they said to one
another in great dismay: "Soon they will devour the whole country.
Neither the high mountains nor the valleys and hills can support the
mass of them."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Yet they all seized their weapons, lighted fires on their bastions,
and kept watch throughout the night.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` On the second day Holofernes led out all his cavalry in the sight of
the Israelites who were in Bethulia.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He reconnoitered the approaches to their city and located their
sources of water; these he seized, stationing armed detachments around
them, while he himself returned to his troops.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` All the commanders of the Edomites and all the leaders of the
Ammonites, together with the generals of the seacoast, came to
Holofernes and said:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "Sir, listen to what we have to say, that there may be no losses
among your troops.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` These Israelites do not rely on their spears, but on the height of
the mountains where they dwell; it is not easy to reach the summit of
their mountains.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Therefore, sir, do not attack them in regular formation; thus not a
single one of your troops will fall.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Stay in your camp, and spare all your soldiers. Have some of your
servants keep control of the source of water that flows out at the base
of the mountain,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` for that is where the inhabitants of Bethulia get their water. Then
thirst will begin to carry them off, and they will surrender their
city. Meanwhile, we and our men will go up to the summits of the nearby
mountains, and encamp there to guard against anyone's leaving the city.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` They and their wives and children will languish with hunger, and
even before the sword strikes them they will be laid low in the streets
of their city.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thus you will render them dire punishment for their rebellion and
their refusal to meet you peacefully."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Their words pleased Holofernes and all his ministers, and he
ordered their proposal to be carried out.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thereupon the Moabites moved camp, together with five thousand
Assyrians. They encamped in the valley, and held the water supply and
the springs of the Israelites.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The Edomites and the Ammonites went up and encamped in the mountain
region opposite Dothan; and they sent some of their men to the south
and to the east opposite Egrebel, near Chusi, which is on Wadi Mochmur.
The rest of the Assyrian army was encamped in the plain, covering the
whole countryside. Their enormous store of tents and equipment was
spread out in profusion everywhere.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The Israelites cried to the Lord, their God, for they were
disheartened, since all their enemies had them surrounded, and there
was no way of slipping through their lines.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The whole Assyrian camp, infantry, chariots, and cavalry, kept them
thus surrounded for thirty-four days. All the reservoirs of water
failed the inhabitants of Bethulia,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and the cisterns ran dry, so that on no day did they have enough to
drink, but their drinking water was rationed.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Their children fainted away, and the women and youths were consumed
with thirst and were collapsing in the streets and gateways of the
city, with no strength left in them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` All the people, therefore, including youths, women, and children,
went in a crowd to Uzziah and the rulers of the city. They set up a
great clamor and said before the elders:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "God judge between you and us! You have done us grave injustice in
not making peace with the Assyrians.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` There is no help for us now! Instead, God has sold us into their
power by laying us prostrate before them in thirst and utter
exhaustion.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Therefore, summon them and deliver the whole city as booty to the
troops of Holofernes and to all his forces;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` we would be better off to become their prey. We should indeed be
made slaves, but at least we should live, and not have to behold our
little ones dying before our eyes and our wives and children breathing
out their souls.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` We adjure you by heaven and earth, and by our God, the Lord of our
forefathers, who is punishing us for our sins and those of our
forefathers, to do as we have proposed, this very day."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` All in the assembly with one accord broke into shrill wailing and
loud cries to the Lord their God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But Uzziah said to them, "Courage, my brothers! Let us wait five
days more for the Lord our God, to show his mercy toward us; he will
not utterly forsake us.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But if those days pass without help coming to us, I will do as you
say."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then he dispersed the men to their posts, and they returned to the
walls and towers of the city; the women and children he sent to their
homes. Throughout the city they were in great misery.
