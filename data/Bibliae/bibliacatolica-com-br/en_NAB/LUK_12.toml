Pharisees.

that will not be known.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in
the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be
proclaimed on the housetops.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body
but after that can do no more.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I shall show you whom to fear. Be afraid of the one who after
killing has the power to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, be afraid
of that one.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins? Yet not one of them
has escaped the notice of God.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid.
You are worth more than many sparrows.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before others the Son of
Man will acknowledge before the angels of God.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` "Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be
forgiven, but the one who blasphemes against the holy Spirit will not
be forgiven.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` When they take you before synagogues and before rulers and
authorities, do not worry about how or what your defense will be or
about what you are to say.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` For the holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you should
say."

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to
share the inheritance with me."

"14" = ''':sup:`14` He replied to him, "Friend, who appointed me as your judge and
arbitrator?"

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then he said to the crowd, "Take care to guard against all greed,
for though one may be rich, one's life does not consist of
possessions."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then he told them a parable. "There was a rich man whose land
produced a bountiful harvest.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He asked himself, 'What shall I do, for I do not have space to
store my harvest?'

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he said, 'This is what I shall do: I shall tear down my barns

about your life and what you will eat, or about your body and what you
will wear.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` For life is more than food and the body more than clothing.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Notice the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have neither
storehouse nor barn, yet God feeds them. How much more important are
you than birds!

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Can any of you by worrying add a moment to your lifespan?

"26" = ''':sup:`26` If even the smallest things are beyond your control, why are you
anxious about the rest?

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Notice how the flowers grow. They do not toil or spin. But I tell
you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` If God so clothes the grass in the field that grows today and is
thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O
you of little faith?

"29" = ''':sup:`29` As for you, do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to
drink, and do not worry anymore.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` All the nations of the world seek for these things, and your Father
knows that you need them.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` Instead, seek his kingdom, and these other things will be given you
besides.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` Do not be afraid any longer, little flock, for your Father is
pleased to give you the kingdom.

"33" = ''':sup:`33` Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for
yourselves that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven
that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.

wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.

"37" = ''':sup:`37` Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his
arrival. Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself, have them recline at
table, and proceed to wait on them.

"38" = ''':sup:`38` And should he come in the second or third watch and find them
prepared in this way, blessed are those servants.

"39" = ''':sup:`39` Be sure of this: if the master of the house had known the hour when
the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.

"40" = ''':sup:`40` You also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the
Son of Man will come."

"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then Peter said, "Lord, is this parable meant for us or for
everyone?"

"42" = ''':sup:`42` And the Lord replied, "Who, then, is the faithful and prudent
steward whom the master will put in charge of his servants to
distribute (the) food allowance at the proper time?

"44" = ''':sup:`44` Truly, I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his property.

"45" = ''':sup:`45` But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed in
coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, to
eat and drink and get drunk,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` then that servant's master will come on an unexpected day and at an
unknown hour and will punish him severely and assign him a place with
the unfaithful.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` That servant who knew his master's will but did not make
preparations nor act in accord with his will shall be beaten severely;
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` and the servant who was ignorant of his master's will but acted in
a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beaten only lightly. Much
will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will
be demanded of the person entrusted with more.

"49" = ''':sup:`49` "I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were
already blazing!

"50" = ''':sup:`50` There is a baptism with which I must be baptized, and how great is
my anguish until it is accomplished!

"51" = ''':sup:`51` Do you think that I have come to establish peace on the earth? No,
I tell you, but rather division.

"52" = ''':sup:`52` From now on a household of five will be divided, three against two
and two against three;

"53" = ''':sup:`53` a father will be divided against his son and a son against his
father, a mother against her daughter and a daughter against her
mother, a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and a
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law."

west you say immediately that it is going to rain--and so it does;

"55" = ''':sup:`55` and when you notice that the wind is blowing from the south you say
that it is going to be hot--and so it is.

"56" = ''':sup:`56` You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the
earth and the sky; why do you not know how to interpret the present
time?

"57" = ''':sup:`57` "Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` If you are to go with your opponent before a magistrate, make an
effort to settle the matter on the way; otherwise your opponent will
turn you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the
constable, and the constable throw you into prison.
