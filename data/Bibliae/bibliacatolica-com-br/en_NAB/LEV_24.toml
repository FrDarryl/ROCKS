"1" = ''':sup:`1` The LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land that
I am giving you, let the land, too, keep a sabbath for the LORD.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For six years you may sow your field, and for six years prune your
vineyard, gathering in their produce.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But during the seventh year the land shall have a complete rest, a
sabbath for the LORD, when you may neither sow your field nor prune
your vineyard.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap, nor shall you
pick the grapes of your untrimmed vines in this year of sabbath rest
for the land.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` While the land has its sabbath, all its produce will be food equally
for you yourself and for your male and female slaves, for your hired
help and the tenants who live with you,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and likewise for your livestock and for the wild animals on your
land.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` "Seven weeks of years shall you count--seven times seven years--so
that the seven cycles amount to forty-nine years.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month let the trumpet resound;
on this, the Day of Atonement, the trumpet blast shall re-echo
throughout your land.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This fiftieth year you shall make sacred by proclaiming liberty in
the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, when
every one of you shall return to his own property, every one to his own
family estate.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` In this fiftieth year, your year of jubilee, you shall not sow, nor
shall you reap the aftergrowth or pick the grapes from the untrimmed
vines.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Since this is the jubilee, which shall be sacred for you, you may
not eat of its produce, except as taken directly from the field.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "In this year of jubilee, then, every one of you shall return to
his own property.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Therefore, when you sell any land to your neighbor or buy any from
him, do not deal unfairly.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` On the basis of the number of years since the last jubilee shall
you purchase the land from him; and so also, on the basis of the number
of years for crops, shall he sell it to you.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When the years are many, the price shall be so much the more; when
the years are few, the price shall be so much the less. For it is
really the number of crops that he sells you.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Do not deal unfairly, then; but stand in fear of your God. I, the
LORD, am your God.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Observe my precepts and be careful to keep my regulations, for
then you will dwell securely in the land.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The land will yield its fruit and you will have food in abundance,
so that you may live there without worry.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Therefore, do not say, 'What shall we eat in the seventh year, if
we do not then sow or reap our crop?'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I will bestow such blessings on you in the sixth year that there
will then be crop enough for three years.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When you sow in the eighth year, you will continue to eat from the
old crop; and even into the ninth year, when the crop comes in, you
will still have the old to eat from.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "The land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine,
and you are but aliens who have become my tenants.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Therefore, in every part of the country that you occupy, you must
permit the land to be redeemed.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When one of your countrymen is reduced to poverty and has to sell
some of his property, his closest relative, who has the right to redeem
it, may go and buy back what his kinsman has sold.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` If, however, the man has no relative to redeem his land, but later
on acquires sufficient means to buy it back in his own name,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` he shall make a deduction from the price in proportion to the
number of years since the sale, and then pay back the balance to the
one to whom he sold it, so that he may thus regain his own property.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But if he does not acquire sufficient means to buy back his land,
what he has sold shall remain in the possession of the purchaser until
the jubilee, when it must be released and returned to its original
owner.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` "When someone sells a dwelling in a walled town, he has the right
to buy it back during the time of one full year from its sale.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But if such a house in a walled town has not been redeemed at the
end of a full year, it shall belong in perpetuity to the purchaser and
his descendants; nor shall it be released in the jubilee.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` However, houses in villages that are not encircled by walls shall
be considered as belonging to the surrounding farm land; they may be
redeemed at any time, and in the jubilee they must be released.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` "In levitical cities the Levites shall always have the right to
redeem the town houses that are their property.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Any town house of the Levites in their cities that had been sold
and not redeemed, shall be released in the jubilee; for the town houses
of the Levites are their hereditary property in the midst of the
Israelites.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Moreover, the pasture land belonging to their cities shall not be
sold at all; it must always remain their hereditary property.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` "When one of your fellow countrymen is reduced to poverty and is
unable to hold out beside you, extend to him the privileges of an alien
or a tenant, so that he may continue to live with you.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Do not exact interest from your countryman either in money or in
kind, but out of fear of God let him live with you.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` You are to lend him neither money at interest nor food at a profit.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` I, the LORD, am your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt
to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` "When, then, your countryman becomes so impoverished beside you
that he sells you his services, do not make him work as a slave.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Rather, let him be like a hired servant or like your tenant,
working with you until the jubilee year,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` when he, together with his children, shall be released from your
service and return to his kindred and to the property of his ancestors.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Since those whom I brought out of the land of Egypt are servants of
mine, they shall not be sold as slaves to any man.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Do not lord it over them harshly, but stand in fear of your God.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` "Slaves, male and female, you may indeed possess, provided you buy
them from among the neighboring nations.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` You may also buy them from among the aliens who reside with you and
from their children who are born and reared in your land. Such slaves
you may own as chattels,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and leave to your sons as their hereditary property, making them
perpetual slaves. But you shall not lord it harshly over any of the
Israelites, your kinsmen.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` "When one of your countrymen is reduced to such poverty that he
sells himself to a wealthy alien who has a permanent or a temporary
residence among you, or to one of the descendants of an immigrant
family,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` even after he has thus sold his services he still has the right of
redemption; he may be redeemed by one of his own brothers,
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` or by his uncle or cousin, or by some other relative or fellow
clansman; or, if he acquires the means, he may redeem himself.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` With his purchaser he shall compute the years from the sale to the
jubilee, distributing the sale price over these years as though he had
been hired as a day laborer.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` The more such years there are, the more of the sale price he shall
pay back as ransom;
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` the fewer years there are left before the jubilee year, the more he
has to his credit; in proportion to his years of service shall he pay
his ransom.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` The alien shall treat him as a servant hired on an annual basis,
and he shall not lord it over him harshly under your very eyes.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` If he is not thus redeemed, he shall nevertheless be released,
together with his children, in the jubilee year.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` For to me the Israelites belong as servants; they are servants of
mine, because I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I, the LORD,
your God.
