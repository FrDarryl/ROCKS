"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a revelation was given
to Daniel, who had been named Belteshazzar. The revelation was certain:
a great war; he understood it from the vision.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In those days, I, Daniel, mourned three full weeks.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I ate no savory food, I took no meat or wine, and I did not anoint
myself at all until the end of the three weeks.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` On the twenty-fourth day of the first month I was on the bank of the
great river, the Tigris.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As I looked up, I saw a man dressed in linen with a belt of fine
gold around his waist.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` His body was like chrysolite, his face shown like lightning, his
eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and feet looked like burnished
bronze, and his voice sounded like the roar of a multitude.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I alone, Daniel, saw the vision; but great fear seized the men who
were with me; they fled and hid themselves, although they did not see
the vision.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So I was left alone, seeing this great vision. No strength remained
in me; I turned the color of death and was powerless.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When I heard the sound of his voice, I fell face forward in a faint.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But then a hand touched me, raising me to my hands and knees.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "Daniel, beloved," he said to me, "understand the words which I am
speaking to you; stand up, for my mission now is to you." When he said
this to me, I stood up trembling.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` "Fear not, Daniel," he continued; "from the first day you made up
your mind to acquire understanding and humble yourself before God, your
prayer was heard. Because of it I started out,

"13" = ''':sup:`13` but the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood in my way for
twenty-one days, until finally Michael, one of the chief princes, came
to help me. I left him there with the prince of the kings of Persia,

"14" = ''':sup:`14` and came to make you understand what shall happen to your people in
the days to come; for there is yet a vision concerning those days."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` While he was speaking thus to me, I fell forward and kept silent.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then something like a man's hand touched my lips; I opened my mouth
and said to the one facing me, "My lord, I was seized with pangs at the
vision and I was powerless.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` How can my lord's servant speak with you, my lord? For now no
strength or even breath is left in me."

"18" = ''':sup:`18` The one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me,
saying,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` "Fear not, beloved, you are safe; take courage and be strong."

"20" = ''':sup:`20` When he spoke to me, I grew strong and said, "Speak, my lord, for
you have strengthened me." "Do you know," he asked, "why I have come to
you? Soon I must fight the prince of Persia again. When I leave, the
prince of Greece will come;
