worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"

"3" = ''':sup:`3` But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open

"4" = ''':sup:`4` I shed many tears because no one was found worthy to open the scroll
or to examine it.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` One of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. The lion of the tribe of
Judah, the root of David, has triumphed, enabling him to open the
scroll with its seven seals."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then I saw standing in the midst of the throne and the four living
creatures and the elders, a Lamb that seemed to have been slain. He had
seven horns and seven eyes; these are the (seven) spirits of God sent
out into the whole world.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` He came and received the scroll from the right hand of the one who
sat on the throne.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When he took it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four

Notas de rodap√©:
5:1-5 - John sees the scroll sealed with seven seals, and no one is
worthy to open it until the Lamb, Christ, appears as the one worthy to
open the seals. Christ's victory over death makes Him worthy to reveal
5:6-10 - The Lamb is described as having been slain and worthy of
worship from all creation. His work of redemption is universal, and His
5:11-14 - Worship of the Lamb extends to all the heavenly orders,
showing that Christ is the center of all worship in heaven and on
earth. Christ's victory is an invitation for all creation to surrender
