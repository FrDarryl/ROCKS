six cubits wide, which he set up in the plain of Dura in the province
of Babylon.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He then ordered the satraps, prefects, and governors, the
counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the officials of
the provinces to be summoned to the dedication of the statue which he
had set up.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The satraps, prefects, and governors, the counselors, treasurers,
judges, and magistrates and all the officials of the provinces, all
these came together for the dedication and stood before the statue
which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
'''

hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, lyre, harp, psaltery, bagpipe,
and all the other musical instruments,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` you are ordered to fall down and worship the golden statue which
King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Whoever does not fall down and worship shall be instantly cast into
a white-hot furnace."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the trumpet, flute,
lyre, harp, psaltery, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments,
the nations and peoples of every language all fell down and worshiped
the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` At that point, some of the Chaldeans came and accused the Jews
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` to King Nebuchadnezzar: "O king, live forever!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` O king, you issued a decree that everyone who heard the sound of
the trumpet, flute, lyre, harp, psaltery, bagpipe, and all the other
musical instruments should fall down and worship the golden statue;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` whoever did not was to be cast into a white-hot furnace.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` There are certain Jews whom you have made administrators of the
province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego; these men, O king,
have paid no attention to you; they will not serve your god or worship
the golden statue which you set up."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and sent for Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, who were promptly brought before the king.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` King Nebuchadnezzar questioned them: "Is it true, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, that you will not serve my god, or worship the
golden statue that I set up?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Be ready now to fall down and worship the statue I had made,
whenever you hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, lyre, harp,
psaltery, bagpipe, and all the other musical instruments; otherwise,
you shall be instantly cast into the white-hot furnace; and who is the
God that can deliver you out of my hands?"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar,
"There is no need for us to defend ourselves before you in this matter.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If our God, whom we serve, can save us from the white-hot furnace
and from your hands, O king, may he save us!
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But even if he will not, know, O king, that we will not serve your
god or worship the golden statue which you set up."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Nebuchadnezzar's face became livid with utter rage against
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace to be heated
seven times more than usual
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and had some of the strongest men in his army bind Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego and cast them into the white-hot furnace.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They were bound and cast into the white-hot furnace with their
coats, hats, shoes and other garments,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` for the king's order was urgent. So huge a fire was kindled in the
furnace that the flames devoured the men who threw Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego into it.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But these three fell, bound, into the midst of the white-hot
furnace.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` They walked about in the flames, singing to God and blessing the
Lord.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` In the fire Azariah stood up and prayed aloud:
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` "Blessed are you, and praiseworthy, O Lord, the God of our fathers,
and glorious forever is your name.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For you are just in all you have done; all your deeds are
faultless, all your ways right, and all your judgments proper.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` You have executed proper judgments in all that you have brought
upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers. By a proper
judgment you have done all this because of our sins;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For we have sinned and transgressed by departing from you, and we
have done every kind of evil.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Your commandments we have not heeded or observed, nor have we done
as you ordered us for our good.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Therefore all you have brought upon us, all you have done to us,you
have done by a proper judgment.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` You have handed us over to our enemies, lawless and hateful rebels;
to an unjust king, the worst in all the world.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Now we cannot open our mouths; we, your servants, who revere you,
have become a shame and a reproach.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` For your name's sake, do not deliver us up forever, or make void
your covenant.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Do not take away your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham, your
beloved, Isaac your servant, and Israel your holy one,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` To whom you promised to multiply their offspring like the stars of
heaven, or the sand on the shore of the sea.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For we are reduced, O Lord, beyond any other nation, brought low
everywhere in the world this day because of our sins.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` We have in our day no prince, prophet, or leader, no holocaust,
sacrifice, oblation, or incense, no place to offer first fruits, to
find favor with you.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` But with contrite heart and humble spirit let us be received;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` As though it were holocausts of rams and bullocks, or thousands of
fat lambs, So let our sacrifice be in your presence today as we follow
you unreservedly; for those who trust in you cannot be put to shame.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And now we follow you with our whole heart, we fear you and we pray
to you.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Do not let us be put to shame, but deal with us in your kindness
and great mercy.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Deliver us by your wonders, and bring glory to your name, O Lord:
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Let all those be routed who inflict evils on your servants; Let
them be shamed and powerless, and their strength broken;
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Let them know that you alone are the Lord God, glorious over the
whole world."
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Now the king's men who had thrown them in continued to stoke the
furnace with brimstone, pitch, tow, and faggots.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` The flames rose forty-nine cubits above the furnace,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` and spread out, burning the Chaldeans nearby.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` But the angel of the Lord went down into the furnace with Azariah
and his companions, drove the fiery flames out of the furnace,
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` and made the inside of the furnace as though a dew-laden breeze
were blowing through it. The fire in no way touched them or caused them
pain or harm.

"51" = ''':sup:`51` Then these three in the furnace with one voice sang, glorifying and
blessing God:

and astonished at seeing them alive,

"91" = ''':sup:`91` King Nebuchadnezzar rose in haste and asked his nobles, "Did we not
cast three men bound into the fire?" "Assuredly, O king," they
answered.

"95" = ''':sup:`95` Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach,
