"1" = ''':sup:`1` Since the law has only a shadow of the good things to come, and not
the very image of them, it can never make perfect those who come to
worship by the same sacrifices that they offer continually each year.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Otherwise, would not the sacrifices have ceased to be offered, since
the worshipers, once cleansed, would no longer have had any
consciousness of sins?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But in those sacrifices there is only a yearly remembrance of sins,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats take away
sins.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For this reason, when he came into the world, he said: "Sacrifice
and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` holocausts and sin offerings you took no delight in.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then I said, 'As is written of me in the scroll, Behold, I come to
do your will, O God.'"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` First he says, "Sacrifices and offerings, holocausts and sin
offerings, you neither desired nor delighted in." These are offered
according to the law.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then he says, "Behold, I come to do your will." He takes away the
first to establish the second.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` By this "will," we have been consecrated through the offering of
the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Every priest stands daily at his ministry, offering frequently
those same sacrifices that can never take away sins.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But this one offered one sacrifice for sins, and took his seat
forever at the right hand of God;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` now he waits until his enemies are made his footstool.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For by one offering he has made perfect forever those who are being
consecrated.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "This is the covenant I will establish with them after those days,
says the Lord: 'I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write
them upon their minds,'"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` he also says: "Their sins and their evildoing I will remember no
more."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer offering
for sin.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Therefore, brothers, since through the blood of Jesus we have
confidence of entrance into the sanctuary
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` by the new and living way he opened for us through the veil, that
is, his flesh,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and since we have "a great priest over the house of God,"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` let us approach with a sincere heart and in absolute trust, with
our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies
washed in pure water.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Let us hold unwaveringly to our confession that gives us hope, for
he who made the promise is trustworthy.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` We must consider how to rouse one another to love and good works.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` We should not stay away from our assembly, as is the custom of
some, but encourage one another, and this all the more as you see the
day drawing near.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` If we sin deliberately after receiving knowledge of the truth,
there no longer remains sacrifice for sins
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` but a fearful prospect of judgment and a flaming fire that is going
to consume the adversaries.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Anyone who rejects the law of Moses is put to death without pity on
the testimony of two or three witnesses.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Do you not think that a much worse punishment is due the one who
has contempt for the Son of God, considers unclean the covenant-blood
by which he was consecrated, and insults the spirit of grace?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` We know the one who said: "Vengeance is mine; I will repay," and
again: "The Lord will judge his people."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Remember the days past when, after you had been enlightened, you
endured a great contest of suffering.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and affliction; at
other times you associated yourselves with those so treated.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` You even joined in the sufferings of those in prison and joyfully
accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you had a
better and lasting possession.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Therefore, do not throw away your confidence; it will have great
recompense.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` You need endurance to do the will of God and receive what he has
promised.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` "For, after just a brief moment, he who is to come shall come; he
shall not delay.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But my just one shall live by faith, and if he draws back I take no
pleasure in him."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` We are not among those who draw back and perish, but among those
who have faith and will possess life.
