"1" = ''':sup:`1` The LORD said to Samuel: "How long will you grieve for Saul, whom I
have rejected as king of Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and be on
your way. I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have chosen my
king from among his sons."
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But Samuel replied: "How can I go? Saul will hear of it and kill
me." To this the LORD answered: "Take a heifer along and say, 'I have
come to sacrifice to the LORD.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I myself will tell you what to
do; you are to anoint for me the one I point out to you."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Samuel did as the LORD had commanded him. When he entered Bethlehem,
the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and inquired, "Is
your visit peaceful, O seer?"
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He replied: "Yes! I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. So cleanse
yourselves and join me today for the banquet." He also had Jesse and
his sons cleanse themselves and invited them to the sacrifice.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` As they came, he looked at Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD'S
anointed is here before him."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the LORD said to Samuel: "Do not judge from his appearance or
from his lofty stature, because I have rejected him. Not as man sees
does God see, because man sees the appearance but the LORD looks into
the heart."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him before Samuel, who
said, "The Lord has not chosen him."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said, "The LORD has not
chosen this one either."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` In the same way Jesse presented seven sons before Samuel, but
Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen any one of these."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then Samuel asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?" Jesse
replied, "There is still the youngest, who is tending the sheep."
Samuel said to Jesse, "Send for him; we will not begin the sacrificial
banquet until he arrives here."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Jesse sent and had the young man brought to them. He was ruddy, a
youth handsome to behold and making a splendid appearance. The LORD
said, "There-anoint him, for this is he!"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Samuel, with the horn of oil in hand, anointed him in the
midst of his brothers; and from that day on, the spirit of the LORD
rushed upon David. When Samuel took his leave, he went to Ramah.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and he was tormented
by an evil spirit sent by the LORD.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So the servants of Saul said to him: "Please! An evil spirit from
God is tormenting you.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If your lordship will order it, we, your servants here in
attendance on you, will look for a man skilled in playing the harp.
When the evil spirit from God comes over you, he will play and you will
feel better."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Saul then told his servants, "Find me a skillful harpist and bring
him to me."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` A servant spoke up to say: "I have observed that one of the sons of
Jesse of Bethlehem is a skillful harpist. He is also a stalwart
soldier, besides being an able speaker, and handsome. Moreover, the
LORD is with him."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Accordingly, Saul dispatched messengers to ask Jesse to send him
his son David, who was with the flock.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Jesse took five loaves of bread, a skin of wine, and a kid,
and sent them to Saul by his son David.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thus David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul became very
fond of him, made him his armor-bearer,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and sent Jesse the message, "Allow David to remain in my service,
for he meets with my approval."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Whenever the spirit from God seized Saul, David would take the harp
and play, and Saul would be relieved and feel better, for the evil
spirit would leave him.

16:1 - God commands Samuel to go to Bethlehem to anoint a new king from
among the sons of Jesse. This verse marks the transition from Saul to
16:6-7 - When Samuel sees Eliab, he thinks he must be the chosen one,
but God corrects him by saying that He looks not at the outward
appearance, but at the heart. This reinforces the idea that God chooses
16:11-13 - David, the youngest and seemingly insignificant of Jesse's
sons, is anointed king. This event highlights the theme of the "little
one" being exalted by God and prefigures David's central role in
1:27-29).
16:14 - The Spirit of God withdraws from Saul, and an evil spirit
torments him. This verse symbolizes the removal of God's grace from
Saul and the beginning of his spiritual and mental decline (see also
16:17-23 - David, chosen to play the harp and calm Saul, enters the
king's service. This providential encounter between David and Saul
reflects how God uses simple situations to accomplish His greater
