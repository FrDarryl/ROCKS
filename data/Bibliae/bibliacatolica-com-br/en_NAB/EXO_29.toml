wave offering before the LORD; this is to be your own portion.

waved, as well as the thigh of whatever raised offering is raised up,

made at their ordination and consecration; but no layman may eat of
them, since they are sacred.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` If some of the flesh of the ordination sacrifice or some of the
bread remains over on the next day, this remnant must be burned up; it
is not to be eaten, since it is sacred.

I have given them to you. "Seven days you shall spend in ordaining
them,

atonement. Thus also shall you purge the altar in making atonement for
it; you shall anoint it in order to consecrate it.

"37" = ''':sup:`37` Seven days you shall spend in making atonement for the altar and in
consecrating it. Then the altar will be most sacred, and whatever
touches it will become sacred.
