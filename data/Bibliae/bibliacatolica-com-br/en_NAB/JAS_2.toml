"1" = ''':sup:`1` My brothers, show no partiality as you adhere to the faith in our
glorious Lord Jesus Christ.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For if a man with gold rings on his fingers and in fine clothes
comes into your assembly, and a poor person in shabby clothes also
comes in,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say,
"Sit here, please," while you say to the poor one, "Stand there," or
"Sit at my feet,"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges
with evil designs?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Listen, my beloved brothers. Did not God choose those who are poor
in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he
promised to those who love him?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But you dishonored the poor person. Are not the rich oppressing you?
And do they themselves not haul you off to court?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Is it not they who blaspheme the noble name that was invoked over
you?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` However, if you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture,
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing well.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the
law as transgressors.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For whoever keeps the whole law, but falls short in one particular,
has become guilty in respect to all of it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For he who said, "You shall not commit adultery," also said, "You
shall not kill." Even if you do not commit adultery but kill, you have
become a transgressor of the law.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So speak and so act as people who will be judged by the law of
freedom.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For the judgment is merciless to one who has not shown mercy; mercy
triumphs over judgment.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does
not have works? Can that faith save him?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the
day,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm, and eat
well," but you do not give them the necessities of the body, what good
is it?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So also faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Indeed someone might say, "You have faith and I have works."
Demonstrate your faith to me without works, and I will demonstrate my
faith to you from my works.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You believe that God is one. You do well. Even the demons believe
that and tremble.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Do you want proof, you ignoramus, that faith without works is
useless?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his
son Isaac upon the altar?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was
completed by the works.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God,
and it was credited to him as righteousness," and he was called "the
friend of God."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` See how a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And in the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by
works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a different
route?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For just as a body without a spirit is dead, so also faith without
works is dead.

Notas de rodap√©:
2:1-7 - James warns against discrimination in church gatherings,
pointing out that God chose the poor to be rich in faith. Partiality
contradicts the love of Christ, which welcomes all equally (see also
2:8-13 - The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself is central
to the royal law of Christ. God's judgment is based on mercy, and
2:14-17 - James teaches that faith without works is dead. True faith is
demonstrated by concrete actions of love and service. The example of
Abraham and Rahab illustrates how faith and works must go together (see
2:18-20 - James challenges Christians to demonstrate their faith
through works. Faith without works is empty, and good works are the
3:18).
2:21-26 - James illustrates the relationship between faith and works
with the examples of Abraham and Rahab. Both demonstrated their faith
through bold and obedient actions toward God, reinforcing the truth
