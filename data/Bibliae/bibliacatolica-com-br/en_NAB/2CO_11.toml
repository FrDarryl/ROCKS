put up with me.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God, since I betrothed
you to one husband to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning,
your thoughts may be corrupted from a sincere (and pure) commitment to
Christ.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For if someone comes and preaches another Jesus than the one we
preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you
received or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up
with it well enough.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For I think that I am not in any way inferior to these
"superapostles."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Even if I am untrained in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; in
every way we have made this plain to you in all things.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Did I make a mistake when I humbled myself so that you might be
exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?

"8" = ''':sup:`8` I plundered other churches by accepting from them in order to
minister to you.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when I was with you and in need, I did not burden anyone, for

silenced in the regions of Achaia.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And what I do I will continue to do, in order to end this pretext
of those who seek a pretext for being regarded as we are in the mission
of which they boast.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, who
masquerade as apostles of Christ.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So it is not strange that his ministers also masquerade as
ministers of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I repeat, no one should consider me foolish; but if you do, accept
me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` What I am saying I am not saying according to the Lord but as in
foolishness, in this boastful state.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For you gladly put up with fools, since you are wise yourselves.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, or devours you, or
gets the better of you, or puts on airs, or slaps you in the face.

boast of (I am speaking in foolishness) I also dare.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they
descendants of Abraham? So am I.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, far worse
beatings, and numerous brushes with death.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Five times at the hands of the Jews I received forty lashes minus
one.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times
I was shipwrecked, I passed a night and a day on the deep;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers,
dangers from my own race, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city,
dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false
brothers;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` in toil and hardship, through many sleepless nights, through hunger
and thirst, through frequent fastings, through cold and exposure.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And apart from these things, there is the daily pressure upon me of
my anxiety for all the churches.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led to sin, and I am not
indignant?
