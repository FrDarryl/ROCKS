if only about two or three thousand go up, they can overcome Ai. The

people."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` About three thousand of the people made the attack, but they were
defeated by those at Ai,
'''

What will you do for your great name?"

"10" = ''':sup:`10` The LORD replied to Joshua: "Stand up. Why are you lying prostrate?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Israel has sinned: they have violated the covenant which I enjoined
on them. They have stealthily taken goods subject to the ban, and have
deceitfully put them in their baggage.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` If the Israelites cannot stand up to their enemies, but must turn
their back to them, it is because they are under the ban. I will not
remain with you unless you remove from among you whoever has incurred
the ban.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Rise, sanctify the people. Tell them to sanctify themselves before

of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah, was
designated.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give to the LORD, the God of Israel,
glory and honor by telling me what you have done; do not hide it from
me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Achan answered Joshua, "I have indeed sinned against the LORD, the
God of Israel. This is what I have done:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Among the spoils, I saw a beautiful Babylonian mantle, two hundred
shekels of silver, and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight; in my
greed I took them. They are now hidden in the ground inside my tent,
with the silver underneath."

is called the Valley of Achor to this day.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
7:1 - Achan's sin in taking items destined for destruction brings
defeat to Israel at Ai. This emphasizes the importance of holiness and
obedience to God's Word, showing how individual sin can affect the
6:7).
7:2-5 - The defeat at Ai and the distrust it generated among the
Israelites demonstrate that victory is assured only by obedience to
God. Self-reliance can lead to downfall and disillusionment (see also
7:6-9 - Joshua's intercession, questioning God about the defeat,
highlights the importance of communicating with the Lord in times of
crisis. Prayer is an essential tool for seeking guidance and
7:10-13 - God reveals the cause of the defeat, showing that
disobedience brought a curse upon Israel. This highlights the need for
holiness and the seriousness of sin, reinforcing the need to rid
Peter 1:15-16).
7:19-26 - The judgment of Achan and the destruction of his family
highlight the gravity of sin and the need to restore the holiness of
God's people. This teaches about the consequences of sin and the
12:1-2).
