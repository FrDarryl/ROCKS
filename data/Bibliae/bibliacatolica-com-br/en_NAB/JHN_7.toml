"1" = ''':sup:`1` After this, Jesus moved about within Galilee; but he did not wish to
travel in Judea, because the Jews were trying to kill him.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea, so that
your disciples also may see the works you are doing.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` No one works in secret if he wants to be known publicly. If you do
these things, manifest yourself to the world."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For his brothers did not believe in him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Jesus said to them, "My time is not yet here, but the time is
always right for you.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I testify to it
that its works are evil.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my
time has not yet been fulfilled."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` After he had said this, he stayed on in Galilee.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, he himself also
went up, not openly but (as it were) in secret.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The Jews were looking for him at the feast and saying, "Where is
he?"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And there was considerable murmuring about him in the crowds. Some
said, "He is a good man," (while) others said, "No; on the contrary, he
misleads the crowd."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Still, no one spoke openly about him because they were afraid of
the Jews.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When the feast was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple
area and began to teach.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The Jews were amazed and said, "How does he know scripture without
having studied?"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Jesus answered them and said, "My teaching is not my own but is
from the one who sent me.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Whoever chooses to do his will shall know whether my teaching is
from God or whether I speak on my own.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Whoever speaks on his own seeks his own glory, but whoever seeks
the glory of the one who sent him is truthful, and there is no wrong in
him.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why
are you trying to kill me?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The crowd answered, "You are possessed! Who is trying to kill you?"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Jesus answered and said to them, "I performed one work and all of
you are amazed
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` because of it. Moses gave you circumcision--not that it came from
Moses but rather from the patriarchs--and you circumcise a man on the
sabbath.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` If a man can receive circumcision on a sabbath so that the law of
Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole
person well on a sabbath?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Stop judging by appearances, but judge justly."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, "Is he not the one
they are trying to kill?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And look, he is speaking openly and they say nothing to him. Could
the authorities have realized that he is the Messiah?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But we know where he is from. When the Messiah comes, no one will
know where he is from."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Jesus cried out in the temple area as he was teaching and said,
"You know me and also know where I am from. Yet I did not come on my
own, but the one who sent me, whom you do not know, is true.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So they tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand upon him,
because his hour had not yet come.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But many of the crowd began to believe in him, and said, "When the
Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man has done?"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring about him to this effect,
and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent guards to arrest him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So Jesus said, "I will be with you only a little while longer, and
then I will go to the one who sent me.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` You will look for me but not find (me), and where I am you cannot
come."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` So the Jews said to one another, "Where is he going that we will
not find him? Surely he is not going to the dispersion among the Greeks
to teach the Greeks, is he?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` What is the meaning of his saying, 'You will look for me and not
find (me), and where I am you cannot come'?"
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and
exclaimed, "Let anyone who thirsts come to me and drink.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Whoever believes in me, as scripture says: 'Rivers of living water
will flow from within him.'"
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` He said this in reference to the Spirit that those who came to
believe in him were to receive. There was, of course, no Spirit yet,
because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Some in the crowd who heard these words said, "This is truly the
Prophet."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Others said, "This is the Messiah." But others said, "The Messiah
will not come from Galilee, will he?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Does not scripture say that the Messiah will be of David's family
and come from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?"
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` So a division occurred in the crowd because of him.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Some of them even wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on
him.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` So the guards went to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked
them, "Why did you not bring him?"
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` The guards answered, "Never before has anyone spoken like this
one."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So the Pharisees answered them, "Have you also been deceived?
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him?
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` But this crowd, which does not know the law, is accursed."
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Nicodemus, one of their members who had come to him earlier, said
to them,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` "Does our law condemn a person before it first hears him and finds
out what he is doing?"
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` They answered and said to him, "You are not from Galilee also, are
you? Look and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Then each went to his own house,
