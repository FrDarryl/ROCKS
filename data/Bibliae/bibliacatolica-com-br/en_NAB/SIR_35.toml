Notas de rodap√©:
35:1-3 - He who keeps the Law offers sacrifices pleasing to God.
Obedience to God's will is seen as a true sacrifice, reflecting that
justice and righteousness are more important than mere rituals (see
35:7-9 - Generous giving, given cheerfully, is pleasing to God. God
loves a generous heart, and charity and justice are essential to
19:17).
35:12-13 - God is just and shows no partiality. He hears the prayers of
the humble and the afflicted, demonstrating that divine justice is
impartial and always favors those who seek His mercy (see also
35:16-18 - The prayers of the poor and the fatherless go straight to
God's throne. The cries of those who suffer are heard and answered, a
35:20-21 - Patience and perseverance are rewarded by God. He does not
forget those who suffer injustice, and His justice comes in its right
