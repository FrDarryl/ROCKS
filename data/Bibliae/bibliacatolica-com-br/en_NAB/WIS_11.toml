Notas de rodapé:
11:1-6 - Wisdom is seen as a manifestation of God's power in judgment.
The punishment of the wicked is a central theme, highlighting God's
justice in response to sin and the importance of righteousness (see
11:7-12 - God's mercy is revealed in saving the righteous during the
destruction of the wicked. This duality emphasizes God's compassion and
the hope the righteous have in His protection, even in the midst of
11:13-16 - God’s power is evident in His works in nature. Creation
reflects His wisdom and strength, and recognizing this truth leads to
11:17-21 - The description of the plagues of Egypt serves as a reminder
of God's power to discipline and correct. This narrative emphasizes
that divine wisdom manifests itself not only in blessings but also in
12:6).
