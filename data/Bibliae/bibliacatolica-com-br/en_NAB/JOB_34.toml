"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Elihu continued and said:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Hear, O wise men, my discourse, and you that have knowledge, hear
me!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For the ear tests words, as the taste does food.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn between us
what is good.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For Job has said, "I am innocent, but God has taken what is my due.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Notwithstanding my right I am set at nought; in my wound the arrow
rankles, sinless though I am."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` What man is like Job? He drinks in blasphemies like water,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Keeps company with evildoers and goes along with wicked men,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When he says, "It profits a man nought that he is pleasing to God."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Therefore, men of understanding, hearken to me: far be it from God
to do wickedness; far from the Almighty to do wrong!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Rather, he requites men for their conduct, and brings home to a man
his way of life.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Surely, God cannot act wickedly, the Almighty cannot violate
justice.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Who gave him government over the earth, or who else set all the
land in its place?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` If he were to take back his spirit to himself, withdraw to himself
his breath,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` All flesh would perish together, and man would return to the dust.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now, do you, O Job, hear this! Hearken to the words I speak!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Can an enemy of justice indeed be in control, or will you condemn
the supreme Just One,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Who says to a king, "You are worthless!" and to nobles, "You are
wicked!"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Who neither favors the person of princes, nor respects the rich
more than the poor? For they are all the work of his hands;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` in a moment they die, even at midnight. He brings on nobles, and
takes them away, removing the powerful without lifting a hand;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he beholds all his
steps.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` There is no darkness so dense that evildoers can hide in it.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For he forewarns no man of his time to come before God in judgment.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Without a trial he breaks the mighty, and sets others in their
stead,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Therefore he discerns their works; he turns at night and crushes
them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Because they turned away from him and heeded none of his ways,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But caused the cries of the poor to reach him, so that he heard the
plea of the afflicted.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` If he remains tranquil, who then can condemn? If he hides his face,
who then can behold him?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When anyone says to God, "I was misguided; I will offend no more.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Teach me wherein I have sinned; if I have done wrong, I will do so
no more,"
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Would you then say that God must punish, since you reject what he
is doing? It is you who must choose, not I; speak, therefore, what you
know.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Men of understanding will say to me, every wise man who hears my
views:
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` "Job speaks without intelligence, and his words are without sense."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Let Job be tried to the limit, since his answers are those of the
impious;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For he is adding rebellion to his sin by brushing off our arguments
and addressing many words to God.
