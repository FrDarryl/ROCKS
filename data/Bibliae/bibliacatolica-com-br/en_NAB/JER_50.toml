the Chaldeans, through the prophet Jeremiah:

desert, So that no one shall live there, because man and beast have
fled away.

Judah shall come, Weeping as they come, to seek the LORD, their God;

ourselves to the LORD with covenant everlasting, never to be
forgotten."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Lost sheep were my people, their shepherds misled them, straggling
on the mountains; From mountain to hill they wandered, losing the way
to their fold.

Take revenge on her, as she has done, do to her; for she sinned against

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Cut off from Babylon the sower and him who wields the sickle in
harvest time! Before the destroying sword, each of them turns to his
own people, everyone flees to his own land.

Bashan, And on Mount Ephraim and Gilead, till she has her fill.

wrath; For the Lord GOD of hosts has work to do in the land of the

shall perish on that day, says the LORD.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` I am against you, man of insolence, says the Lord GOD of hosts; For
your day has come, the time for me to punish you.

will kindle in his cities a fire that shall devour everything around
him.
'''

with them the men of Judah; All their captors hold them fast and refuse
to let them go.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Strong is their avenger, whose name is LORD of hosts; He will
defend their cause with success, and give rest to the earth, but unrest
to those who live in Babylon.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` A sword upon the Chaldeans, says the LORD, upon Babylon's people,
her princes and wise men!
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` A sword upon the soothsayers, that they may become fools! A sword
upon her warriors, that they may tremble;

"37" = ''':sup:`37` A sword upon her motley throng, that they may become women! A sword
upon her treasures, that they may be plundered;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` A sword upon her waters, that they may dry up! For it is a land of
idols, and they shall be made frantic by fearful things.

shall occupy it; Never again shall it be peopled, or lived in, from age
to age.

says the LORD, Not a man shall dwell there, no human being shall tarry
there.

kings roused from the ends of the earth.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Bow and javelin they wield, cruel and pitiless are they; They sound
like the roaring sea, as they ride forth on steeds, Each in his place
for battle against you, daughter Babylon.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` The king of Babylon hears news of them, and helpless fall his
hands; Anguish seizes him, throes like a mother's in childbirth.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` As when a lion comes up from the Jordan's thicket to the permanent
feeding grounds, So I, in one instant, will drive them off, and whom I
choose I will establish there; For who is like me? who calls me to
account? what shepherd can stand against me?
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD which he has taken against
Babylon; Hear the plans he has made against the land of the Chaldeans:
They shall be dragged away, even the smallest sheep; their own pasture
shall be aghast because of them.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` At the cry "Babylon is captured!" the earth quakes; the outcry is
heard among the nations.
