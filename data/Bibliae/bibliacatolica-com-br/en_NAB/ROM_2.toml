and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Or do you hold his priceless kindness, forbearance, and patience in
low esteem, unaware that the kindness of God would lead you to
repentance?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` By your stubbornness and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath
for yourself for the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment
of God,

"6" = ''':sup:`6` who will repay everyone according to his works:
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` eternal life to those who seek glory, honor, and immortality through
perseverance in good works,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` but wrath and fury to those who selfishly disobey the truth and obey
wickedness.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Yes, affliction and distress will come upon every human being who
does evil, Jew first and then Greek.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does
good, Jew first and then Greek.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` There is no partiality with God.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` All who sin outside the law will also perish without reference to
it, and all who sin under the law will be judged in accordance with it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For it is not those who hear the law who are just in the sight of
God; rather, those who observe the law will be justified.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the
prescriptions of the law, they are a law for themselves even though
they do not have the law.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts,
while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting
thoughts accuse or even defend them
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge people's
hidden works through Christ Jesus.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of God

"18" = ''':sup:`18` and know his will and are able to discern what is important since
you are instructed from the law,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` and if you are confident that you are a guide for the blind and a
light for those in darkness,

"20" = ''':sup:`20` that you are a trainer of the foolish and teacher of the simple,
because in the law you have the formulation of knowledge and truth--
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` then you who teach another, are you failing to teach yourself? You
who preach against stealing, do you steal?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who detest
idols, do you rob temples?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` You who boast of the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For, as it is written, "Because of you the name of God is reviled
among the Gentiles."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Circumcision, to be sure, has value if you observe the law; but if
you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Again, if an uncircumcised man keeps the precepts of the law, will
he not be considered circumcised?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Indeed, those who are physically uncircumcised but carry out the
law will pass judgment on you, with your written law and circumcision,
who break the law.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` One is not a Jew outwardly. True circumcision is not outward, in
the flesh.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` Rather, one is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart, in
the spirit, not the letter; his praise is not from human beings but
from God.
