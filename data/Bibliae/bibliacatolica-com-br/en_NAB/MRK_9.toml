"1" = ''':sup:`1` He also said to them, "Amen, I say to you, there are some standing
here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God
has come in power."
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a
high mountain apart by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no fuller on earth
could bleach them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were
conversing with Jesus.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Peter said to Jesus in reply, "Rabbi, it is good that we are
here! Let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them; then from the cloud
came a voice, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone but Jesus alone
with them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` As they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them not to
relate what they had seen to anyone, except when the Son of Man had
risen from the dead.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what rising from
the dead meant.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then they asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come
first?"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He told them, "Elijah will indeed come first and restore all
things, yet how is it written regarding the Son of Man that he must
suffer greatly and be treated with contempt?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But I tell you that Elijah has come and they did to him whatever
they pleased, as it is written of him."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them
and scribes arguing with them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Immediately on seeing him, the whole crowd was utterly amazed. They
ran up to him and greeted him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He asked them, "What are you arguing about with them?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Someone from the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I have brought to
you my son possessed by a mute spirit.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth,
grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it
out, but they were unable to do so."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He said to them in reply, "O faithless generation, how long will I
be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him to me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` They brought the boy to him. And when he saw him, the spirit
immediately threw the boy into convulsions. As he fell to the ground,
he began to roll around and foam at the mouth.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then he questioned his father, "How long has this been happening to
him?" He replied, "Since childhood.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` It has often thrown him into fire and into water to kill him. But
if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Jesus said to him, " 'If you can!' Everything is possible to one
who has faith."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then the boy's father cried out, "I do believe, help my unbelief!"
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Jesus, on seeing a crowd rapidly gathering, rebuked the unclean
spirit and said to it, "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you: come out
of him and never enter him again!"
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Shouting and throwing the boy into convulsions, it came out. He
became like a corpse, which caused many to say, "He is dead!"
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But Jesus took him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When he entered the house, his disciples asked him in private, "Why
could we not drive it out?"
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He said to them, "This kind can only come out through prayer."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` They left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he
did not wish anyone to know about it.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He was teaching his disciples and telling them, "The Son of Man is
to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after
his death he will rise."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to
question him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` They came to Capernaum and, once inside the house, he began to ask
them, "What were you arguing about on the way?"
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But they remained silent. They had been discussing among themselves
on the way who was the greatest.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then he sat down, called the Twelve, and said to them, "If anyone
wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of
all."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Taking a child he placed it in their midst, and putting his arms
around it he said to them,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` "Whoever receives one child such as this in my name, receives me;
and whoever receives me, receives not me but the one who sent me."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in
your name, and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Jesus replied, "Do not prevent him. There is no one who performs a
mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` For whoever is not against us is for us.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to
Christ, amen, I say to you, will surely not lose his reward.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe (in me) to
sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around
his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to
enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna, into the
unquenchable fire.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` .
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for
you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be thrown into
Gehenna.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. Better for you to
enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be
thrown into Gehenna,

"48" = ''':sup:`48` where 'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` "Everyone will be salted with fire.

with one another."
