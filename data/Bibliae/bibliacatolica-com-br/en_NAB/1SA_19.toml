"1" = ''':sup:`1` Saul discussed his intention of killing David with his son Jonathan
and with all his servants. But Saul's son Jonathan, who was very fond
of David,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` told him: "My father Saul is trying to kill you. Therefore, please
be on your guard tomorrow morning; get out of sight and remain in
hiding.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I, however, will go out and stand beside my father in the
countryside where you are, and will speak to him about you. If I learn
anything, I will let you know."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Jonathan then spoke well of David to his father Saul, saying to him:
"Let not your majesty sin against his servant David, for he has
committed no offense against you, but has helped you very much by his
deeds.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When he took his life in his hands and slew the Philistine, and the
LORD brought about a great victory for all Israel through him, you were
glad to see it. Why, then, should you become guilty of shedding
innocent blood by killing David without cause?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Saul heeded Jonathan's plea and swore, "As the LORD lives, he shall
not be killed."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So Jonathan summoned David and repeated the whole conversation to
him. Jonathan then brought David to Saul, and David served him as
before.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When war broke out again, David went out to fight against the
Philistines and inflicted a great defeat upon them, putting them to
flight.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he was sitting
in his house with spear in hand and David was playing the harp nearby.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Saul tried to nail David to the wall with the spear, but David
eluded Saul, so that the spear struck only the wall, and David got away
safe.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The same night, Saul sent messengers to David's house to guard it,
that he might kill him in the morning. David's wife Michal informed
him, "Unless you save yourself tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Michal let David down through a window, and he made his escape
in safety.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Michal took the household idol and laid it in the bed, putting a
net of goat's hair at its head and covering it with a spread.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she said, "He is sick."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Saul, however, sent the messengers back to see David and commanded
them, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But when the messengers entered, they found the household idol in
the bed, with the net of goat's hair at its head.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Saul therefore asked Michal: "Why did you play this trick on me?
You have helped my enemy to get away!" Michal answered Saul: "He
threatened me, 'Let me go or I will kill you.'"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thus David got safely away; he went to Samuel in Ramah, informing
him of all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to stay
in the sheds.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When Saul was told that David was in the sheds near Ramah,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` he sent messengers to arrest David. But when they saw the band of
prophets, presided over by Samuel, in a prophetic frenzy, they too fell
into the prophetic state.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Informed of this, Saul sent other messengers, who also fell into
the prophetic state. For the third time Saul sent messengers, but they
too fell into the prophetic state.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Saul then went to Ramah himself. Arriving at the cistern of the
threshing floor on the bare hilltop, he inquired, "Where are Samuel and
David?", and was told, "At the sheds near Ramah."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` As he set out from the hilltop toward the sheds, the spirit of God
came upon him also, and he continued on in a prophetic condition until
he reached the spot. At the sheds near Ramah
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` he, too, stripped himself of his garments and he, too, remained in
the prophetic state in the presence of Samuel; all that day and night
he lay naked. That is why they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
19:1-7 - Jonathan intercedes for David, convincing Saul not to kill
him. Jonathan's loyalty, even before his father, is an example of true
friendship and fidelity to God's plan. This relationship illustrates
how God can use human alliances to protect His servants (see also
19:8-10 - Despite his promise to Jonathan, Saul again tries to kill
David. Saul's continued pursuit reveals the depth of his rebellion and
the growing paranoia that consumes him. David, however, continues to
22:1).
19:11-12 - Michal helps David escape Saul's assassination attempt. She
deceives the king's messengers, demonstrating that God can use even
those close to the enemy to protect his chosen ones (see also
19:18-20 - David flees to Ramah and takes refuge with the prophet
Samuel. Samuel's protection symbolizes God's prophetic intervention in
David's life, highlighting the role of prophets as guardians of the
divine covenant (see also 1 Kings 19:9-10 and 2 Kings 6:8-12).
19:21-24 - When Saul attempts to capture David, God's Spirit causes him
and his messengers to prophesy, thwarting their evil plans. This shows
that God can disarm even the greatest enemies and use situations to
4:28-30).
