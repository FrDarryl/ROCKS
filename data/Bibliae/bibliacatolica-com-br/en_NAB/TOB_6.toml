"2" = ''':sup:`2` When the boy left home, accompanied by the angel, the dog followed
Tobiah out of the house and went with them. The travelers walked till
nightfall, and made camp beside the Tigris River.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now when the boy went down to wash his feet in the river, a large
fish suddenly leaped out of the water and tried to swallow his foot. He
shouted in alarm.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the angel said to him, "Take hold of the fish and don't let it
get away!" The boy seized the fish and hauled it up on the shore.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The angel then told him: "Cut the fish open and take out its gall,
heart, and liver, and keep them with you; but throw away the entrails.
Its gall, heart, and liver make useful medicines."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` After the lad had cut the fish open, he put aside the gall, heart,
and liver. Then he broiled and ate part of the fish; the rest he salted
and kept for the journey.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Afterward they traveled on together till they were near Media. The
boy asked the angel this question: "Brother Azariah, what medicinal
value is there in the fish's heart, liver, and gall?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He answered: "As regards the fish's heart and liver, if you burn
them so that the smoke surrounds a man or a woman who is afflicted by a
demon or evil spirit, the affliction will leave him completely, and no
demons will ever return to him again.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And as for the gall, if you rub it on the eyes of a man who has
cataracts, blowing into his eyes right on the cataracts, his sight will
be restored."

"10" = ''':sup:`10` When they had entered Media and were getting close to Ecbatana,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Raphael said to the boy, "Brother Tobiah!" He answered, "Yes, what
is it?" Raphael continued: "Tonight we must stay with Raguel, who is a
relative of yours. He has a daughter named Sarah,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but no other child. Since you are Sarah's closest relative, you
before all other men have the right to marry her. Also, her father's
estate is rightfully yours to inherit. Now the girl is sensible,
courageous, and very beautiful; and her father loves her dearly."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He continued: "Since you have the right to marry her, listen to me,
brother. Tonight I will ask the girl's father to let us have her as
your bride. When we return from Rages, we will hold the wedding feast
for her. I know that Raguel cannot keep her from you or let her become
engaged to another man; that would be a capital crime according to the
decree in the Book of Moses, and he knows that it is your right, before
all other men, to marry his daughter. So heed my words, brother;
tonight we must speak for the girl, so that we may have her engaged to
you. And when we return from Rages, we will take her and bring her back
with us to your house."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Tobiah objected, however: "Brother Azariah, I have heard that this
woman has already been married seven times, and that her husbands died
in their bridal chambers. On the very night they approached her, they
dropped dead. And I have heard it said that it was a demon who killed
them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So now I too am afraid of this demon. Because he loves her, he does
not harm her; but he does slay any man who wishes to come close to her.
I am my father's only child. If I should die, I would bring my father
and mother down to their grave in sorrow over me. And they have no
other son to bury them!"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Raphael said to him: "Do you not remember your father's orders? He
commanded you to marry a woman from your own family. So now listen to
me, brother; do not give another thought to this demon, but marry
Sarah. I know that tonight you shall have her for your wife!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When you go into the bridal chamber, take the fish's liver and
heart, and place them on the embers for the incense.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` As soon as the demon smells the odor they give off, he will flee
and never again show himself near her. Then when you are about to have
intercourse with her, both of you first rise up to pray. Beg the Lord
of heaven to show you mercy and grant you deliverance. But do not be
afraid, for she was set apart for you before the world existed. You
will save her, and she will go with you. And I suppose that you will
have children by her, who will take the place of brothers for you. So
do not worry." When Tobiah heard Raphael say that she was his
kinswoman, of his own family's lineage, he fell deeply in love with
her, and his heart became set on her.
