and dispossess nations greater and stronger than yourselves, having
large cities fortified to the sky,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` the Anakim, a people great and tall. You know of them and have heard
it said of them, 'Who can stand up against the Anakim?'

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Understand, then, today that it is the LORD, your God, who will
cross over before you as a consuming fire; he it is who will reduce
them to nothing and subdue them before you, so that you can drive them
out and destroy them quickly, as the LORD promised you.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` After the LORD, your God, has thrust them out of your way, do not
say to yourselves, 'It is because of my merits that the LORD has
brought me in to possess this land'; for it is really because of the
wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before
you.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` No, it is not because of your merits or the integrity of your heart
that you are going in to take possession of their land; but the LORD,
your God, is driving these nations out before you on account of their
wickedness and in order to keep the promise which he made on oath to
your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Understand this, therefore: it is not because of your merits that
the LORD, your God, is giving you this good land to possess, for you
are a stiff-necked people.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` "Bear in mind and do not forget how you angered the LORD, your God,
in the desert. From the day you left the land of Egypt until you
arrived in this place, you have been rebellious toward the LORD.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` At Horeb you so provoked the LORD that he was angry enough to
destroy you,

"9" = ''':sup:`9` when I had gone up the mountain to receive the stone tablets of the
covenant which the LORD made with you. Meanwhile I stayed on the
mountain forty days and forty nights without eating or drinking,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` till the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone inscribed, by God's
own finger, with a copy of all the words that the LORD spoke to you on
the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then, at the end of the forty days and forty nights, when the LORD
had given me the two stone tablets of the covenant,

"12" = ''':sup:`12` he said to me, 'Go down from here now, quickly, for your people
whom you have brought out of Egypt have become depraved; they have
already turned aside from the way I pointed out to them and have made
for themselves a molten idol.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` I have seen now how stiff-necked this people is,' the LORD said to
me.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` 'Let me be, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from
under the heavens. I will then make of you a nation mightier and
greater than they.'

the two tablets of the covenant in both my hands,

already turned aside from the way which the LORD had pointed out to you
by making for yourselves a molten calf!

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Raising the two tablets with both hands I threw them from me and
broke them before your eyes.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then, as before, I lay prostrate before the LORD for forty days and
forty nights without eating or drinking, because of all the sin you had
committed in the sight of the LORD and the evil you had done to provoke
him.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` For I dreaded the fierce anger of the LORD against you: his wrath
would destroy you. Yet once again the LORD listened to me.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` With Aaron, too, the LORD was deeply angry, and would have killed
him had I not prayed for him also at that time.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then, taking the calf, the sinful object you had made, and fusing
it with fire, I ground it down to powder as fine as dust, which I threw
into the wadi that went down the mountainside.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` "At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah likewise, you
provoked the LORD to anger.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` And when he sent you up from Kadesh-barnea to take possession of
the land he was giving you, you rebelled against this command of the
LORD, your God, and would not trust or obey him.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Ever since I have known you, you have been rebels against the LORD.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` "Those forty days, then, and forty nights, I lay prostrate before
the LORD, because he had threatened to destroy you.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` This was my prayer to him: O Lord GOD, destroy not your people, the
heritage which your majesty has ransomed and brought out of Egypt with
your strong hand.

stubbornness of this people nor upon their wickedness and sin,

was not able to bring them into the land he promised them'; or 'Out of
hatred for them, he brought them out to slay them in the desert.'

brought out by your great power and with your outstretched arm.
