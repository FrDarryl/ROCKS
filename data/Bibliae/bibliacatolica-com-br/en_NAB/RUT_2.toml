in the field of anyone who will allow me that favor." Naomi said to
her, "Go, my daughter,"

happened to be the section belonging to Boaz of the clan of Elimelech.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` The overseer of the harvesters answered, "She is the Moabite girl
who returned from the plateau of Moab with Naomi.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` She asked leave to gather the gleanings into sheaves after the
harvesters; and ever since she came this morning she has remained here
until now, with scarcely a moment's rest."

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen, my daughter! Do not go to glean in

commanded the young men to do you no harm. When you are thirsty, you
may go and drink from the vessels the young men have filled."

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Casting herself prostrate upon the ground, she said to him, "Why
should I, a foreigner, be favored with your notice?"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Boaz answered her: "I have had a complete account of what you have
done for your mother-in-law after your husband's death; you have left
your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come
to a people whom you did not know previously.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` She said, "May I prove worthy of your kindness, my lord: you have
comforted me, your servant, with your consoling words; would indeed

'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come here and have some food; dip
your bread in the sauce." Then as she sat near the reapers, he handed
her some roasted grain and she ate her fill and had some left over.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` She rose to glean, and Boaz instructed his servants to let her
glean among the sheaves themselves without scolding her,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and even to let drop some handfuls and leave them for her to glean
without being rebuked.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` She gleaned in the field until evening, and when she beat out what
she had gleaned it came to about an ephah of barley,

"18" = ''':sup:`18` which she took into the city and showed to her mother-in-law. Next
she brought out and gave her what she had left over from lunch.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today? Where
did you go to work? May he who took notice of you be blessed!" Then she
told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked. "The man at whose
place I worked today is named Boaz," she said.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "May he be blessed by the LORD, who is ever merciful to the living
and to the dead," Naomi exclaimed to her daughter-in-law; and she
continued, "He is a relative of ours, one of our next of kin."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "He even told me," added Ruth the Moabite, "that I should stay with
his servants until they complete his entire harvest."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` "You would do well, my dear," Naomi rejoined, "to go out with his
servants; for in someone else's field you might be insulted."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So she stayed gleaning with the servants of Boaz until the end of
the barley and wheat harvests.
