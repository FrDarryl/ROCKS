"1" = ''':sup:`1` But your holy ones had very great light; And those others, who heard
their voices but did not see their forms, since now they themselves had
suffered, called them blest;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And because they who formerly had been wronged did not harm them,
they thanked them, and pleaded with them, for the sake of the
difference between them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Instead of this, you furnished the flaming pillar which was a guide
on the unknown way, and the mild sun for an honorable migration.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For those deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned by
darkness, who had kept your sons confined through whom the imperishable
light of the law was to be given to the world.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When they determined to put to death the infants of the holy ones,
and when a single boy had been cast forth but saved, As a reproof you
carried off their multitude of sons and made them perish all at once in
the mighty water.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` That night was known beforehand to our fathers, that, with sure
knowledge of the oaths in which they put their faith, they might have
courage.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Your people awaited the salvation of the just and the destruction of
their foes.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For when you punished our adversaries, in this you glorified us whom
you had summoned.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For in secret the holy children of the good were offering sacrifice
and putting into effect with one accord the divine institution, That
your holy ones should share alike the same good things and dangers,
having previously sung the praises of the fathers.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But the discordant cry of their enemies responded, and the piteous
wail of mourning for children was borne to them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the slave was smitten with the same retribution as his master;
even the plebeian suffered the same as the king.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And all alike by a single death had countless dead; For the living
were not even sufficient for the burial, since at a single instant
their nobler offspring were destroyed.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For though they disbelieved at every turn on account of sorceries,
at the destruction of the first-born they acknowledged that the people
was God's son.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For when peaceful stillness compassed everything and the night in
its swift course was half spent,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Your all-powerful word from heaven's royal throne bounded, a fierce
warrior, into the doomed land,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` bearing the sharp sword of your inexorable decree. And as he
alighted, he filled every place with death; he still reached to heaven,
while he stood upon the earth.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then, forthwith, visions in horrible dreams perturbed them and
unexpected fears assailed them;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And cast half-dead, one here, another there, each was revealing the
reason for his dying.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For the dreams that disturbed them had proclaimed this beforehand,
lest they perish unaware of why they suffered ill.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But the trial of death touched at one time even the just, and in
the desert a plague struck the multitude; Yet not for long did the
anger last.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For the blameless man hastened to be their champion, bearing the
weapon of his special office, prayer and the propitiation of incense;
He withstood the wrath and put a stop to the calamity, showing that he
was your servant.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And he overcame the bitterness not by bodily strength, not by force
of arms; But by word he overcame the smiter, recalling the sworn
covenants with their fathers.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For when corpses had already fallen one on another in heaps, he
stood in the midst and checked the anger, and cut off the way to the
living.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For on his full-length robe was the whole world, and the glories of
the fathers were carved in four rows upon the stones, and your grandeur
was on the crown upon his head.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` To these names the destroyer yielded, and these he feared; for the
mere trial of anger was enough.
