"1" = ''':sup:`1` At that time there was no king in Israel. Moreover the tribe of
Danites were in search of a district to dwell in, for up to that time
they had received no heritage among the tribes of Israel.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So the Danites sent from their clan a detail of five valiant men of
Zorah and Eshtaol, to reconnoiter the land and scout it. With their
instructions to go and scout the land, they traveled as far as the
house of Micah in the mountain region of Ephraim, where they passed the
night.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Near the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young
Levite and turned in that direction. "Who brought you here and what are
you doing here?" they asked him. "What is your interest here?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` "This is how Micah treats me," he replied to them. "He pays me a
salary and I am his priest."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They said to him, "Consult God, that we may know whether the
undertaking we are engaged in will succeed."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The priest said to them, "Go and prosper: the LORD is favorable to
the undertaking you are engaged in."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So the five men went on and came to Laish. They saw that the people
dwelling there lived securely after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet
and trusting, with no lack of any natural resources. They were distant
from the Sidonians and had no contact with other people.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When the five returned to their kinsmen in Zorah and Eshtaol and
were asked for a report,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` they replied, "Come, let us attack them, for we have seen the land
and it is very good. Are you going to hesitate? Do not be slothful
about beginning your expedition to possess the land.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Those against whom you go are a trusting people, and the land is
ample. God has indeed given it into your power: a place where no
natural resource is lacking."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So six hundred men of the clan of the Danites, fully armed with
weapons of war, set out from where they were in Zorah and Eshtaol,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and camped in Judah, up near Kiriath-jearim; hence to this day the
place, which lies west of Kiriath-jearim, is called Mahaneh-dan.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` From there they went on to the mountain region of Ephraim and came
to the house of Micah.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The five men who had gone to reconnoiter the land of Laish said to
their kinsmen, "Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod,
household idols, and a carved idol overlaid with silver? Now decide
what you must do!"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So turning in that direction, they went to the house of the young
Levite at the home of Micah and greeted him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The six hundred men girt with weapons of war, who were Danites,
stood by the entrance of the gate, and the priest stood there also.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Meanwhile the five men who had gone to reconnoiter the land went up
and entered the house of Micah.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When they had gone in and taken the ephod, the household idols, and
the carved idol overlaid with silver, the priest said to them, "What
are you doing?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They said to him, "Be still: put your hand over your mouth. Come
with us and be our father and priest. Is it better for you to be priest
for the family of one man or to be priest for a tribe and a clan in
Israel?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The priest, agreeing, took the ephod, household idols, and carved
idol and went off in the midst of the band.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` As they turned to depart, they placed their little ones, their
livestock, and their goods at the head of the column.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The Danites had already gone some distance, when those in the
houses near that of Micah took up arms and overtook them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` They called to the Danites, who turned about and said to Micah,
"What do you want, that you have taken up arms?"
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "You have taken my god, which I made, and have gone off with my
priest as well," he answered. "What is left for me? How, then, can you
ask me what I want?"
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The Danites said to him, "Let us hear no further sound from you,
lest fierce men fall upon you and you and your family lose your lives."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The Danites then went on their way, and Micah, seeing that they
were stronger than he, returned home.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Having taken what Micah had made, and the priest he had had, they
attacked Laish, a quiet and trusting people; they put them to the sword
and destroyed their city by fire.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` No one came to their aid, since the city was far from Sidon and
they had no contact with other people. The Danites then rebuilt the
city, which was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob, and lived
there.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, son of Israel. However,
the name of the city was formerly Laish.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The Danites set up the carved idol for themselves, and Jonathan,
son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his descendants were priests for the
tribe of the Danites until the time of the captivity of the land.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` They maintained the carved idol Micah had made as long as the house
of God was in Shiloh.
