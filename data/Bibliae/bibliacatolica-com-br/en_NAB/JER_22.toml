[22]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` The LORD told me this: Go down to the palace of the king of Judah
and there deliver this message:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` You shall say: Listen to the word of the LORD, king of Judah, who
sit on the throne of David, you, your ministers, and your people that
enter by these gates!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Thus says the LORD: Do what is right and just. Rescue the victim
from the hand of his oppressor. Do not wrong or oppress the resident
alien, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this
place.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` If you carry out these commands, kings who succeed to the throne of
David will continue to enter the gates of this palace, riding in
chariots or mounted on horses, with their ministers, and their people.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But if you do not obey these commands, I swear by myself, says the
LORD: this palace shall become rubble.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For thus says the LORD concerning the palace of the king of Judah:
Though you be to me like Gilead, like the peak of Lebanon, I will turn
you into a waste, a city uninhabited.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Against you I will send destroyers, each with his axe: They shall
cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Many people will pass by this city and ask one another: "Why has the
LORD done this to so great a city?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the answer will be given: "Because they have deserted their
covenant with the LORD, their God, by worshiping and serving strange
gods."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Weep not for him who is dead, mourn not for him! Weep rather for
him who is going away; never again will he see the land of his birth.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus says the LORD concerning Shallum, son of Josiah, king of
Judah, who succeeded his father as king. He has left this place never
to return.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Rather, he shall die in the place where they exiled him; this land
he shall not see again.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Woe to him who builds his house on wrong, his terraces on
injustice; Who works his neighbor without pay, and gives him no wages.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Who says, "I will build myself a spacious house, with airy rooms,"
Who cuts out windows for it, panels it with cedar, and paints it with
vermillion.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Must you prove your rank among kings by competing with them in
cedar? Did not your father eat and drink? He did what was right and
just, and it went well with him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Because he dispensed justice to the weak and the poor, it went well
with him. Is this not true knowledge of me? says the LORD.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But your eyes and heart are set on nothing except on your own gain,
On shedding innocent blood, on practicing oppression and extortion.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim, son of Josiah,
king of Judah: They shall not lament him, "Alas! my brother"; "Alas!
sister." They shall not lament him, "Alas, Lord! alas, Majesty!"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The burial of an ass shall he be given, dragged forth and cast out
beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Scale Lebanon and cry out, in Bashan lift up your voice; Cry out
from Abarim, for all your lovers are crushed.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I spoke to you when you were secure, but you answered, "I will not
listen." This has been your way from your youth, not to listen to my
voice.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds, your lovers shall go
into exile. Surely then you shall be ashamed and confounded because of
all your wickedness.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` You who dwell on Lebanon, who nest in the cedars, How you shall
groan when pains come upon you, like the pangs of a woman in travail!
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As I live, says the LORD, if you, Coniah, son of Jehoiakim, king of
Judah, are a signet ring on my right hand, I will snatch you from it.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I will deliver you into the hands of those who seek your life; the
hands of those whom you fear; the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of
Babylon, and the Chaldeans.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` I will cast you out, you and the mother who bore you, into a
different land from the one you were born in; and there you shall die.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Neither of them shall come back to the land for which they yearn.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Is this man Coniah a vessel despised, to be broken up, an
instrument that no one wants? Why are he and his descendants cast out?
why thrown into a land they know not?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD--
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus says the LORD: Write this man down as one childless, who will
never thrive in his lifetime! No descendant of his shall achieve a seat
on the throne of David as ruler again over Judah.

Notas de rodap√©:
22:1-5 - The warning to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, is clear: his
disobedience will bring destruction. The promise that Jerusalem would
be the "head of the nations" if it depended on righteous leaders is
nullified by the king's injustice (see also 2 Kings 24:1-7 and
22:6-9 - The destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian captivity are
foretold as a consequence of the people's disloyalty and the corruption
of their leaders. Social sin and injustice are central themes,
demonstrating how collective sin affects the entire nation (see also
22:10-12 - The death of Jeconiah (Jeconiah) is prophesied, and his line
will be cut off from the throne of Judah. The fall of his house
illustrates God's judgment on unjust rulers, revealing divine
sovereignty over lineages and kingdoms (see also 2 Kings 24:12-16 and
