and a wall of one cubit; but the entrances of the chambers were on the
north.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` The outermost chambers were the lowest, for the system of levels set
them at a level lower than the closest chambers and those in between;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` for they were in three rows and had no foundations to conform with
the foundations of the courts, therefore they were on a lower terrace
of the ground than the closest and the middle chambers.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` On the far side there was a wall running parallel to the chambers
along the outer court; its length before these chambers was fifty
cubits,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` for the length of the chambers belonging to the outer court was
fifty cubits, but along its entire length the wall measured one hundred

"10" = ''':sup:`10` where the wall of the court began. To the south along the side of

north, just as long and just as wide, with the same exits and plan and
entrances.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Below the chambers to the south there was an entrance at the
beginning of the way which led to the back wall, by which one could
enter from the east.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He said to me, "The north and south chambers which border on the
free area are the sanctuary chambers; here the priests who draw near to
the LORD shall eat the most sacred meals, and here they shall keep the
most sacred offerings: cereal offerings, sin offerings, and guilt
offerings; for it is a holy place.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When the priests have once entered, they shall not leave the holy
place for the outer court until they have left here the clothing in
which they ministered, for it is holy. They shall put on other
garments, and then approach the place destined for the people."

"15" = ''':sup:`15` When he had finished measuring the inner temple area, he brought me
out by way of the gate which faces east and measured all the limits of
the court.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He measured the east side: five hundred cubits by his measuring
rod. Then he turned
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and measured the north side: five hundred cubits by the measuring
rod. He turned
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` to the south and measured five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then he turned to the west and measured five hundred cubits by the
measuring rod.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Thus he measured it in the four directions, five hundred cubits
long and five hundred cubits wide. It was surrounded by a wall, to
separate the sacred from the profane.
