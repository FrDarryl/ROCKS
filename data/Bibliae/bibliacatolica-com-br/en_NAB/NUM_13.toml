"3" = ''':sup:`3` So Moses dispatched them from the desert of Paran, as the LORD had
ordered. All of them were leaders among the Israelites;

'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` These are the names of the men whom Moses sent out to reconnoiter
the land. But Hoshea, son of Nun, Moses called Joshua.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` In sending them to reconnoiter the land of Canaan, Moses said to
them, "Go up here in the Negeb, up into the highlands,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and see what kind of land it is. Are the people living there strong
or weak, few or many?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Is the country in which they live good or bad? Are the towns in
which they dwell open or fortified?

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Is the soil fertile or barren, wooded or clear? And do your best to
get some of the fruit of the land." It was then the season for early
grapes.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So they went up and reconnoitered the land from the desert of Zin
as far as where Rehob adjoins Labo of Hamath.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Going up by way of the Negeb, they reached Hebron, where Ahiman,
Sheshai and Talmai, descendants of the Anakim, were living. (Hebron had
been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` They also reached the Wadi Eshcol, where they cut down a branch
with a single cluster of grapes on it, which two of them carried on a
pole, as well as some pomegranates and figs.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` It was because of the cluster the Israelites cut there that they
called the place Wadi Eshcol.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` After reconnoitering the land for forty days they returned,

"26" = ''':sup:`26` met Moses and Aaron and the whole community of the Israelites in
the desert of Paran at Kadesh, made a report to them all, and showed
them the fruit of the country.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` They told Moses: "We went into the land to which you sent us. It
does indeed flow with milk and honey, and here is its fruit.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` However, the people who are living in the land are fierce, and the
towns are fortified and very strong. Besides, we saw descendants of the
Anakim there.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` Amalekites live in the region of the Negeb; Hittites, Jebusites and
Amorites dwell in the highlands, and Canaanites along the seacoast and
the banks of the Jordan."

"30" = ''':sup:`30` Caleb, however, to quiet the people toward Moses, said, "We ought
to go up and seize the land, for we can certainly do so."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But the men who had gone up with him said, "We cannot attack these
people; they are too strong for us."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So they spread discouraging reports among the Israelites about the
land they had scouted, saying, "The land that we explored is a country
that consumes its inhabitants. And all the people we saw there are huge
men,

"33" = ''':sup:`33` veritable giants (the Anakim were a race of giants); we felt like
mere grasshoppers, and so we must have seemed to them."

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-3 - God commands Moses to send 12 spies to explore the land of
Canaan. This marks a time of preparation and confidence in the
fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Israel (see also
13:17-20 - Moses instructs the spies to observe the land, its people,
and its cities. This investigation anticipates the entry into Canaan
and emphasizes the importance of wisdom and strategy in fulfilling
13:25-29 - The spies return with a positive report about the land's
fertility, but they express fear because of the strong inhabitants.
This demonstrates the tension between God's promise and human fear (see
13:30-31 - Caleb encourages the people to trust God and take possession
of the land, while the other spies discourage the people, demonstrating
a lack of faith. This passage illustrates the importance of trusting
Corinthians 5:7).
13:32-33 - The spies' unbelief creates fear among the Israelites,
distorting reality with exaggerations about giants in the land. This
shows how a lack of faith can lead to despair and disobedience (see
