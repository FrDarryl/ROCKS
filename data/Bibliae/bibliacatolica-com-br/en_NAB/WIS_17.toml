"1" = ''':sup:`1` For great are your judgments, and hardly to be described; therefore
the unruly souls were wrong.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For when the lawless thought to enslave the holy nation, shackled
with darkness, fettered by the long night, they lay confined beneath
their own roofs as exiles from the eternal providence.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For they who supposed their secret sins were hid under the dark veil
of oblivion Were scattered in fearful trembling, terrified by
apparitions.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For not even their inner chambers kept them fearless, for crashing
sounds on all sides terrified them, and mute phantoms with somber looks
appeared.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` No force, even of fire, was able to give light, nor did the flaming
brilliance of the stars succeed in lighting up that gloomy night.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But only intermittent, fearful fires flashed through upon them; And
in their terror they thought beholding these was worse than the times
when that sight was no longer to be seen.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And mockeries of the magic art were in readiness, and a jeering
reproof of their vaunted shrewdness.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For they who undertook to banish fears and terrors from the sick
soul themselves sickened with a ridiculous fear.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For even though no monstrous thing frightened them, they shook at
the passing of insects and the hissing of reptiles,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And perished trembling, reluctant to face even the air that they
could nowhere escape.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For wickedness, of its nature cowardly, testifies in its own
condemnation, and because of a distressed conscience, always magnifies
misfortunes.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For fear is nought but the surrender of the helps that come from
reason;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and the more one's expectation is of itself uncertain, the more one
makes of not knowing the cause that brings on torment.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So they, during that night, powerless though it was, that had come
upon them from the recesses of a powerless nether world, while all
sleeping the same sleep,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Were partly smitten by fearsome apparitions and partly stricken by
their souls' surrender; for fear came upon them, sudden and unexpected.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thus, then, whoever was there fell into that unbarred prison and
was kept confined.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For whether one was a farmer, or a shepherd, or a worker at tasks
in the wasteland, Taken unawares, he served out the inescapable
sentence;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` for all were bound by the one bond of darkness. And were it only
the whistling wind, or the melodious song of birds in the spreading
branches, Or the steady sound of rushing water,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` or the rude crash of overthrown rocks, Or the unseen gallop of
bounding animals, or the roaring cry of the fiercest beasts, Or an echo
resounding from the hollow of the hills, these sounds, inspiring
terror, paralyzed them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For the whole world shone with brilliant light and continued its
works without interruption;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Over them alone was spread oppressive night, an image of the
darkness that next should come upon them; yet they were to themselves
more burdensome than the darkness.
