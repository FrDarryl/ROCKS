"1" = ''':sup:`1` Samuel addressed all Israel: "I have granted your request in every
respect," he said. "I have set a king over you
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and now the king is your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and
have sons among you. I have lived with you from my youth to the present
day.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Here I stand! Answer me in the presence of the LORD and of his
anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose ass have I taken? Whom have I
cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whom have I accepted a bribe and
overlooked his guilt? I will make restitution to you."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They replied, "You have neither cheated us, nor oppressed us, nor
accepted anything from anyone."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he said to them, "The LORD is witness against you this day, and
his anointed as well, that you have found nothing in my possession."
"He is witness," they agreed.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Continuing, Samuel said to the people: "The LORD is witness, who
appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up from the
land of Egypt.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now, therefore, take your stand, and I shall arraign you before the
LORD, and shall recount for you all the acts of mercy the LORD has done
for you and your fathers.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When Jacob and his sons went to Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed
them, your fathers appealed to the LORD, who sent Moses and Aaron to
bring them out of Egypt, and he gave them this place to live in.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But they forgot the LORD their God; and he allowed them to fall into
the clutches of Sisera, the captain of the army of Jabin, king of
Hazor, into the grasp of the Philistines, and into the grip of the king
of Moab, who made war against them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Each time they appealed to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned in
forsaking the LORD and worshiping Baals and Ashtaroth; but deliver us
now from the power of our enemies, and we will worship you.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Accordingly, the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel;
he delivered you from the power of your enemies on every side, so that
you were able to live in security.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Yet, when you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, advancing against
you, you said to me, 'Not so, but a king must rule us,' even though the
LORD your God is your king.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Now you have the king you want, a king the LORD has given you.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` If you fear the LORD and worship him, if you are obedient to him
and do not rebel against the LORD'S command, if both you and the king
who rules you follow the LORD your God--well and good.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But if you do not obey the LORD and if you rebel against his
command, the LORD will deal severely with you and your king, and
destroy you.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now then, stand ready to witness the great marvel the LORD is about
to accomplish before your eyes.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Are we not in the harvest time for wheat? Yet I shall call to the
LORD, and he will send thunder and rain. Thus you will see and
understand how greatly the LORD is displeased that you have asked for a
king."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Samuel then called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain
that day. As a result, all the people dreaded the LORD and Samuel.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for us, your
servants, that we may not die for having added to all our other sins
the evil of asking for a king."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "Do not fear," Samuel answered them. "It is true you have committed
all this evil; still, you must not turn from the LORD, but must worship
him with your whole heart.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Do not turn to meaningless idols which can neither profit nor save;
they are nothing.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For the sake of his own great name the LORD will not abandon his
people, since the LORD himself chose to make you his people.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` As for me, far be it from me to sin against the LORD by ceasing to
pray for you and to teach you the good and right way.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But you must fear the LORD and worship him faithfully with your
whole heart; keep in mind the great things he has done among you.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` If instead you continue to do evil, both you and your king shall
perish."
