the statutes for the altar when it is set up for the offering of
holocausts upon it and for the sprinkling of blood against it.

are of the line of Zadok, who draw near me to minister to me, says the
Lord GOD.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar,
and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim all around. Thus
you shall purify it and make atonement for it.

to purify the altar as was done with the bull.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` When you have finished the purification, bring an unblemished young
bull and an unblemished ram from the flock,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and present them before the LORD; the priests shall strew salt on
them and offer them to the LORD as holocausts.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Daily for seven days you shall offer a he-goat as a sin offering,
and a young bull and a ram from the flock, all unblemished, shall be
offered
