water, which was ankle-deep.

the water, which was now knee-deep. Again he measured off a thousand
and had me wade; the water was up to my waist.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Once more he measured off a thousand, but there was now a river
through which I could not wade; for the water had risen so high it had
become a river that could not be crossed except by swimming.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He asked me, "Have you seen this, son of man?" Then he brought me to
the bank of the river, where he had me sit.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Along the bank of the river I saw very many trees on both sides.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He said to me, "This water flows into the eastern district down upon
the Arabah, and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes
fresh.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Wherever the river flows, every sort of living creature that can
multiply shall live, and there shall be abundant fish, for wherever
this water comes the sea shall be made fresh.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Fishermen shall be standing along it from En-gedi to En-eglaim,
spreading their nets there. Its kinds of fish shall be like those of
the Great Sea, very numerous.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Only its marshes and swamps shall not be made fresh; they shall be
left for salt.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of every kind shall
grow; their leaves shall not fade, nor their fruit fail. Every month
they shall bear fresh fruit, for they shall be watered by the flow from
the sanctuary. Their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for
medicine."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Thus says the Lord GOD: These are the boundaries within which you
shall apportion the land among the twelve tribes of Israel (Joseph
having two portions).
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` All of you shall have a like portion in this land which I swore to
give to your fathers, that it might fall to you as your inheritance.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` This is the boundary of the land on the north side: from the Great
Sea in the direction of Hethlon, past Labo of Hamath, to Zedad,

to Hazar-enon which is on the border of the Hauran.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thus the border shall extend from the sea to Hazar-enon, with the
frontier of Hamath and Damascus to the north. This is the northern
boundary.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The eastern boundary: between the Hauran--toward Damascus--and
Gilead on the one side, and the land of Israel on the other side, the
Jordan shall form the boundary down to the eastern sea as far as Tamar.
This is the eastern boundary.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The southern boundary: from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh,
thence to the Wadi of Egypt, and on to the Great Sea. This is the
southern boundary.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The western boundary: the Great Sea forms the boundary up to a
point parallel to Labo of Hamath. This is the western boundary.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` You shall distribute this land among yourselves according to the
tribes of Israel.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You shall allot it as inheritances for yourselves and for the
aliens resident in your midst who have bred children among you. The
latter shall be to you like native Israelites; along with you they
shall receive inheritances among the tribes of Israel.
