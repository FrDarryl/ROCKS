"2" = ''':sup:`2` I know well that it is so; but how can a man be justified before
God?

"5" = ''':sup:`5` He removes the mountains before they know it; he overturns them in
his anger.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` He shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars beneath it
tremble.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He commands the sun, and it rises not; he seals up the stars.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He alone stretches out the heavens and treads upon the crests of the
sea.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` He made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of
the south;

"10" = ''':sup:`10` He does great things past finding out, marvelous things beyond
reckoning.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Should he come near me, I see him not; should he pass by, I am not
aware of him;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Should he seize me forcibly, who can say him nay? Who can say to
him, "What are you doing?"

"13" = ''':sup:`13` He is God and he does not relent; the helpers of Rahab bow beneath
him.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` How much less shall I give him any answer, or choose out arguments
against him!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Even though I were right, I could not answer him, but should rather
beg for what was due me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If I appealed to him and he answered my call, I could not believe
that he would hearken to my words;

"17" = ''':sup:`17` With a tempest he might overwhelm me, and multiply my wounds
without cause;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He need not suffer me to draw breath, but might fill me with bitter
griefs.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` If it be a question of strength, he is mighty; and if of judgment,
who will call him to account?

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Though I were right, my own mouth might condemn me; were I
innocent, he might put me in the wrong.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Though I am innocent, I myself cannot know it; I despise my life.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` It is all one! therefore I say: Both the innocent and the wicked he

"23" = ''':sup:`23` When the scourge slays suddenly, he laughs at the despair of the
innocent.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; he covers the
faces of its judges. If it is not he, who then is it?

"25" = ''':sup:`25` My days are swifter than a runner, they flee away; they see no
happiness;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` They shoot by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping upon its
prey.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` If I say: I will forget my complaining, I will lay aside my sadness
and be of good cheer,

"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then I am in dread of all my pains; I know that you will not hold
me innocent.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` If I must be accounted guilty, why then should I strive in vain?

"30" = ''':sup:`30` If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,

"31" = ''':sup:`31` Yet you would plunge me in the ditch, so that my garments would
abhor me.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` For he is not a man like myself, that I should answer him, that we
should come together in judgment.

"33" = ''':sup:`33` Would that there were an arbiter between us, who could lay his hand
upon us both

"34" = ''':sup:`34` and withdraw his rod from me. Would that his terrors did not

9:3-12 - Job expresses his frustration with his inability to challenge
God. He emphasizes the inevitability of suffering and the difficulty of
understanding God's ways. This reflects the human struggle with pain

God, he could not win. The idea that God is unbeatable underscores the
disproportion between divine wisdom and human understanding (see also
9:21-24 - Job feels his integrity is not recognized, and he expresses
that the unrighteous are often favored. This reflection on the apparent
prosperity of the wicked is a recurring theme in Scripture and raises
