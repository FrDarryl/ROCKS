his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught
his disciples."

"2" = ''':sup:`2` He said to them, "When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Give us each day our daily bread

"4" = ''':sup:`4` and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to
us, and do not subject us to the final test."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend to whom he
goes at midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey and I
have nothing to offer him,'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and he says in reply from within, 'Do not bother me; the door has
already been locked and my children and I are already in bed. I cannot
get up to give you anything.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I tell you, if he does not get up to give him the loaves because of
their friendship, he will get up to give him whatever he needs because
of his persistence.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "And I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find;
knock and the door will be opened to you.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and
to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` What father among you would hand his son a snake when he asks for a
fish?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` If you then, who are wicked, know how to give good gifts to your
children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the holy Spirit
to those who ask him?"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He was driving out a demon (that was) mute, and when the demon had
gone out, the mute person spoke and the crowds were amazed.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Some of them said, "By the power of Beelzebul, the prince of
demons, he drives out demons."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Others, to test him, asked him for a sign from heaven.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But he knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided
against itself will be laid waste and house will fall against house.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom
stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I drive out demons.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If I, then, drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own
people drive them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But if it is by the finger of God that (I) drive out demons, then
the kingdom of God has come upon you.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` When a strong man fully armed guards his palace, his possessions
are safe.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` But when one stronger than he attacks and overcomes him, he takes
away the armor on which he relied and distributes the spoils.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` "When an unclean spirit goes out of someone, it roams through arid
regions searching for rest but, finding none, it says, 'I shall return
to my home from which I came.'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But upon returning, it finds it swept clean and put in order.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then it goes and brings back seven other spirits more wicked than
itself who move in and dwell there, and the last condition of that
person is worse than the first."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` While he was speaking, a woman from the crowd called out and said
to him, "Blessed is the womb that carried you and the breasts at which
you nursed."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` He replied, "Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and
observe it."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` While still more people gathered in the crowd, he said to them,
"This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign
will be given it, except the sign of Jonah.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of
Man be to this generation.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` At the judgment the queen of the south will rise with the men of
this generation and she will condemn them, because she came from the
ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and there is something
greater than Solomon here.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` At the judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation
and condemn it, because at the preaching of Jonah they repented, and

"33" = ''':sup:`33` "No one who lights a lamp hides it away or places it (under a
bushel basket), but on a lampstand so that those who enter might see
the light.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is sound, then your
whole body is filled with light, but when it is bad, then your body is
in darkness.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Take care, then, that the light in you not become darkness.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` If your whole body is full of light, and no part of it is in
darkness, then it will be as full of light as a lamp illuminating you
with its brightness."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` After he had spoken, a Pharisee invited him to dine at his home. He
entered and reclined at table to eat.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` The Pharisee was amazed to see that he did not observe the
prescribed washing before the meal.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The Lord said to him, "Oh you Pharisees! Although you cleanse the
outside of the cup and the dish, inside you are filled with plunder and
evil.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` You fools! Did not the maker of the outside also make the inside?
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` But as to what is within, give alms, and behold, everything will be
clean for you.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Woe to you Pharisees! You pay tithes of mint and of rue and of
every garden herb, but you pay no attention to judgment and to love for
God. These you should have done, without overlooking the others.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Woe to you Pharisees! You love the seat of honor in synagogues and
greetings in marketplaces.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Woe to you! You are like unseen graves over which people
unknowingly walk."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Then one of the scholars of the law said to him in reply, "Teacher,
by saying this you are insulting us too."
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And he said, "Woe also to you scholars of the law! You impose on
people burdens hard to carry, but you yourselves do not lift one finger
to touch them.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Woe to you! You build the memorials of the prophets whom your
ancestors killed.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Consequently, you bear witness and give consent to the deeds of
your ancestors, for they killed them and you do the building.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Therefore, the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets
and apostles; some of them they will kill and persecute'
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` in order that this generation might be charged with the blood of
all the prophets shed since the foundation of the world,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who died between
the altar and the temple building. Yes, I tell you, this generation
will be charged with their blood!
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Woe to you, scholars of the law! You have taken away the key of
knowledge. You yourselves did not enter and you stopped those trying to
enter."

"53" = ''':sup:`53` When he left, the scribes and Pharisees began to act with hostility
toward him and to interrogate him about many things,

"54" = ''':sup:`54` for they were plotting to catch him at something he might say.
