"1" = ''':sup:`1` That same day Tobit remembered the money he had deposited with
Gabael at Rages in Media, and he thought,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Now that I have asked for death, why should I not call my son
Tobiah and let him know about this money before I die?"
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So he called his son Tobiah; and when he came, he said to him: "My
son, when I die, give me a decent burial. Honor your mother, and do not
abandon her as long as she lives. Do whatever pleases her, and do not
grieve her spirit in any way.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Remember, my son, that she went through many trials for your sake
while you were in her womb. And when she dies, bury her in the same
grave with me.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` "Through all your days, my son, keep the Lord in mind, and suppress
every desire to sin or to break his commandments. Perform good works
all the days of your life, and do not tread the paths of wrongdoing.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` For if you are steadfast in your service, your good works will bring
success, not only to you, but also to all those who live uprightly.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` "Give alms from your possessions. Do not turn your face away from
any of the poor, and God's face will not be turned away from you.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Son, give alms in proportion to what you own. If you have great
wealth, give alms out of your abundance; if you have but little,
distribute even some of that. But do not hesitate to give alms;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` you will be storing up a goodly treasure for yourself against the
day of adversity.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Almsgiving frees one from death, and keeps one from going into the
dark abode.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Alms are a worthy offering in the sight of the Most High for all
who give them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` "Be on your guard, son, against every form of immorality, and above
all, marry a woman of the lineage of your forefathers. Do not marry a
stranger who is not of your father's tribe, because we are sons of the
prophets. My boy, keep in mind Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our
fathers from of old: all of them took wives from among their own
kinsmen and were blessed in their children. Remember that their
posterity shall inherit the land.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Therefore, my son, love your kinsmen. Do not be so proudhearted
toward your kinsmen, the sons and daughters of your people, as to
refuse to take a wife for yourself from among them. For in such
arrogance there is ruin and great disorder. Likewise, in worthlessness
there is decay and dire poverty, for worthlessness is the mother of
famine.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` "Do not keep with you overnight the wages of any man who works for
you, but pay him immediately. If you thus behave as God's servant, you
will receive your reward. Keep a close watch on yourself, my son, in
everything you do, and discipline yourself in all your conduct.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do to no one what you yourself dislike. Do not drink wine till you
become drunk, nor let drunkenness accompany you on your way.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Give to the hungry some of your bread, and to the naked some of
your clothing. Whatever you have left over, give away as alms; and do
not begrudge the alms you give.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Be lavish with your bread and wine at the burial of the virtuous,
but do not share them with sinners.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Seek counsel from every wise man, and do not think lightly of any
advice that can be useful.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` At all times bless the Lord God, and ask him to make all your paths
straight and to grant success to all your endeavors and plans. For no
pagan nation possesses good counsel, but the Lord himself gives all
good things. If the Lord chooses, he raises a man up; but if he should
decide otherwise, he casts him down to the deepest recesses of the
nether world. So now, my son, keep in mind my commandments, and never
let them be erased from your heart.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` "And now, son, I wish to inform you that I have deposited a great
sum of money with Gabri's son Gabael at Rages in Media.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Do not be discouraged, my child, because of our poverty. You will
be a rich man if you fear God, avoid all sin, and do what is right
before the Lord your God."
