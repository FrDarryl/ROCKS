hire laborers for his vineyard.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage, he sent them into
his vineyard.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Going out about nine o'clock, he saw others standing idle in the

"4" = ''':sup:`4` and he said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard, and I will give
you what is just.'

"5" = ''':sup:`5` So they went off. (And) he went out again around noon, and around
three o'clock, and did likewise.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Going out about five o'clock, he found others standing around, and
said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'

"7" = ''':sup:`7` They answered, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You
too go into my vineyard.'

"8" = ''':sup:`8` When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman,
'Summon the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last

"9" = ''':sup:`9` When those who had started about five o'clock came, each received
the usual daily wage.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more,

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner,

"12" = ''':sup:`12` saying, 'These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made

"13" = ''':sup:`13` He said to one of them in reply, 'My friend, I am not cheating you.
Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the
same as you?

"15" = ''':sup:`15` (Or) am I not free to do as I wish with my own money? Are you
envious because I am generous?'

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve (disciples)
aside by themselves, and said to them on the way,

"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be
handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn
him to death,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` He said to her, "What do you wish?" She answered him, "Command that
these two sons of mine sit, one at your right and the other at your
left, in your kingdom."

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Jesus said in reply, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you
drink the cup that I am going to drink?" They said to him, "We can."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He replied, "My cup you will indeed drink, but to sit at my right
and at my left (, this) is not mine to give but is for those for whom
it has been prepared by my Father."

"24" = ''':sup:`24` When the ten heard this, they became indignant at the two brothers.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` But Jesus summoned them and said, "You know that the rulers of the
Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones make their authority
over them felt.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` But it shall not be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be
great among you shall be your servant;

"27" = ''':sup:`27` whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` Just so, the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and
to give his life as a ransom for many."

"29" = ''':sup:`29` As they left Jericho, a great crowd followed him.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard
that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "(Lord,) Son of David, have
pity on us!"

"31" = ''':sup:`31` The crowd warned them to be silent, but they called out all the
more, "Lord, Son of David, have pity on us!"

"32" = ''':sup:`32` Jesus stopped and called them and said, "What do you want me to do
for you?"
