recovered the temple and the city,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` they destroyed the altars erected by the Gentiles in the marketplace
and the sacred enclosures.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` After purifying the temple, they made a new altar. Then, with fire
struck from flint, they offered sacrifice for the first time in two
years, burned incense, and lighted lamps. They also set out the
showbread.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When they had done this, they prostrated themselves and begged the
Lord that they might never again fall into such misfortunes, and that
if they should sin at any time, he might chastise them with moderation
and not hand them over to blasphemous and barbarous Gentiles.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` On the anniversary of the day on which the temple had been profaned
by the Gentiles, that is, the twenty-fifth of the same month Chislev,
the purification of the temple took place.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The Jews celebrated joyfully for eight days as on the feast of
Booths, remembering how, a little while before, they had spent the

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Carrying rods entwined with leaves, green branches and palms, they
sang hymns of grateful praise to him who had brought about the

'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` By public edict and decree they prescribed that the whole Jewish

'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Such was the end of Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes.

of that godless man, and shall give a summary of the chief evils caused
by the wars.
'''

charge of the government as commander-in-chief of Coelesyria and
Phoenicia.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Ptolemy, surnamed Macron, had taken the lead in treating the Jews
fairly because of the previous injustice that had been done them, and
he endeavored to have peaceful relations with them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` As a result, he was accused before Eupator by the King's Friends.
In fact, on all sides he heard himself called a traitor for having
abandoned Cyprus, which Philometor had entrusted to him, and for having
gone over to Antiochus Epiphanes. Since he could not command the
respect due to his high office, he ended his life by taking poison.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Gorgias became governor of the region, he employed foreign
troops and used every opportunity to attack the Jews.

containing everything necessary to sustain a siege,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, along with Zacchaeus and his men,
in sufficient numbers to besiege them, while he himself went off to
places where he was more urgently needed.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But some of the men in Simon's force who were money lovers let
themselves be bribed by some of the men in the towers; on receiving
seventy thousand drachmas, they allowed a number of them to escape.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Maccabeus was told what had happened, he assembled the rulers
of the people and accused those men of having sold their kinsmen for
money by setting their enemies free to fight against them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So he put them to death as traitors, and without delay captured the
two towers.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` As he was successful at arms in all his undertakings, he destroyed
more than twenty thousand men in the two strongholds.
'''

cavalry from Asia; then he appeared in Judea, ready to conquer it by
force.
'''

sprinkling earth upon their heads and girding their loins in sackcloth.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Lying prostrate at the foot of the altar, they begged him to be
gracious to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and a foe to
their foes, as the law declares.

considerable distance from the city, halting when they were close to
the enemy.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` As soon as dawn broke, the armies joined battle, the one having as
pledge of success and victory not only their valor but also their
reliance on the Lord, and the other taking fury as their leader in the
fight.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` In the midst of the fierce battle, there appeared to the enemy from
the heavens five majestic men riding on golden-bridled horses, who led
the Jews on.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` They surrounded Maccabeus, and shielding him with their own armor,
kept him from being wounded. They shot arrows and hurled thunderbolts
at the enemy, who were bewildered and blinded, thrown into confusion
and routed.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Twenty-five hundred of their foot soldiers and six hundred of their
horsemen were slain.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Timothy, however, fled to a well-fortified stronghold called
Gazara, where Chaereas was in command.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` For four days Maccabeus and his men eagerly besieged the fortress.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Those inside, relying on the strength of the place, kept repeating
outrageous blasphemies and uttering abominable words.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` When the fifth day dawned, twenty young men in the army of
Maccabeus, angered over such blasphemies, bravely stormed the wall and
with savage fury cut down everyone they encountered.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Others who climbed up the same way swung around on the defenders,
taking the besieged in the rear; they put the towers to the torch,
spread the fire and burned the blasphemers alive. Still others broke
down the gates and let in the rest of the troops, who took possession
of the city.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Timothy had hidden in a cistern, but they killed him, along with
his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes.

victory.
