[21]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Some time after this, as Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in
Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard to be my vegetable
garden, since it is close by, next to my house. I will give you a
better vineyard in exchange, or, if you prefer, I will give you its
value in money."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` "The LORD forbid," Naboth answered him, "that I should give you my
ancestral heritage."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Ahab went home disturbed and angry at the answer Naboth the
Jezreelite had made to him: "I will not give you my ancestral
heritage." Lying down on his bed, he turned away from food and would
not eat.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` His wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, "Why are you so angry
that you will not eat?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He answered her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said
to him, 'Sell me your vineyard, or, if you prefer, I will give you a
vineyard in exchange.' But he refused to let me have his vineyard."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` "A fine ruler over Israel you are indeed!" his wife Jezebel said to
him. "Get up. Eat and be cheerful. I will obtain the vineyard of Naboth
the Jezreelite for you."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and, having sealed them with his
seal, sent them to the elders and to the nobles who lived in the same
city with Naboth.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` This is what she wrote in the letters: "Proclaim a fast and set
Naboth at the head of the people.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Next, get two scoundrels to face him and accuse him of having
cursed God and king. Then take him out and stone him to death."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` His fellow citizens--the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his
city--did as Jezebel had ordered them in writing, through the letters
she had sent them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` They proclaimed a fast and placed Naboth at the head of the people.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Two scoundrels came in and confronted him with the accusation,
"Naboth has cursed God and king." And they led him out of the city and
stoned him to death.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then they sent the information to Jezebel that Naboth had been
stoned to death.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When Jezebel learned that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said
to Ahab, "Go on, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the
Jezreelite which he refused to sell you, because Naboth is not alive,
but dead."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` On hearing that Naboth was dead, Ahab started off on his way down
to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Start down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He
will be in the vineyard of Naboth, of which he has come to take
possession.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This is what you shall tell him, 'The LORD says: After murdering,
do you also take possession? For this, the LORD says: In the place
where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, the dogs shall lick up
your blood, too.'"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "Have you found me out, my enemy?" Ahab said to Elijah. "Yes," he
answered. "Because you have given yourself up to doing evil in the
LORD'S sight,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I am bringing evil upon you: I will destroy you and will cut off
every male in Ahab's line, whether slave or freeman, in Israel.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` I will make your house like that of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and
like that of Baasha, son of Ahijah, because of how you have provoked me
by leading Israel into sin."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` (Against Jezebel, too, the LORD declared, "The dogs shall devour
Jezebel in the district of Jezreel.")
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "When one of Ahab's line dies in the city, dogs will devour him;
when one of them dies in the field, the birds of the sky will devour
him."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Indeed, no one gave himself up to the doing of evil in the sight of
the LORD as did Ahab, urged on by his wife Jezebel.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` He became completely abominable by following idols, just as the
Amorites had done, whom the LORD drove out before the Israelites.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When Ahab heard these words, he tore his garments and put on
sackcloth over his bare flesh. He fasted, slept in the sackcloth, and
went about subdued.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` "Have you seen that Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he
has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his time. I
will bring the evil upon his house during the reign of his son."

Notas de rodap√©:
21:1-4 - Ahab desires Naboth's vineyard, but Naboth refuses to sell it
because of Israel's inheritance law. Naboth's faithfulness to God's Law
contrasts with Ahab's selfish desire and greed, revealing the conflict

21:5-10 - Ahab's wife, Jezebel, plots Naboth's death to satisfy the
king's desire. This evil act of conspiracy and murder highlights the
corruption of power and the wickedness of the human heart (see also
21:17-19 - God sends Elijah to confront Ahab after the murder of
Naboth. Elijah's prophecy against Ahab and Jezebel reveals that no one
is above God's justice, not even the king. This underscores the
21:25-26 - The Bible emphasizes that Ahab was Israel's worst king,
incited by Jezebel to commit abominations. His life is an example of
how persistent sin and evil influence can corrupt an entire nation (see

Elijah's condemnation. God, in His mercy, postpones full judgment on
his house. This shows that even the worst of sinners can experience
