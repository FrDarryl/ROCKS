down into Egypt. They stayed there as long as they found sustenance,
and grew into such a great multitude that the number of their race
could not be counted.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` The king of Egypt, however, rose up against them, shrewdly forced
them to labor at brickmaking, oppressed and enslaved them.
