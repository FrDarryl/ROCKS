"2" = ''':sup:`2` Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus says the Lord GOD:
Because you are haughty of heart, you say, "A god am I! I occupy a
godly throne in the heart of the sea!"-- And yet you are a man, and not
a god, however you may think yourself like a god.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Oh yes, you are wiser than Daniel, there is no secret that is beyond
you.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` By your wisdom and your intelligence you have made riches for
yourself; You have put gold and silver into your treasuries.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` By your great wisdom applied to your trading you have heaped up your
riches; your heart has grown haughty from your riches--
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have thought yourself
to have the mind of a god,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore I will bring against you foreigners, the most barbarous of
nations. They shall draw their swords against your beauteous wisdom,
they shall run them through your splendid apparel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They shall thrust you down to the pit, there to die a bloodied
corpse, in the heart of the sea.

'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Son of man, utter a lament over the king of Tyre, saying to him:
Thus says the Lord GOD: You were stamped with the seal of perfection,
of complete wisdom and perfect beauty.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In Eden, the garden of God, you were, and every precious stone was
your covering (carnelian, topaz, and beryl, chrysolite, onyx, and
jasper, sapphire, garnet, and emerald); Of gold your pendants and
jewels were made, on the day you were created.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` With the Cherub I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God,
walking among the fiery stones.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Blameless you were in your conduct from the day you were created,
Until evil was found in you,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` the result of your far-flung trade; violence was your business, and
you sinned. Then I banned you from the mountain of God; the Cherub
drove you from among the fiery stones.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` You became haughty of heart because of your beauty; for the sake of
splendor you debased your wisdom. I cast you to the earth, so great was
your guilt; I made you a spectacle in the sight of kings.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Because of your guilt, your sinful trade, I have profaned your
sanctuaries, And I have brought out fire from your midst which will
devour you. I have reduced you to dust on the earth in the sight of all
who should see you.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Among the peoples, all who knew you stand aghast at you; You have
become a horror, you shall be no more.

'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Son of man, look toward Sidon, and prophesy against it:
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Thus says the Lord GOD: See! I am coming at you, Sidon; I will be
glorified in your midst. Then they shall know that I am the LORD, when
I inflict punishments upon it and use it to manifest my holiness.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Into it I will send pestilence, and blood shall flow in its
streets. Within it shall fall those slain by the sword that comes
against it from every side. Thus they shall know that I am the LORD.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Sidon shall no longer be a tearing thorn for the house of Israel, a
brier that scratches them more than all the others about them who
despise them; thus they shall know that I am the LORD.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the
peoples among whom they are scattered, then I will manifest my holiness
through them in the sight of the nations. Then they shall live on their
land which I gave to my servant Jacob;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` they shall live on it in security, building houses and planting
vineyards. They shall dwell secure while I inflict punishments on all
their neighbors who despised them; thus they shall know that I, the
LORD, am their God.

28:1-10 - The prophecy against the prince of Tyre denounces his
arrogance and his attempt to equal himself with God. The condemnation
of the prince of Tyre highlights how pride and self-sufficiency are
2:4).
28:11-19 - The prophecy against the king of Tyre is one of the most
detailed, describing the fall of a being who was "in Eden, in the
garden of God," a reference to sin and the fall of humanity. The fall
of Tyre is compared to the fall of Lucifer due to pride and rebellion
28:20-23 - God's judgment against Sidon is announced, with the promised
punishment for its wickedness. Sidon's destruction reflects God's
punishment for those who persist in their wicked practices and reject
28:24-26 - Israel's restoration is contrasted with the destruction of
enemy nations. The judgment against Tyre and Sidon is a lesson that
God's vengeance is certain, but it also reveals His faithfulness in
