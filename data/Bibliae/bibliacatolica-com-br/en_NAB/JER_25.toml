all the citizens of Jerusalem:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Since the thirteenth year of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah, to
this day-these three and twenty years-the word of the LORD has come to
me and I spoke to you untiringly, but you would not listen.

without fail all his servants the prophets
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` with this message: Turn back, each of you, from your evil way and
from your evil deeds; then you shall remain in the land which the LORD

them: Thus says the LORD of hosts: You must drink!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For since with this city, which is called by my name, I begin to

LORD of hosts.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Prophesy against them all these things and say to them: The LORD
roars from on high, from his holy dwelling he raises his voice;
Mightily he roars over the range, a shout like that of vintagers over
the grapes.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` To all who inhabit the earth to its very ends the uproar spreads;
For the LORD has an indictment against the nations, he is to pass
judgment upon all mankind: The godless shall be given to the sword,
says the LORD.

nation; A great storm is unleashed from the ends of the earth.
