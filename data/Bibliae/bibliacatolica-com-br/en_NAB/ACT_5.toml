[5]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` A man named Ananias, however, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece
of property.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He retained for himself, with his wife's knowledge, some of the
purchase price, took the remainder, and put it at the feet of the
apostles.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that
you lied to the holy Spirit and retained part of the price of the land?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` While it remained unsold, did it not remain yours? And when it was
sold, was it not still under your control? Why did you contrive this
deed? You have lied not to human beings, but to God."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last,
and great fear came upon all who heard of it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The young men came and wrapped him up, then carried him out and
buried him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, unaware of
what had happened.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Peter said to her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?"
She answered, "Yes, for that amount."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Peter said to her, "Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the
Lord? Listen, the footsteps of those who have buried your husband are
at the door, and they will carry you out."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` At once, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the
young men entered they found her dead, so they carried her out and
buried her beside her husband.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of
these things.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Many signs and wonders were done among the people at the hands of
the apostles. They were all together in Solomon's portico.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` None of the others dared to join them, but the people esteemed
them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Yet more than ever, believers in the Lord, great numbers of men and
women, were added to them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thus they even carried the sick out into the streets and laid them
on cots and mats so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might
fall on one or another of them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` A large number of people from the towns in the vicinity of
Jerusalem also gathered, bringing the sick and those disturbed by
unclean spirits, and they were all cured.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then the high priest rose up and all his companions, that is, the
party of the Sadducees, and, filled with jealousy,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the public jail.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But during the night, the angel of the Lord opened the doors of the
prison, led them out, and said,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "Go and take your place in the temple area, and tell the people
everything about this life."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When they heard this, they went to the temple early in the morning
and taught. When the high priest and his companions arrived, they
convened the Sanhedrin, the full senate of the Israelites, and sent to
the jail to have them brought in.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the court officers who went did not find them in the prison, so
they came back and reported,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "We found the jail securely locked and the guards stationed outside
the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When they heard this report, the captain of the temple guard and
the chief priests were at a loss about them, as to what this would come
to.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then someone came in and reported to them, "The men whom you put in
prison are in the temple area and are teaching the people."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then the captain and the court officers went and brought them in,
but without force, because they were afraid of being stoned by the
people.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When they had brought them in and made them stand before the
Sanhedrin, the high priest questioned them,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` "We gave you strict orders (did we not?) to stop teaching in that
name. Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and want to
bring this man's blood upon us."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` But Peter and the apostles said in reply, "We must obey God rather
than men.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, though you had him killed by
hanging him on a tree.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` God exalted him at his right hand as leader and savior to grant
Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` We are witnesses of these things, as is the holy Spirit that God
has given to those who obey him."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` When they heard this, they became infuriated and wanted to put them
to death.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But a Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named Gamaliel, a teacher of the
law, respected by all the people, stood up, ordered the men to be put
outside for a short time,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and said to them, "Fellow Israelites, be careful what you are about
to do to these men.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Some time ago, Theudas appeared, claiming to be someone important,
and about four hundred men joined him, but he was killed, and all those
who were loyal to him were disbanded and came to nothing.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` After him came Judas the Galilean at the time of the census. He
also drew people after him, but he too perished and all who were loyal
to him were scattered.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` So now I tell you, have nothing to do with these men, and let them
go. For if this endeavor or this activity is of human origin, it will
destroy itself.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` But if it comes from God, you will not be able to destroy them; you
may even find yourselves fighting against God." They were persuaded by
him.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` After recalling the apostles, they had them flogged, ordered them
to stop speaking in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had
been found worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And all day long, both at the temple and in their homes, they did
not stop teaching and proclaiming the Messiah, Jesus.
