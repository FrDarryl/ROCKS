"1" = ''':sup:`1` Samuel said to Saul: "It was I the LORD sent to anoint you king over
his people Israel. Now, therefore, listen to the message of the LORD.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This is what the LORD of hosts has to say: 'I will punish what
Amalek did to Israel when he barred his way as he was coming up from
Egypt.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Go, now, attack Amalek, and deal with him and all that he has under
the ban. Do not spare him, but kill men and women, children and
infants, oxen and sheep, camels and asses.'"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Saul alerted the soldiers, and at Telaim reviewed two hundred
thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Saul went to the city of Amalek, and after setting an ambush in the
wadi,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` warned the Kenites: "Come! Leave Amalek and withdraw, that I may not
have to destroy you with them, for you were kind to the Israelites when
they came up from Egypt." After the Kenites left,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Saul routed Amalek from Havilah to the approaches of Shur, on the
frontier of Egypt.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He took Agag, king of Amalek, alive, but on the rest of the people
he put into effect the ban of destruction by the sword.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He and his troops spared Agag and the best of the fat sheep and
oxen, and the lambs. They refused to carry out the doom on anything
that was worthwhile, dooming only what was worthless and of no account.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then the LORD spoke to Samuel:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "I regret having made Saul king, for he has turned from me and has
not kept my command." At this Samuel grew angry and cried out to the
LORD all night.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Early in the morning he went to meet Saul, but was informed that
Saul had gone to Carmel, where he erected a trophy in his own honor,
and that on his return he had passed on and gone down to Gilgal.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Samuel came to him, Saul greeted him: "The LORD bless you! I
have kept the command of the LORD."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But Samuel asked, "What, then, is the meaning of this bleating of
sheep that comes to my ears, and the lowing of oxen that I hear?"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Saul replied: "They were brought from Amalek. The men spared the
best sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the LORD, your God; but we have
carried out the ban on the rest."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Samuel said to Saul: "Stop! Let me tell you what the LORD said to
me last night." "Speak!" he replied.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Samuel then said: "Though little in your own esteem, are you not
leader of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king of Israel
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and put the sinful
Amalekites under a ban of destruction. Fight against them until you
have exterminated them.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Why then have you disobeyed the LORD? You have pounced on the
spoil, thus displeasing the LORD."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Saul answered Samuel: "I did indeed obey the LORD and fulfill the
mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought back Agag, and I have
destroyed Amalek under the ban.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But from the spoil the men took sheep and oxen, the best of what
had been banned, to sacrifice to the LORD their God in Gilgal."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But Samuel said: "Does the LORD so delight in holocausts and
sacrifices as in obedience to the command of the LORD? Obedience is
better than sacrifice, and submission than the fat of rams.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For a sin like divination is rebellion, and presumption is the
crime of idolatry. Because you have rejected the command of the LORD,
he, too, has rejected you as ruler."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Saul replied to Samuel: "I have sinned, for I have disobeyed the
command of the LORD and your instructions. In my fear of the people, I
did what they said.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now forgive my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the
LORD."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you, because you
rejected the command of the LORD and the LORD rejects you as king of
Israel."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` As Samuel turned to go, Saul seized a loose end of his mantle, and
it tore off.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Samuel said to him: "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel
from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is
better than you.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The Glory of Israel neither retracts nor repents, for he is not man
that he should repent."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But he answered: "I have sinned, yet honor me now before the elders
of my people and before Israel. Return with me that I may worship the
LORD your God."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And so Samuel returned with him, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Afterward Samuel commanded, "Bring Agag, king of Amalek, to me."
Agag came to him struggling and saying, "So it is bitter death!"
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall
your mother be childless among women." Then he cut Agag down before the
LORD in Gilgal.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Samuel departed for Ramah, while Saul went up to his home in Gibeah
of Saul.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Never again, as long as he lived, did Samuel see Saul. Yet he
grieved over Saul, because the LORD regretted having made him king of
Israel.

Notas de rodapé:
15:1-3 - God, through Samuel, commands Saul to completely destroy the
Amalekites, a nation that was an enemy of Israel. This is a clear
command that tests Saul's complete obedience to God (see also
15:9-11 - Saul and the people disobey God by sparing King Agag and the
best of their flocks. This reveals Saul's failure to follow God's
commands completely, resulting in the rejection of his kingship (see
15:22-23 - Samuel confronts Saul, saying that “to obey is better than
sacrifice.” The central lesson here is that God values obedience and
submission to His will more than any external ritual (see also
15:24-26 - Saul confesses his sin, but his motivation is fear of the
people rather than genuine repentance. Samuel reaffirms that God has
rejected him as king, establishing that a leader's heart is more
Corinthians 7:10).
15:32-33 - Samuel executes King Agag, completing the order Saul failed
to carry out. This underscores Samuel's zeal for God's justice and the
