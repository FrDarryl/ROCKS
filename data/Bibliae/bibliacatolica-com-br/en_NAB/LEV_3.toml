against some command of the LORD by doing one of the forbidden things,

"3" = ''':sup:`3` if it is the anointed priest who thus sins and thereby makes the
people also become guilty, he shall present to the LORD a young,
unblemished bull as a sin offering for the sin he committed.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Bringing the bullock to the entrance of the meeting tent, before the
LORD, he shall lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the
LORD.

times before the LORD, toward the veil of the sanctuary.

community shall present a young bull as a sin offering. They shall
bring it before the meeting tent,

bullock. Thus the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will
be forgiven.

pleasing to the LORD. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and
he will be forgiven.

bring an unblemished female.

offering in the place where the holocausts are slaughtered.

Notas de rodap√©:
3:1-5 - The peace offering was a sacrifice of communion, celebrating
peace between God and man. The blood, which represented life, was to be
3:6-11 - As with the burnt offering, the animal offered had to be
without defect. This emphasizes the need for purity and integrity in
3:12-16 - The fat of the animal, considered the best part, was to be
offered to the Lord. This reflects the principle that the best of our
03:17 - God forbids the consumption of fat and blood, indicating the
sanctity of these elements in the sacrificial context. Blood is life,
and life belongs to God and is consecrated to Him (see also
03:16 - The fire on the altar burns continually, consuming the fat of
the peace offering, representing the perpetual commitment to worship
8:3-4).
