"1" = ''':sup:`1` For we know that if our earthly dwelling, a tent, should be
destroyed, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands,
eternal in heaven.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For in this tent we groan, longing to be further clothed with our
heavenly habitation
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` if indeed, when we have taken it off, we shall not be found naked.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For while we are in this tent we groan and are weighed down, because
we do not wish to be unclothed but to be further clothed, so that what
is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now the one who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has
given us the Spirit as a first installment.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So we are always courageous, although we know that while we are at
home in the body we are away from the Lord,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` for we walk by faith, not by sight.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Yet we are courageous, and we would rather leave the body and go
home to the Lord.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Therefore, we aspire to please him, whether we are at home or away.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that
each one may receive recompense, according to what he did in the body,
whether good or evil.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade
others; but we are clearly apparent to God, and I hope we are also
apparent to your consciousness.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an
opportunity to boast of us, so that you may have something to say to
those who boast of external appearance rather than of the heart.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; if we are rational,
it is for you.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For the love of Christ impels us, once we have come to the
conviction that one died for all; therefore, all have died.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He indeed died for all, so that those who live might no longer live
for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Consequently, from now on we regard no one according to the flesh;
even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him
so no longer.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So whoever is in Christ is a new creation: the old things have
passed away; behold, new things have come.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through
Christ and given us the ministry of reconciliation,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` namely, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not
counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message
of reconciliation.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing through
us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin, so that we
might become the righteousness of God in him.
