"2" = ''':sup:`2` It is I, Paul, who am telling you that if you have yourselves
circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Once again I declare to every man who has himself circumcised that
he is bound to observe the entire law.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` You are separated from Christ, you who are trying to be justified by
law; you have fallen from grace.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For through the Spirit, by faith, we await the hope of
righteousness.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts
for anything, but only faith working through love.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Would that those who are upsetting you might also castrate

"13" = ''':sup:`13` For you were called for freedom, brothers. But do not use this
freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; rather, serve one another
through love.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely, "You shall

"16" = ''':sup:`16` I say, then: live by the Spirit and you will certainly not gratify
the desire of the flesh.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit

acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn
you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not

Notas de rodap√©:
5:1 - Freedom in Christ is the key to the Christian life, and Paul
exhorts the Galatians to stand firm in this freedom, without submitting
again to the yoke of slavery. Freedom is central to the gospel (see
5:13-15 - Paul teaches that Christian freedom should be used to serve
others with love. Love is the fulfillment of the law, and true freedom

flesh. Life in the Spirit is a constant struggle against the desires of
the flesh, but it enables us to live according to God's will (see also
5:22-23 - The fruit of the Spirit is a contrast to the works of the
flesh, showing that a life in Christ results in virtues such as love,
peace, and kindness. These fruits reflect the inner transformation
5:24-26 - Paul teaches that those who belong to Christ have crucified
the flesh and now live by the Spirit. True freedom in Christ is a life
