came to him.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` He began to teach them, saying:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
will be satisfied.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of
God.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter
every kind of evil against you (falsely) because of me.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. Thus
they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, with
what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything but to be
thrown out and trampled underfoot.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be
hidden.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Nor do they light a lamp and then put it under a bushel basket; it
is set on a lampstand, where it gives light to all in the house.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Just so, your light must shine before others, that they may see
your good deeds and glorify your heavenly Father.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the
smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the
law, until all things have taken place.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments
and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of
heaven. But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments will be called
greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes
and Pharisees, you will not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` "You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, 'You shall not
kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.'

his brother, 'Raqa,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin, and whoever
says, 'You fool,' will be liable to fiery Gehenna.

your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Settle with your opponent quickly while on the way to court with

the last penny.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'

"28" = ''':sup:`28` But I say to you, everyone who looks at a woman with lust has
already committed adultery with her in his heart.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away.
It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your
whole body thrown into Gehenna.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it
away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have
your whole body go into Gehenna.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill
of divorce.'
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is
unlawful) causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced
woman commits adultery.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` "Again you have heard that it was said to your ancestors, 'Do not
take a false oath, but make good to the Lord all that you vow.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But I say to you, do not swear at all; not by heaven, for it is
God's throne;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it
is the city of the great King.

"36" = ''':sup:`36` Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white
or black.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Let your 'Yes' mean 'Yes,' and your 'No' mean 'No.' Anything more

for a tooth.'

your cloak as well.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Should anyone press you into service for one mile, go with him for
two miles.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Give to the one who asks of you, and do not turn your back on one
who wants to borrow.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and
hate your enemy.'
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who
persecute you,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` that you may be children of your heavenly Father, for he makes his
sun rise on the bad and the good, and causes rain to fall on the just
and the unjust.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` For if you love those who love you, what recompense will you have?
Do not the tax collectors do the same?
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And if you greet your brothers only, what is unusual about that? Do
not the pagans do the same?
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` So be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.
