"1" = ''':sup:`1` This "Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High," "met
Abraham as he returned from his defeat of the kings" and "blessed him."
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Abraham apportioned to him "a tenth of everything." His name
first means righteous king, and he was also "king of Salem," that is,
king of peace.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Without father, mother, or ancestry, without beginning of days or
end of life, thus made to resemble the Son of God, he remains a priest
forever.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` See how great he is to whom the patriarch "Abraham (indeed) gave a
tenth" of his spoils.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The descendants of Levi who receive the office of priesthood have a
commandment according to the law to exact tithes from the people, that
is, from their brothers, although they also have come from the loins of
Abraham.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But he who was not of their ancestry received tithes from Abraham
and blessed him who had received the promises.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Unquestionably, a lesser person is blessed by a greater.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` In the one case, mortal men receive tithes; in the other, a man of
whom it is testified that he lives on.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, was
tithed through Abraham,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` for he was still in his father's loins when Melchizedek met him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` If, then, perfection came through the levitical priesthood, on the
basis of which the people received the law, what need would there still
have been for another priest to arise according to the order of
Melchizedek, and not reckoned according to the order of Aaron?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When there is a change of priesthood, there is necessarily a change
of law as well.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now he of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe,
of which no member ever officiated at the altar.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` It is clear that our Lord arose from Judah, and in regard to that
tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` It is even more obvious if another priest is raised up after the
likeness of Melchizedek,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` who has become so, not by a law expressed in a commandment
concerning physical descent but by the power of a life that cannot be
destroyed.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For it is testified: "You are a priest forever according to the
order of Melchizedek."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` On the one hand, a former commandment is annulled because of its
weakness and uselessness,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` for the law brought nothing to perfection; on the other hand, a
better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` --for others became priests without an oath,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but he with an oath, through the one who said to him: "The Lord has
sworn, and he will not repent: 'You are a priest forever'"--
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` to that same degree has Jesus (also) become the guarantee of an
(even) better covenant.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Those priests were many because they were prevented by death from
remaining in office,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but he, because he remains forever, has a priesthood that does not
pass away.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Therefore, he is always able to save those who approach God through
him, since he lives forever to make intercession for them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` It was fitting that we should have such a high priest:
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` He has no need, as did the high priests, to offer sacrifice day
after day, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he
did that once for all when he offered himself.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` For the law appoints men subject to weakness to be high priests,
but the word of the oath, which was taken after the law, appoints a
son, who has been made perfect forever.
'''
