"1" = ''':sup:`1` While the holy city lived in perfect peace and the laws were
strictly observed because of the piety of the high priest Onias and his
hatred of evil,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` the kings themselves honored the Place and glorified the temple with
the most magnificent gifts.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Thus Seleucus, king of Asia, defrayed from his own revenues all the
expenses necessary for the sacrificial services.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But a certain Simon, of the priestly course of Bilgah, who had been
appointed superintendent of the temple, had a quarrel with the high
priest about the supervision of the city market.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Since he could not prevail against Onias, he went to Apollonius of
Tarsus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and reported to him that the treasury in Jerusalem was so full of
untold riches that the total sum of money was incalculable and out of
all proportion to the cost of the sacrifices, and that it would be
possible to bring it all under the control of the king.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Apollonius had an audience with the king, he informed him about
the riches that had been reported to him. The king chose his minister
Heliodorus and sent him with instructions to expropriate the aforesaid
wealth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So Heliodorus immediately set out on his journey, ostensibly to
visit the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, but in reality to carry
out the king's purpose.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When he arrived in Jerusalem and had been graciously received by the
high priest of the city, he told him about the information that had
been given, and explained the reason for his presence, and he asked if
these things were really true.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The high priest explained that part of the money was a care fund
for widows and orphans,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and a part was the property of Hyrcanus, son of Tobias, a man who
occupied a very high position. Contrary to the calumnies of the impious
Simon, the total amounted to four hundred talents of silver and two
hundred of gold.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He added that it was utterly unthinkable to defraud those who had
placed their trust in the sanctity of the Place and in the sacred
inviolability of a temple venerated all over the world.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But because of the orders he had from the king, Heliodorus said
that in any case the money must be confiscated for the royal treasury.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So on the day he had set he went in to take an inventory of the
funds. There was great distress throughout the city.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Priests prostrated themselves in their priestly robes before the
altar, and loudly begged him in heaven who had given the law about
deposits to keep the deposits safe for those who had made them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Whoever saw the appearance of the high priest was pierced to the
heart, for the changed color of his face manifested the anguish of his
soul.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The terror and bodily trembling that had come over the man clearly
showed those who saw him the pain that lodged in his heart.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` People rushed out of their houses in crowds to make public
supplication, because the Place was in danger of being profaned.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Women, girded with sackcloth below their breasts, filled the
streets; maidens secluded indoors ran together, some to the gates, some
to the walls, others peered through the windows,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` all of them with hands raised toward heaven, making supplication.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` It was pitiful to see the populace variously prostrated in prayer
and the high priest full of dread and anguish.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` While they were imploring the almighty Lord to keep the deposits
safe and secure for those who had placed them in trust,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Heliodorus went on with his plan.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But just as he was approaching the treasury with his bodyguards,
the Lord of spirits who holds all power manifested himself in so
striking a way that those who had been bold enough to follow Heliodorus
were panic-stricken at God's power and fainted away in terror.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` There appeared to them a richly caparisoned horse, mounted by a
dreadful rider. Charging furiously, the horse attacked Heliodorus with
its front hoofs. The rider was seen to be wearing golden armor.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then two other young men, remarkably strong, strikingly beautiful,
and splendidly attired, appeared before him. Standing on each side of
him, they flogged him unceasingly until they had given him innumerable
blows.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Suddenly he fell to the ground, enveloped in great darkness. Men
picked him up and laid him on a stretcher.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The man who a moment before had entered that treasury with a great
retinue and his whole bodyguard was carried away helpless, having
clearly experienced the sovereign power of God.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` While he lay speechless and deprived of all hope of aid, due to an
act of God's power,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` the Jews praised the Lord who had marvelously glorified his holy
Place; and the temple, charged so shortly before with fear and
commotion, was filled with joy and gladness, now that the almighty Lord
had manifested himself.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Soon some of the companions of Heliodorus begged Onias to invoke
the Most High, praying that the life of the man who was about to expire
might be spared.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Fearing that the king might think that Heliodorus had suffered some
foul play at the hands of the Jews, the high priest offered a sacrifice
for the man's recovery.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` While the high priest was offering the sacrifice of atonement, the
same young men in the same clothing again appeared and stood before
Heliodorus. "Be very grateful to the high priest Onias," they told him.
"It is for his sake that the Lord has spared your life.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Since you have been scourged by Heaven, proclaim to all men the
majesty of God's power." When they had said this, they disappeared.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` After Heliodorus had offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made most
solemn vows to him who had spared his life, he bade Onias farewell, and
returned with his soldiers to the king.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Before all men he gave witness to the deeds of the most high God
that he had seen with his own eyes.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` When the king asked Heliodorus who would be a suitable man to be
sent to Jerusalem next, he answered:
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` "If you have an enemy or a plotter against the government, send him
there, and you will receive him back well-flogged, if indeed he
survives at all; for there is certainly some special divine power about
the Place.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` He who has his dwelling in heaven watches over that Place and
protects it, and he strikes down and destroys those who come to harm
it."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` This was how the matter concerning Heliodorus and the preservation
of the treasury turned out.
