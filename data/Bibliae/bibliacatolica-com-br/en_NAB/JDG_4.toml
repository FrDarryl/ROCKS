"1" = ''':sup:`1` After Ehud's death, however, the Israelites again offended the LORD.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So the LORD allowed them to fall into the power of the Canaanite
king, Jabin, who reigned in Hazor. The general of his army was Sisera,
who dwelt in Harosheth-ha-goiim.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But the Israelites cried out to the LORD; for with his nine hundred
iron chariots he sorely oppressed the Israelites for twenty years.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` At this time the prophetess Deborah, wife of Lappidoth, was judging
Israel.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` She used to sit under Deborah's palm tree, situated between Ramah
and Bethel in the mountain region of Ephraim, and there the Israelites
came up to her for judgment.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` She sent and summoned Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh of
Naphtali. "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, commands," she
said to him; "go, march on Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand
Naphtalites and Zebulunites.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I will lead Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, out to you at the
Wadi Kishon, together with his chariots and troops, and will deliver
them into your power."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But Barak answered her, "If you come with me, I will go; if you do
not come with me, I will not go."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "I will certainly go with you," she replied, "but you shall not gain
the glory in the expedition on which you are setting out, for the LORD
will have Sisera fall into the power of a woman." So Deborah joined
Barak and journeyed with him to Kedesh.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men
followed him. Deborah also went up with him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now the Kenite Heber had detached himself from his own people, the
descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent
by the tere-binth of Zaanannim, which was near Kedesh.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It was reported to Sisera that Barak, son of Abinoam, had gone up
to Mount Tabor.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Sisera assembled from Harosheth-ha-goiim at the Wadi Kishon all
nine hundred of his iron chariots and all his forces.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Deborah then said to Barak, "Be off, for this is the day on which
the LORD has delivered Sisera into your power. The LORD marches before
you." So Barak went down Mount Tabor, followed by his ten thousand men.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the LORD put Sisera and all his chariots and all his forces to
rout before Barak. Sisera himself dismounted from his chariot and fled
on foot.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Barak, however, pursued the chariots and the army as far as
Harosheth-ha-goiim. The entire army of Sisera fell beneath the sword,
not even one man surviving.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Sisera, in the meantime, had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, wife
of the Kenite Heber, since Jabin, king of Hazor, and the family of the
Kenite Heber were at peace with one another.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come in, my lord,
come in with me; do not be afraid." So he went into her tent, and she
covered him with a rug.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink. I am
thirsty." But she opened a jug of milk for him to drink, and then
covered him over.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "Stand at the entrance of the tent," he said to her. "If anyone
comes and asks, 'Is there someone here?' say, 'No!'"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Instead Jael, wife of Heber, got a tent peg and took a mallet in
her hand. While Sisera was sound asleep, she stealthily approached him
and drove the peg through his temple down into the ground, so that he
perished in death.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then when Barak came in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to meet
him and said to him, "Come, I will show you the man you seek." So he
went in with her, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg through
his temple.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thus on that day God humbled the Canaanite king, Jabin, before the
Israelites;

"24" = ''':sup:`24` their power weighed ever heavier upon him, till at length they
destroyed the Canaanite king, Jabin.
