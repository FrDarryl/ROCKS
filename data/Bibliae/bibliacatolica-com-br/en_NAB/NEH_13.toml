"1" = ''':sup:`1` At that time, when there was reading from the book of Moses in the
hearing of the people, it was found written there that "no Ammonite or
Moabite may ever be admitted into the assembly of God;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` for they would not succor the Israelites with food and water, but
they hired Balaam to curse them, though our God turned the curse into a
blessing."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When they had heard the law, they separated from Israel every
foreign element.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Before this, the priest Eliashib, who had been placed in charge of
the chambers of the house of our God and who was an associate of
Tobiah,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` had set aside for the latter's use a large chamber in which had
previously been stored the cereal offerings, incense and utensils, the
tithes in grain, wine, and oil allotted to the Levites, singers, and
gatekeepers, and the offerings due the priests.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` During all this time I had not been in Jerusalem, for in the
thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I had gone back to
the king. After due time, however, I asked leave of the king
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and returned to Jerusalem, where I discovered the evil thing that
Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in setting aside for him a chamber in the
courts of the house of God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This displeased me very much, and I had all of Tobiah's household
goods thrown outside the chamber.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then I gave orders to purify the chambers, and I had them replace
there the utensils of the house of God, the cereal offerings, and the
incense.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I learned, too, that the portions due the Levites were no longer
being given, so that the Levites and the singers who should have been
carrying out the services had deserted, each man to his own field.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I took the magistrates to task, demanding, "Why is the house of God
abandoned?" Then I brought the Levites together and had them resume
their stations.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` All Judah once more brought in the tithes of grain, wine, and oil
to the storerooms;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and in charge of the storerooms I appointed the priest Shelemiah,
Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah, one of the Levites, together with Hanan,
son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, as their assistant; for these men were
held to be trustworthy. It was their duty to make the distribution to
their brethren.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Remember this to my credit, O my God! Let not the devotion which I
showed for the house of my God and its services be forgotten!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` In those days I perceived that men in Judah were treading the
winepresses on the sabbath; that they were bringing in sheaves of
grain, loading them on their asses, together with wine, grapes, figs,
and every other kind of burden, and bringing them to Jerusalem on the
sabbath day. I warned them to sell none of these victuals.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` In Jerusalem itself the Tyrians who were resident there were
importing fish and every other kind of merchandise and selling it to
the Judahites on the sabbath.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I took the nobles of Judah to task, demanding of them: "What is
this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Did not your fathers act in this same way, with the result that our
God has brought all this evil upon us and upon this city? Would you add
to the wrath against Israel by once more profaning the sabbath?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When the shadows were falling on the gates of Jerusalem before the
sabbath, I ordered the doors to be closed and forbade them to be
reopened till after the sabbath. I posted some of my own men at the
gates so that no burden might enter on the sabbath day.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The merchants and sellers of various kinds of merchandise spent the
night once or twice outside Jerusalem,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but then I warned them, saying to them: "Why do you spend the night
alongside the wall? If you keep this up, I will lay hands on you!" From
that time on, they did not return on the sabbath.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then I ordered the Levites to purify themselves and to go and watch
the gates, so that the sabbath day might be kept holy. This, too,
remember in my favor, O my God, and have mercy on me in accordance with
your great mercy!
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Also in those days I saw Jews who had married Ashdodite, Ammonite,
or Moabite wives.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Of their children, half spoke Ashdodite, and none of them knew how
to speak Jewish; and so it was in regard to the languages of the
various other peoples.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I took them to task and cursed them; I had some of them beaten and
their hair pulled out; and I adjured them by God: "You shall not marry
your daughters to their sons nor take any of their daughters for your
sons or for yourselves!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Did not Solomon, the king of Israel, sin because of them? Though
among the many nations there was no king like him, and though he was
beloved of his God and God had made him king over all Israel, yet even
he was made to sin by foreign women.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Must it also be heard of you that you have done this same very
great evil, betraying our God by marrying foreign women?"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` One of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was the
son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite! I drove him from my presence.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Remember against them, O my God, how they defiled the priesthood
and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites!
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus I cleansed them of all foreign contamination. I established
the various functions for the priests and Levites, so that each had his
appointed task.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` I also provided for the procurement of wood at stated times and for
the first fruits. Remember this in my favor, O my God!

13:1-3 - The reading from the Book of Moses reveals that the Ammonites
and Moabites were not to be among Israel. The people separated
themselves from foreigners, in obedience to the Law, to preserve the
holiness and identity of God's people (see also Deuteronomy 23:3-5 and
13:4-9 - Nehemiah discovers that Eliashib the priest has allowed
Tobiah, a foreigner, to occupy a chamber in the Temple. Nehemiah
cleanses the Temple and expels Tobiah, reaffirming his zeal for the
2:14-17).
13:10-12 - Nehemiah restores the neglected payment of tithes to the
Levites, ensuring that Temple service is maintained. Faithfulness in
supporting ministers is crucial for continued worship (see also
13:15-18 - Nehemiah rebukes those who were violating the Sabbath by
buying and selling. He takes drastic measures to ensure that the
