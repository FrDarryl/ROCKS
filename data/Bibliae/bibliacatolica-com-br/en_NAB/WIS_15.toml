all with mercy.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` For even if we sin, we are yours, and know your might; but we will
not sin, knowing that we belong to you.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` For to know you well is complete justice, and to know your might is
the root of immortality.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` For neither did the evil creation of men's fancy deceive us, nor the
fruitless labor of painters, A form smeared with varied colors,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` the sight of which arouses yearning in the senseless man, till he
longs for the inanimate form of a dead image.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Lovers of evil things, and worthy of such hopes are they who make
them and long for them and worship them.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` For truly the potter, laboriously working the soft earth, molds for
our service each several article: Both the vessels that serve for clean
purposes and their opposites, all alike; As to what shall be the use of
each vessel of either class the worker in clay is the judge.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And with misspent toil he molds a meaningless god from the selfsame
clay; though he himself shortly before was made from the earth And

"14" = ''':sup:`14` But all quite senseless, and worse than childish in mind, are the
enemies of your people who enslaved them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For they esteemed all the idols of the nations gods, which have no
use of the eyes for vision, nor nostrils to snuff the air, Nor ears to
hear, nor fingers on their hands for feeling; even their feet are
useless to walk with.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For a man made them; one whose spirit has been lent him fashioned
them. For no man succeeds in fashioning a god like himself;

"17" = ''':sup:`17` being mortal, he makes a dead thing with his lawless hands. For he
is better than the things he worships; he at least lives, but never
