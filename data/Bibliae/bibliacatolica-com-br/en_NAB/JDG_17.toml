"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a man in the mountain region of Ephraim whose name was
Micah.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels of silver over
which you pronounced a curse in my hearing when they were taken from
you, are in my possession. It was I who took them; so now I will
restore them to you."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When he restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother,
she took two hundred of them and gave them to the silversmith, who made
of them a carved idol overlaid with silver.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then his mother said, "May the LORD bless my son! I have consecrated
the silver to the LORD as my gift in favor of my son, by making a
carved idol overlaid with silver." It remained in the house of Micah.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thus the layman Micah had a sanctuary. He also made an ephod and
household idols, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
priest.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what he
thought best.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` There was a young Levite who had resided within the tribe of Judah
at Bethlehem of Judah.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` From that city he set out to find another place of residence. On his
journey he came to the house of Micah in the mountain region of
Ephraim.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" He answered him, "I am
a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and am on my way to find some other
place of residence."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` "Stay with me," Micah said to him. "Be father and priest to me, and
I will give you ten silver shekels a year, a set of garments, and your
food."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So the young Levite decided to stay with the man, to whom he became
as one of his own sons.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Micah consecrated the young Levite, who became his priest,
remaining in his house.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Therefore Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me,
since the Levite has become my priest."
