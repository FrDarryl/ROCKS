discipline, That my failings may not be spared, nor the sins of my
heart overlooked;

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Lest my failings increase, and my sins be multiplied; Lest I succumb
to my foes, and my enemy rejoice over me?

without welts, So one who swears continually by the Holy Name will not
remain free from sin.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` A man who often swears heaps up obligations; the scourge will never
be far from his house. If he swears in error, he incurs guilt; if he

reason he cannot be found just, and all his house will suffer
affliction.
'''

fire breaks forth;

he dies;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the man who dishonors his marriage bed and says to himself "Who
can see me? Darkness surrounds me, walls hide me; no one sees me; why
should I fear to sin?" Of the Most High he is not mindful,
'''

of the LORD, ten thousand times brighter than the sun, Observe every
step a man takes and peer into hidden corners.

least expects it, he will be apprehended.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So also with the woman who is unfaithful to her husband and offers
as heir her son by a stranger.

world shall understand, That nothing is better than the fear of the
LORD, nothing more salutary than to obey his commandments.
