purification. He shall be brought to the priest,

"3" = ''':sup:`3` who is to go outside the camp to examine him. If the priest finds
that the sore of leprosy has healed in the leper,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` he shall order the man who is to be purified, to get two live, clean
birds, as well as some cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop.

hyssop, the priest shall dip them all in the blood of the bird that was

leprosy. When he has thus purified him, he shall let the living bird
fly away over the countryside.

guilt offering, along with the log of oil, waving them as a wave
offering before the LORD.

offering and the holocaust are slaughtered; because, like the sin

seven times before the LORD.

man's uncleanness shall the priest slaughter the holocaust

before the LORD. When the priest has thus made atonement for him, the
man will be clean.

shows how persistent and devastating sin and corruption can be in the
spiritual life. Only God can completely restore purity (see also

ensure there was no contamination. This highlights the importance of
13:45-46 - Those declared unclean were to live in isolation,
