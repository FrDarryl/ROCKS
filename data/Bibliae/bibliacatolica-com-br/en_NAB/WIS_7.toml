"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore I prayed, and prudence was given me; I pleaded and the
spirit of Wisdom came to me.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I preferred her to scepter and throne, And deemed riches nothing in
comparison with her,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` nor did I liken any priceless gem to her; Because all gold, in view
of her, is a little sand, and before her, silver is to be accounted
mire.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Beyond health and comeliness I loved her, And I chose to have her
rather than the light, because the splendor of her never yields to
sleep.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Yet all good things together came to me in her company, and
countless riches at her hands;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Simply I learned about her, and ungrudgingly do I share- her riches

treasure win the friendship of God, to whom the gifts they have from
discipline commend them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Now God grant I speak suitably and value these endowments at their
worth: For he is the guide of Wisdom and the director of the wise.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` The beginning and the end and the midpoint of times, the changes in
the sun's course and the variations of the seasons.

thoughts of men, uses of plants and virtues of roots-

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Such things as are hidden I learned and such as are plain;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` for Wisdom, the artificer of all, taught me. For in her is a spirit
intelligent, holy, unique, Manifold, subtle, agile, clear, unstained,
certain, Not baneful, loving the good, keen, unhampered, beneficent,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` kindly, Firm, secure, tranquil, all-powerful, all-seeing, And
pervading all spirits, though they be intelligent, pure and very
subtle.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion, and she penetrates and
pervades all things by reason of her purity.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For she is an aura of the might of God and a pure effusion of the
glory of the Almighty; therefore nought that is sullied enters into
her.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For she is the refulgence of eternal light, the spotless mirror of
the power of God, the image of his goodness.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` And she, who is one, can do all things, and renews everything while
herself perduring; And passing into holy souls from age to age, she
produces friends of God and prophets.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` For there is nought God loves, be it not one who dwells with
Wisdom.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For she is fairer than the sun and surpasses every constellation of
the stars. Compared to light, she takes precedence;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` for that, indeed, night supplants, but wickedness prevails not over
Wisdom.
