"1" = ''':sup:`1` The LORD said to Moses,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Avenge the Israelites on the Midianites, and then you shall be
taken to your people."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So Moses told the people, "Select men from your midst and arm them
for war, to attack the Midianites and execute the LORD'S vengeance on
them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` From each of the tribes of Israel you shall send a band of one
thousand men to war."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` From the clans of Israel, therefore, a thousand men of each tribe
were levied, so that there were twelve thousand men armed for war.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Moses sent them out on the campaign, a thousand from each tribe,
with Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest for the campaign, who had
with him the sacred vessels and the trumpets for sounding the alarm.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` They waged war against the Midianites, as the LORD had commanded
Moses, and killed every male among them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Besides those slain in battle, they killed the five Midianite kings:
Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba; and they also executed Balaam, son of
Beor, with the sword.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But the Israelites kept the women of the Midianites with their
little ones as captives, and all their herds and flocks and wealth as
spoil,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` while they set on fire all the towns where they had settled and all
their encampments.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then they took all the booty, with the people and beasts they had
captured, and brought the captives, together with the spoils and booty,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` to Moses and the priest Eleazar and to the Israelite community at
their camp on the plains of Moab, along the Jericho stretch of the
Jordan.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Moses and the priest Eleazar, with all the princes of the
community, went outside the camp to meet them,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Moses became angry with the officers of the army, the clan and
company commanders, who were returning from combat.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "So you have spared all the women!" he exclaimed.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Why, they are the very ones who on Balaam's advice prompted the
unfaithfulness of the Israelites toward the LORD in the Peor affair,
which began the slaughter of the LORD'S community.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Slay, therefore, every male child and every woman who has had
intercourse with a man.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But you may spare and keep for yourselves all girls who had no
intercourse with a man.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "Moreover, you shall stay outside the camp for seven days, and
those of you who have slain anyone or touched anyone slain in battle
shall purify yourselves on the third and on the seventh day. This
applies both to you and to your captives.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` You shall also purify every article of cloth, leather, goats' hair,
or wood."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Eleazar the priest told the soldiers who had returned from combat:
"This is what the law, as prescribed by the LORD to Moses, ordains:
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Whatever can stand fire, such as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin
and lead,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` you shall put into the fire, that it may become clean; however, it
must also be purified with lustral water. But whatever cannot stand
fire you shall put into the water.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes, and then you will
again be clean. After that you may enter the camp."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The LORD said to Moses:
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` "With the help of the priest Eleazar and of the heads of the
ancestral houses, count up all the human captives and the beasts that
have been taken;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` then divide them evenly, giving half to those who took active part
in the war by going out to combat, and half to the rest of the
community.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` You shall levy a tax for the LORD on the warriors who went out to
combat: one out of every five hundred persons, oxen, asses and sheep
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` in their half of the spoil you shall turn over to the priest
Eleazar as a contribution to the LORD.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` From the Israelites' half you shall take one out of every fifty
persons, and the same from the different beasts, oxen, asses and sheep,
and give them to the Levites, who have charge of the LORD'S Dwelling."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So Moses and the priest Eleazar did this, as the LORD had commanded
Moses.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` This booty, what was left of the loot which the soldiers had taken,
amounted to six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` seventy-two thousand oxen,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` sixty-one thousand asses,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and thirty-two thousand girls who were still virgins.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` The half that fell to those who had gone out to combat was: three
hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` of which six hundred and seventy-five fell as tax to the LORD;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` thirty-six thousand oxen, of which seventy-two fell as tax to the
LORD;
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` thirty thousand five hundred asses, of which sixty-one fell as tax
to the LORD;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` and sixteen thousand persons, of whom thirty-two fell as tax to the
LORD.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` The taxes contributed to the LORD, Moses gave to the priest
Eleazar, as the LORD had commanded him.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` The half for the other Israelites, which fell to the community when
Moses had taken it from the soldiers, was:
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` thirty-six thousand oxen,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` thirty thousand five hundred asses,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and sixteen thousand persons.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` From this, the Israelites' share, Moses, as the LORD had ordered,
took one out of every fifty, both of persons and of beasts, and gave
them to the Levites, who had charge of the LORD'S Dwelling.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Then the officers who had been clan and company commanders of the
army came up to Moses
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` and said to him, "Your servants have counted up the soldiers under
our command, and not one is missing.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` So, to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD, each of us
will bring as an offering to the LORD some gold article he has picked
up, such as an anklet, a bracelet, a ring, an earring, or a necklace."
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Moses and the priest Eleazar accepted this gold from them, all of
it in well-wrought articles.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` The gold that they gave as a contribution to the LORD amounted in
all to sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. This was from
the clan and company commanders;
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` what the common soldiers had looted each one kept for himself.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Moses, then, and the priest Eleazar accepted the gold from the clan
and company commanders, and put it in the meeting tent as a memorial
for the Israelites before the LORD.

Notas de rodapé:
31:1-6 - God commands Moses to avenge Israel against the Midianites,
marking Moses' last great act of leadership. Just war, under divine
guidance, is intended to eliminate the influence of sin and idolatry
31:7-12 - The victory over the Midianites demonstrates God's power to
protect and avenge His people. The capture of their possessions and
prisoners reinforces the concept of divine judgment on those who oppose
31:13-18 - Moses is angry because the Israelites spared the Midianite
women, who had led Israel into sin at Peor. This incident shows the
importance of cleansing and holiness among God’s people (see also
31:19-24 - The captured soldiers and goods are purified according to
God's instructions, symbolizing the importance of ritual purity and
separation from sin before returning to the community of Israel (see
31:25-30 - The division of the spoils between the soldiers and the
people of Israel reflects God's justice and fairness in rewarding those
on the front lines of battle and those supporting from behind. This
