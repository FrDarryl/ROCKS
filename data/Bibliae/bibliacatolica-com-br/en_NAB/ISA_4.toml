prophecy points to the coming of the Messiah and the spiritual
restoration of Israel, where true beauty is found in God (see also
4:3-4 - God will cleanse Jerusalem from sins, removing all impurity.
This renewal symbolizes the holiness God desires for His people and the

cloud and a flame. This imagery recalls God's protection in the
