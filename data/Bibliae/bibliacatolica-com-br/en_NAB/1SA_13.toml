"1" = ''':sup:`1` (Saul was. . . years old when he became king and he reigned. . .
(two) years over Israel.)
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Saul chose three thousand men of Israel, of whom two thousand
remained with him in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and
one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest
of the people back to their tents.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now Jonathan overcame the Philistine garrison which was in Gibeah,
and the Philistines got word of it. Then Saul sounded the horn
throughout the land, with a proclamation, "Let the Hebrews hear!"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Thus all Israel learned that Saul had overcome the garrison of the
Philistines and that Israel had brought disgrace upon the Philistines;
and the soldiers were called up to Saul in Gilgal.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The Philistines also assembled for battle, with three thousand
chariots, six thousand horsemen, and foot soldiers as numerous as the
sands of the seashore. Moving up against Israel, they encamped in
Michmash, east of Beth-aven.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Some Israelites, aware of the danger and of the difficult situation,
hid themselves in caves, in thickets, among rocks, in caverns, and in
cisterns,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and other Hebrews passed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and
Gilead. Saul, however, held out at Gilgal, although all his followers
were seized with fear.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He waited seven days--the time Samuel had determined. When Samuel
did not arrive at Gilgal, the men began to slip away from Saul.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He then said, "Bring me the holocaust and peace offerings," and he
offered up the holocaust.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He had just finished this offering when Samuel arrived. Saul went
out to greet him,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and Samuel asked him, "What have you done?" Saul replied: "When I
saw that the men were slipping away from me, since you had not come by
the specified time, and with the Philistines assembled at Michmash,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I said to myself, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at
Gilgal, and I have not yet sought the LORD'S blessing.' So in my
anxiety I offered up the holocaust."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Samuel's response was: "You have been foolish! Had you kept the
command the LORD your God gave you, the LORD would now establish your
kingship in Israel as lasting;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` but as things are, your kingdom shall not endure. The LORD has
sought out a man after his own heart and has appointed him commander of
his people, because you broke the LORD'S command."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went his own way; but the rest
of the people went up after Saul to meet the soldiers, going from
Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul then numbered the soldiers he had
with him, who were about six hundred.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Saul, his son Jonathan, and the soldiers they had with them were
now occupying Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines were encamped at
Michmash.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Meanwhile, raiders left the camp of the Philistines in three bands.
One band took the Ophrah road toward the district of Shual;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` another turned in the direction of Beth-horon; and the third took
the road for Geba that overlooks the Valley of the Hyenas toward the
desert.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Not a single smith was to be found in the whole land of Israel, for
the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or
spears."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` All Israel, therefore, had to go down to the Philistines to sharpen
their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The price for the plowshares and mattocks was two-thirds of a
shekel, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting
the ox-goads.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And so on the day of battle neither sword nor spear could be found
in the possession of any of the soldiers with Saul or Jonathan. Only
Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` An outpost of the Philistines had pushed forward to the pass of
Michmash.

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-4 - Saul rallies the army of Israel to fight the Philistines, but
when he attacks an enemy garrison, he provokes a fierce retaliation.
This event demonstrates the growing threat of the Philistines and the
13:5-7 - The Philistine army gathers in large numbers, frightening the
Israelites, who begin to hide in fear. This reflects Israel's lack of
faith in God's power in the face of adverse circumstances (see also
13:8-10 - Saul, impatient with Samuel's delay, offers the sacrifice
himself. His disobedience reveals his lack of trust in God and the

has already chosen another man to be king. This prophecy anticipates
