Notas de rodap√©:
24:1-4 - During the reign of Jehoiakim, the Babylonian king
Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah. Manasseh's sins continued to take their
toll on Judah, resulting in its subjugation to the Babylonian empire.
This reflected God's justice in punishing persistent idolatry (see also
24:10-12 - Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem, and Jehoiakim surrenders.
He is taken captive to Babylon, marking the beginning of Judah's
downfall. This event fulfills the prophets' warnings about impending
24:13-14 - The Temple and palace treasures are plundered, and many of

24:15-16 - King Jehoiachin and the nobles of Judah are exiled, leaving

warriors signals the humiliation of Judah and the fulfillment of the
24:18-20 - Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, does what is evil in the
