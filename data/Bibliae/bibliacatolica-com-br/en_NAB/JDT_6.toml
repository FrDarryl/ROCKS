"1" = ''':sup:`1` When the noise of the crowd surrounding the council had subsided,
Holofernes, commander-in-chief of the Assyrian army, said to Achior, in
the presence of the whole throng of coastland peoples, of the Moabites,
and of the Ammonite mercenaries:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Who are you, Achior, to prophesy among us as you have done today,
and to tell us not to fight against the Israelites because their God
protects them? What god is there beside Nebuchadnezzar? He will send
his force and destroy them from the face of the earth. Their God will
not save them;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` but we, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar, will strike them down as one
man, for they will be unable to withstand the force of our cavalry.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` We will overwhelm them with it, and the mountains shall be drunk
with their blood, and their plains filled with their corpses. Not a
trace of them shall survive our attack: they shall utterly perish, says
King Nebuchadnezzar, lord of all the earth; for he has spoken, and his
words shall not remain unfulfilled.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As for you, Achior, you Ammonite mercenary, for saying these things
in a moment of perversity you shall not see my face after today, until
I have taken revenge on this race of people from Egypt.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then at my return, the sword of my army or the spear of my servants
will pierce your sides, and you shall fall among their slain.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` My servants will now conduct you to the mountain region, and leave
you at one of the towns along the ascent.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` You shall not die till you are destroyed together with them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` If you still cherish the hope that they will not be taken, then
there is no need for you to be downcast. I have spoken, and my words
shall not prove false in any respect."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Holofernes ordered the servants who were standing by in his
tent to seize Achior, conduct him to Bethulia, and hand him over to the
Israelites.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So the servants took him in custody and brought him out of the camp
into the plain. From there they led him into the mountain region till
they reached the springs below Bethulia.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When the men of the city saw them, they seized their weapons and
ran out of the city to the crest of the ridge; and all the slingers
blocked the ascent of Holofernes' servants by hurling stones upon them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So they took cover below the mountain, where they bound Achior and
left him lying at the foot of the mountain; then they returned to their
lord.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The Israelites came down to him from their city, loosed him, and
brought him into Bethulia. They haled him before the rulers of the
city,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` who in those days were Uzziah, son of Micah of the tribe of Simeon,
Chabris, son of Gothoniel, and Charmis, son of Melchiel.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` They then convened all the elders of the city; and all their young
men, as well as the women, gathered in haste at the place of assembly.
They placed Achior in the center of the throng, and Uzziah questioned
him about what had happened.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He replied by giving them an account of what was said in the
council of Holofernes, and of all his own words among the Assyrian
officers, and of all the boasting threats of Holofernes against the
house of Israel.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` At this the people fell prostrate and worshiped God; and they cried
out:
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "Lord, God of heaven, behold their arrogance! Have pity on the
lowliness of our people, and look with favor this day on those who are
consecrated to you."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then they reassured Achior and praised him highly.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Uzziah brought him from the assembly to his home, where he gave a
banquet for the elders. That whole night they called upon the God of
Israel for help.
