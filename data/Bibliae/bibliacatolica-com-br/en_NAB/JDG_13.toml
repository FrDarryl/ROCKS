'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But his wife pointed out to him, "If the LORD had meant to kill us,
he would not have accepted a holocaust and cereal offering from our
hands! Nor would he have let us see all this just now, or hear what we
have heard."

Samson's upbringing and education. The importance of obedience to God's
commandments in the formation of leaders is emphasized, showing that
spiritual education is crucial to the fulfillment of God's purpose (see
