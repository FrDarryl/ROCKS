"2" = ''':sup:`2` But his sobs were so loud that the Egyptians heard him, and so the
news reached Pharaoh's palace.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` "I am Joseph," he said to his brothers. "Is my father still in good
health?" But his brothers could give him no answer, so dumbfounded were
they at him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` "Come closer to me," he told his brothers. When they had done so, he
said: "I am your brother Joseph, whom you once sold into Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But now do not be distressed, and do not reproach yourselves for
having sold me here. It was really for the sake of saving lives that
God sent me here ahead of you.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For two years now the famine has been in the land, and for five more
years tillage will yield no harvest.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` God, therefore, sent me on ahead of you to ensure for you a remnant
on earth and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So it was not really you but God who had me come here; and he has
made of me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his household, and ruler
over the whole land of Egypt.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "Hurry back, then, to my father and tell him: 'Thus says your son
Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come to me without delay.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Since five years of famine still lie ahead, I will provide for you
there, so that you and your family and all that are yours may not
suffer want.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Surely, you can see for yourselves, and Benjamin can see for
himself, that it is I, Joseph, who am speaking to you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Tell my father all about my high position in Egypt and what you
have seen. But hurry and bring my father down here."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thereupon he flung himself on the neck of his brother Benjamin and
wept, and Benjamin wept in his arms.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Joseph then kissed all his brothers, crying over each of them; and
only then were his brothers able to talk with him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had
come, Pharaoh and his courtiers were pleased.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Pharaoh told Joseph: "Say to your brothers: 'This is what you
shall do: Load up your animals and go without delay to the land of
Canaan.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` There get your father and your families, and then come back here to
me; I will assign you the best land in Egypt, where you will live off
the fat of the land.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Instruct them further: 'Do this. Take wagons from the land of Egypt
for your children and your wives and to transport your father on your
way back here.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Do not be concerned about your belongings, for the best in the
whole land of Egypt shall be yours.'"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The sons of Israel acted accordingly. Joseph gave them the wagons,
as Pharaoh had ordered, and he supplied them with provisions for the
journey.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He also gave to each of them fresh clothing, but to Benjamin he
gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of garments.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Moreover, what he sent to his father was ten jackasses loaded with
the finest products of Egypt and ten jennies loaded with grain and
bread and other provisions for his journey.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As he sent his brothers on their way, he told them, "Let there be
no recriminations on the way."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So they left Egypt and made their way to their father Jacob in the
land of Canaan.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When they told him, "Joseph is still alive--in fact, it is he who
is ruler of all the land of Egypt," he was dumbfounded; he could not
believe them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But when they recounted to him all that Joseph had told them, and
when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent for his transport, the
spirit of their father Jacob revived.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` "It is enough," said Israel. "My son Joseph is still alive! I must
go and see him before I die."
