"1" = ''':sup:`1` After a lapse of two years, Pharaoh had a dream. He saw himself
standing by the Nile,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` when up out of the Nile came seven cows, handsome and fat; they
grazed in the reed grass.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Behind them seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the
Nile; and standing on the bank of the Nile beside the others,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the ugly, gaunt cows ate up the seven handsome, fat cows. Then
Pharaoh woke up.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He fell asleep again and had another dream. He saw seven ears of
grain, fat and healthy, growing on a single stalk.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, thin and blasted by the
east wind;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven fat, healthy ears.
Then Pharaoh woke up, to find it was only a dream.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Next morning his spirit was agitated. So he summoned all the
magicians and sages of Egypt and recounted his dreams to them; but no
one could interpret his dreams for him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then the chief cupbearer spoke up and said to Pharaoh: "On this
occasion I am reminded of my negligence.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Once, when Pharaoh was angry, he put me and the chief baker in
custody in the house of the chief steward.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Later, we both had dreams on the same night, and each of our dreams
had its own meaning.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` There with us was a Hebrew youth, a slave of the chief steward; and
when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us and explained
for each of us the meaning of his dream.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And it turned out just as he had told us: I was restored to my
post, but the other man was impaled."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Pharaoh therefore had Joseph summoned, and they hurriedly brought
him from the dungeon. After he shaved and changed his clothes, he came
into Pharaoh's presence.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Pharaoh then said to him: "I had certain dreams that no one can
interpret. But I hear it said of you that the moment you are told a
dream you can interpret it."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "It is not I," Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "but God who will give
Pharaoh the right answer."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: "In my dream, I was standing on the
bank of the Nile,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` when up from the Nile came seven cows, fat and well-formed; they
grazed in the reed grass.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Behind them came seven other cows, scrawny, most ill-formed and
gaunt. Never have I seen such ugly specimens as these in all the land
of Egypt!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The gaunt, ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But when they had consumed them, no one could tell that they had
done so, because they looked as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` In another dream I saw seven ears of grain, fat and healthy,
growing on a single stalk.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, shriveled and thin and
blasted by the east wind;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven healthy ears. I have
spoken to the magicians, but none of them can give me an explanation."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Joseph said to Pharaoh: "Both of Pharaoh's dreams have the same
meaning. God has thus foretold to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The seven healthy cows are seven years, and the seven healthy ears
are seven years--the same in each dream.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So also, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are
seven years, as are the seven thin, wind-blasted ears; they are seven
years of famine.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` It is just as I told Pharaoh: God has revealed to Pharaoh what he
is about to do.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Seven years of great abundance are now coming throughout the land
of Egypt;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` but these will be followed by seven years of famine, when all the
abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. When the famine has
ravaged the land,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` no trace of the abundance will be found in the land because of the
famine that follows it--so utterly severe will that famine be.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` That Pharaoh had the same dream twice means that the matter has
been reaffirmed by God and that God will soon bring it about.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` "Therefore, let Pharaoh seek out a wise and discerning man and put
him in charge of the land of Egypt.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Pharaoh should also take action to appoint overseers, so as to
regiment the land during the seven years of abundance.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` They should husband all the food of the coming good years,
collecting the grain under Pharaoh's authority, to be stored in the
towns for food.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` This food will serve as a reserve for the country against the seven
years of famine that are to follow in the land of Egypt, so that the
land may not perish in the famine."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` This advice pleased Pharaoh and all his officials.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` "Could we find another like him," Pharaoh asked his officials, "a
man so endowed with the spirit of God?"
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So Pharaoh said to Joseph: "Since God has made all this known to
you, no one can be as wise and discerning as you are.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people shall dart
at your command. Only in respect to the throne shall I outrank you.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Herewith," Pharaoh told Joseph, "I place you in charge of the whole
land of Egypt."
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` With that, Pharaoh took off his signet ring and put it on Joseph's
finger. He had him dressed in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain
about his neck.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He then had him ride in the chariot of his vizier, and they shouted
"Abrek!" before him. Thus was Joseph installed over the whole land of
Egypt.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` "I, Pharaoh, proclaim," he told Joseph, "that without your approval
no one shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Pharaoh also bestowed the name of Zaphnath-paneah on Joseph, and he
gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of
Heliopolis.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh,
king of Egypt. After Joseph left Pharaoh's presence, he traveled
throughout the land of Egypt.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` During the seven years of plenty, when the land produced abundant
crops,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` he husbanded all the food of these years of plenty that the land of
Egypt was enjoying and stored it in the towns, placing in each town the
crops of the fields around it.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Joseph garnered grain in quantities like the sands of the sea, so
vast that at last he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond measure.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Before the famine years set in, Joseph became the father of two
sons, borne to him by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of
Heliopolis.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` He named his first-born Manasseh, meaning, "God has made me forget
entirely the sufferings I endured at the hands of my family";
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` and the second he named Ephraim, meaning, "God has made me fruitful
in the land of my affliction."
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` When the seven years of abundance enjoyed by the land of Egypt came
to an end,
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` the seven years of famine set in, just as Joseph had predicted.
Although there was famine in all the other countries, food was
available throughout the land of Egypt.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` When hunger came to be felt throughout the land of Egypt and the
people cried to Pharaoh for bread, Pharaoh directed all the Egyptians
to go to Joseph and do whatever he told them.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` When the famine had spread throughout the land, Joseph opened all
the cities that had grain and rationed it to the Egyptians, since the
famine had gripped the land of Egypt.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` In fact, all the world came to Joseph to obtain rations of grain,
for famine had gripped the whole world.
