"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now (even) the first covenant had regulations for worship and an
earthly sanctuary.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For a tabernacle was constructed, the outer one, in which were the
lampstand, the table, and the bread of offering; this is called the
Holy Place.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Behind the second veil was the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` in which were the gold altar of incense and the ark of the covenant
entirely covered with gold. In it were the gold jar containing the
manna, the staff of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tablets of the
covenant.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of
expiation. Now is not the time to speak of these in detail.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` With these arrangements for worship, the priests, in performing
their service, go into the outer tabernacle repeatedly,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` but the high priest alone goes into the inner one once a year, not
without blood that he offers for himself and for the sins of the
people.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` In this way the holy Spirit shows that the way into the sanctuary
had not yet been revealed while the outer tabernacle still had its
place.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` This is a symbol of the present time, in which gifts and sacrifices
are offered that cannot perfect the worshiper in conscience
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` but only in matters of food and drink and various ritual washings:
regulations concerning the flesh, imposed until the time of the new
order.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that have
come to be, passing through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not
made by hands, that is, not belonging to this creation,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` he entered once for all into the sanctuary, not with the blood of
goats and calves but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal
redemption.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of a
heifer's ashes can sanctify those who are defiled so that their flesh
is cleansed,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from
dead works to worship the living God.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For this reason he is mediator of a new covenant: since a death has
taken place for deliverance from transgressions under the first
covenant, those who are called may receive the promised eternal
inheritance.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now where there is a will, the death of the testator must be
established.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For a will takes effect only at death; it has no force while the
testator is alive.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thus not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When every commandment had been proclaimed by Moses to all the
people according to the law, he took the blood of calves (and goats),
together with water and crimson wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the
book itself and all the people,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` saying, "This is 'the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined
upon you.'"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` In the same way, he sprinkled also the tabernacle and all the
vessels of worship with blood.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` According to the law almost everything is purified by blood, and
without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Therefore, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things
to be purified by these rites, but the heavenly things themselves by
better sacrifices than these.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a copy of
the true one, but heaven itself, that he might now appear before God on
our behalf.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Not that he might offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest
enters each year into the sanctuary with blood that is not his own;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` if that were so, he would have had to suffer repeatedly from the
foundation of the world. But now once for all he has appeared at the
end of the ages to take away sin by his sacrifice.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Just as it is appointed that human beings die once, and after this
the judgment,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` so also Christ, offered once to take away the sins of many, will
appear a second time, not to take away sin but to bring salvation to
those who eagerly await him.

9:1-5 - The author of Hebrews describes the tabernacle and sacred
furnishings, highlighting the importance of ritual and worship in the
Old Testament. This symbolic system prepares the way for Christ's
9:11-12 - Christ, as High Priest, enters the Most Holy Place with His
own blood, offering an eternal sacrifice. His work replaces the
temporary and incomplete sacrifices of the old covenant (see also
09:15 - Jesus, as Mediator of a new covenant, brings eternal
redemption, guaranteeing the promise of salvation to those called. His
death is the price of purification from transgression (see also

3:25).

sanctuary, but in the true one, in the presence of God. His
intercession continues, offering us direct access to the Father (see
