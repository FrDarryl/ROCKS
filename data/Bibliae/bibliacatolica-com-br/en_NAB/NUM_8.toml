'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Give Aaron this command: When you set up the seven lamps, have them
throw their light toward the front of the lampstand."

branches, according to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` "Take the Levites from among the Israelites and purify them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` This is what you shall do to them to purify them. Sprinkle them with
the water of remission; then have them shave their whole bodies and
wash their clothes, and so purify themselves.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They shall take a young bull, along with its cereal offering of fine
flour mixed with oil; you shall take another young bull for a sin
offering.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then have the Levites come forward in front of the meeting tent,
where you shall assemble also the whole community of the Israelites.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` While the Levites are present before the LORD, the Israelites shall
lay their hands upon them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Let Aaron then offer the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering
from the Israelites, thus devoting them to the service of the LORD.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The Levites in turn shall lay their hands on the heads of the
bullocks, which shall then be immolated, the one as a sin offering and
the other as a holocaust to the LORD, in atonement for the Levites.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Thus, then, shall you have the Levites stand before Aaron and his
sons, to be offered as a wave offering to the LORD;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and thus shall you set aside the Levites from the rest of the
Israelites, that they may be mine.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "Only then shall the Levites enter upon their service in the
meeting tent. You shall purify them and offer them as a wave offering;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` because they, among the Israelites, are strictly dedicated to me; I
have taken them for myself in place of every first-born that opens the
womb among the Israelites.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Indeed, all the first-born among the Israelites, both of man and of
beast, belong to me; I consecrated them to myself on the day I slew all
the first-born in the land of Egypt.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But in place of all the first-born Israelites I have taken the
Levites;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and I have given these dedicated Israelites to Aaron and his sons
to discharge the duties of the Israelites in the meeting tent and to
make atonement for them, so that no plague may strike among the
Israelites should they come near the sanctuary."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Thus, then, did Moses and Aaron and the whole community of the
Israelites deal with the Levites, carrying out exactly the command
which the LORD had given Moses concerning them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When the Levites had cleansed themselves of sin and washed their
clothes, Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the LORD, and
made atonement for them to purify them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Only then did they enter upon their service in the meeting tent
under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. The command which the LORD
had given Moses concerning the Levites was carried out.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The LORD said to Moses:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "This is the rule for the Levites. Each from his twenty-fifth year
onward shall perform the required service in the meeting tent.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When he is fifty years old, he shall retire from the required
service and work no longer.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` His service with his fellow Levites shall consist in sharing their
responsibilities in the meeting tent, but he shall not do the work.
This, then, is how you are to regulate the duties of the Levites."
