the sky by its four corners, and it came to me.

of the earth, the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the birds of the sky.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` I also heard a voice say to me, 'Get up, Peter. Slaughter and eat.'

"8" = ''':sup:`8` But I said, 'Certainly not, sir, because nothing profane or unclean

"9" = ''':sup:`9` But a second time a voice from heaven answered, 'What God has made
clean, you are not to call profane.'

"10" = ''':sup:`10` This happened three times, and then everything was drawn up again
into the sky.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Just then three men appeared at the house where we were, who had
been sent to me from Caesarea.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` The Spirit told me to accompany them without discriminating. These
six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` He related to us how he had seen (the) angel standing in his house,

"14" = ''':sup:`14` who will speak words to you by which you and all your household

'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` As I began to speak, the holy Spirit fell upon them as it had upon
us at the beginning,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, 'John
baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy Spirit.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If then God gave them the same gift he gave to us when we came to
believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to hinder God?"

"18" = ''':sup:`18` When they heard this, they stopped objecting and glorified God,
saying, "God has then granted life-giving repentance to the Gentiles
too."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose
because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch,
preaching the word to no one but Jews.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` There were some Cypriots and Cyrenians among them, however, who

"23" = ''':sup:`23` When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and
encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord in firmness of
heart,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` for he was a good man, filled with the holy Spirit and faith. And a
large number of people was added to the Lord.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then he went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole
year they met with the church and taught a large number of people, and
it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and one of them named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit
that there would be a severe famine all over the world, and it happened
under Claudius.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` So the disciples determined that, according to ability, each should

Saul.
