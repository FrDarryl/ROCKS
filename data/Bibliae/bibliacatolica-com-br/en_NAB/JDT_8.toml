Oziel, son of Elkiah, son of Ananias, son of Gideon, son of Raphain,
son of Ahitob, son of Elijah, son of Hilkiah, son of Eliab, son of
Nathanael, son of Salamiel, son of Sarasadai, son of Simeon, son of
Israel, heard of this.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Her husband, Manasseh, of her own tribe and clan, had died at the
time of the barley harvest.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` While he was in the field supervising those who bound the sheaves,
he suffered sunstroke; and he died of this illness in Bethulia, his
native city. He was buried with his forefathers in the field between
Dothan and Balamon.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The widowed Judith remained three years and four months at home,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` where she set up a tent for herself on the roof of her house. She
put sackcloth about her loins and wore widow's weeds.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` She fasted all the days of her widowhood, except sabbath eves and
sabbaths, new moon eves and new moons, feastdays and holidays of the
house of Israel.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` She was beautifully formed and lovely to behold. Her husband,
Manasseh, had left her gold and silver, servants and maids, livestock
and fields, which she was maintaining.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` No one had a bad word to say about her, for she was a very
God-fearing woman.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When Judith, therefore, heard of the harsh words which the people,
discouraged by their lack of water, had spoken against their ruler, and
of all that Uzziah had said to them in reply, swearing that he would
hand over the city to the Assyrians at the end of five days,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` she sent the maid who was in charge of all her things to ask
Uzziah, Chabris, and Charmis, the elders of the city, to visit her.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When they came, she said to them: "Listen to me, you rulers of the
people of Bethulia. What you said to the people today is not proper.
When you promised to hand over the city to our enemies at the end of
five days unless within that time the Lord comes to our aid, you
interposed between God and yourselves this oath which you took.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Who are you, then, that you should have put God to the test this
day, setting yourselves in the place of God in human affairs?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is the Lord Almighty for whom you are laying down conditions;
will you never understand anything?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart or grasp the
workings of the human mind; how then can you fathom God, who has made
all these things, discern his mind, and understand his plan? "No, my
brothers, do not anger the Lord our God.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For if he does not wish to come to our aid within the five days, he
has it equally within his power to protect us at such time as he
pleases, or to destroy us in the face of our enemies.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` It is not for you to make the Lord our God give surety for his
plans. "God is not man that he should be moved by threats, nor human,
that he may be given an ultimatum.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` "So while we wait for the salvation that comes from him, let us
call upon him to help us, and he will hear our cry if it is his good
pleasure.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For there has not risen among us in recent generations, nor does
there exist today, any tribe, or clan, or town, or city of ours that
worships gods made by hands, as happened in former days.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` It was for such conduct that our forefathers were handed over to
the sword and to pillage, and fell with great destruction before our
enemies.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But since we acknowledge no other god but the Lord, we hope that he
will not disdain us or any of our people.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` If we are taken, all Judea will fall, our sanctuary will be
plundered, and God will make us pay for its profanation with our life's
blood.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For the slaughter of our kinsmen, for the taking of exiles from the
land, and for the devastation of our inheritance, he will lay the guilt
on our heads. Wherever we shall be enslaved among the nations, we shall
be a mockery and a reproach in the eyes of our masters.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Our enslavement will not be turned to our benefit, but the Lord our
God, will maintain it to our disgrace.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "Therefore, my brothers, let us set an example for our kinsmen.
Their lives depend on us, and the defense of the sanctuary, the temple,
and the altar rests with us.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Besides all this, we should be grateful to the Lord our God, for
putting us to the test, as he did our forefathers.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Recall how he dealt with Abraham, and how he tried Isaac, and all
that happened to Jacob in Syrian Mesopotamia while he was tending the
flocks of Laban, his mother's brother.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Not for vengeance did the Lord put them in the crucible to try
their hearts, nor has he done so with us. It is by way of admonition
that he chastises those who are close to him."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then Uzziah said to her: "All that you have said was spoken with
good sense, and no one can gainsay your words.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Not today only is your wisdom made evident, but from your earliest
years all the people have recognized your prudence, which corresponds
to the worthy dispositions of your heart.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The people, however, were so tortured with thirst that they forced
us to speak to them as we did, and to bind ourselves by an oath that we
cannot break.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But now, God-fearing woman that you are, pray for us that the Lord
may send rain to fill up our cisterns, lest we be weakened still
further."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then Judith said to them: "Listen to me! I will do something that
will go down from generation to generation among the descendants of our
race.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Stand at the gate tonight to let me pass through with my maid; and
within the days you have specified before you will surrender the city
to our enemies, the Lord will rescue Israel by my hand.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` You must not inquire into what I am doing, for I will not tell you
until my plan has been accomplished."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Uzziah and the rulers said to her, "Go in peace, and may the Lord
God go before you to take vengeance upon our enemies!"
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then they withdrew from the tent and returned to their posts.
