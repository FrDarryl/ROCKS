"1" = ''':sup:`1` These are the names of the sons of Israel who, accompanied by their
households, migrated with Jacob into Egypt:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The total number of the direct descendants of Jacob was seventy.
Joseph was already in Egypt.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Now Joseph and all his brothers and that whole generation died.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific. They became so
numerous and strong that the land was filled with them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then a new king, who knew nothing of Joseph , came to power in
Egypt.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He said to his subjects, "Look how numerous and powerful the
Israelite people are growing, more so than we ourselves!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Come, let us deal shrewdly with them to stop their increase;
otherwise, in time of war they too may join our enemies to fight
against us, and so leave our country."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Accordingly, taskmasters were set over the Israelites to oppress
them with forced labor. Thus they had to build for Pharaoh the supply
cities of Pithom and Raamses.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Yet the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and
spread. The Egyptians, then, dreaded the Israelites
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and reduced them to cruel slavery,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` making life bitter for them with hard work in mortar and brick and
all kinds of field work--the whole cruel fate of slaves.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The king of Egypt told the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was called
Shiphrah and the other Puah,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When you act as midwives for the Hebrew women and see them giving
birth, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, she may live."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The midwives, however, feared God; they did not do as the king of
Egypt had ordered them, but let the boys live.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So the king summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you
acted thus, allowing the boys to live?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The midwives answered Pharaoh, "The Hebrew women are not like the
Egyptian women. They are robust and give birth before the midwife
arrives."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Therefore God dealt well with the midwives. The people, too,
increased and grew strong.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And because the midwives feared God, he built up families for them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Pharaoh then commanded all his subjects, "Throw into the river
every boy that is born to the Hebrews, but you may let all the girls
live."
