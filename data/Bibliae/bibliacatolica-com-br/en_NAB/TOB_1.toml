"1" = ''':sup:`1` This book tells the story of Tobit, son of Tobiel, son of Hananiel,
son of Aduel, son of Gabael of the family of Asiel, of the tribe of
Naphtali,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` who during the reign of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, was taken
captive from Thisbe, which is south of Kedesh Naphtali in upper
Galilee, above and to the west of Asser, north of Phogor.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I, Tobit, have walked all the days of my life on the paths of truth
and righteousness. I performed many charitable works for my kinsmen and
my people who had been deported with me to Nineveh, in Assyria.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When I lived as a young man in my own country, Israel, the entire
tribe of my forefather Naphtali had broken away from the house of David
and from Jerusalem. This city had been singled out of all Israel's
tribes, so that they all might offer sacrifice in the place where the
temple, God's dwelling, had been built and consecrated for all
generations to come.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All my kinsmen, like the rest of the tribe of my forefather
Naphtali, used to offer sacrifice on all the mountains of Galilee as
well as to the young bull which Jeroboam, king of Israel, had made in
Dan.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I, for my part, would often make the pilgrimage alone to Jerusalem
for the festivals, as is prescribed for all Israel by perpetual decree.
Bringing with me the first fruits of the field and the firstlings of
the flock, together with a tenth of my income and the first shearings
of the sheep, I would hasten to Jerusalem
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and present them to the priests, Aaron's sons, at the altar. To the
Levites who were doing service in Jeusalem I would give the tithe of
grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruits. And
except for sabbatical years, I used to give a second tithe in money,
which each year I would go and disburse in Jerusalem.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The third tithe I gave to orphans and widows, and to converts who
were living with the Israelites. Every third year I would bring them
this offering, and we ate it in keeping with the decree of the Mosaic
law and the commands of Deborah, the mother of my father Tobiel; for
when my father died, he left me an orphan.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When I reached manhood, I married Anna, a woman of our own lineage.
By her I had a son whom I named Tobiah.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now, after I had been deported to Nineveh, all my brothers and
relatives ate the food of heathens,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but I refrained from eating that kind of food.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Because of this wholehearted service of God,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` the Most High granted me favor and status with Shalmaneser, so that
I became purchasing agent for all his needs.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Every now and then until his death I would go to Media to buy goods
for him. I also deposited several pouches containing a great sum of
money with my kinsman Gabael, son of Gabri, who lived at Rages, in
Media.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when Shalmaneser died and his son Sennacherib succeeded him as
king, the roads to Media became unsafe, so I could no longer go there.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` During Shalmaneser's reign I performed many charitable works for my
kinsmen and my people.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I would give my bread to the hungry and my clothing to the naked.
If I saw one of my people who had died and been thrown outside the
walls of Nineveh, I would bury him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` I also buried anyone whom Sennacherib slew when he returned as a
fugitive from Judea during the days of judgment decreed against him by
the heavenly King because of the blasphemies he had uttered. In his
rage he killed many Israelites, but I used to take their bodies by
stealth and bury them; so when Sennacherib looked for them, he could
not find them.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But a certain citizen of Nineveh informed the king that it was I
who buried the dead. When I found out that the king knew all about me
and wanted to put me to death, I went into hiding; then in my fear I
took to flight.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Afterward, all my property was confiscated; I was left with
nothing. All that I had was taken to the king's palace, except for my
wife Anna and my son Tobiah.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But less than forty days later the king was assassinated by two of
his sons, who then escaped into the mountains of Ararat. His son
Esarhaddon, who succeeded him as king, placed Ahiqar, my brother
Anael's son, in charge of all the accounts of his kingdom, so that he
took control over the entire administration.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then Ahiqar interceded on my behalf, and I was able to return to
Nineveh. For under Sennacherib, king of Assyria, Ahiqar had been chief
cupbearer, keeper of the seal, administrator, and treasurer; and
Esarhaddon reappointed him. He was a close relative-in fact, my nephew.
