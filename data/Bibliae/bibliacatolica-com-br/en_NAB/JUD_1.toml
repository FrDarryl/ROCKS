called, beloved in God the Father and kept safe for Jesus Christ:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` may mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Beloved, although I was making every effort to write to you about
our common salvation, I now feel a need to write to encourage you to
contend for the faith that was once for all handed down to the holy
ones.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For there have been some intruders, who long ago were designated for
this condemnation, godless persons, who pervert the grace of our God
into licentiousness and who deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus
Christ.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I wish to remind you, although you know all things, that (the) Lord
who once saved a people from the land of Egypt later destroyed those
who did not believe.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The angels too, who did not keep to their own domain but deserted
their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains, in gloom, for the
judgment of the great day.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Likewise, Sodom, Gomorrah, and the surrounding towns, which, in the
same manner as they, indulged in sexual promiscuity and practiced
unnatural vice, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of
eternal fire.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Similarly, these dreamers nevertheless also defile the flesh, scorn
lordship, and revile glorious beings.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Yet the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil in a
dispute over the body of Moses, did not venture to pronounce a reviling
judgment upon him but said, "May the Lord rebuke you!"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But these people revile what they do not understand and are
destroyed by what they know by nature like irrational animals.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Woe to them! They followed the way of Cain, abandoned themselves to
Balaam's error for the sake of gain, and perished in the rebellion of
Korah.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` These are blemishes on your love feasts, as they carouse fearlessly
and look after themselves. They are waterless clouds blown about by
winds, fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead and uprooted.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameless
deeds, wandering stars for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved
forever.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Enoch, of the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied also about
them when he said, "Behold, the Lord has come with his countless holy
ones
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` to execute judgment on all and to convict everyone for all the
godless deeds that they committed and for all the harsh words godless
sinners have uttered against him."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` These people are complainers, disgruntled ones who live by their
desires; their mouths utter bombast as they fawn over people to gain
advantage.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But you, beloved, remember the words spoken beforehand by the
apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` for they told you, "In (the) last time there will be scoffers who
will live according to their own godless desires."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` These are the ones who cause divisions; they live on the natural
plane, devoid of the Spirit.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But you, beloved, build yourselves up in your most holy faith; pray
in the holy Spirit.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Keep yourselves in the love of God and wait for the mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` On those who waver, have mercy;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` save others by snatching them out of the fire; on others have mercy
with fear, abhorring even the outer garment stained by the flesh.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` To the one who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present
you unblemished and exultant, in the presence of his glory,

"25" = ''':sup:`25` to the only God, our savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord be
glory, majesty, power, and authority from ages past, now, and for ages
to come. Amen.
