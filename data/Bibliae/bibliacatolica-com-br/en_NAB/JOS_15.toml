"1" = ''':sup:`1` The lot for the clans of the Judahite tribe fell in the extreme
south toward the boundary of Edom, the desert of Zin in the Negeb.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The boundary there ran from the bay that forms the southern end of
the Salt Sea,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` southward below the pass of Akrabbim, across through Zin, up to a
point south of Kadesh-barnea, across to Hezron, and up to Addar; from
there, looping around Karka,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` it crossed to Azmon and then joined the Wadi of Egypt before coming
out at the sea. (This is your southern boundary.)
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the
Jordan.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The northern boundary climbed from the bay where the Jordan meets
the sea, up to Beth-hoglah, and ran north of Beth-arabah, up to
Eben-Bohan-ben-Reuben.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thence it climbed to Debir, north of the vale of Achor, in the
direction of the Gilgal that faces the pass of Adummim, on the south
side of the wadi; from there it crossed to the waters of En-shemesh and
emerged at En-rogel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Climbing again to the Valley of Ben-hinnom on the southern flank of
the Jebusites (that is, Jerusalem), the boundary rose to the top of the
mountain at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim, which bounds the
Valley of Hinnom on the west.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` From the top of the mountain it ran to the fountain of waters of
Nephtoah, extended to the cities of Mount Ephron, and continued to
Baalah, or Kiriath-jearim.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` From Baalah the boundary curved westward to Mount Seir and passed
north of the ridge of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon); thence it
descended to Beth-shemesh, and ran across to Timnah.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` It then extended along the northern flank of Ekron, continued
through Shikkeron, and across to Mount Baalah, thence to include
Jabneel, before it came out at the sea.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The western boundary was the Great Sea and its coast. This was the
complete boundary of the clans of the Judahites.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` As the LORD had commanded, Joshua gave Caleb, son of Jephunneh, a
portion among the Judahites, namely, Kiriath-arba (Arba was the father
of Anak), that is, Hebron.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Caleb drove out from there the three Anakim, the descendants of
Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` From there he marched up against the inhabitants of Debir, which
was formerly called Kiriath-sepher.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the one
who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Othniel, son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, captured it, and so Caleb
gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` On the day of her marriage to Othniel, she induced him to ask her
father for some land. Then, as she alighted from the ass, Caleb asked
her, "What is troubling you?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` She answered, "Give me an additional gift! Since you have assigned
to me land in the Negeb, give me also pools of water." So he gave her
the upper and the lower pools.
