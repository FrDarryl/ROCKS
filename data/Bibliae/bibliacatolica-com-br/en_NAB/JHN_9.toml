"1" = ''':sup:`1` As he passed by he saw a man blind from birth.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his
parents, that he was born blind?"
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Jesus answered, "Neither he nor his parents sinned; it is so that
the works of God might be made visible through him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` We have to do the works of the one who sent me while it is day.
Night is coming when no one can work.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made clay with the
saliva, and smeared the clay on his eyes,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and said to him, "Go wash in the Pool of Siloam" (which means Sent).
So he went and washed, and came back able to see.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` His neighbors and those who had seen him earlier as a beggar said,
"Isn't this the one who used to sit and beg?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Some said, "It is," but others said, "No, he just looks like him."
He said, "I am."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So they said to him, "(So) how were your eyes opened?"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He replied, "The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes
and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went there and washed and
was able to see."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And they said to him, "Where is he?" He said, "I don't know."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` They brought the one who was once blind to the Pharisees.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes on a sabbath.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So then the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see. He
said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can
see."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because
he does not keep the sabbath." (But) others said, "How can a sinful man
do such signs?" And there was a division among them.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So they said to the blind man again, "What do you have to say about
him, since he opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and gained his
sight until they summoned the parents of the one who had gained his
sight.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How
does he now see?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` His parents answered and said, "We know that this is our son and
that he was born blind.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` We do not know how he sees now, nor do we know who opened his eyes.
Ask him, he is of age; he can speak for him self."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the
Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged him as the Messiah,
he would be expelled from the synagogue.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; question him."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to
him, "Give God the praise! We know that this man is a sinner."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He replied, "If he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know
is that I was blind and now I see."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So they said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your
eyes?"
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` He answered them, "I told you already and you did not listen. Why
do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples,
too?"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` They ridiculed him and said, "You are that man's disciple; we are
disciples of Moses!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this one
is from."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The man answered and said to them, "This is what is so amazing,
that you do not know where he is from, yet he opened my eyes.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if one is devout
and does his will, he listens to him.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` It is unheard of that anyone ever opened the eyes of a person born
blind.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do
anything."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` They answered and said to him, "You were born totally in sin, and
are you trying to teach us?" Then they threw him out.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, he found him and
said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He answered and said, "Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Jesus said to him, "You have seen him and the one speaking with you
is he."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` He said, "I do believe, Lord," and he worshiped him.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Then Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, so that
those who do not see might see, and those who do see might become
blind."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and said to him,
"Surely we are not also blind, are we?"
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but
now you are saying, 'We see,' so your sin remains.
