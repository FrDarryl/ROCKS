"1" = ''':sup:`1` I ask, then, has God rejected his people? Of course not! For I too
am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know
what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against
Israel?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have torn down your
altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But what is God's response to him? "I have left for myself seven
thousand men who have not knelt to Baal."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So also at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But if by grace, it is no longer because of works; otherwise grace
would no longer be grace.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` What then? What Israel was seeking it did not attain, but the elect
attained it; the rest were hardened,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that
should not see and ears that should not hear, down to this very day."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And David says: "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a
stumbling block and a retribution for them;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` let their eyes grow dim so that they may not see, and keep their
backs bent forever."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Hence I ask, did they stumble so as to fall? Of course not! But
through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as
to make them jealous.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now if their transgression is enrichment for the world, and if
their diminished number is enrichment for the Gentiles, how much more
their full number.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am the
apostle to the Gentiles, I glory in my ministry
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` in order to make my race jealous and thus save some of them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what
will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch of dough; and if
the root is holy, so are the branches.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive
shoot, were grafted in their place and have come to share in the rich
root of the olive tree,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` do not boast against the branches. If you do boast, consider that
you do not support the root; the root supports you.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Indeed you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be
grafted in."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` That is so. They were broken off because of unbelief, but you are
there because of faith. So do not become haughty, but stand in awe.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For if God did not spare the natural branches, (perhaps) he will
not spare you either.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` See, then, the kindness and severity of God: severity toward those
who fell, but God's kindness to you, provided you remain in his
kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they also, if they do not remain in unbelief, will be grafted
in, for God is able to graft them in again.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and
grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated one, how much more will
they who belong to it by nature be grafted back into their own olive
tree.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers, so that
you will not become wise (in) your own estimation: a hardening has come
upon Israel in part, until the full number of the Gentiles comes in,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The deliverer
will come out of Zion, he will turn away godlessness from Jacob;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` In respect to the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but in
respect to election, they are beloved because of the patriarchs.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Just as you once disobeyed God but have now received mercy because
of their disobedience,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` so they have now disobeyed in order that, by virtue of the mercy
shown to you, they too may (now) receive mercy.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` For God delivered all to disobedience, that he might have mercy
upon all.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How
inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways!
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` "For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has been his
counselor?"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` "Or who has given him anything that he may be repaid?"
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be
glory forever. Amen.

Notas de rodap√©:
11:1-6 - Paul affirms that God has not rejected Israel, for he himself,
as a Jew, is an example that God still maintains a faithful remnant.
Election by grace, not works, is the basis of salvation (see also 1
11:7-10 - Israel's unbelief does not hinder God's plan. He gave them a
spirit of perversion, but He did not completely abandon His people,
allowing the Gentiles to be incorporated into His plan of salvation
11:11-15 - The fall of Israel resulted in the salvation of the
Gentiles, but Paul points out that this is for the salvation of the
Jews as well. The introduction of the Gentiles to the gospel is a
blessing, but the ultimate goal is the restoration of Israel (see also
11:16-24 - Paul uses the metaphor of the olive tree to illustrate the
relationship between Jews and Gentiles. The Gentiles have been grafted
into the olive tree, but they must remain humble and watchful, for the
tree can be cut down if they do not remain faithful to the faith (see
11:25-36 - Paul speaks of the mystery of Israel's salvation and how the
Jews' partial blindness will be removed at the end of time. He
concludes with a hymn of praise to God's wisdom and sovereignty (see
