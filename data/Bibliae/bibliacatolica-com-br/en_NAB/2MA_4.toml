"1" = ''':sup:`1` The Simon mentioned above as the informer about the funds against
his own country, made false accusation that it was Onias who threatened
Heliodorus and instigated the whole miserable affair.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He dared to brand as a plotter against the government the man who
was a benefactor of the city, a protector of his compatriots, and a
zealous defender of the laws.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When Simon's hostility reached such a point that murders were being
committed by one of his henchmen,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Onias saw that the opposition was serious and that Apollonius, son
of Menestheus, the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, was abetting
Simon's wickedness.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he had recourse to the king, not as an accuser of his countrymen,
but as a man looking to the general and particular good of all the
people.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He saw that, unless the king intervened, it would be impossible to
have a peaceful government, and that Simon would not desist from his
folly.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Seleucus died, and when Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes succeeded
him on the throne, Onias' brother Jason obtained the high priesthood by
corrupt means:
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` in an interview, he promised the king three hundred and sixty
talents of silver, as well as eighty talents from another source of
income.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Besides this he agreed to pay a hundred and fifty more, if he were
given authority to establish a gymnasium and a youth club for it and to
enroll men in Jerusalem as Antiochians.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When Jason received the king's approval and came into office, he
immediately initiated his countrymen into the Greek way of life.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He set aside the royal concessions granted to the Jews through the
mediation of John, father of Eupolemus (that Eupolemus who would later
go on an embassy to the Romans to establish a treaty of friendship with
them); he abrogated the lawful institutions and introduced customs
contrary to the law.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He quickly established a gymnasium at the very foot of the
acropolis, where he induced the noblest young men to wear the Greek
hat.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The craze for Hellenism and foreign customs reached such a pitch,
through the outrageous wickedness of the ungodly pseudo-high-priest
Jason,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` that the priests no longer cared about the service of the altar.
Disdaining the temple and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened, at
the signal for the discus-throwing, to take part in the unlawful
exercises on the athletic field.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They despised what their ancestors had regarded as honors, while
they highly prized what the Greeks esteemed as glory.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Precisely because of this, they found themselves in serious
trouble: the very people whose manner of life they emulated, and whom
they desired to imitate in everything, became their enemies and
oppressors.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It is no light matter to flout the laws of God, as the following
period will show.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When the quinquennial games were held at Tyre in the presence of
the king,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` the vile Jason sent envoys as representatives of the Antiochians of
Jerusalem, to bring there three hundred silver drachmas for the
sacrifice to Hercules. But the bearers themselves decided that the
money should not be spent on a sacrifice, as that was not right, but
should be used for some other purpose.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So the contribution destined by the sender for the sacrifice to
Hercules was in fact applied, by those who brought it, to the
construction of triremes.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Apollonius, son of Menestheus, was sent to Egypt for the
coronation of King Philometor, Antiochus learned that the king was
opposed to his policies; so he took measures for his own security.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` After going to Joppa, he proceeded to Jerusalem. There he was
received with great pomp by Jason and the people of the city, who
escorted him with torchlights and acclamations; following this, he led
his army into Phoenicia.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Three years later Jason sent Menelaus, brother of the
aforementioned Simon, to deliver the money to the king, and to obtain
decisions on some important matters.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When he had been introduced to the king, he flattered him with such
an air of authority that he secured the high priesthood for himself,
outbidding Jason by three hundred talents of silver.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He returned with the royal commission, but with nothing that made
him worthy of the high priesthood; he had the temper of a cruel tyrant
and the rage of a wild beast.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then Jason, who had cheated his own brother and now saw himself
cheated by another man, was driven out as a fugitive to the country of
the Ammonites.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Although Menelaus had obtained the office, he did not make any
payments of the money he had promised to the king,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` in spite of the demand of Sostratus, the commandant of the citadel,
whose duty it was to collect the taxes. For this reason, both were
summoned before the king.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus as his substitute in the high
priesthood, while Sostratus left Crates, commander of the Cypriots, as
his substitute.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` While these things were taking place, the people of Tarsus and
Mallus rose in revolt, because their cities had been given as a gift to
Antiochis, the king's mistress.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The king, therefore, went off in haste to settle the affair,
leaving Andronicus, one of his nobles, as his deputy.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then Menelaus, thinking this a good opportunity, stole some gold
vessels from the temple and presented them to Andronicus; he had
already sold some other vessels in Tyre and in the neighboring cities.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` When Onias had clear evidence of the facts, he made a public
protest, after withdrawing to the inviolable sanctuary at Daphne, near
Antioch.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Thereupon Menelaus approached Andronicus privately and asked him to
lay hands on Onias. So Andronicus went to Onias, and by treacherously
reassuring him through sworn pledges with right hands joined, persuaded
him, in spite of his suspicions, to leave the sanctuary. Then, without
any regard for justice, he immediately put him to death.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` As a result, not only the Jews, but many people of other nations as
well, were indignant and angry over the unjust murder of the man.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` When the king returned from the region of Cilicia, the Jews of the
city, together with the Greeks who detested the crime, went to see him
about the murder of Onias.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Antiochus was deeply grieved and full of pity; he wept as he
recalled the prudence and noble conduct of the deceased.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Inflamed with anger, he immediately stripped Andronicus of his
purple robe, tore off his other garments, and had him led through the
whole city to the very place where he had committed the outrage against
Onias; and there he put the murderer to death. Thus the Lord rendered
him the punishment he deserved.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Many sacrilegious thefts had been committed by Lysimachus in the
city with the connivance of Menelaus. When word was spread that a large
number of gold vessels had been stolen, the people assembled in protest
against Lysimachus.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` As the crowds, now thoroughly enraged, began to riot, Lysimachus
launched an unjustified attack against them with about three thousand
armed men under the leadership of Auranus, a man as advanced in folly
as he was in years.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Reacting against Lysimachus' attack, the people picked up stones or
pieces of wood or handfuls of the ashes lying there and threw them in
wild confusion at Lysimachus and his men.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` As a result, they wounded many of them and even killed a few, while
they put all the rest to flight. The sacrilegious thief himself they
slew near the treasury.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Charges about this affair were brought against Menelaus.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` When the king came to Tyre, three men sent by the senate presented
to him the justice of their cause.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But Menelaus, seeing himself on the losing side, promised Ptolemy,
son of Dorymenes, a substantial sum of money if he would win the king
over.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` So Ptolemy retired with the king under a colonnade, as if to get
some fresh air, and persuaded him to change his mind.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Menelaus, who was the cause of all the trouble, the king acquitted
of the charges, while he condemned to death those poor men who would
have been declared innocent even if they had pleaded their case before
Scythians.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Thus, those who had prosecuted the case for the city, for the
people, and for the sacred vessels, quickly suffered unjust punishment.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` For this reason, even some Tyrians were indignant over the crime
and provided sumptuously for their burial.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` But Menelaus, thanks to the covetousness of the men in power,
remained in office, where he grew in wickedness and became the chief
plotter against his fellow citizens.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
4:7-10 - Under the rule of Antiochus Epiphanes, Jason bribes the king
to become high priest, illustrating the corruption of religious
leadership. The exchange of spiritual values for political interests
4:11-13 - Jason promotes Hellenistic culture, leading the people away
from God's Law. The Jews' adoption of pagan practices demonstrates the
struggle between faithfulness to God and external cultural influence
4:14-17 - The neglect of the temple and worship by the priests reveals
internal apostasy. This reflects how religious corruption can lead to
the destruction of the faith and identity of God's people (see also
4:23-26 - Menelaus replaces Jason as high priest through further
bribery. This cycle of betrayal and corruption shows the fragility of
leadership without true reverence for God (see also 1 Kings 21:1-16 and
4:32-35 - Onias is murdered on Menelaus' orders, reflecting the
violence that arises when leadership is corrupted. Innocent blood cries
23:35).
