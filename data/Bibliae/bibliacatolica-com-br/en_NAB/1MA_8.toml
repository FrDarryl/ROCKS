'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and by planning and persistence had conquered the whole country,
although it was very remote from their own. They had crushed the kings
who had come against them from the far corners of the earth and had
inflicted on them severe defeat, and the rest paid tribute to them
every year.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Philip and Perseus, king of the Macedonians, and the others who
opposed them in battle had been overwhelmed and subjugated.
'''

"9" = ''':sup:`9` When the men of Greece had planned to come and destroy them,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the Romans discovered it, and sent against the Greeks a single
general who made war on them. Many were wounded and fell, and the
Romans took their wives and children captive. They plundered them, took
possession of their land, tore down their strongholds and reduced them
to slavery even to this day.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` All the other kingdoms and islands that had ever opposed them they
destroyed and enslaved;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` with their friends, however, and those who relied on them, they
maintained friendship. They had conquered kings both far and near, and
all who heard of their fame were afraid of them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In truth, those whom they desired to help to a kingdom became
kings, and those whom they wished to depose they deposed; and they were

their entire country, and they all obeyed that one, and there was no
envy or jealousy among them.

of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome to establish an alliance of
friendship with them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He did this to get rid of the yoke, for it was obvious that the
kingdom of the Greeks was subjecting Israel to slavery.
'''

senate and spoke as follows:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "Judas, called Maccabeus, and his brothers, with the Jewish people,
have sent us to you to make a peaceful alliance with you, and to enroll
ourselves among your allies and friends."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The proposal pleased the Romans,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and this is a copy of the reply they inscribed on bronze tablets
and sent to Jerusalem, to remain there with the Jews as a record of
peace and alliance:
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "May it be well with the Romans and the Jewish nation at sea and on
land forever; may sword and enemy be far from them.

shall demand;

arms, money, or ships; this is Rome's decision. They shall fulfill
their obligations without receiving any recompense.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` In the same way, if war is made first on the Jewish nation, the
Romans will help them willingly, as the occasion shall demand,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and to those who are attacking them there shall not be given grain,
arms, money, or ships; this is Rome's decision. They shall fulfill
their obligations without deception.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` On these terms the Romans have made an agreement with the Jewish
people.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But if both parties hereafter decide to add or take away anything,
they shall do as they choose, and whatever they shall add or take away
shall be valid.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "Moreover, concerning the wrongs that King Demetrius has done to
them, we have written to him thus: 'Why have you made your yoke heavy

war on you by land and sea.'"
