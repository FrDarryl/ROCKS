son of Immer, chief officer in the house of the LORD.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So he had the prophet scourged and placed in the stocks at the upper
Gate of Benjamin in the house of the LORD.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The next morning, after Pashhur had released Jeremiah from the
stocks, the prophet said to him: Instead of Pashhur, the LORD will name
you "Terror on every side."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For thus says the LORD: Indeed, I will deliver you to terror, you
and all your friends. Your own eyes shall see them fall by the sword of
their enemies. All Judah I will deliver to the king of Babylon, who
shall take them captive to Babylon or slay them with the sword.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All the wealth of this city, all it has toiled for and holds dear,
all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I will give as plunder into
the hands of their foes, who shall seize it and carry it away to
Babylon.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` You Pashhur, and all the members of your household shall go into
exile. To Babylon you shall go, you and all your friends; there you
shall die and be buried, because you have prophesied lies to them.

my bones; I grow weary holding it in, I cannot endure it.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Yes, I hear the whisperings of many: "Terror on every side!
Denounce! let us denounce him!" All those who were my friends are on
the watch for any misstep of mine. "Perhaps he will be trapped; then we
can prevail, and take our vengeance on him."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But the LORD is with me, like a mighty champion: my persecutors
will stumble, they will not triumph. In their failure they will be put
to utter shame, to lasting, unforgettable confusion.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` O LORD of hosts, you who test the just, who probe mind and heart,
Let me witness the vengeance you take on them, for to you I have
entrusted my cause.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Sing to the LORD, praise the LORD, For he has rescued the life of
the poor from the power of the wicked!

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Cursed be the day on which I was born! May the day my mother gave
me birth never be blessed!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father, saying, "A
child, a son, has been born to you!" filling him with great joy.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Let that man be like the cities which the LORD relentlessly
overthrew; Let him hear war cries in the morning, battle alarms at
noonday,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` because he did not dispatch me in the womb! Then my mother would
have been my grave, her womb confining me forever.

my days in shame?
