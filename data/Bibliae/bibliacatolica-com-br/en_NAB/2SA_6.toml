"6" = ''':sup:`6` When they came to the threshing floor of Nodan, Uzzah reached out
his hand to the ark of God and steadied it, for the oxen were making it

"20" = ''':sup:`20` When David returned to bless his own family, Saul's daughter Michal
came out to meet him and said, "How the king of Israel has honored
himself today, exposing himself to the view of the slave girls of his
followers, as a commoner might do!"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But David replied to Michal: "I was dancing before the LORD. As the
LORD lives, who preferred me to your father and his whole family when
he appointed me commander of the LORD'S people, Israel, not only will I
make merry before the LORD,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` but I will demean myself even more. I will be lowly in your esteem,
but in the esteem of the slave girls you spoke of I will be honored."

"23" = ''':sup:`23` And so Saul's daughter Michal was childless to the day of her
death.
