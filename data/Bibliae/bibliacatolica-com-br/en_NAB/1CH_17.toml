I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you should have brought me
as far as I have come?

another nation on earth whom a god went to redeem as his people? You

"22" = ''':sup:`22` You made your people Israel your own forever, and you, O LORD,
became their God.

your servant and his house remain firm forever. Bring about what you
have promised,

"24" = ''':sup:`24` that your renown as LORD of hosts, God of Israel, may be great and
abide forever, while the house of David, your servant, is established
