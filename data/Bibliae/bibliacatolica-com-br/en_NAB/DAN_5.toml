"1" = ''':sup:`1` King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his lords,
with whom he drank.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Under the influence of the wine, he ordered the gold and silver
vessels which Nebuchadnezzar, his father, had taken from the temple in
Jerusalem, to be brought in so that the king, his lords, his wives and
his entertainers might drink from them.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` When the gold and silver vessels taken from the house of God in
Jerusalem had been brought in, and while the king, his lords, his wives
and his entertainers were drinking

"4" = ''':sup:`4` wine from them, they praised their gods of gold and silver, bronze
and iron, wood and stone.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Suddenly, opposite the lampstand, the fingers of a human hand
appeared, writing on the plaster of the wall in the king's palace. When
the king saw the wrist and hand that wrote,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` his face blanched; his thoughts terrified him, his hip joints shook,
and his knees knocked.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The king shouted for the enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers to
be brought in. "Whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means,"
he said to the wise men of Babylon, "shall be clothed in purple, wear a
golden collar about his neck, and be third in the government of the
kingdom."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But though all the king's wise men came in, none of them could
either read the writing or tell the king what it meant.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then King Belshazzar was greatly terrified; his face went ashen, and
his lords were thrown into confusion.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When the queen heard of the discussion between the king and his
lords, she entered the banquet hall and said, "O king, live forever! Be
not troubled in mind, nor look so pale!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy
God; during the lifetime of your father he was seen to have brilliant
knowledge and god-like wisdom. In fact, King Nebuchadnezzar, your
father, made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and
astrologers,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` because of the extraordinary mind possessed by this Daniel, whom
the king named Belteshazzar. He knew and understood how to interpret
dreams, explain enigmas, and solve difficulties. Now therefore, summon
Daniel to tell you what this means."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Daniel was brought into the presence of the king. The king
asked him, "Are you the Daniel, the Jewish exile, whom my father, the
king, brought from Judah?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I have heard that the spirit of God is in you, that you possess
brilliant knowledge and extraordinary wisdom.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Now, the wise men and enchanters were brought in to me to read this
writing and tell me its meaning, but they could not say what the words
meant.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But I have heard that you can interpret dreams and solve
difficulties; if you are able to read the writing and tell me what it
means, you shall be clothed in purple, wear a gold collar about your
neck, and be third in the government of the kingdom."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Daniel answered the king: "You may keep your gifts, or give your

and glorious majesty.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Because he made him so great, the nations and peoples of every
language dreaded and feared him. Whomever he wished, he killed or let
live; whomever he wished, he exalted or humbled.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But when his heart became proud and his spirit hardened by
insolence, he was put down from his royal throne and deprived of his
glory;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` he was cast out from among men and was made insensate as a beast;
he lived with wild asses, and ate grass like an ox; his body was bathed
with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God rules
over the kingdom of men and appoints over it whom he will.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you
knew all this;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` you have rebelled against the Lord of heaven. You had the vessels
of his temple brought before you, so that you and your nobles, your
wives and your entertainers, might drink wine from them; and you
praised the gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone,
that neither see nor hear nor have intelligence. But the God in whose
hand is your life breath and the whole course of your life, you did not
glorify.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` By him were the wrist and hand sent, and the writing set down.
