"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then he brought me to the nave and measured the pilasters, which
were six cubits thick on either side.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the walls at either
side of it measured five cubits each. He measured the length of the
nave, which was found to be forty cubits, while its width was twenty.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then he went in beyond and measured the pilasters flanking that
entrance, which were two cubits; the width of the entrance was six
cubits, and the walls at either side of it extended seven cubits each.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He measured the space beyond the nave, twenty cubits long and twenty
cubits wide, and said to me, "This is the holy of holies."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then he measured the wall of the temple, which was six cubits thick;
the side chambers, which extended all the way around the temple, had a
width of four cubits.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` There were thirty side chambers built one above the other in three
stories, and there were offsets in the outside wall of the temple that
enclosed the side chambers; these served as supports, so that there
were no supports in the temple wall proper.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` There was a broad circular passageway that led upward to the side
chambers, for the temple was enclosed all the way around and all the
way upward; therefore the temple had a broad way running upward so that
one could pass from the lowest to the middle and the highest story.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` About the temple was a raised pavement completely enclosing it--the
foundations of the side chambers--a full rod of six cubits in extent.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The width of the outside wall which enclosed the side chambers was
five cubits. Between the side chambers of the temple
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and the chambers of the court was an open space twenty cubits wide
going all around the temple.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The side chambers had entrances to the open space, one entrance on
the north and another on the south. The width of the wall surrounding
the open space was five cubits.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The building fronting the free area on the west side was seventy
cubits front to back; the wall of the building was five cubits thick
all around, and it measured ninety cubits from side to side.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He measured the temple, which was one hundred cubits long. The free
area, together with the building and its walls, was a hundred cubits in
length.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The facade of the temple, along with the free area, on the east
side, was one hundred cubits wide.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He measured the building which lay the length of the free area and
behind it, and together with its walls on both sides it was one hundred
cubits. The inner nave and the outer vestibule
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` were paneled with precious wood all around, covered from the ground
to the windows. There were splayed windows with trellises about them
(facing the threshold).
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` As high as the lintel of the door, even into the interior part of
the temple as well as outside, on every wall on every side in both the
inner and outer rooms were carved
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` the figures of cherubim and palmtrees: a palmtree between every two
cherubim. Each cherub had two faces:
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` a man's face looking at a palmtree on one side, and a lion's face
looking at a palmtree on the other; thus they were figured on every
side throughout the whole temple.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` From the ground to the lintel of the door the cherubim and
palmtrees were carved on the walls.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The way into the nave was a square doorframe. In front of the holy
place was something that looked like
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` a wooden altar, three cubits in height, two cubits long, and two
cubits wide. It had corners, and its base and sides were of wood. He
said to me, "This is the table which is before the LORD."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The nave had a double door, and also the holy place had
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` a double door. Each door had two movable leaves; two leaves were on
one doorjamb and two on the other.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Carved upon them (on the doors of the nave) were cherubim and
palmtrees, like those carved on the walls. Before the vestibule outside
was a wooden lattice.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` There were splayed windows (and palmtrees) on both side walls of
the vestibule, and the side chambers of the temple. . . .
