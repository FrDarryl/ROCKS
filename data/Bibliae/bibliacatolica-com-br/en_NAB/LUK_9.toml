"1" = ''':sup:`1` He summoned the Twelve and gave them power and authority over all
demons and to cure diseases,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal (the
sick).
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He said to them, "Take nothing for the journey, neither walking
stick, nor sack, nor food, nor money, and let no one take a second
tunic.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Whatever house you enter, stay there and leave from there.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And as for those who do not welcome you, when you leave that town,
shake the dust from your feet in testimony against them."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then they set out and went from village to village proclaiming the
good news and curing diseases everywhere.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` heard about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed
because some were saying, "John has been raised from the dead";
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` others were saying, "Elijah has appeared"; still others, "One of the
ancient prophets has arisen."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But Herod said, "John I beheaded. Who then is this about whom I hear
such things?" And he kept trying to see him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When the apostles returned, they explained to him what they had
done. He took them and withdrew in private to a town called Bethsaida.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The crowds, meanwhile, learned of this and followed him. He
received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and he healed
those who needed to be cured.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` As the day was drawing to a close, the Twelve approached him and
said, "Dismiss the crowd so that they can go to the surrounding
villages and farms and find lodging and provisions; for we are in a
deserted place here."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He said to them, "Give them some food yourselves." They replied,
"Five loaves and two fish are all we have, unless we ourselves go and
buy food for all these people."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now the men there numbered about five thousand. Then he said to his
disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of (about) fifty."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They did so and made them all sit down.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to
heaven, he said the blessing over them, broke them, and gave them to
the disciples to set before the crowd.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They all ate and were satisfied. And when the leftover fragments
were picked up, they filled twelve wicker baskets.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Once when Jesus was praying in solitude, and the disciples were
with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say that I am?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They said in reply, "John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still
others, 'One of the ancient prophets has arisen.'"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then he said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter said in
reply, "The Messiah of God."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` He rebuked them and directed them not to tell this to anyone.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He said, "The Son of Man must suffer greatly and be rejected by the
elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed and on the
third day be raised."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then he said to all, "If anyone wishes to come after me, he must
deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses
his life for my sake will save it.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or
forfeit himself?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of Man will be
ashamed of when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father
and of the holy angels.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste
death until they see the kingdom of God."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` About eight days after he said this, he took Peter, John, and James
and went up the mountain to pray.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` While he was praying his face changed in appearance and his
clothing became dazzling white.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And behold, two men were conversing with him, Moses and Elijah,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` who appeared in glory and spoke of his exodus that he was going to
accomplish in Jerusalem.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep, but becoming
fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` As they were about to part from him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master,
it is good that we are here; let us make three tents, one for you, one
for Moses, and one for Elijah." But he did not know what he was saying.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` While he was still speaking, a cloud came and cast a shadow over
them, and they became frightened when they entered the cloud.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then from the cloud came a voice that said, "This is my chosen Son;
listen to him."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They fell silent
and did not at that time tell anyone what they had seen.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` On the next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large
crowd met him.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` There was a man in the crowd who cried out, "Teacher, I beg you,
look at my son; he is my only child.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` For a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams and it convulses
him until he foams at the mouth; it releases him only with difficulty,
wearing him out.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` I begged your disciples to cast it out but they could not."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Jesus said in reply, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long
will I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here."
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` As he was coming forward, the demon threw him to the ground in a
convulsion; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and
returned him to his father.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And all were astonished by the majesty of God. While they were all
amazed at his every deed, he said to his disciples,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` "Pay attention to what I am telling you. The Son of Man is to be
handed over to men."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But they did not understand this saying; its meaning was hidden
from them so that they should not understand it, and they were afraid
to ask him about this saying.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` An argument arose among the disciples about which of them was the
greatest.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Jesus realized the intention of their hearts and took a child and
placed it by his side
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` and said to them, "Whoever receives this child in my name receives
me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. For the one
who is least among all of you is the one who is the greatest."
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Then John said in reply, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons
in your name and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow in
our company."
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Jesus said to him, "Do not prevent him, for whoever is not against
you is for you."
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` When the days for his being taken up were fulfilled, he resolutely
determined to journey to Jerusalem,
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` and he sent messengers ahead of him. On the way they entered a
Samaritan village to prepare for his reception there,
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` but they would not welcome him because the destination of his
journey was Jerusalem.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` When the disciples James and John saw this they asked, "Lord, do
you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?"
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` Jesus turned and rebuked them,
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` and they journeyed to another village.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` As they were proceeding on their journey someone said to him, "I
will follow you wherever you go."
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Jesus answered him, "Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head."
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` And to another he said, "Follow me." But he replied, "(Lord,) let
me go first and bury my father."
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` But he answered him, "Let the dead bury their dead. But you, go and
proclaim the kingdom of God."
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And another said, "I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say
farewell to my family at home."
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` (To him) Jesus said, "No one who sets a hand to the plow and looks
to what was left behind is fit for the kingdom of God."

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
9:1-6 - Jesus empowers His disciples to preach the kingdom of God and
heal the sick. This reflects the mission to spread the gospel with
God-given power, demonstrating that Christian mission is accomplished
9:18-20 - Peter confesses that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah. This
declaration is central to understanding Jesus' identity and the divine
revelation of who He truly is. Peter's confession is a milestone in
9:23-27 - Jesus teaches the need to deny oneself, take up one's cross,
and follow Him. This teaching challenges the vision of a triumphant
Messiah and points to the true path of discipleship, which involves
8:34-37).
9:28-36 - Jesus' transfiguration reveals His divine glory. Moses and
Elijah appear, confirming that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law and
the Prophets. This event strengthens the disciples' faith and
anticipates the full revelation of Jesus' identity (see also
9:57-62 - Jesus speaks about the cost of discipleship, showing that
following Christ involves leaving everything behind and prioritizing
the Kingdom of God. He emphasizes that following Christ must be
10:28-31).
