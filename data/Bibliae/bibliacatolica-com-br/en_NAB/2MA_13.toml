"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the year one hundred and forty-nine, Judas and his men learned
that Antiochus Eupator was invading Judea with a large force,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and that with him was Lysias, his guardian, who was in charge of the
government. They led a Greek army of one hundred and ten thousand foot
soldiers, fifty-three hundred horsemen, twenty-two elephants, and three
hundred chariots armed with scythes.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Menelaus also joined them, and with great duplicity kept urging
Antiochus on, not for the welfare of his country, but in the hope of
being established in office.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the King of kings aroused the anger of Antiochus against the
scoundrel. When the king was shown by Lysias that Menelaus was to blame
for all the trouble, he ordered him to be taken to Beroea and executed
there in the customary local method.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` There is at that place a tower seventy-five feet high, full of
ashes, with a circular rim sloping down steeply on all sides toward the
ashes.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` A man guilty of sacrilege or notorious for certain other crimes is
brought up there and then hurled down to destruction.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` In such a manner was Menelaus, the transgressor of the law, fated to
die; he was deprived even of decent burial.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` It was altogether just that he who had committed so many sins
against the altar with its pure fire and ashes should meet his death in
ashes.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The king was advancing, his mind full of savage plans for inflicting
on the Jews worse things than those they suffered in his father's time.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When Judas learned of this, he urged the people to call upon the
LORD night and day, to help them now, if ever,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` when they were about to be deprived of their law, their country,
and their holy temple; and not to allow this nation, which had just
begun to revive, to be subjected again to blasphemous Gentiles.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When they had all joined in doing this, and had implored the
merciful LORD continuously with weeping and fasting and prostrations
for three days, Judas encouraged them and told them to stand ready.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` After a private meeting with the elders, he decided that, before
the king's army could invade Judea and take possession of the city, the
Jews should march out and settle the matter with God's help.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Leaving the outcome to the Creator of the world, and exhorting his
followers to fight nobly to death for the laws, the temple, the city,
the country, and the government, he pitched his camp near Modein.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Giving his men the battle cry "God's Victory," he made a night
attack on the king's pavilion with a picked force of the bravest young
men and killed about two thousand in the camp. They also slew the lead
elephant and its rider.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Finally they withdrew in triumph, having filled the camp with
terror and confusion.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Day was just breaking when this was accomplished with the help and
protection of the LORD.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The king, having had a taste of the Jews' daring, tried to take
their positions by a stratagem.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So he marched against Beth-zur, a strong fortress of the Jews; but
he was driven back, checked, and defeated.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Judas then sent supplies to the men inside,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but Rhodocus, of the Jewish army, betrayed military secrets to the
enemy. He was found out, arrested, and imprisoned.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The king made a second attempt by negotiating with the men of
Beth-zur. After giving them his pledge and receiving theirs, he
withdrew
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and attacked Judas and his men. But he was defeated. Next he heard
that Philip, who was left in charge of the government in Antioch had
rebelled. Dismayed, he parleyed with the Jews, submitted to their
terms, and swore to observe their rights. Having come to this
agreement, he offered a sacrifice, and honored the temple with a
generous donation.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` He approved of Maccabeus and left him as military and civil
governor of the territory from Ptolemais to the region of the Gerrenes.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When he came to Ptolemais, the people of that city were angered by
the peace treaty; in fact they were so indignant that they wanted to
annul its provisions.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Lysias took the platform, defended the treaty as well as he
could and won them over by persuasion. After calming them and gaining
their good will, he returned to Antioch. That is how the king's attack
and withdrawal went.
