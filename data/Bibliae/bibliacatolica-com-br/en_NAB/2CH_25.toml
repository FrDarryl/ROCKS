"1" = ''':sup:`1` Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he
reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother, named Jehoaddan,
was from Jerusalem.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He did what was pleasing in the sight of the LORD, though not
wholeheartedly.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` After he had strengthened his hold on the kingdom, he slew those of
his servants who had killed the king, his father;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` but he did not put their children to death, for he acted according
to what is written in the law, in the Book of Moses, as the LORD
commanded: "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor
children for their fathers; but only for his own guilt shall a man be
put to death."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Amaziah mustered Judah and placed them, out of all Judah and
Benjamin according to their ancestral houses, under leaders of
thousands and of hundreds. When he had counted those of twenty years
and over, he found them to be three hundred thousand picked men fit for
war, capable of handling lance and shield.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He also hired a hundred thousand valiant warriors from Israel for a
hundred talents of silver.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But a man of God came to him and said: "O king, let not the army of
Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with any
Ephraimite.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Instead, go on your own, strongly prepared for the conflict;
otherwise the LORD will defeat you in the face of the enemy. It is God
who has the power to reinforce or to defeat."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Amaziah answered the man of God, "But what is to be done about the
hundred talents that I paid for the troops of Israel?" The man of God
replied, "The LORD can give you much more than that."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Amaziah then disbanded the troops that had come to him from
Ephraim, and sent them home. They, however, became furiously angry with
Judah, and returned home blazing with resentment.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Amaziah now assumed command of his army. They proceeded to the
Valley of Salt, and there they killed ten thousand men of Seir.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The Judahites also brought back another ten thousand alive, whom
they led to the summit of the Rock and then cast down, so that they
were all crushed.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Meanwhile, the mercenaries whom Amaziah had dismissed from battle
service with him raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon.
They killed three thousand of the inhabitants and took away much booty.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Amaziah returned from his conquest of the Edomites he brought
back with him the gods of the people of Seir, which he set up as his
own gods; he bowed down before them and offered sacrifice to them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then the anger of the LORD blazed out against Amaziah, and he sent
a prophet to him who said: "Why have you had recourse to this people's
gods that could not save their own people from your hand?"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` While he was still speaking, however, the king said to him: "Have
you been made the king's counselor? Be silent! Why should it be
necessary to kill you?" Therefore the prophet desisted. "I know,
however," he said, "that God has let you take counsel to your own
destruction, because you have done this thing and have refused to hear
my counsel."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Having taken counsel, King Amaziah of Judah sent messengers to
Joash, son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, "Come,
let us meet each other face to face."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` King Joash of Israel sent this reply to King Amaziah of Judah: "The
thistle of the Lebanon sent a message to the cedar of the Lebanon,
saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for his wife.' But the wild
beasts of the Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle down.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You are thinking, 'See, I have beaten Edom!', and thus ambition
makes you proud. Remain at home. Why involve yourself, and Judah with
you, in misfortune and failure?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Amaziah would not listen, for God had determined to hand them
over because they had had recourse to the gods of Edom.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Therefore King Joash of Israel advanced and he and King Amaziah met
in battle at Beth-shemesh of Judah.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` There Judah was defeated by Israel, and all the Judean soldiers
fled homeward.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` King Joash of Israel captured Amaziah, king of Judah, son of Joash,
son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem. Then he
tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner
Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` He took away all the gold and silver and all the vessels he found
in the house of God with Obed-edom, together with the treasures of the
palace, and hostages as well. Then he returned to Samaria.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, survived Joash, son of
Jehoahaz, king of Israel, by fifteen years.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, can be found
written, as is well known, in the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Now from the time that Amaziah ceased to follow the LORD, a
conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem; hence he fled to
Lachish. But they pursued him to Lachish and put him to death there.

in the City of Judah.

Notas de rodap√©:
25:1-4 - Amaziah, son of Joash, begins his reign and seeks to do what
is right, but not with a sincere heart. This shows that the appearance
of righteousness does not replace the need for a heart truly committed
25:5-10 - Amaziah hires mercenary soldiers, but is warned by a prophet
not to trust them. This warning highlights the importance of depending
on God rather than relying on human strategies for battle (see also
25:11-16 - Amaziah defeats the Edomites and turns away, worshiping
their gods. This transition highlights the danger of allowing temporary
victories to lead to idolatry, reinforcing the need for continued
10:14).
25:17-24 - Amaziah confronts Joash, king of Israel, leading to a
disastrous battle. The dispute between the kingdoms illustrates the
consequences of a proud heart and a lack of respect for God's word (see
25:25-28 - Amaziah is defeated and murdered, ending his life in
unfaithfulness. This narrative serves as a warning about the cost of
straying and the importance of remaining faithful to the Lord to the
