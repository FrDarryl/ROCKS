"1" = ''':sup:`1` Three years later, Judas and his men learned that Demetrius, son of
Seleucus, had sailed into the port of Tripolis with a powerful army and
a fleet,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and that he had occupied the country, after doing away with
Antiochus and his guardian Lysias.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` A certain Alcimus, a former high priest, who had willfully incurred
defilement at the time of the revolt, realized that there was no way
for him to salvage his position and regain access to the holy altar.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So he went to King Demetrius in the year one hundred and fifty-one
and presented him with a gold crown and a palm branch, as well as some
of the customary olive branches from the temple. On that occasion he
kept quiet.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But he found an opportunity to further his mad scheme when he was
invited to the council by Demetrius and questioned about the
dispositions and intentions of the Jews. He replied:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "Those Jews called Hasideans, led by Judas Maccabeus, are
warmongers, who stir up sedition and keep the kingdom from enjoying
peace and quiet.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For this reason, now that I am deprived of my ancestral dignity,
that is to say, the high priesthood, I have come here--
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` first, out of my genuine concern for the king's interests, and
secondly, out of consideration for my own countrymen, since our entire
nation is suffering great affliction from the unreasonable conduct of
the people just mentioned.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When you have informed yourself in detail on these matters, O king,
act in the interest of our country and its hard-pressed people with the
same gracious consideration that you show toward all.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` As long as Judas is around, it is impossible for the state to enjoy
peace."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When he had said this, the other Friends who were hostile to Judas
quickly added fuel to Demetrius' indignation.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The king immediately chose Nicanor, who had been in command of the
elephants, and appointed him governor of Judea. He sent him off
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` with orders to put Judas to death, to disperse his followers, and
to set up Alcimus as high priest of the great temple.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The Gentiles from Judea, who would have banished Judas, came
flocking to Nicanor, thinking that the misfortunes and calamities of
the Jews would mean prosperity for themselves.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that the Gentiles were
rallying to him, they sprinkled themselves with earth and prayed to him
who established his people forever, and who always comes to the aid of
his heritage.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` At their leader's command, they set out at once and came upon the
enemy at the village of Adasa.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Judas' brother Simon had engaged Nicanor, but because of the sudden
appearance of the enemy suffered a slight repulse.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` However, when Nicanor heard of the valor of Judas and his men, and
the great courage with which they fought for their country, he shrank
from deciding the issue by bloodshed.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So he sent Posidonius, Theodotus and Mattathias to arrange an
agreement.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` After a long discussion of the terms, each leader communicated them
to his troops; and when general agreement was expressed, they assented
to the treaty.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` A day was set on which the leaders would meet by themselves. From
each side a chariot came forward and thrones were set in place.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Judas had posted armed men in readiness at suitable points for fear
that the enemy might suddenly carry out some treacherous plan. But the
conference was held in the proper way.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Nicanor stayed on in Jerusalem, where he did nothing out of place.
He got rid of the throngs of ordinary people who gathered around him;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but he always kept Judas in his company, for he had a cordial
affection for the man.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He urged him to marry and have children; so Judas married, settled
down, and shared the common life.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When Alcimus saw their friendship for each other, he took the
treaty that had been made, went to Demetrius, and said that Nicanor was
plotting against the state, and that he had appointed Judas, the
conspirator against the kingdom, to be his successor.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Stirred up by the villain's calumnies, the king became enraged. He
wrote to Nicanor, stating that he was displeased with the treaty, and
ordering him to send Maccabeus as a prisoner to Antioch without delay.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When this message reached Nicanor he was dismayed, for he hated to
break his agreement with a man who had done no wrong.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` However, there was no way of opposing the king, so he watched for
an opportunity to carry out this order by a stratagem.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But Maccabeus noticed that Nicanor was becoming cool in his
dealings with him, and acting with unaccustomed rudeness when they met;
he concluded that this coldness betokened no good. So he gathered
together a large number of his men, and went into hiding from Nicanor.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When Nicanor realized that he had been disgracefully outwitted by
the man, he went to the great and holy temple, at a time when the
priests were offering the customary sacrifices, and ordered them to
surrender Judas.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` As they declared under oath that they did not know where the wanted
man was,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` he raised his right hand toward the temple and swore this oath: "If
you do not hand Judas over to me as prisoner, I will level this shrine
of God to the ground; I will tear down the altar, and erect here a
splendid temple to Dionysus."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` With these words he went away. The priests stretched out their
hands toward heaven, calling upon the unfailing defender of our nation
in these words:
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` "Lord of all, though you are in need of nothing, you have approved
of a temple for your dwelling place among us.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Therefore, O holy One, Lord of all holiness, preserve forever
undefiled this house, which has been so recently purified."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` A certain Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to
Nicanor as a patriot. A man highly regarded, he was called a father of
the Jews because of his love for them.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` In the early days of the revolt, he had been convicted of Judaism,
and had risked body and life in his ardent zeal for it.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Nicanor, to show his detestation of the Jews, sent more than five
hundred soldiers to arrest him.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` He thought that by arresting such a man he would deal the Jews a
hard blow.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` But when these troops, on the point of capturing the tower, were
forcing the outer gate and calling for fire to set the door ablaze,
Razis, now caught on all sides, turned his sword against himself,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` preferring to die nobly rather than fall into the hands of vile men
and suffer outrages unworthy of his noble birth.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` In the excitement of the struggle he failed to strike exactly. So
while the troops rushed in through the doors, he gallantly ran up to
the top of the wall and with manly courage threw himself down into the
crowd.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` But as they quickly drew back and left an opening, he fell into the
middle of the empty space.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Still breathing, and inflamed with anger, he got up and ran through
the crowd, with blood gushing from his frightful wounds.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Then, standing on a steep rock, as he lost the last of his blood,
he tore out his entrails and flung them with both hands into the crowd,
calling upon the Lord of life and of spirit to give these back to him
again. Such was the manner of his death.
