Notas de rodapé:
17:1-2 - Jesus' transfiguration on the mountain is a pivotal moment in

and Elijah points to the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in
17:3-4 - Peter's proposal to build three tents reflects his desire to

17:14-21 - Jesus heals a boy possessed by an evil spirit, and His
rebuke of the disciples for their lack of faith highlights the
