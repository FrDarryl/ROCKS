"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now when the Pharisees with some scribes who had come from Jerusalem
gathered around him,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` they observed that some of his disciples ate their meals with
unclean, that is, unwashed, hands.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` (For the Pharisees and, in fact, all Jews, do not eat without
carefully washing their hands, keeping the tradition of the elders.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And on coming from the marketplace they do not eat without purifying
themselves. And there are many other things that they have
traditionally observed, the purification of cups and jugs and kettles
(and beds).)
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So the Pharisees and scribes questioned him, "Why do your disciples
not follow the tradition of the elders but instead eat a meal with
unclean hands?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He responded, "Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it
is written: 'This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts
are far from me;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines human precepts.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` You disregard God's commandment but cling to human tradition."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He went on to say, "How well you have set aside the commandment of
God in order to uphold your tradition!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Whoever
curses father or mother shall die.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Yet you say, 'If a person says to father or mother, "Any support
you might have had from me is qorban"' (meaning, dedicated to God),
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` you allow him to do nothing more for his father or mother.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` You nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you
have handed on. And you do many such things."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He summoned the crowd again and said to them, "Hear me, all of you,
and understand.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Nothing that enters one from outside can defile that person; but
the things that come out from within are what defile."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` )
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When he got home away from the crowd his disciples questioned him
about the parable.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He said to them, "Are even you likewise without understanding? Do
you not realize that everything that goes into a person from outside
cannot defile,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` since it enters not the heart but the stomach and passes out into
the latrine?" (Thus he declared all foods clean.)
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "But what comes out of a person, that is what defiles.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts,
unchastity, theft, murder,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy,
arrogance, folly.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` All these evils come from within and they defile."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` From that place he went off to the district of Tyre. He entered a
house and wanted no one to know about it, but he could not escape
notice.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Soon a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him.
She came and fell at his feet.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth, and she begged
him to drive the demon out of her daughter.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` He said to her, "Let the children be fed first. For it is not right
to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` She replied and said to him, "Lord, even the dogs under the table
eat the children's scraps."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then he said to her, "For saying this, you may go. The demon has
gone out of your daughter."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When the woman went home, she found the child lying in bed and the
demon gone.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Again he left the district of Tyre and went by way of Sidon to the
Sea of Galilee, into the district of the Decapolis.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And people brought to him a deaf man who had a speech impediment
and begged him to lay his hand on him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He took him off by himself away from the crowd. He put his finger
into the man's ears and, spitting, touched his tongue;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` then he looked up to heaven and groaned, and said to him,
"Ephphatha!" (that is, "Be opened!")
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And (immediately) the man's ears were opened, his speech impediment
was removed, and he spoke plainly.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more he ordered them
not to, the more they proclaimed it.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` They were exceedingly astonished and they said, "He has done all
things well. He makes the deaf hear and (the) mute speak."

Notas de rodap√©:
7:1-13 - Jesus confronts the Pharisees about human tradition and true
purity. He teaches that it is not outward actions, but the heart that
counts with God. True worship comes from a sincere and purified heart
7:14-23 - Jesus teaches that what defiles a person is not what goes
into them, but what comes out of their hearts. This statement goes
against the dietary laws and shows that moral impurity comes from human

7:24-30 - The healing of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter
demonstrates the expansion of Jesus' mission beyond Israel. Jesus
commends the woman's persistent faith, highlighting the importance of
genuine faith regardless of background or social status (see also

communication and relationship with God. This miracle also illustrates
how faith and divine grace can open spiritual "ears" and bring true
