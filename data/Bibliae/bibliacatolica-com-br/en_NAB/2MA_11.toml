"1" = ''':sup:`1` Very soon afterward, Lysias, guardian and kinsman of the king and
head of the government, being greatly displeased at what had happened,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` mustered about eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and
marched against the Jews. His plan was to make Jerusalem a Greek
settlement;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` to levy tribute on the temple, as he did on the sanctuaries of the
other nations; and to put the high priesthood up for sale every year.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He did not take God's power into account at all, but felt exultant
confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his thousands of horsemen,
and his eighty elephants.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he invaded Judea, and when he reached Beth-zur, a fortified place
about twenty miles from Jerusalem, launched a strong attack against it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When Maccabeus and his men learned that Lysias was besieging the
strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with lamentations
and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he exhorted the
others to join him in risking their lives to help their kinsmen. Then
they resolutely set out together.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared
at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing gold weapons.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then all of them together thanked God for his mercy, and their
hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to assault
not only men, but the most savage beasts, yes, even walls of iron.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now that the Lord had shown his mercy toward them, they advanced in
battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions, they laid low eleven
thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred horsemen, and put all the
rest to flight.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Most of those who got away were wounded and stripped of their arms,
while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But Lysias was not a stupid man. He reflected on the defeat he had
suffered, and came to realize that the Hebrews were invincible because
the mighty God was their ally. He therefore sent a message
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` persuading them to settle everything on just terms, and promising
to persuade the king also, and to induce him to become their friend.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Maccabeus, solicitous for the common good, agreed to all that
Lysias proposed; and the king, on his part, granted in behalf of the
Jews all the written requests of Maccabeus to Lysias.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` These are the terms of the letter which Lysias wrote to the Jews:
"Lysias sends greetings to the Jewish people.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` John and Absalom, your envoys, have presented your signed
communication and asked about the matters contained in it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Whatever had to be referred to the king I called to his attention,
and the things that were acceptable he has granted.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If you maintain your loyalty to the government, I will endeavor to
further your interests in the future.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` On the details of these matters I have authorized my
representatives, as well as your envoys, to confer with you.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Farewell." The year one hundred and forty-eight, the twenty-fourth
of Dioscorinthius.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The king's letter read thus: "King Antiochus sends greetings to his
brother Lysias.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now that our father has taken his place among the gods, we wish the
subjects of our kingdom to be undisturbed in conducting their own
affairs.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` We understand that the Jews do not agree with our father's policy
concerning Greek customs but prefer their own way of life. They are
petitioning us to let them retain their own customs.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Since we desire that this people too should be undisturbed, our
decision is that their temple be restored to them and that they live in
keeping with the customs of their ancestors.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Accordingly, please send them messengers to give them our
assurances of friendship, so that, when they learn of our decision,
they may have nothing to worry about but may contentedly go about their
own business."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The king's letter to the people was as follows: "King Antiochus
sends greetings to the Jewish senate and to the rest of the Jews.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` If you are well, it is what we desire. We too are in good health.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Menelaus has told us of your wish to return home and attend to your
own affairs.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Therefore, those who return by the thirtieth of Xanthicus will have
our assurance of full permission
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` to observe their dietary laws and other laws, just as before, and
none of the Jews shall be molested in any way for faults committed
through ignorance.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` I have also sent Menelaus to reassure you.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Farewell." In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the fifteenth
of Xanthicus.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The Romans also sent them a letter as follows: "Quintus Memmius and
Titus Manius, legates of the Romans, send greetings to the Jewish
people.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Whatever Lysias, kinsman of the king, has granted you, we also
approve.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` But the matters on which he passed judgment should be submitted to
the king. As soon as you have considered them, send someone to us with
your decisions so that we may present them to your advantage, for we
are on our way to Antioch.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Make haste, then, to send us those who can inform us of your
intentions.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Farewell." In the year one hundred and forty-eight, the fifteenth
of Xanthicus.
