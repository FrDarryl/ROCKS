no fear of the signs of the heavens, though the nations fear them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For the cult idols of the nations are nothing, wood cut from the
forest, Wrought by craftsmen with the adze,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` adorned with silver and gold. With nails and hammers they are
fastened, that they may not totter.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Like a scarecrow in a cucumber field are they, they cannot speak;

none like you.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` One and all they are dumb and senseless, these idols they teach
about are wooden:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Silver strips brought from Tarshish, and gold from Ophir, The work
of the craftsman and the handiwork of the smelter, Clothed with violet
and purple- all of them the work of artisans.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The LORD is true God, he is the living God, the eternal King,
Before whose anger the earth quakes, whose wrath the nations cannot
endure:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus shall you say of them: Let the gods that did not make heaven
and earth perish from the earth, and from beneath these heavens!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He who made the earth by his power, established the world by his
wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his skill.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar, and he brings up
clouds from the end of the earth; He makes the lightning flash in the
rain, and releases stormwinds from their chambers.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Every man is stupid, ignorant; every artisan is put to shame by his
idol: He has molded a fraud, without breath of life.

if I make light of my wound, I can bear it.

they are no more: no one to pitch my tent, no one to raise its

Therefore they had no success, and all their flocks were scattered.

land: To turn the cities of Judah into a desert haunt of jackals.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` You know, O LORD, that man is not master of his way; Man's course
is not within his choice, nor is it for him to direct his step.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Punish us, O LORD, but with equity, not in anger, lest you have us
dwindle away.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Pour out your wrath on the nations that know you not, on the tribes
that call not upon your name; For they have devoured Jacob utterly, and
laid waste his dwelling.
