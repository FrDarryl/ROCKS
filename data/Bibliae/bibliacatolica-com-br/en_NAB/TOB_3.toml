"1" = ''':sup:`1` Grief-stricken in spirit, I groaned and wept aloud. Then with sobs I
began to pray:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "You are righteous, O Lord, and all your deeds are just; All your
ways are mercy and truth; you are the judge of the world.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And now, O Lord, may you be mindful of me, and look with favor upon
me. Punish me not for my sins, nor for my inadvertent offenses, nor for
those of my fathers. "They sinned against you,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and disobeyed your commandments. So you handed us over to
plundering, exile, and death, till we were an object lesson, a byword,
a reproach in all the nations among whom you scattered us.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` "Yes, your judgments are many and true in dealing with me as my sins
and those of my fathers deserve. For we have not kept your
commandments, nor have we trodden the paths of truth before you.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "So now, deal with me as you please, and command my life breath to
be taken from me, that I may go from the face of the earth into dust.
It is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard insulting
calumnies, and I am overwhelmed with grief. "Lord, command me to be
delivered from such anguish; let me go to the everlasting abode; Lord,
refuse me not. For it is better for me to die than to endure so much
misery in life, and to hear these insults!"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` On the same day, at Ecbatana in Media, it so happened that Raguel's
daughter Sarah also had to listen to abuse, from one of her father's
maids.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For she had been married to seven husbands, but the wicked demon
Asmodeus killed them off before they could have intercourse with her,
as it is prescribed for wives. So the maid said to her: "You are the
one who strangles your husbands! Look at you! You have already been
married seven times, but you have had no joy with any one of your
husbands.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Why do you beat us? Because your husbands are dead? Then why not
join them! May we never see a son or daughter of yours!"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` That day she was deeply grieved in spirit. She went in tears to an
upstairs room in her father's house with the intention of hanging
herself. But she reconsidered, saying to herself: "No! People would
level this insult against my father: 'You had only one beloved
daughter, but she hanged herself because of ill fortune!' And thus
would I cause my father in his old age to go down to the nether world
laden with sorrow. It is far better for me not to hang myself, but to
beg the Lord to have me die, so that I need no longer live to hear such
insults."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` At that time, then, she spread out her hands, and facing the
window, poured out this prayer: "Blessed are you, O Lord, merciful God!
Forever blessed and honored is your holy name; may all your works
forever bless you.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now, O Lord, to you I turn my face and raise my eyes.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Bid me to depart from the earth, never again to hear such insults.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` "You know, O Master, that I am innocent of any impure act with a
man,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And that I have never defiled my own name or my father's name in
the land of my exile. "I am my father's only daughter, and he has no
other child to make his heir, Nor does he have a close kinsman or other
relative whom I might bide my time to marry. I have already lost seven
husbands; why then should I live any longer? But if it please you,
Lord, not to slay me, look favorably upon me and have pity on me; never
again let me hear these insults!"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` At that very time, the prayer of these two suppliants was heard in
the glorious presence of Almighty God.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Raphael was sent to heal them both: to remove the cataracts from
Tobit's eyes, so that he might again see God's sunlight; and to marry
Raguel's daughter Sarah to Tobit's son Tobiah, and then drive the
wicked demon Asmodeus from her. For Tobiah had the right to claim her
before any other who might wish to marry her.In the very moment that
Tobit returned from the courtyard to his house, Raguel's daughter Sarah
