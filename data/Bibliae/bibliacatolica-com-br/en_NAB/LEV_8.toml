he came down from offering the sin offering and holocaust and peace
offering,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Moses and Aaron went into the meeting tent. On coming out they

all the people.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Fire came forth from the LORD'S presence and consumed the holocaust
and the remnants of the fat on the altar. Seeing this, all the people
cried out and fell prostrate.
