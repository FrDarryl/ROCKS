"1" = ''':sup:`1` Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
and Sosthenes our brother,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` to the church of God that is in Corinth, to you who have been
sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be holy, with all those
everywhere who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord
and ours.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I give thanks to my God always on your account for the grace of God
bestowed on you in Christ Jesus,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` that in him you were enriched in every way, with all discourse and
all knowledge,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you wait for
the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He will keep you firm to the end, irreproachable on the day of our
Lord Jesus (Christ).
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` God is faithful, and by him you were called to fellowship with his
Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
all of you agree in what you say, and that there be no divisions among
you, but that you be united in the same mind and in the same purpose.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For it has been reported to me about you, my brothers, by Chloe's
people, that there are rivalries among you.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I mean that each of you is saying, "I belong to Paul," or "I belong
to Apollos," or "I belong to Kephas," or "I belong to Christ."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized
in the name of Paul?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I give thanks (to God) that I baptized none of you except Crispus
and Gaius,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` so that no one can say you were baptized in my name.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` (I baptized the household of Stephanas also; beyond that I do not
know whether I baptized anyone else.)
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and
not with the wisdom of human eloquence, so that the cross of Christ
might not be emptied of its meaning.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the
learning of the learned I will set aside."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Where is the wise one? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of
this age? Has not God made the wisdom of the world foolish?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For since in the wisdom of God the world did not come to know God
through wisdom, it was the will of God through the foolishness of the
proclamation to save those who have faith.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and
foolishness to Gentiles,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but to those who are called, Jews and Greeks alike, Christ the
power of God and the wisdom of God.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the
weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Consider your own calling, brothers. Not many of you were wise by
human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Rather, God chose the foolish of the world to shame the wise, and
God chose the weak of the world to shame the strong,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and God chose the lowly and despised of the world, those who count
for nothing, to reduce to nothing those who are something,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` so that no human being might boast before God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It is due to him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us
wisdom from God, as well as righteousness, sanctification, and
redemption,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` so that, as it is written, "Whoever boasts, should boast in the
Lord."

Notas de rodap√©:
1:10-13 - Paul calls for unity in the church, warning against divisions
caused by loyalty to human leaders. True unity comes from Christ, not
1:18-21 - The message of the cross is foolishness to the wise of this
world, but it is the power of God to those who are saved. This contrast
between human and divine wisdom is central to understanding the gospel
1:26-29 - God chose the weak and the humble to confound the wise and
the mighty, emphasizing that salvation does not come by human wisdom
1:30-31 - Christ is our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
redemption. Salvation is an act of God, not something we can earn, and
it is given to those who humble themselves before His grace (see also
