"1" = ''':sup:`1` The prophet Elisha called one of the guild prophets and said to him:
"Gird your loins, take this flask of oil with you, and go to
Ramoth-gilead.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When you get there, look for Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, son of
Nimshi. Enter and take him away from his companions into an inner
chamber.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` From the flask you have, pour oil on his head, and say, 'Thus says
the LORD: I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and flee
without delay."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The young man (the guild prophet) went to Ramoth-gilead.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When he arrived, the commanders of the army were in session. "I have
a message for you, commander," he said. "For which one of us?" asked
Jehu. "For you, commander," he answered.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the young man poured the
oil on his head and said, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: 'I
anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` You shall destroy the house of Ahab your master; thus will I avenge
the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the other
servants of the LORD shed by Jezebel,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` and by all the rest of the family of Ahab. I will cut off every male
in Ahab's line, whether slave or freeman in Israel.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` I will deal with the house of Ahab as I dealt with the house of
Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and with the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Dogs shall devour Jezebel at the confines of Jezreel, so that no
one can bury her.'" Then he opened the door and fled.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When Jehu rejoined his master's servants, they asked him, "Is all
well? Why did that madman come to you?" You know that kind of man and
his talk, he replied.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But they said, "Not at all! Come, tell us." So he told them what
the young man had said to him, and finally, "Thus says the LORD: 'I
anoint you king over Israel.'"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` At once each took his garment, spread it under Jehu on the bare
steps, blew the trumpet, and cried out, "Jehu is king!"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thus Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, formed a conspiracy
against Joram. Joram, with all Israel, had been besieging Ramoth-gilead
against Hazael, king of Aram,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds the Arameans
had inflicted on him in the battle against Hazael, king of Aram. "If
you are truly with me," Jehu said, "see that no one escapes from the
city to report in Jezreel."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Jehu mounted his chariot and drove to Jezreel, where Joram lay
ill and Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come to visit him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw the troop of Jehu
coming and reported, "I see chariots." "Get a driver," Joram said, "and
send him to meet them and to ask whether all is well."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So a driver went out to meet him and said, "The king asks whether
all is well." "What does it matter to you how things are?" Jehu said.
"Get behind me." The watchman reported to the king, "The messenger has
reached them, but is not returning."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Joram sent a second driver, who went to them and said, "The king
asks whether all is well." "What does it matter to you how things are?"
Jehu replied. "Get behind me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The watchman reported, "The messenger has reached them, but is not
returning. The driving is like that of Jehu, son of Nimshi, in its
fury."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "Prepare my chariot," said Joram. When they had done so, Joram,
king of Israel, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, set out, each in his own
chariot, to meet Jehu. They reached him near the field of Naboth the
Jezreelite.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When Joram recognized Jehu, he asked, "Is all well, Jehu?" "How can
all be well," Jehu replied, "as long as the many fornications and
witchcrafts of your mother Jezebel continue?"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Joram reined about and fled, crying to Ahaziah, "Treason, Ahaziah!"
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders, so that
the arrow went through his heart and he collapsed in his chariot.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Jehu said to his adjutant Bidkar, "Take him and throw him into
the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For I remember that when we were
driving teams behind his father Ahab, the LORD delivered this oracle
against him:
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` 'As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of
his sons,' says the LORD, 'I will repay you for it in that very plot of
ground, says the LORD.' So now take him into this plot of ground, in
keeping with the word of the LORD."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Seeing what was happening, Ahaziah, king of Judah, fled toward
Beth-haggan. Jehu pursued him, shouting, "Kill him too!" And they
pierced him as he rode through the pass of Gur near Ibleam. He
continued his flight as far as Megiddo and died there.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` His servants brought him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him
in the tomb of his ancestors in the City of David.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh year of Joram, son
of Ahab.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When Jezebel learned that Jehu had arrived in Jezreel, she shadowed
her eyes, adorned her hair, and looked down from her window.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` As Jehu came through the gate, she cried out, "Is all well, Zimri,
murderer of your master?"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Jehu looked up to the window and shouted, "Who is on my side?
Anyone?" At this, two or three eunuchs looked down toward him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` "Throw her down," he ordered. They threw her down, and some of her
blood spurted against the wall and against the horses. Jehu rode in
over her body
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and, after eating and drinking, he said: "Attend to that accursed
woman and bury her; after all, she was a king's daughter."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But when they went to bury her, they found nothing of her but the
skull, the feet, and the hands.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` They returned to Jehu, and when they told him, he said, "This is
the sentence which the LORD pronounced through his servant Elijah the
Tishbite: 'In the confines of Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of
Jezebel.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` The corpse of Jezebel shall be like dung in the field in the
confines of Jezreel, so that no one can say: This was Jezebel.'"
