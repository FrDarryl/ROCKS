Israelites were encamped at the spring of Harod near Jezreel.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` As the Philistine lords were marching their groups of a hundred and
a thousand, David and his men were marching in the rear guard with
Achish.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The Philistine chiefs asked, "What are those Hebrews doing here?"
And Achish answered them: "Why, that is David, the officer of Saul,
king of Israel. He has been with me now for a year or two, and I have
no fault to find with him from the day he came over to me until the
present."

"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the Philistine chiefs were angered at this and said to him:
"Send that man back! Let him return to the place you picked out for
him. He must not go down into battle with us, lest during the battle he
become our enemy. For how else can he win back his master's favor, if
not with the heads of these men of ours?

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Is this not the David of whom they sing during their dances, 'Saul

"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Achish summoned David and said to him: "As the LORD lives, you

against your servant from the first day I have been with you to this
day, that I cannot go to fight against the enemies of my lord the
king?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "You know," Achish answered David, "that you are acceptable to me.
But the Philistine chiefs have determined you are not to go up with us
to battle.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So the first thing tomorrow, you and your lord's servants who came
with you, go to the place I picked out for you. Do not decide to take
umbrage at this; you are as acceptable to me as an angel of God. But
make an early morning start, as soon as it grows light, and be on your
way."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So David and his men left early in the morning to return to the
land of the Philistines. The Philistines, however, went on up to
Jezreel.
