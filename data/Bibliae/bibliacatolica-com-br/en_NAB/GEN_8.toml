"2" = ''':sup:`2` The fountains of the abyss and the floodgates of the sky were
closed, and the downpour from the sky was held back.

ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` The waters continued to diminish until the tenth month, and on the
first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains appeared.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` At the end of forty days Noah opened the hatch he had made in the
ark,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and he sent out a raven, to see if the waters had lessened on the
earth. It flew back and forth until the waters dried off from the
earth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then he sent out a dove, to see if the waters had lessened on the
earth.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But the dove could find no place to alight and perch, and it
returned to him in the ark, for there was water all over the earth.
Putting out his hand, he caught the dove and drew it back to him inside
the ark.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` He waited seven days more and again sent the dove out from the ark.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` In the evening the dove came back to him, and there in its bill was

the earth.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` He waited still another seven days and then released the dove once
more; and this time it did not come back.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the six hundred and first year of Noah's life, in the first
month, on the first day of the month, the water began to dry up on the

"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Go out of the ark, together with your wife and your sons and your
sons' wives.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Bring out with you every living thing that is with you--all bodily
creatures, be they birds or animals or creeping things of the earth-and
let them abound on the earth, breeding and multiplying on it."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So Noah came out, together with his wife and his sons and his sons'
wives;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and all the animals, wild and tame, all the birds, and all the
creeping creatures of the earth left the ark, one kind after another.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and choosing from every clean
animal and every clean bird, he offered holocausts on the altar.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` WHEN the LORD smelled the sweet odor, he said to himself: "Never
again will I doom the earth because of man, since the desires of man's
heart are evil from the start; nor will I ever again strike down all
living beings, as I have done.

Summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."
