"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now in regard to spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be
unaware.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` You know how, when you were pagans, you were constantly attracted
and led away to mute idols.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Therefore, I tell you that nobody speaking by the spirit of God
says, "Jesus be accursed." And no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except
by the holy Spirit.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` there are different forms of service but the same Lord;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` there are different workings but the same God who produces all of
them in everyone.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some
benefit.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to
another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by
the one Spirit;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another
discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another
interpretation of tongues.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing
them individually to each person as he wishes.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` As a body is one though it has many parts, and all the parts of the
body, though many, are one body, so also Christ.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews
or Greeks, slaves or free persons, and we were all given to drink of
one Spirit.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now the body is not a single part, but many.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If a foot should say, "Because I am not a hand I do not belong to
the body," it does not for this reason belong any less to the body.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Or if an ear should say, "Because I am not an eye I do not belong
to the body," it does not for this reason belong any less to the body.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the
whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But as it is, God placed the parts, each one of them, in the body
as he intended.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If they were all one part, where would the body be?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But as it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The eye cannot say to the hand, "I do not need you," nor again the
head to the feet, "I do not need you."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Indeed, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are all the
more necessary,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and those parts of the body that we consider less honorable we
surround with greater honor, and our less presentable parts are treated
with greater propriety,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` whereas our more presentable parts do not need this. But God has so
constructed the body as to give greater honor to a part that is without
it,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` so that there may be no division in the body, but that the parts
may have the same concern for one another.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` If (one) part suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if one part is
honored, all the parts share its joy.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Now you are Christ's body, and individually parts of it.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Some people God has designated in the church to be, first,
apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then, mighty deeds; then,
gifts of healing, assistance, administration, and varieties of tongues.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work
mighty deeds?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all
interpret?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts. But I shall show
you a still more excellent way.
