"1" = ''':sup:`1` O stupid Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus
Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I want to learn only this from you: did you receive the Spirit from
works of the law, or from faith in what you heard?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Are you so stupid? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now
ending with the flesh?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Did you experience so many things in vain?--if indeed it was in
vain.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Does, then, the one who supplies the Spirit to you and works mighty
deeds among you do so from works of the law or from faith in what you
heard?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Thus Abraham "believed God, and it was credited to him as
righteousness."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Realize then that it is those who have faith who are children of
Abraham.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Scripture, which saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles
by faith, foretold the good news to Abraham, saying, "Through you shall
all the nations be blessed."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Consequently, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham
who had faith.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For all who depend on works of the law are under a curse; for it is
written, "Cursed be everyone who does not persevere in doing all the
things written in the book of the law."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And that no one is justified before God by the law is clear, for
"the one who is righteous by faith will live."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But the law does not depend on faith; rather, "the one who does
these things will live by them."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Christ ransomed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse
for us, for it is written, "Cursed be everyone who hangs on a tree,"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` that the blessing of Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles
through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the
Spirit through faith.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Brothers, in human terms I say that no one can annul or amend even
a human will once ratified.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his descendant. It
does not say, "And to descendants," as referring to many, but as
referring to one, "And to your descendant," who is Christ.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty
years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God,
so as to cancel the promise.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For if the inheritance comes from the law, it is no longer from a
promise; but God bestowed it on Abraham through a promise.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Why, then, the law? It was added for transgressions, until the
descendant came to whom the promise had been made; it was promulgated
by angels at the hand of a mediator.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now there is no mediator when only one party is involved, and God
is one.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Is the law then opposed to the promises (of God)? Of course not!
For if a law had been given that could bring life, then righteousness
would in reality come from the law.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But scripture confined all things under the power of sin, that
through faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who
believe.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Before faith came, we were held in custody under law, confined for
the faith that was to be revealed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Consequently, the law was our disciplinarian for Christ, that we
might be justified by faith.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a
disciplinarian.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For through faith you are all children of God in Christ Jesus.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed
yourselves with Christ.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free
person, there is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendant,
heirs according to the promise.
