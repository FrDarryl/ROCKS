"1" = ''':sup:`1` At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the reputation of Jesus
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and said to his servants, "This man is John the Baptist. He has been
raised from the dead; that is why mighty powers are at work in him."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now Herod had arrested John, bound (him), and put him in prison on
account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` for John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Although he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, for they
regarded him as a prophet.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But at a birthday celebration for Herod, the daughter of Herodias
performed a dance before the guests and delighted Herod
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` so much that he swore to give her whatever she might ask for.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the
head of John the Baptist."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests who
were present, he ordered that it be given,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and he had John beheaded in the prison.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who
took it to her mother.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` His disciples came and took away the corpse and buried him; and
they went and told Jesus.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew in a boat to a deserted place
by himself. The crowds heard of this and followed him on foot from
their towns.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved
with pity for them, and he cured their sick.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When it was evening, the disciples approached him and said, "This
is a deserted place and it is already late; dismiss the crowds so that
they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` (Jesus) said to them, "There is no need for them to go away; give
them some food yourselves."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But they said to him, "Five loaves and two fish are all we have
here."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then he said, "Bring them here to me,"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five
loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said the
blessing, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who in turn
gave them to the crowds.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the fragments
left over --twelve wicker baskets full.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Those who ate were about five thousand men, not counting women and
children.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he made the disciples get into the boat and precede him to the
other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When
it was evening he was there alone.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed
about by the waves, for the wind was against it.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` During the fourth watch of the night, he came toward them, walking
on the sea.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified.
"It is a ghost," they said, and they cried out in fear.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` At once (Jesus) spoke to them, "Take courage, it is I; do not be
afraid."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Peter said to him in reply, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come
to you on the water."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He said, "Come." Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the
water toward Jesus.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But when he saw how (strong) the wind was he became frightened;
and, beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said
to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` After they got into the boat, the wind died down.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Those who were in the boat did him homage, saying, "Truly, you are
the Son of God."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` After making the crossing, they came to land at Gennesaret.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` When the men of that place recognized him, they sent word to all
the surrounding country. People brought to him all those who were sick
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and begged him that they might touch only the tassel on his cloak,
and as many as touched it were healed.
