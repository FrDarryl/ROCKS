"1" = ''':sup:`1` David received information that the Philistines were attacking
Keilah and plundering the threshing floors.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So he consulted the LORD, inquiring, "Shall I go and defeat these
Philistines?" The LORD answered, "Go, for you will defeat the
Philistines and rescue Keilah."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But David's men said to him: "We are afraid here in Judah. How much
more so if we go to Keilah against the forces of the Philistines!"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Again David consulted the LORD, who answered, "Go down to Keilah,
for I will deliver the Philistines into your power."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` David then went with his men to Keilah and fought with the
Philistines. He drove off their cattle and inflicted a severe defeat on
them, and thus rescued the inhabitants of Keilah.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, who had fled to David, went down with
David to Keilah, taking the ephod with him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Saul was told that David had entered Keilah, he said: "God has
put him in my grip. Now he has shut himself in, for he has entered a
city with gates and bars."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Saul then called all the people to war, in order to go down to
Keilah and besiege David and his men.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When David found out that Saul was planning to harm him, he said to
the priest Abiathar, "Bring forward the ephod."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` David then said: "O LORD God of Israel, your servant has heard a
report that Saul plans to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my
account.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Will they hand me over? And now: will Saul come down as your
servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, tell your servant." The LORD
answered, "He will come down."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` David then asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah deliver me and my
men into the grasp of Saul?" And the LORD answered, "Yes."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and
wandered from place to place. When Saul was informed that David had
escaped from Keilah, he abandoned the expedition.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` David now lived in the refuges in the desert, or in the barren hill
country near Ziph. Though Saul sought him continually, the LORD did not
deliver David into his grasp.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` David was apprehensive because Saul had come out to seek his life;
but while he was at Horesh in the barrens near Ziph,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Saul's son, Jonathan, came down there to David and strengthened his
resolve in the LORD.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He said to him: "Have no fear, my father Saul shall not lay a hand
to you. You shall be king of Israel and I shall be second to you. Even
my father Saul knows this."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They made a joint agreement before the LORD in Horesh, where David
remained, while Jonathan returned to his home.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Some of the Ziphites went up to Saul in Gibeah and said, "David is
hiding among us, now in the refuges, and again at Horesh, or on the
hill of Hachilah, south of the wasteland.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Therefore, whenever the king wishes to come down, let him do so. It
will be our task to deliver him into the king's grasp."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Saul replied: "The LORD bless you for your sympathy toward me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Go now and make sure once more! Take note of the place where he
sets foot" (for he thought, perhaps they are playing some trick on me).
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "Look around and learn in which of all the various hiding places he
is holding out. Then come back to me with sure information, and I will
go with you. If he is in the region, I will search him out among all
the families of Judah."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So they went off to Ziph ahead of Saul. At this time David and his
men were in the desert below Maon, in the Arabah south of the
wasteland.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When Saul and his men came looking for him, David got word of it
and went down to the gorge in the desert below Maon. Saul heard of this
and pursued David into the desert below Maon.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` As Saul moved along one rim of the gorge, David and his men took to
the other. David was in anxious flight to escape Saul, and Saul and his
men were attempting to outflank David and his men in order to capture
them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` when a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Come quickly, because the
Philistines have invaded the land."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Saul interrupted his pursuit of David and went to meet the
Philistines. This is how that place came to be called the Gorge of
Divisions.
