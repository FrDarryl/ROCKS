'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Saul, meanwhile, was trying to destroy the church; entering house
after house and dragging out men and women, he handed them over for
imprisonment.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thus Philip went down to (the) city of Samaria and proclaimed the
Messiah to them.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` With one accord, the crowds paid attention to what was said by
Philip when they heard it and saw the signs he was doing.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` There was great joy in that city.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` A man named Simon used to practice magic in the city and astounded
the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` All of them, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him,
saying, "This man is the 'Power of God' that is called 'Great.'"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` They paid attention to him because he had astounded them by his
magic for a long time,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but once they began to believe Philip as he preached the good news

alike were baptized.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Even Simon himself believed and, after being baptized, became
devoted to Philip; and when he saw the signs and mighty deeds that were
occurring, he was astounded.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted
the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` who went down and prayed for them, that they might receive the holy
Spirit,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` for it had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had only been
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then they laid hands on them and they received the holy Spirit.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred by the laying on of
the apostles' hands, he offered them money
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and said, "Give me this power too, so that anyone upon whom I lay
my hands may receive the holy Spirit."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Peter said to him, "May your money perish with you, because you
thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` You have no share or lot in this matter, for your heart is not

'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Repent of this wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that, if
possible, your intention may be forgiven.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For I see that you are filled with bitter gall and are in the bonds

'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Simon said in reply, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what
you have said may come upon me."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So when they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord,
they returned to Jerusalem and preached the good news to many Samaritan
villages.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, "Get up and head south
on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, the desert route."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So he got up and set out. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a
court official of the Candace, that is, the queen of the Ethiopians, in
charge of her entire treasury, who had come to Jerusalem to worship,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and was returning home. Seated in his chariot, he was reading the
prophet Isaiah.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The Spirit said to Philip, "Go and join up with that chariot."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said,
"Do you understand what you are reading?"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He replied, "How can I, unless someone instructs me?" So he invited
Philip to get in and sit with him.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` This was the scripture passage he was reading: "Like a sheep he was
led to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he
opened not his mouth.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` In (his) humiliation justice was denied him. Who will tell of his
posterity? For his life is taken from the earth."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then the eunuch said to Philip in reply, "I beg you, about whom is
the prophet saying this? About himself, or about someone else?"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then Philip opened his mouth and, beginning with this scripture
passage, he proclaimed Jesus to him.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` As they traveled along the road they came to some water, and the
eunuch said, "Look, there is water. What is to prevent my being
baptized?"
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` .
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Then he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip and the eunuch both
went down into the water, and he baptized him.

"39" = ''':sup:`39` When they came out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched
Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but continued on his way
