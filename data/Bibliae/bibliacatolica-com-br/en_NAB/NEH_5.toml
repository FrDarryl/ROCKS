against certain of their fellow Jews.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Some said: "We are forced to pawn our sons and daughters in order to
get grain to eat that we may live."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Others said: "We are forced to pawn our fields, our vineyards, and
our houses, that we may have grain during the famine."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Still others said: "To pay the king's tax we have borrowed money on
our fields and our vineyards.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And though these are our own kinsmen and our children are as good as
theirs, we have had to reduce our sons and daughters to slavery, and
violence has been done to some of our daughters! Yet we can do nothing
about it, for our fields and our vineyards belong to others."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I was extremely angry when I heard the reasons they had for
complaint.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` After some deliberation, I called the nobles and magistrates to
account, saying to them, "You are exacting interest from your own
kinsmen!" I then rebuked them severely,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` saying to them: "As far as we were able, we bought back our fellow
Jews who had been sold to Gentiles; you, however, are selling your own
brothers, to have them bought back by us." They remained silent, for
they could find no answer.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I continued: "What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in
the fear of our God, and put an end to the derision of our Gentile
enemies?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I myself, my kinsmen, and my attendants have lent the people money
and grain without charge. Let us put an end to this usury!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I ask that you return to them this very day their fields, their
vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, together with the
interest on the money, the grain, the wine, and the oil that you have
lent them."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` They answered: "We will return everything and exact nothing further
from them. We will do just what you ask." Then I called for the priests
and had them administer an oath to these men that they would do as they
had promised.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I also shook out the folds of my garment, saying, "Thus may God
shake from his home and his fortune every man who fails to keep this
promise, and may he thus be shaken out and emptied!" And the whole
assembly answered, "Amen," and praised the LORD. Then the people did as
they had promised.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Moreover, from the time that King Artaxerxes appointed me governor
in the land of Judah, from his twentieth to his thirty-second
year--during these twelve years neither I nor my brethren lived from
the governor's allowance.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The earlier governors, my predecessors, had laid a heavy burden on
the people, taking from them each day forty silver shekels for their
food; then too, their men oppressed the people. But I, because I feared
God, did not act thus.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Moreover, though I had acquired no land of my own, I did my part in
this work on the wall, and all my men were gathered there for the work.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Though I set my table for a hundred and fifty persons, Jews and
magistrates, as well as those who came to us from the nations round
about,

"18" = ''':sup:`18` and though the daily preparations were made at my expense--one
beef, six choice muttons, poultry--besides all kinds of wine in
abundance every ten days, despite this I did not claim the governor's
allowance, for the labor lay heavy upon this people.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Keep in mind, O my God, in my favor all that I did for this people.
