your loins, but do not put it in water.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` I bought the loincloth, as the LORD commanded, and put it on.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` A second time the word of the LORD came to me thus:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Take the loincloth which you bought and are wearing, and go now to
the Parath; there hide it in a cleft of the rock.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Obedient to the LORD'S command, I went to the Parath and buried the
loincloth.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` After a long interval, he said to me: Go now to the Parath and fetch
the loincloth which I told you to hide there.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Again I went to the Parath, sought out and took the loincloth from
the place where I had hid it. But it was rotted, good for nothing!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the message came to me from the LORD:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Thus says the LORD: So also I will allow the pride of Judah to rot,
the great pride of Jerusalem.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This wicked people who refuse to obey my words, who walk in the
stubbornness of their hearts, and follow strange gods to serve and
adore them, shall be like this loincloth which is good for nothing.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For, as close as the loincloth clings to a man's loins, so had I
made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to
me, says the LORD; to be my people, my renown, my praise, my beauty.
But they did not listen.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now speak to them this word: Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel:
Every wineflask is meant to be filled with wine. If they reply, "Do we
not know that every wineflask is meant to be filled with wine?"

"13" = ''':sup:`13` say to them: Thus says the LORD: Beware! I am filling with
drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land, the kings who succeed to
David's throne, the priests and prophets, and all the citizens of
Jerusalem.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I will dash them against each other, fathers and sons together,
says the LORD; I will show no compassion, I will not spare or pity, but
will destroy them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Give ear, listen humbly, for the LORD speaks.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Give glory to the LORD, your God, before it grows dark; Before your
feet stumble on darkening mountains; Before the light you look for
turns to darkness, changes into black clouds.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If you do not listen to this in your pride, I will weep in secret
many tears; My eyes will run with tears for the LORD'S flock, led away
to exile.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Say to the king and to the queen mother: come down from your
throne; From your heads fall your magnificent crowns.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The cities of the Negeb are besieged, with no one to relieve them;
All Judah is banished in universal exile.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Lift up your eyes and see men coming from the north. Where is the
flock entrusted to you, the sheep that were your glory?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` What will you say when they place as rulers over you those whom you
taught to be your lovers? Will not pangs seize you like those of a
woman giving birth?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` If you ask in your heart why these things befall you: For your
great guilt your skirts are stripped away and you are violated.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Can the Ethiopian change his skin? the leopard his spots? As easily
would you be able to do good, accustomed to evil as you are.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` I will scatter them like chaff that flies when the desert wind
blows.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` This is your lot, the portion measured out to you from me, says the
LORD. Because you have forgotten me, and trusted in the lying idol,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` I now will strip off your skirts from you, so that your shame will
appear.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Your adulteries, your neighings, your shameless prostitutions: On
the hills in the highlands I see these horrible crimes of yours. Woe to
you, Jerusalem, how long will it yet be before you become clean!

Judah's impending destruction. The people's pride and confidence in

warns the people not to harden their hearts, for divine judgment is
approaching, and repentance is the only way to avoid calamity (see also
13:18-23 - The humiliation of Judah and the judgment upon the nation
are foretold, for the people have turned away from God. The analogy of
the woman and the girdle illustrates the nearness of the judgment that
will be visited upon Judah (see also 2 Kings 24:10-16 and Lamentations
1:18).
13:24-27 - The people will be scattered among the nations, and their
idolatries will be punished. God speaks against the people's pride,
