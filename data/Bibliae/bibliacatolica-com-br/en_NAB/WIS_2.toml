"1" = ''':sup:`1` they who said among themselves, thinking not aright: "Brief and
troublous is our lifetime; neither is there any remedy for man's dying,
nor is anyone known to have come back from the nether world.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For haphazard were we born, and hereafter we shall be as though we
had not been; Because the breath in our nostrils is a smoke and reason
is a spark at the beating of our hearts,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And when this is quenched, our body will be ashes and our spirit
will be poured abroad like unresisting air.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Even our name will be forgotten in time, and no one will recall our
deeds. So our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud, and will
be dispersed like a mist pursued by the sun's rays and overpowered by
its heat.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For our lifetime is the passing of a shadow; and our dying cannot be
deferred because it is fixed with a seal; and no one returns.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are real, and use
the freshness of creation avidly.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Let us have our fill of costly wine and perfumes, and let no
springtime blossom pass us by;

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Let us oppress the needy just man; let us neither spare the widow

"11" = ''':sup:`11` But let our strength be our norm of justice; for weakness proves
itself useless.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Let us beset the just one, because he is obnoxious to us; he sets
himself against our doings, Reproaches us for transgressions of the law
and charges us with violations of our training.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` He professes to have knowledge of God and styles himself a child of
the LORD.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` To us he is the censure of our thoughts; merely to see him is a
hardship for us,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Because his life is not like other men's, and different are his
ways.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` He judges us debased; he holds aloof from our paths as from things
impure. He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts that God is
his Father.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Let us see whether his words be true; let us find out what will
happen to him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him and
deliver him from the hand of his foes.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` With revilement and torture let us put him to the test that we may
have proof of his gentleness and try his patience.

Notas de rodap√©:
2:1-5 - The wicked doubt God's justice and claim that life is fleeting.
This materialistic view reflects a lack of spiritual understanding and
2:6-9 - The pursuit of temporal pleasures and the denial of any divine
responsibility lead to arrogance. The author emphasizes that true
wisdom opposes this mindset and seeks what is eternal (see also
2:10-12 - The persecution of the righteous is a consequence of
rejecting wisdom. The wicked try to eliminate those who live
righteously, revealing their true nature and contempt for the truth
2:13-16 - The righteous are seen as an affront to the lives of the
wicked, for their righteousness exposes moral corruption. The contrast
between the righteous and the wicked is emphasized, showing how the
light of wisdom overshadows the darkness of unrighteousness (see also
2:17-24 - The death and resurrection of Christ are prefigured in this
passage, which reveals wisdom's victory over death. The assurance of
eternal life for the righteous is a source of hope and encouragement
