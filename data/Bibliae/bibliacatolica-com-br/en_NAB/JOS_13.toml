"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Joshua was old and advanced in years, the LORD said to him:
"Though now you are old and advanced in years, a very large part of the
land still remains to be conquered.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This additional land includes all Geshur and all the districts of
the Philistines
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` (from the stream adjoining Egypt to the boundary of Ekron in the
north is reckoned Canaanite territory, though held by the five lords of
the Philistines in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron); also where
the Avvim are in the south;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` all the land of the Canaanites from Mearah of the Sidonians to
Aphek, and the boundaries of the Amorites;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and the Gebalite territory; and all the Lebanon on the east, from
Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to Labo in the land of Hamath.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` At the advance of the Israelites I will drive out all the Sidonian
inhabitants of the mountain regions between Lebanon and
Misrephoth-maim; at least include these areas in the division of the
Israelite heritage, just as I have commanded you.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now, therefore, apportion among the nine tribes and the half-tribe
of Manasseh the land which is to be their heritage."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Now the other half of the tribe of Manasseh as well as the
Reubenites and Gadites, had received their heritage which Moses, the
servant of the LORD, had given them east of the Jordan:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` from Aroer on the bank of the Wadi Arnon and the city in the wadi

all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` the entire kingdom in Bashan of Og, a survivor of the Rephaim, who
reigned at Ashtaroth and Edrei. Though Moses conquered and occupied
these territories,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` the Israelites did not dislodge the Geshurites and Maacathites, so
that Geshur and Maacath survive in the midst of Israel to this day.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` However, to the tribe of Levi Moses assigned no heritage since, as
the LORD had promised them, the LORD, the God of Israel, is their
heritage.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What Moses gave to the Reubenite clans:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Their territory reached from Aroer, on the bank of the Wadi Arnon,

'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and the other cities of the tableland and, generally, of the
kingdom of Sihon. This Amorite king, who reigned in Heshbon, Moses had
killed, with his vassals, the princes of Midian, who were settled in
the land: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and among their slain followers the Israelites put to the sword
also the soothsayer Balaam, son of Beor.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The boundary of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. These
cities and their villages were the heritage of the clans of the
Reubenites.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` What Moses gave to the Gadite clans:
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Their territory included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half
the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, toward Rabbah (that is,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the
boundary of Lodebar);
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and in the Jordan valley: Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, Zaphon,
the other part of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon, with the bank
of the Jordan to the southeastern tip of the Sea of Chinnereth.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` These cities and their villages were the heritage of the clans of
the Gadites.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` What Moses gave to the clans of the half-tribe of Manasseh:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Their territory included Mahanaim, all of Bashan, the entire
kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, and all the villages of Jair, which are
sixty cities in Bashan.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, once the royal cities of
Og in Bashan, fell to the descendants of Machir, son of Manasseh, for
half the clans descended from Machir.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` These are the portions which Moses gave when he was in the plains
of Moab, beyond the Jordan east of Jericho.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` However, Moses gave no heritage to the tribe of Levi, since the
LORD himself, the God of Israel, is their heritage, as he promised.
