Notas de rodap√©:
3:1-6 - The healing of a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath defies
legal and religious norms, showing that Jesus prioritizes the
restoration of human life over tradition. The Pharisees' reaction
reveals the hardness of their hearts in the face of God's mercy (see
3:7-12 - The crowd follows Jesus because of the miracles He performs,
but He instructs them not to reveal His identity. This indicates that,
while the healings confirm His authority, Jesus wants to focus on His
3:13-19 - Jesus chooses the twelve apostles, establishing a leadership
that will continue His mission on earth. This moment underscores the
importance of divine choice in the formation of the Christian community
6:12-16).
3:20-30 - Jesus is accused of being possessed by Beelzebub, but He
refutes this accusation, explaining that His power comes from God. He
teaches that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is unforgivable,
emphasizing the gravity of the sin of rejecting God's Spirit (see also
3:31-35 - Jesus redefines family ties, saying that those who do God's
will are His true brothers and sisters. This underscores the importance
of obedience to God as the foundation for our relationship with Him and
8:19-21).
