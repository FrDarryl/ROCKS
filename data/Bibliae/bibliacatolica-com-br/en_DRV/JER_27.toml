masters:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I made the earth, and the men, and the beasts that are upon the face
of the earth, by my great power, and by my stretched out arm: and I

is futile and that peace will come only when the people submit to God's
27:12-15 - Jeremiah urges King Zedekiah and the people to submit to
Babylon to avoid destruction. Failure to submit to Nebuchadnezzar would
result in suffering and loss, and true peace would come through

immediate restoration of the temple furnishings. The message is clear:
the temple and sacred objects cannot be restored without first
