"1" = ''':sup:`1` Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God,
through our Lord Jesus Christ:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein
we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that
tribulation worketh patience;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And patience trial; and trial hope;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth
in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time,
die for the ungodly?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man
some one would dare to die.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we
were sinners, according to the time,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his
blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his
life.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin
death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not imputed,
when the law was not.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who
have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who
is a figure of him who was to come.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of
one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace
of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment
indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences,
unto justification.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For if by one man's offence death reigned through one; much more
they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice,
shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation;
so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so
also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin
abounded, grace did more abound.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by
justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
