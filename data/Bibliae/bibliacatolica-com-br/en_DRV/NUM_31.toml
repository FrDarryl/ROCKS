Notas de rodapé:
31:1-6 - God commands Moses to avenge Israel against the Midianites,
marking Moses' last great act of leadership. Just war, under divine
guidance, is intended to eliminate the influence of sin and idolatry

protect and avenge His people. The capture of their possessions and
prisoners reinforces the concept of divine judgment on those who oppose
31:13-18 - Moses is angry because the Israelites spared the Midianite
women, who had led Israel into sin at Peor. This incident shows the
importance of cleansing and holiness among God’s people (see also
31:19-24 - The captured soldiers and goods are purified according to
God's instructions, symbolizing the importance of ritual purity and
separation from sin before returning to the community of Israel (see

people of Israel reflects God's justice and fairness in rewarding those
