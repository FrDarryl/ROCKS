king's servant, saying:
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Go and consult the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all
Juda, concerning the words of this book which is found: for the great
wrath of the Lord is kindled against us, because our fathers have not

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods,
provoking me by all the works of their hands: therefore my indignation

"18" = ''':sup:`18` But to the king of Juda, who sent you to consult the Lord, thus
shall you say: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Forasmuch as thou
hast heard the words of the book,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` And thy heart hath been moved to fear, and thou hast humbled
thyself before the Lord, hearing the words against this place, and the
inhabitants thereof, to wit, that they should become a wonder and a
curse: and thou hast rent thy garments, and wept before me, I also have
heard thee, saith the Lord:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Therefore I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
gathered to thy sepulchre in peace, that thy eyes may not see all the
evils which I will bring; upon this place.
