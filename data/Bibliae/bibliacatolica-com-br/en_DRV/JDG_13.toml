Notas de rodap√©:
13:1 - The people of Israel again do what is evil in the sight of the
Lord and are delivered into the hands of the Philistines. This repeated
cycle of sin, oppression, and repentance is a central theme in the Book
of Judges, demonstrating the need for divine leadership (see also
13:2-5 - The announcement of Samson's birth by a barren woman is a
demonstration of God's power to bring life where there seems to be no
hope. Samson's appointment as judge is an example of God's sovereign
18:14).
13:6-14 - The woman visits an angel of the Lord, who instructs her on
Samson's upbringing and education. The importance of obedience to God's
commandments in the formation of leaders is emphasized, showing that
spiritual education is crucial to the fulfillment of God's purpose (see
13:15-20 - Manoah's request to the angel of the Lord for further
revelation highlights the human search for divine guidance. The angel's
response reaffirms the importance of sacrifice and worship to God,
13:21-25 - The Lord's presence manifests itself in Samson, marking him
as chosen for the mission of delivering Israel. The Spirit of the Lord
begins to move upon Samson, demonstrating the importance of spiritual
Corinthians 12:4-11).
