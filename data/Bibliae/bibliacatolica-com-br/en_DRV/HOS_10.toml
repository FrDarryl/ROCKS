Notas de rodap√©:
10:1-2 - Israel's corruption is compared to a vineyard that produced
adulterated fruit. The people, who should have been faithful to God,
became idolatrous and deceitful. Israel's duplicity is the reason for
their separation from God and the promise of judgment (see also
10:3-6 - Israel is described as a nation that, faced with oppression,
seeks a solution in false hopes and its own strength. Dependence on
idols is a major flaw that will lead to the destruction of the kingdom
10:7-10 - Israel's destruction is imminent, with the king being taken
into exile and the nation suffering divine punishment. The people are
being punished for their rebellion, and God laments their destruction,
but justice is necessary because of their unfaithfulness (see also
10:11-12 - God calls Israel to repentance, comparing them to a land in
need of righteousness. He calls the people to cultivate righteousness
10:13-15 - Israel's sin is compared to a deep wound, and the people
will continue to be punished until they repent. God's judgment is
inevitable, but if the people turn to Him, there will be restoration
