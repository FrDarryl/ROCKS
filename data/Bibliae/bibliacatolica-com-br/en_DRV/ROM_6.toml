longer therein?

baptized in his death?

Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also
may walk in newness of life.

death shall no more have dominion over him.

Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - God's grace should not be used as an excuse for sin, because as
Christians, we have died to sin. Life transformation is evidenced by
6:3-4 - Baptism symbolizes union with Christ in His death and
resurrection, being an act of rebirth to a new life in Christ (see also
6:6-7 - The old human nature was crucified with Christ, so that we are
now freed from the dominion of sin. Justification brings the freedom to
4:22-24).
6:12-14 - The Christian must not allow sin to reign in his mortal body,
but instead offer himself to God as an instrument of righteousness.
Corinthians 6:19-20).
06:23 - The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus. This verse is a crucial contrast between the fate of
3:16).
