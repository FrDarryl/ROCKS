Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-3 - God commands Moses to send 12 spies to explore the land of
Canaan. This marks a time of preparation and confidence in the
fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Israel (see also
13:17-20 - Moses instructs the spies to observe the land, its people,

13:32-33 - The spies' unbelief creates fear among the Israelites,
