"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Tobias sighed, and began to pray with tears,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Saying: Thou art just, O Lord, and all thy judgments are just, and
all thy ways mercy, and truth, and judgment:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And now, O Lord, think of me, and take not revenge of my sins,
neither remember my offenses, nor those of my parents.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore are we delivered
to spoil and to captivity, and death, and are made a fable, and a
reproach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now, O Lord, great are thy judgments, because we have not done
according to thy precepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And now, O Lord, do with me according to thy will, and command my
spirit to be received in peace: for it is better for me to die, than to
live.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now it happened on the same day, that Sara daughter of Raguel, in
Rages a city of the Medes, received a reproach from one of her father's
servant maids,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Because she had been given to seven husbands, and a devil named
Asmodeus had killed them, at their first going in unto her.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So when she reproved the maid for her fault, she answered her,
saying: May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou
murderer of thy husbands.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Wilt thou kill me also, as thou hast already killed seven husbands?
At these words she went into an upper chamber of her house: and for
three days and three nights did neither eat nor drink:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But continuing in prayer with tears besought God, that he would
deliver her from this reproach.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And it came to pass on the third day, when she was making an end of
her prayer, blessing the Lord,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` She said: Blessed is thy name, O God of our fathers: who when thou
hast been angry, wilt shew mercy, and in the time of tribulation
forgivest the sins of them that call upon thee.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` To thee, O Lord, I turn my face, to thee I direct my eyes.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I beg, O Lord, that thou loose me from the bond of this reproach,
or else take me away from the earth.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thou knowest, O Lord, that I never coveted a husband, and have kept
my soul clean from all lust.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Never have I joined myself with them that play: neither have I made
myself partaker with them that walk in lightness.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But a husband I consented to take, with thy fear, not with my lust.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And either I was unworthy of them, or they perhaps were not worthy
of me: because perhaps thou hast kept me for another man.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For thy counsel is not in man's power.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But this every one is sure of that worshippeth thee, that his life,
if it be under trial, shall be crowned: and if it be under tribulation,
it shall be delivered: and if it be under correction, it shall be
allowed to come to thy mercy.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For thou art not delighted in our being lost: because after a storm
thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou pourest in
joyfulness.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Be thy name, O God of Israel, blessed for ever.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` At that time the prayers of them both were heard in the sight of
the glory of the most high God:

"25" = ''':sup:`25` And the holy angel of the Lord, Raphael was sent to heal them both,
whose prayers at one time were rehearsed in the sight of the Lord.
