"1" = ''':sup:`1` And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The man in whose skin or flesh shalt arise a different colour or a
blister, or as it were something shining, that is, the stroke of the
leprosy, shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or any one of his sons.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And if he see the leprosy in his skin, and the hair turned white,
and the place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the
rest of the flesh: it is the stroke of the leprosy, and upon his
judgment he shall be separated.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin, and not lower than
the other flesh, and the hair be of the former colour, the priest shall
shut him up seven days.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And the seventh day he shall look on him: and if the leprosy be
grown no farther, and hath not spread itself in the skin, he shall shut
him up again other seven days.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And on the seventh day, he shall look on him: if the leprosy be
somewhat obscure, and not spread in the skin, he shall declare him
clean, because it is but a scab: and the man shall wash his clothes,
and shall be clean.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But if the leprosy grow again, after he was seen by the priest and
restored to cleanness, he shall be brought to him,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And shall be condemned of uncleanness.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` If the stroke of the leprosy be in a man, he shall be brought to the
priest,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And he shall view him. And when there shall be a white colour in
the skin, and it shall have changed the look of the hair, and the
living flesh itself shall appear:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` It shall be judged an inveterate leprosy, and grown into the skin.
The priest therefore shall declare him unclean, and shall not shut him
up, because he is evidently unclean.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin, and cover
all the skin from the head to the feet, whatsoever falleth under the
sight of the eyes,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The priest shall view him, and shall judge that the leprosy which
he has is very clean: because it is all turned into whiteness, and
therefore the man shall be clean.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But when the live flesh shall appear in him,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled, and shall
be reckoned among the unclean: for live flesh, if it be spotted with
leprosy, is unclean.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And if again it be turned into whiteness, and cover all the man,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The priest shall view him, and shall judge him to be clean.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin, and it
has been healed,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And in the place of the ulcer, there appeareth a white scar, or
somewhat red, the man shall be brought to the priest:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other
flesh, and the hair turned white, he shall declare him unclean, for the
plague of leprosy is broken out in the ulcer.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But if the hair be of the former colour, and the scar somewhat
obscure, and be not lower than the flesh that is near it, he shall shut
him up seven days.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And if it spread, he shall judge him to have the leprosy:
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But if it stay in its place, it is but the scar of an ulcer, and
the man shall be clean.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The flesh also and skin that hath been burnt, and after it is
healed hath a white or a red scar,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The priest shall view it, and if he see it turned white, and the
place thereof is lower than the other skin: he shall declare him
unclean, because the evil of leprosy is broken out in the scar.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But if the colour of the hair be not changed, nor the blemish lower
than the other flesh, and the appearance of the leprosy be somewhat
obscure, he shall shut him up seven days,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And on the seventh day he shall view him: if the leprosy be grown
farther in the skin, he shall declare him unclean.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But if the whiteness stay in its place, and be not very clear, it
is the sore of a burning, and therefore he shall be cleansed, because
it is only the scar of a burning.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a man or
woman, the Priest shall see them,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the hair
yellow, and thinner than usual: he shall declare them unclean, because
it is the leprosy of the head and the beard;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with the flesh
that is near it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up seven days,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And on the seventh day he shall look upon it. If the spot be not
grown, and the hair keep its colour, and the place of the blemish be
even with the other flesh:
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The man shall be shaven all but the place of the spot, and he shall
be shut up other seven days:
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` If on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its place,
and not lower than the other flesh, he shall cleanse him, and his
clothes being washed he shall be clean.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the skin,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow, because he
is evidently unclean.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` But if the spot be stayed, and the hair be black, let him know that
the man is healed, and let him confidently pronounce him clean.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If a whiteness appear in the skin of a man or a woman,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The priest shall view them. If he find that a darkish whiteness
shineth in the skin, let him know that it is not the leprosy, but a
white blemish, and that the man is clean.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` The man whose hair falleth off from his head, he is bald and clean:
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And if the hair fall from his forehead, he is bald before and
clean.

"42" = ''':sup:`42` But if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be risen a
white or reddish colour,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And the priest perceive this, he shall condemn him undoubtedly of
leprosy which is risen in the bald part.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy, and is separated
by the judgment of the priest,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Shall have his clothes hanging loose, his head bare, his mouth
covered with a cloth, and he shall cry out that he is defiled and
unclean.

"46" = ''':sup:`46` All the time that he is a leper and unclean, he shall dwell alone
without the camp.

the leprosy, and shall be shewn to the priest.

"50" = ''':sup:`50` And he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven days:

"51" = ''':sup:`51` 51And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again, if he find
that it if grown, it is a Axed leprosy: he shall judge the garment
unclean, and every thing wherein it shall be found:

"52" = ''':sup:`52` And therefore it shall be burnt with fire.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` But if he see that it is not grown,
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` He shall give orders, and they shall wash that part wherein the
leprosy is, and he shall shut it up other seven days.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned, nor
yet the leprosy spread, he shall judge it unclean, and shall burn it
with fire, for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the
garment, or through the whole.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark, after the garment
is washed, he shall tear it off, and divide it from that which is
sound.

without spot, a flying and wandering leprosy: it must be burnt with
fire.

"58" = ''':sup:`58` If it cease, he shall wash with water the parts that are pure, the
second time, and they shall be clean.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` This is the law touching the leprosy of any woollen or linen
garment, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins, how it
ought to be cleansed, or pronounced unclean.

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-3 - The laws regarding skin diseases, such as leprosy, demonstrate
God's concern for the purity and holiness of His people. The priest's
role was to examine and determine whether someone was unclean,
highlighting the importance of spiritual intercession (see also
13:4-8 - Quarantining people with suspicious spots reflects the
principle of precaution and community protection. The physical and
spiritual health of the people of Israel were inseparable from their
13:9-17 - The declaration of impurity for those with chronic illnesses
shows how persistent and devastating sin and corruption can be in the
spiritual life. Only God can completely restore purity (see also
13:18-23 - Skin diseases following wounds were carefully examined to
ensure there was no contamination. This highlights the importance of
13:45-46 - Those declared unclean were to live in isolation,
symbolizing separation from sin. Temporary exclusion from the camp
represents the separation that sin causes between God and His people
