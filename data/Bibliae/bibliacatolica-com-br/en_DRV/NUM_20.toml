just: there shall be no difficulty in the price, only let us pass

"20" = ''':sup:`20` But he answered: Thou shalt not pass. And immediately he came forth
to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand,

'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people: for he shall not go into the
land which I have given the children of Israel, because he was
incredulous to my words, at the waters of contradiction.

20:6-9 - Moses and Aaron seek God's guidance, and He instructs Moses to
speak to the rock so that water may come out. This event highlights the
20:10-13 - Moses, however, strikes the rock instead of speaking to it,

leaders are held accountable for their actions (see also Deuteronomy
20:14-21 - The Edomites deny passage to the Israelites, despite being
distant relatives. This incident reflects the tensions between the
peoples and the difficulty Israel faces on the road to the Promised
20:22-29 - Aaron's death is narrated when he is succeeded by his son
