"1" = ''':sup:`1` For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in
the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and
sacrifices for sins:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err:
because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to
offer for sins.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is
called by God, as Aaron was.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high
priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten thee.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever,
according to the order of Melchisedech.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering
up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from
death, was heard for his reverence.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by
the things which he suffered:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of
eternal salvation.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered:
because you are become weak to hear.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to
be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and
you are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word
of justice: for he is a little child.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have
their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.
