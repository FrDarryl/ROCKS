vengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their uncleanness, and
uncovered the virgin unto confusion:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And who gavest their wives to he made a prey, and their daughters
into captivity: and all their spoils to be divided to thy servants, who
were zealous with thy zeal: assist, I beseech thee, O Lord God, me a
widow.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For thou hast done the things of old, and hast devised one thing
after another: and what thou hast designed hath been done.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For all thy ways are prepared, and in thy providence thou hast
placed thy judgments.

look upon the camp of the Egyptians, when they pursued armed after thy
servants, trusting in their chariots, and in their horsemen, and in a
multitude of warriors.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Lift up thy arm as from the beginning, and crush their power with
thy power: let their power fall in their wrath, who promise themselves
to violate thy sanctuary, and defile the dwelling place of thy name,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` For thy power, O Lord, is not in a multitude, nor is thy pleasure
in the strength of horses, nor from the beginning have the proud been
