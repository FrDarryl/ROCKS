declared all the words which the Lord had commanded.

'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The Lord said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in the darkness of

Sinai.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` He said to them: Be ready against the third day, and come not near
your wives.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And now the third day was come, and the morning appeared: and
behold thunders began to be heard, and lightning to flash, and a very
thick cloud to cover the mount, and the noise of the trumpet sounded
exceeding loud, and the people that was in the camp, feared.

the camp, they stood at the bottom of the mount.

was drawn out to a greater length: Moses spoke, and God answered him.
'''

mount, and he called Moses unto the top thereof. And when he was gone
up thither,

have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great
multitude of them should perish.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The priests also that come to the Lord, let them be sanctified,
lest he strike them.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Moses said to the Lord: The people cannot come up to mount
Sinai: for thou did charge, and command, saying: Set limits about the
mount, and sanctify it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And the Lord said to him: Go, get thee down: and thou shalt come
up, thou and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people
pass the limits, nor come up to the Lord, lest he kill them.
