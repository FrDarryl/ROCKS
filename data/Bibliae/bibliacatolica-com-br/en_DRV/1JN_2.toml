sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the just:

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but
also for those of the whole world.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his
commandments.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments,
is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God
is perfected; and by this we know that we are in him.

he walked.

commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is
the word which you have heard.

in him and in you; because the darkness is passed, and the true light
now shineth.

darkness even until now.

scandal in him.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in
darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth; because the darkness hath
blinded his eyes.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
you for his name's sake.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him, who is from
the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome
the wicked one.

unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God
abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any
man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` For all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of the flesh,
and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not
of the Father, but is of the world.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof: but he
that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.

Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby
we know that it is the last hour.

been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us; but that they
may be manifest, that they are not all of us.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but
as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is
Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the Son.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that
confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning, abide
in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning,
you also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.

everlasting.

you.

abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you; but as his
unction teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie. And as
it hath taught you, abide in him.
