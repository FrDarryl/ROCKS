"1" = ''':sup:`1` God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with
thy word,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And by thy wisdom hast appointed man, that he should have dominion
over the creature that was made by thee,

"3" = ''':sup:`3` That he should order the world according to equity and justice, and
execute justice with an upright heart:

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne, and cast me not off from
among thy children:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid, a weak man, and
of short time, and falling short of the understanding of judgment and
laws.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For if one be perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom
be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Thou hast chosen me to be king of thy people, and a judge of thy
sons and daughters.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And hast commanded me to build a temple on thy holy mount, and an
altar in the city of thy dwelling place, a resemblance of thy holy
tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning:

know what is acceptable with thee:

"11" = ''':sup:`11` For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and shall lead me
soberly in my works, and shall preserve me by her power.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So shall my works be acceptable, and I shall govern thy people
justly, and shall be worthy of the throne of my father.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For who among men is he that can know the counsel of God? or who
can think what the will of God is?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For the thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels
uncertain.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For the corruptible body is a load upon the soul, and the earthly
habitation presseth down the mind that museth upon many things.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth: and
with labour do we find the things that are before us. But the things
that are in heaven, who shall search out?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And who shall know thy thought, except thou give wisdom, and send
thy Holy Spirit from above:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And so the ways of them that are upon earth may be corrected, and
men may learn the things that please thee?

"19" = ''':sup:`19` For by wisdom they were healed, whosoever have pleased thee, O
Lord, from the beginning.
