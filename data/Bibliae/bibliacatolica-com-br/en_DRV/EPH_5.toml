'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered
himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of
sweetness.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so
much as be named among you, as becometh saints:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no
purpose; but rather giving of thanks.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or
covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and of God.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things
cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Be ye not therefore partakers with them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk
then as children of the light.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and
truth;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Proving what is well pleasing to God:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
rather reprove them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even
to speak of.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light;
for all that is made manifest is light.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of
God.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled
with the holy Spirit,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual
canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, to God and the Father:

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head
of the church. He is the saviour of his body.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives
be to their husbands in all things.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and
delivered himself up for it:
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in
the word of life:
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and
without blemish.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
loveth his wife, loveth himself.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth
it, as also Christ doth the church:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as
himself: and let the wife fear her husband.

the works of darkness and exposing them to the light. The contrast
between light and darkness is a metaphor for the Christian life (see
5:22-33 - Paul teaches about the relationship between husband and wife,
comparing it to the relationship between Christ and the church. The
sacrificial love of husbands and the submission of wives reflect
