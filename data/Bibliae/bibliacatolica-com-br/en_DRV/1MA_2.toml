"1" = ''':sup:`1` In those days arose Mathathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a
priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and he abode in the
mountain of Modin.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he had five sons: John who was surnamed Gaddis:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And Simon, who was surnamed Thasi:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Judas, who was called Machabeus:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Eleazar, who was surnamed Abaron: and Jonathan, who was surnamed
Apphus.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` These saw the evils that were done in the people of Juda, and in
Jerusalem.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Mathathias said: Woe is me, wherefore was I born to see the ruin
of my people, and the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there, when
it is given into the hands of the enemies?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The holy places are come into the hands of strangers: her temple is
become as a man without honour.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The vessels of her glory are carried away captive: her old men are
murdered in the streets, and her young men are fallen by the sword of
the enemies.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` What nation hath not inherited her kingdom, and gotten of her
spoils?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` All her ornaments are taken away. She that was free is made a
slave.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And behold our sanctuary, and our beauty, and our glory is laid
waste, and the Gentiles have defiled them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` To what end then should we live any longer?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Mathathias and his sons rent their garments, and they covered
themselves with haircloth, and made great lamentation.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they that were sent from king Antiochus came thither, to compel
them that were fled into the city of Modin, to sacrifice, and to burn
incense, and to depart from the law of God.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And many of the people of Israel consented, and came to them: but
Mathathias and his sons stood firm.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And they that were sent from Antiochus, answering, said to
Mathathias: Thou art a ruler, and an honourable, and great man in this
city, and adorned with sons, and brethren.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Therefore come thou first, and obey the king's commandment, as all
nations have done, and the men of Juda, and they that remain in
Jerusalem: and thou, and thy sons, shall be in the number of the king's
friends, and enriched with gold, and silver, and many presents.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Mathathias answered, and said with a loud voice: Although all
nations obey king Antiochus, so as to depart every man from the service
of the law of his fathers, and consent to his commandments:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I and my sons, and my brethren will obey the law of our fathers.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` God be merciful unto us: it is not profitable for us to forsake the
law, and the justices of God:
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` We will not hearken to the words of king Antiochus, neither will we
sacrifice, and transgress the commandments of our law, to go another
way.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now as he left off speaking these words, there came a certain Jew
in the sight of all to sacrifice to the idols upon the altar in the
city of Modin, according to the king's commandment.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Mathathias saw and was grieved, and his reins trembled, and his
wrath was kindled according to the judgment of the law, and running
upon him he slew him upon the altar:
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Moreover the man whom king Antiochus had sent, who compelled them
to sacrifice, he slew at the same time, and pulled down the altar.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And shewed zeal for the law, as Phinees did by Zamri the son of
Salomi.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Mathathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying:
Every one that hath zeal for the law, and maintaineth the testament,
let him follow me.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So he, and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they
had in the city.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then many that sought after judgment, and justice, went down into
the desert:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And they abode there, they and their children, and their wives, and
their cattle: because afflictions increased upon them.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And it was told to the king's men, and to the army that was in
Jerusalem in the city of David, that certain men who had broken the
king's commandment, were gone away into the secret places in the
wilderness, and that many were gone after them.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And forthwith they went out towards them, and made war against them
on the sabbath day,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And they said to them: Do you still resist? come forth, and do
according to the edict of king Antiochus, and you shall live.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And they said: We will not come forth, neither will we obey the
king's edict, to profane the sabbath day.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And they made haste to give them battle.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` But they answered them not, neither did they cast a stone at them,
nor stopped up the secret places,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Saying: Let us all die in our innocency: and heaven and earth shall
be witnesses for us, that you put us to death wrongfully.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` So they gave them battle on the sabbath: and they were slain with
their wives, and their children, and their cattle, to the number of a
thousand persons.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And Mathathias and his friends heard of it, and they mourned for
them exceedingly.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And every man said to his neighbour: If we shall all do as our
brethren have done, and not fight against the heathens for our lives,
and our justifications: they will now quickly root us out of the earth.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And they determined in that day, saying: Whosoever shall come up
against us to fight on the sabbath day, we will fight against him: and
we will not all die, as our brethren that were slain in the secret
places.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Then was assembled to them the congregation of the Assideans, the
stoutest of Israel, every one that had a good will for the law.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And all they that fled from the evils, joined themselves to them,
and were a support to them.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And they gathered an army, and slew the sinners in their wrath, and
the wicked men in their indignation: and the rest fled to the nations
for safety.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And Mathathias and his friends went round about, and they threw
down the altars:
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And they circumcised all the children whom they found in the
confines of Israel that were uncircumcised: and they did valiantly.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And they pursued after the children of pride, and the work
prospered in their hands:
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And they recovered the law out of the hands of the nations, and out
of the hands of the kings: and they yielded not the horn to the sinner.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Now the days drew near that Mathathias should die, and he said to
his sons: Now hath pride and chastisement gotten strength, and the time
of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Now therefore, O my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your
lives for the covenant of your fathers.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` And call to remembrance the works of the fathers, which they have
done in their generations: and you shall receive great glory, and an
everlasting name.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was reputed to
him unto justice?
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment, and he was
made lord of Egypt.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Phinees our father, by being fervent in the zeal of God, received
the covenant of an everlasting priesthood.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` Jesus, whilst he fulfilled the word, was made ruler in Israel.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` Caleb, for bearing witness before the congregation, received an
inheritance.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` David by his mercy obtained the throne of an everlasting kingdom.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Elias, while he was full of zeal for the law, was taken up into
heaven.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Ananias and Azarias and Misael by believing, were delivered out of
the flame.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` Daniel in his innocency was delivered out of the mouth of the
lions.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And thus consider through all generations: that none that trust in
him fail in strength.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` And fear not the words of a sinful man, for his glory is dung, and
worms:
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` To day he is lifted up, and to morrow he shall not be found,
because he is returned into his earth; and his thought is come to
nothing.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` You therefore, my sons, take courage, and behave manfully in the
law: for by it you shall be glorious.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel:
give ear to him always, and he shall be a father to you.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` And Judas Machabeus who is valiant and strong from his youth up,
let him be the leader of your army, and he shall manage the war of the
people.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` And you shall take to you all that observe the law: and revenge ye
the wrong of your people.
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` Render to the Gentiles their reward, and take heed to the precepts
of the law.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` And he blessed them, and was joined to his fathers.
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` And he died in the hundred and forty-sixth year: and he was buried
by his sons in the sepulchres of his fathers in Modin, and all Israel
mourned for him with great mourning.
