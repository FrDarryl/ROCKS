"1" = ''':sup:`1` Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down
their back always.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` I say then, have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God
forbid. But by their offence, salvation is come to the Gentiles, that
they may be emulous of them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world, and the
diminution of them, the riches of the Gentiles; how much more the
fulness of them?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For I say to you, Gentiles: as long indeed as I am the apostle of
the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh,
and may save some of them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what
shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root
be holy, so are the branches.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And if some of the branches be broken, and thou, being a wild
olive, art ingrafted in them, and art made partaker of the root, and of
the fatness of the olive tree,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not
the root, but the root thee.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off, that I might be
grafted in.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest
by faith: be not highminded, but fear.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps
he also spare not thee.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed
that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God,
if thou abide in goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural
to thee; and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the good olive
tree; how much more shall they that are the natural branches, be
grafted into their own olive tree?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, (lest
you should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part has
happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall
come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn away
ungodliness from Jacob.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake:
but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the
fathers.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have
obtained mercy, through their unbelief;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also
may obtain mercy.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on
all.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of
God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his
ways!
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his
counsellor?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory
for ever. Amen.

Notas de rodap√©:
11:1-6 - Paul affirms that God has not rejected Israel, for he himself,
as a Jew, is an example that God still maintains a faithful remnant.
Election by grace, not works, is the basis of salvation (see also 1
11:7-10 - Israel's unbelief does not hinder God's plan. He gave them a
spirit of perversion, but He did not completely abandon His people,
allowing the Gentiles to be incorporated into His plan of salvation
11:11-15 - The fall of Israel resulted in the salvation of the
Gentiles, but Paul points out that this is for the salvation of the
Jews as well. The introduction of the Gentiles to the gospel is a
blessing, but the ultimate goal is the restoration of Israel (see also
11:16-24 - Paul uses the metaphor of the olive tree to illustrate the
relationship between Jews and Gentiles. The Gentiles have been grafted
into the olive tree, but they must remain humble and watchful, for the
tree can be cut down if they do not remain faithful to the faith (see
11:25-36 - Paul speaks of the mystery of Israel's salvation and how the
Jews' partial blindness will be removed at the end of time. He
concludes with a hymn of praise to God's wisdom and sovereignty (see
