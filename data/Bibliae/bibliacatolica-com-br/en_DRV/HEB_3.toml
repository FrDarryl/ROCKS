"1" = ''':sup:`1` Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation,
consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his
house.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so
much as he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the
house.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For every house is built by some man: but he that created all
things, is God.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a
testimony of those things which were to be said:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we
hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To day if you shall hear his
voice,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation; in the day of
temptation in the desert,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation,
and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil
heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that
none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the
beginning of his substance firm unto the end.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not
your hearts, as in that provocation.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt
by Moses.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them
that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest:
but to them that were incredulous?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.
