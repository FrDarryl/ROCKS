"1" = ''':sup:`1` Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do)
epistles of commendation to you, or from you?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read
by all men:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by
us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God;
not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of
ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the
letter, but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but the spirit
quickeneth.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones,
was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly
behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is
made void:
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the
ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by
reason of the glory that excelleth.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
remaineth is in glory.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence:
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of
Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made
void.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the
selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken
away (because in Christ it is made void).
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their
heart.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be
taken away.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are
transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit
of the Lord.

Notas de rodap√©:
3:2-3 - Paul praises the Corinthians as living epistles of Christ,
known and read by all. Their spiritual transformation is visible and
3:4-6 - Paul speaks of the confidence we have before God, not because
we are sufficient, but because God empowers us through the Spirit.
Grace is the foundation of Christian ministry, which is based not on
3:7-11 - Paul contrasts the old covenant, which brought death, with the
new covenant in Christ, which brings life and glory. The superiority of
the new covenant is evidenced by the abiding and effective Spirit (see
03:18 - As we behold the glory of Christ, we are transformed from glory
to glory, reflecting the image of God. Sanctification is an ongoing
process in the believer's life, driven by the Spirit's action (see also
