'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover,
as the Lord had commanded.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and
the oracle above.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the

'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the

'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had

'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony over

"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and
the altar, filling it with water.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Moses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the
altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar,
drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were
perfected,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of
the Lord filled it.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the
cloud covering all things and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the
cloud had covered all.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children
of Israel went forward by their troops:
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` If it hung over, they remained in the same place.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a
fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout
all their mansions.
