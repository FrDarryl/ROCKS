and not to please ourselves.

that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have
hope.

one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` That with one mind, and with one mouth, you may glorify God and the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
'''

the honour of God.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also
are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able
to admonish one another.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as
it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me
from God.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles;
sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be

not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost,
so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum, I have
replenished the gospel of Christ.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named,

desire these many years past to come unto you,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that as I
pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you, if
first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you:
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For if the
Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought
also in carnal things to minister to them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to
them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
