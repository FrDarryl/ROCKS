Notas de rodap√©:
22:5 - David is concerned with preparing materials for the temple, as
his son Solomon will be young and inexperienced. David's vision
demonstrates his dedication to establishing a suitable place for God's
22:7-9 - David explains that although he desired to build the temple,
God chose Solomon for the work because of the blood David had shed in
battle. This reveals God's desire for the temple to be built by someone
7:12-13).

emphasizing the importance of following the commandments for the
kingdom's success. Obedience to God's will is essential for prosperity

22:17-19 - David exhorts Israel's leaders to help Solomon and seek God
with all their hearts so that the temple can be completed. Cooperation
