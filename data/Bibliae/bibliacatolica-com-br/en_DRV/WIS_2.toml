responsibility lead to arrogance. The author emphasizes that true
wisdom opposes this mindset and seeks what is eternal (see also

rejecting wisdom. The wicked try to eliminate those who live
righteously, revealing their true nature and contempt for the truth
2:13-16 - The righteous are seen as an affront to the lives of the
wicked, for their righteousness exposes moral corruption. The contrast

passage, which reveals wisdom's victory over death. The assurance of
eternal life for the righteous is a source of hope and encouragement
