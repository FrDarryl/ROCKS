highlights God's sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. The
presence of the cherubim also symbolizes God's majesty and power in all
10:6-7 - God's command to destroy the city is given to armed men. This
reveals the seriousness of God's judgment and justice in punishing
wickedness, while also emphasizing the precise execution of God's plan
10:8-11 - The appearance of the cherubim and the vision of God's throne
