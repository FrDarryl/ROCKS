"1" = ''':sup:`1` And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When
you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, observe the
rest of the sabbath to the Lord.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune
thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits thereof:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land, of the
resting of the Lord: thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune thy
vineyard.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt not reap:
neither shalt thou gather the grapes of the firstfruits as a vintage:
for it is a year of rest to the land:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But they shall be unto you for meat, to thee and to thy manservant,
to thy maidservant and thy hireling, and to the strangers that sojourn
with thee:
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years, that is to say,
seven times seven, which together make forty-nine years:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month, the tenth day
of the month, in the time of the expiation in all your land.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt proclaim
remission to all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is the year of
jubilee. Every man shall return to his possession, and every one shall
go back to his former family:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You shall not sow,
nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither
shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Because of the sanctification of the jubilee: but as they grow you
shall presently eat them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour, or shalt buy of
him; grieve not thy brother: but thou shalt buy of him according to the
number of years from the jubilee.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the
fruits.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The more years remain after the jubilee, the more shall the price
increase: and the less time is counted, so much the less shall the
purchase cost. For he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Do not afflict your countrymen, but let every one fear his God:
because I am the Lord your God.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Do my precepts, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them: that you
may dwell in the land without any fear,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the ground may yield you its fruits, of which you may eat your
fill, fearing no mall's invasion.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But if you say: What shall we eat the seventh year, if we sow not,
nor gather our fruits?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I will give you my blessing the sixth year, and it shall yield the
fruits of three years:
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the eighth year you shall sow, and shall eat of the old fruits,
until the ninth year: till new grow up, you shall eat the old store.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The land also shall not be sold for ever: because it is mine, and
you are strangers and sojourners with me.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For which cause all the country of your possession shall be under
the condition of redemption.

sold it: and the overplus he shall restore to the buyer, and so shall
receive his possession again.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But if his hands find not the means to repay the price, the buyer

possessor.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` If he redeem it not, and the whole year be fully out, the buyer
shall possess it, and his posterity for ever, and it can- not be
redeemed, not even in the jubilee.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But if the house be in a village, that hath no walls, it shall be
sold according to the same law as the fields: if it be not redeemed
before, in the jubilee it shall return to the owner.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The houses of Levites, which are in cities, may always be redeemed:
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` If they be not redeemed, in the jubilee they shall all return to
the owners, because the houses of the cities of the Levites are for
their possessions among the children of Israel.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But let not their suburbs be sold, because it is a perpetual
possession.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` If thy brother be impoverished, and weak of hand, and thou receive
him as a stranger and sojourner, and he live with thee,

thy brother may live with thee.

increase of fruits.

that I might give you the land of Chanaan, and might be your God.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` If thy brother constrained by poverty, sell himself to thee, thou
shalt not oppress him with the service of bondservants:
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` But he shall be as a hireling, and a sojourner: he shall work with
thee until the year of the jubilee,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And afterwards he shall go out with his children, and shall return
to his kindred and to the possession of his fathers,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` For they are my servants, and I brought them out of the land of
Egypt: let them not be sold as bondmen:
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Afflict him not by might, but fear thy God.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Let your bondmen, and your bondwomen, be of the nations that are
round about you.

"45" = ''':sup:`45` And of the strangers that sojourn among you, or that were born of
them in your land, these you shall have for servants:
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And by right of inheritance shall leave them to your posterity, and
shall possess them for ever. But oppress not your brethren the children
of Israel by might.

thy brother being impoverished sell himself to him, or to any of his
race:

shall redeem him:
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, or his kinsman, by blood, or
by affinity. But if he himself be able also, he shall redeem himself,
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto the year
of the jubilee: and counting the money that he was sold for, according
to the number of the years and the reckoning of a hired servant,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` If there be many years that remain until the jubilee, according to
them shall he also repay the price.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` If few, he shall make the reckoning with him according to the
number of the years, and shall repay to the buyer of what remaineth of
the years,
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` His wages being allowed for which he served before: he shall not
afflict him violently in thy sight.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` And if by these means he cannot be redeemed, in the year of the
jubilee he shall go out with his children.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` For the children of Israel are my servants, whom I brought forth
out of the land of Egypt.
