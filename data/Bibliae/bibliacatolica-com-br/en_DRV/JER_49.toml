fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the
Lord.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath,

Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests, and his princes
together.

delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said:
Who shall come to me?

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts,
from all that are round about thee: and you shall be scattered every
one out of one another's sight, neither shall there be any to gather
together them that flee.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to
return, saith the Lord.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Against Edom. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is wisdom no more in
Theman? counsel is perished from her children: their wisdom is become
unprofitable.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Flee and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye inhabitants
of Dedan: for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon him, the time
of his visitation.
'''

bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what was enough
for them.

cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his
neighbours, and he shall not be.

widows shall hope in me.
'''

drink of the cup, shall certainly drink: and shalt thou come off as
innocent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking thou shalt
drink.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra shall become
a desolation, and a reproach, and a desert, and a curse: and all her
cities shall be everlasting wastes.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent to
the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let
us rise up to battle.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations,
despicable among men.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart: O
thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, and endeavourest to lay
hold on the height of the hill : but though thou shouldst make thy nest
as high as an eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the
Lord.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it, shall
be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.
'''

saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no
son of man inhabit it.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the Jordan,
against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon
her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for
who is like to m? and who shall abide me? and who is that shepherd that
can withstand my countenance?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken
concerning Edom: and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the
inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the flock shall cast
them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of their
voice is heard in the Red Sea.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he shall spread
his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of
Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Against Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: for they have
heard very bad tidings, they are troubled as in the sea: through care
they could not rest.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Damascus is undone, she is put to flight, trembling hath seized on
her: anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of joy !
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets: and all the men
of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, rind it shall
devour the strong holds of Benadad.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor, which
Nabuchodonouor king of Babylon destroyed. Thus saith the Lord: Arise,
and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the east.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall carry off
for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels:
and they shall call fear upon them round about.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that inhabit
Asur, saith the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath taken
counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against you.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Arise, and so up to a nation that is at ease, and that dwelleth
securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor bars: they dwell
alone.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And their camels shall be for a spoil, and the multitude of their
cattle for a booty, and I will scatter into every wind them that have
their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction upon them from I all
their confines, saith the Lord.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for ever: no
man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit it.

Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, saying:

and their chief strength.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the fear quarters of
heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds: and there shall
be no nation, to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies, and in the
