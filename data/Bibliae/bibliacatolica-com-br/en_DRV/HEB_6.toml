"1" = ''':sup:`1` Wherefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on
to things more perfect, not laying again the foundation of penance from
dead works, and of faith towards God,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Of the doctrine of baptisms, and imposition of hands, and of the
resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And this will we do, if God permit.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have
tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy
Ghost,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
world to come,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying
again to themselves the Son of God, and making him a mockery.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it,
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth
blessing from God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers, is reprobate, and
very near unto a curse, whose end is to be burnt.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to
salvation; though we speak thus.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the
love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered, and do
minister to the saints.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness
to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` That you become not slothful, but followers of them, who through
faith and patience shall inherit the promises.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by
whom he might swear, swore by himself,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall
multiply thee.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for
confirmation is the end of all their controversy.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the
promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to
lie, we may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to
hold fast the hope set before us.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which
entereth in even within the veil;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest
for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.

Notas de rodapé:
6:1-3 - The author exhorts Christians to advance toward spiritual
maturity by leaving behind elementary principles and seeking the full
knowledge of Christ. Maturity is necessary for a solid Christian life
6:4-6 - The author warns of the danger of apostasy, describing those
who fall away as those who reject God's grace after experiencing it.
6:9-12 - Despite the warning, the author expresses confidence in the
perseverance of his readers and exhorts them to imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit God’s promises (see also
6:13-20 - God's promise to Abraham is used as an example of a sure and
steadfast hope. The hope we have in Christ is an anchor for the soul,
1:2).
