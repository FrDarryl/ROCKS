Notas de rodapé:
21:1-4 - God establishes purity standards for priests, forbidding them
to defile themselves with the dead, except through close relatives.
This emphasizes the holiness that should mark the lives of priests,
reflecting their role as intercessors between God and the people (see
21:5-6 - The priests are instructed to avoid pagan practices such as
shaving their heads or cutting their bodies, common mourning practices.
This emphasizes the separation between the children of Israel and the

3:2 and Titus 1:6).
21:10-12 - The high priest has even more restrictions, such as being
forbidden from tearing his garments or leaving the sanctuary, even in
the event of the death of close family members. This highlights the
high spiritual responsibility and holiness that must be maintained (see
21:16-23 - Priests with physical defects are forbidden from offering
