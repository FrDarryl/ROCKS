To morrow about this time a bushel of fine hour shall be sold for a
stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, in the gate of Samaria.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering
the man of God, said: If the Lord should make hood-gates in heaven, can
that possibly be which thou sayest? And he said: Thou shalt see it with
thy eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now there were four lepers, at the entering in of the gate: and they
said one to another: What mean we to stay here till we die?

"4" = ''':sup:`4` If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine: and if
we will remain here, we must also die: come, therefore, and let us run
over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare us, we shall live: but
if they kill us, we shall but die.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So they arose in the evening, to go to the Syrian camp, And when
they were come to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found
no man there.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise of
chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army, and they said one to
another: Behold the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of
the Hethites, and of the Egyptians, and they are come upon us.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their
tents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to
save their lives.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they
went into one tent, and ate and drank: and they took from thence
silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it: and they came
again, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like
manner, and hid it.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of
good tidings. If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the
morning, we shall be charged with a crime: come, let us go and tell it
in the king's court.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So they came to the gate of the city, and told them, saying: We
went to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no man there, but horses,
and asses tied, and the tents standing.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then the guards of the gate went, and told it within the king's
palace.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he arose in the night and said to his servants: I tell you what
the Syrians have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and
therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the fields,
saying: When they come out of the city we shall take them alive, and
then we may get into the city.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And one of his servants answered: Let us take the five horses that
are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole
multitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed,) and let us send and
see.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp
of the Syrians, saying: Go, and see.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they went after them as far as the Jordan: and behold all the
way was full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away
in their fright, and the messengers returned end told the king.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the people going out pillaged the camp of the Syrians: and a
bushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley
for a stater, according to the word of the Lord.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to stand
at the gate: and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the gate;
and he died, as the man of God had said, when the king came down to
him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And it came to pass according to the word of the man of God, which
he spoke to the king, when he said: Two bushels of barley shall be for
a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater, at this very time to
morrow in the gate of Samaria.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When that lord answered the mall of' God, and said: Although the
Lord should make flood-gates in heaven, could this come to pass which
thou sayest? And he said to him: Thou shalt see with thy eyes, and
shalt not eat thereof.
