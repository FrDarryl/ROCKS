36:1-4 - Jehoahaz is made king of Judah, but is deposed by Necho, king
of Egypt, who installs Eliakim (Jehoiakim) as ruler in his place. This

highlighting God's judgment on the nation for its disobedience (see
36:5-8 - Jehoiakim reigns over Judah in sin and rebellion against God.
He is handed over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, as part of divine
judgment. This event marks the beginning of Jerusalem's fall and
36:9-10 - Jehoiachin, Jehoiakim's successor, reigns briefly before
being taken captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. His capture
symbolizes the continuing decline of Judah and the advancing Babylonian
exile as punishment for the people's sin (see also 2 Kings 24:8-16 and
36:11-14 - Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, rebels against

36:15-23 - The destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians
is described as a consequence of persistent rejection of the warnings
of God's prophets. However, the chapter ends with the proclamation of

rebuilding of the temple, symbolizing divine restoration (see also
