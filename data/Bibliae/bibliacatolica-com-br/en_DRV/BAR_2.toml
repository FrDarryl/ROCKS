"1" = ''':sup:`1` Wherefore the Lord our God hath made good his word, that he spoke to
us, and to our judges that have judged Israel, and to our kings, and to
our princes, and to all Israel and Juda:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In the fifth year, in the seventh day of the month, at the time that
the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` That the Lord would bring upon us great evils, such as never
happened under heaven, as they have come to pass in Jerusalem,
according to the things that are written in the law of Moses:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And Baruch read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias
the son of Joakim king of Juda, and in the hearing of all the people
that came to hear the book.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his
own daughter.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And in the hearing of the nobles, the sons of the kings, and in the
hearing of the ancients, and in the hearing of the people, from the
least even to the greatest of them that dwelt in Babylonia, by the
river Sedi.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And he hath delivered them up to be under the hand of all the kings
that are round about us, to be a reproach, and desolation among all the
people, among whom the Lord hath scattered us.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when they heard it they wept, and fasted, and prayed before the
Lord.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And we are brought under, and are not uppermost: because we have
sinned against the Lord our God, by not obeying his voice.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And they made a collection of money, according to every man's power.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` To the Lord our God belongeth justice: but to us, and to our fathers
confusion of face, as at this day.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And they sent it to Jerusulem to Joakim the priest, the son of
Helcias, the son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people,
that were found with him in Jerusalem:
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For the Lord hath pronounced against us all these evils that are
come upon us:
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` At the time when he received the vessels of the temple of the Lord,
which had been taken away out of the temple, to return them into the
land of Juda the tenth day of the month Sivan, the silver vessels,
which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Juda had made,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And we have not entreated the face of the Lord our God, that we
might return every one of us from our most wicked ways.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` After that Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away
Jechonias, and the princes, and all the powerful men, and the people of
the land from Jerusalem, and brought them bound to Babylon.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the Lord hath watched over us for evil, and hath brought it upon
us: for the Lord is just in all his works which he hath commanded us:
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And they said: Behold we have sent you money, buy with it
holocausts, and frankincense, and make meat offerings, and offerings
for sin at the altar of the Lord our God:
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And we have not hearkened to his voice to walk in the commandments
of the Lord which he hath set before us.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And pray ye for the life of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and
for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as
the days of heaven:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And now, O Lord God of Israel, who hast brought thy people out of
the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and with signs, and with wonders,
and with thy great power, and with a mighty arm, and hast made thee a
name as at this day,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And that the Lord may give us strength, and enlighten our eyes,
that we may live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor the king of
Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and may serve them
many days, and may find favour in their sight.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have acted unjustly, O
Lord our God, against all thy justices.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And pray ye for us to the Lord our God: for we have sinned against
the Lord our God, and his wrath is not turned away from us even to this
day.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Let thy wrath be turned away from us: for we are left a few among
the nations where thou hast scattered us.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And read ye this book, which we have sent to you to be read in the
temple of the Lord, on feasts, and proper days.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Hear, O Lord, our prayers, and our petitions, and deliver us for
thy own sake: and grant that we may find favour in the sight of them
that have led us away:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And you shall say: To the Lord our God belongeth justice, but to us
confusion of our face: as it is come to pass at this day to all Juda,
and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God, and
that thy name is called upon Israel, and upon his posterity.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` To our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our
prophets, and to our fathers.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Look down upon us, O Lord, from thy holy house, and incline thy
ear, and hear us.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` We have sinned before the Lord our God, and have not believed him,
nor put our trust in him:
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Open thy eyes, and behold: for the dead that are in hell, whose
spirit is taken away from their bowels, shall not give glory and
justice to the Lord:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And we were not obedient to him, and we have not harkened to the
voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his commandments, which he hath
given us.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But the soul that is sorrowful for the greatness of evil she hath
done, and goeth bowed down, and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the
hungry soul giveth glory and justice to thee the Lord.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` From the day that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt,
even to this day, we were disobedient to the Lord our God: and going
astray we turned away from hearing his voice.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For it is not for the justices of our fathers that we pour out our
prayers, and beg mercy in thy sight, O Lord our God:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And many evils have cleaved to us, and the curses which the Lord
foretold by Moses his servant: who brought our fathers out of the land
of Egypt, to give us a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this
day.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But because thou hast sent out thy wrath, and thy indignation upon
us, as thou hast spoken by the hand of thy servants the prophets,
saying:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God
according to all the words of the prophets whom he sent to us:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thus saith the Lord: Bow down your shoulder, and your neck, and
serve the king of Babylon: and you shall remain in the land which I
have given to your fathers.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And we have gone away every man after the inclinations of his own
wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the
Lord our God. Chapter2
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to
serve the king of Babylon: I will cause you to depart out of the cities
of Juda, and from without Jerusalem.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And I will take away from you the voice of mirth, and the voice of
joy, and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, and
all the land shall be without any footstep of inhabitants.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And they hearkened not to thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon:
and thou hast made good thy words, which thou spokest by the hands of
thy servants the prophets, that the bones of our kings, and the bones
of our fathers should be removed out of their place:
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And behold they are cast out to the heat of the sun, and to the
frost of the night: and they have died in grievous pains, by famine,
and by the sword, and in banishment.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And thou hast made the temple, in which thy name was called upon,
as it is at this day, for the iniquity of the house of Israel, and the
house of Juda.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And thou hast dealt with us, O Lord our God, according to all thy
goodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine:
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` As thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, in the day when
thou didst command him to write thy law before the children of Israel,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Saying: If you will not hear my voice, this great multitude shall
be turned into a very small number among the nations, where I will
scatter them:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For I know that the people will not hear me, for they are a people
of a stiff neck: but they shall turn to their heart in the land of
their captivity:
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And they shall know that I am the Lord their God: and I will give
them a heart, and they shall understand: and ears, and they shall hear.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and shall
be mindful of my name.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And they shall turn away themselves from their stiff neck, and from
their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers,
that sinned against me.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And I will bring them back again into the land which I promised
with an oath to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they
shall be masters thereof: and I will multiply them, and they shall not
be diminished.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And I will make with them another covenant that shall be
everlasting, to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will
no more remove my people, the children of Israel, out of the land that
I have given them.
