"1" = ''':sup:`1` And it came to pass in Iconium, that they entered together into the
synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a very great multitude both of
the Jews and of the Greeks did believe.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and incensed the minds of the
Gentiles against the brethren.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` A long time therefore they abode there, dealing confidently in the
Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and
wonders to be done by their hands.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the multitude of the city was divided; and some of them indeed
held with the Jews, but some with the apostles.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles and the Jews with
their rulers, to use them contumeliously, and to stone them:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` They understanding it, fled to Lystra, and Derbe, cities of
Lycaonia, and to the whole country round about, and were there
preaching the gospel.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, a
cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` This same heard Paul speaking. Who looking upon him, and seeing that
he had faith to be healed,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Said with a loud voice: Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped up,
and walked.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when the multitudes had seen what Paul had done, they lifted up
their voice in the Lycaonian tongue, saying: The gods are come down to
us in the likeness of men;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And they called Barnabas, Jupiter: but Paul, Mercury; because he
was chief speaker.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The priest also of Jupiter that was before the city, bringing oxen
and garlands before the gate, would have offered sacrifice with the
people.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Which, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul had heard, rending their
clothes, they leaped out among the people, crying,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And saying: Ye men, why do ye these things? We also are mortals,
men like unto you, preaching to you to be converted from these vain
things, to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the
sea, and all things that are in them:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony, doing good from
heaven, giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food
and gladness.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And speaking these things, they scarce restrained the people from
sacrificing to them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now there came thither certain Jews from Antioch, and Iconium: and
persuading the multitude, and stoning Paul, drew him out of the city,
thinking him to be dead.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and entered
into the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught
many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to
continue in the faith: and that through many tribulations we must enter
into the kingdom of God.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And when they had ordained to them priests in every church, and had
prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, in whom they
believed.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perge, they went down
into Attalia:
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been
delivered to the grace of God, unto the work which they accomplished.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when they were come, and had assembled the church, they related
what great things God had done with them, and how he had opened the
door of faith to the Gentiles.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And they abode no small time with the disciples.

Notas de rodap√©:
14:8-18 - Paul and Barnabas heal a crippled man, and the people of
Lystra attempt to worship them. This episode illustrates the human
tendency to idolize leadership figures, but also the importance of
14:19-23 - Paul is stoned and left for dead, but he rises and continues
his mission. This event illustrates the endurance needed to fulfill
14:24-28 - Paul and Barnabas return to Antioch, reporting all that God
has done and how they have opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
This demonstrates the advancement of the mission and God's faithfulness
15:18-19).
