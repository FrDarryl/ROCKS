"1" = ''':sup:`1` I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are
done under the sun, and the tears of the innocent, and they had no
comforter; and they were not able to resist their violence, being
destitute of help from any.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And I praised the dead rather than the living:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor
hath seen the evils that are done under the sun.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that their
industries are exposed to the envy of their neighhour: so in this also
there is vanity, and fruitless care.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh,
saying:

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour, and
vexation of mind.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother,
and yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with
riches, neither doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and
defraud my soul of good things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous
vexation.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one
alone be warmed?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a
threefold cord is not easily broken.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old
and foolish, who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a
kingdom: and another born king is consumed with poverty.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` I saw all men living, that walk under the sun with the second young
man, who shall rise up in his place.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` The number of the people, of all that were before him is infinite:

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Keep thy foot, when thou goest into the house of God, and draw nigh
to hear. For much better is obedience, than the victims of fools, who
know not what evil they do.
