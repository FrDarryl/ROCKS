"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
7:1 - Achan's sin in taking items destined for destruction brings
defeat to Israel at Ai. This emphasizes the importance of holiness and
obedience to God's Word, showing how individual sin can affect the
6:7).
7:2-5 - The defeat at Ai and the distrust it generated among the
Israelites demonstrate that victory is assured only by obedience to
God. Self-reliance can lead to downfall and disillusionment (see also
7:6-9 - Joshua's intercession, questioning God about the defeat,
highlights the importance of communicating with the Lord in times of
crisis. Prayer is an essential tool for seeking guidance and
7:10-13 - God reveals the cause of the defeat, showing that
disobedience brought a curse upon Israel. This highlights the need for
holiness and the seriousness of sin, reinforcing the need to rid
Peter 1:15-16).
7:19-26 - The judgment of Achan and the destruction of his family
highlight the gravity of sin and the need to restore the holiness of
God's people. This teaches about the consequences of sin and the
12:1-2).
