thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember
mercy.

is his strength hid:

his feet.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He stood and measured the earth. He beheld, and melted the nations:
and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces. The hills of the
world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, the curtains of the
land of Madian shall be troubled.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy wrath upon the

thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that

may rest in the day of tribulation: that I may go up to our people that
are girded.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall be no spring in
