Maacha the daughter of Abessalom.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
before him: end his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was
the heart of David his father.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But for David's sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem,
to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Because David had done that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,
and had not turned aside from any thing that he commanded him, all the
days of his life, except the matter of Urias the Hethite.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all the time of his
life.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And the rest of the words of Abiam, and all that he did, are they

And there was war between Abiam and Jeroboam.

'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And he reigned one end forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as did
David his father:
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he took away the effeminate out of the land, and he removed all
the filth of the idols, which his fathers had made.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Moreover he also removed his mother Maacha, from being the princess
in the sacrifices of Priapus, and in the grove which she had
consecrated to him: and he destroyed her den, and broke in pieces the
filthy idol, and burnt it by the torrent Cedron:
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But the high places he did not take away. Nevertheless the heart of
Asa was perfect with the Lord all his days:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and he
had vowed, into the house of the Lord, silver and gold, and vessels.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And there was war between Asa, and Baasa king of Israel all their
days.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Baasa king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, that
no man might go out or come in, of the side of Asa king of Juda.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then Asa took all the silver and gold that remained in the
treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's
house, and delivered it into the hands of his servants : and sent them
to Benadad son of Tabremon the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt
in Damascus, saying:
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and
thy father: therefore I have sent thee presents of silver and gold: and
I desire thee to come, and break thy league with Baasa king of Israel,
that he may depart from me.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Benadad hearkening to king Asa, sent the captains of his army
against the cities of Israel, and they smote Ahion, and Dan, and
Abeldomum Maacha, and all Cenneroth, that is all the land of Nephtali.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And when Baasa had heard this, he left off building Rama, and
returned into Thersa.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But king Asa sent word into all Juda, saying: Let no man be
excused: and they took away the stones from Rama, and the timber
thereof wherewith Baasa had been building, and with them Asa built
Gabaa of Benjamin, and Maspha.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his strength, and all
that he did and the cities that he built, are they not written in the
book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? But in the time of
his old age he was diseased in his feet.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And he slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city
of David his father. And Josaphat his son reigned in his place.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But Nadab the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel the second year
of Asa king of Juda: and he reigned over Israel two years.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of
his father, and in his sins, wherewith he made Israel to sin.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Baasa the son of Ahias of the house of Issachar, conspired
against him, and slew him in Gebbethon, which is a city of the
Philistines: for Nadab and all Israel besieged Gebbethon.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Baasa slew him in the third year of Asa king of Juda, and
reigned in his place.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And when he was king he cut off all the house of Jeroboam: he left
not so much as one soul of his seed, till he had utterly destroyed him,
according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken in the hand of
Ahias the Silonite:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Because of the sin of Jeroboam, which he had sinned, and wherewith
he had made Israel to sin, and for the offence, wherewith he provoked
the Lord the God of Israel.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of
Israel?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And there was war between Asa and Baasa the king of Israel all
their days.
