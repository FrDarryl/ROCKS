"1" = ''':sup:`1` And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his father sojourned.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years
old, was feeding the dock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he
was with the sons of and of Zelpha his father's wives : and he accused
his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in
his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than
all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had
dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose
as it were, end stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down
before my sheaf.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` His brethren answered : Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be
subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words
ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I
saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars
worshipping me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father
rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed?
shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the
thing with himself.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's docks,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I
will send thee to them. And when he answered:
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with
thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So
being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he
sought.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the
docks.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I
heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his
brethren, and found them in Dothain.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And when they saw him afar off, be- fore he came nigh them, they
thought to kill him.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit : and we will
say : Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what
his dreams avail him :
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their
hands, end said:
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into
this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now
he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to
restore him to his father.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him
of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their
way coming from Calaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm,
and myrrh to Egypt.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our
brother, and conceal his blood?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands
be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren
agreed to his words.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of
the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver:
and they led him into Egypt.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy
doth not appear and whither shall I go?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which
they had killed :
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have
found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil
wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And tearing his garments, he put an sackcloth, mourning for his son
a long time.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And alibis children being gathered together to comfort their father
in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down
to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,
