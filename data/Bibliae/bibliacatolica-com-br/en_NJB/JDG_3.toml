previously):
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` the five chiefs of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the
Sidonians, and the Hittites who lived in the range of the Lebanon, from

'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites and Amorites,
the Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` they married their daughters, they gave their own sons to their
daughters and they served their gods.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The Israelites did what is evil in Yahweh's eyes. They forgot Yahweh
their God and served Baals and Asherahs.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then Yahweh's anger blazed out against Israel: he handed them over
to Cushan-Rishathaim king of Edom, and the Israelites were enslaved to
Cushan-Rishathaim for eight years.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The Israelites then cried to Yahweh and Yahweh raised for the
Israelites a deliverer who rescued them, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's
younger brother.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` The spirit of Yahweh was on him; he became judge in Israel and set

then died.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Again the Israelites began doing what is evil in Yahweh's eyes, and
Yahweh strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, since they were
doing what is evil in Yahweh's eyes.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Eglon in conjunction with the sons of Ammon and Amalek marched on
Israel, beat them and captured the City of Palm Trees.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The Israelites were enslaved to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen
years.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The Israelites then cried to Yahweh, and Yahweh raised a deliverer
for them, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjaminite; he was left-handed. The
Israelites appointed him to take their tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Ehud made himself a dagger -- it was double-edged and a foot long
-- and strapped it under his clothes on his right thigh.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. This Eglon was a
very fat man.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Having presented the tribute, Ehud sent away the men who had been
carrying it;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` but he himself, on reaching the Idols which are near Gilgal, went
back and said, 'I have a secret message for you, O king.' The king
commanded silence, and all his attendants withdrew.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Ehud went up to him; he was sitting in his private room upstairs,
where it was cool. Ehud said to him, 'I have a message from God for
you, O king.' The latter immediately rose from his seat.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then Ehud, reaching with his left hand, drew the dagger he was
carrying on his right thigh and thrust it into the king's belly.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The hilt too went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the
blade, since Ehud did not pull the dagger out of his belly again.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Ehud went out through the privies, having shut and bolted the doors
of the upstairs room behind him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When he had gone, the servants came back and looked; the doors of
the upstairs room were bolted. They thought, 'He is probably covering
his feet in the inner part of the cool room.'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` They waited until they became embarrassed, but still he did not
open the doors of the upstairs room. Eventually, they took the key and
opened the door; and there lay their master, dead, on the ground.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Meanwhile, Ehud had got away, passed the Idols and made good his
escape to safety in Seirah.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Once there, he sounded the horn in the highlands of Ephraim, and
the Israelites came down from the hills with him at their head.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he said to them, 'Follow me, because Yahweh has delivered your
enemy Moab into your hands.' So they followed him, seized the fords of
the Jordan against Moab and allowed no one to cross.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` On that occasion they beat the Moabites, some ten thousand men, all
tough and seasoned fighters, and not one escaped.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` That day Moab was humbled under the hand of Israel, and the country
had peace for eighty years.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` After him came Shamgar son of Anath. He routed six hundred of the
