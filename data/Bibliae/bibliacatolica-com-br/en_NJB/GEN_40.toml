"1" = ''':sup:`1` It happened some time later that the king of Egypt's cup-bearer and
his baker offended their master the king of Egypt.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cup-bearer and
the chief baker,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and put them in custody in the house of the commander of the guard,
in the gaol where Joseph was a prisoner.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The commander of the guard assigned Joseph to them to attend to
their wants, and they remained in custody for some time.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now both of them had dreams on the same night, each with its own
meaning for the cup-bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were
prisoners in the gaol.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked
gloomy,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and he asked the two officials who were in custody with him in his
master's house, 'Why these sad looks today?'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They replied, 'We have each had a dream, but there is no one to
interpret it.' 'Are not interpretations God's business?' Joseph asked
them. 'Tell me about them.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So the chief cup-bearer described his dream to Joseph, telling him,
'In my dream there was a vine in front of me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` On the vine were three branches; no sooner had it budded than it
blossomed, and its clusters became ripe grapes.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I had Pharaoh's cup in my hand; I picked the grapes and squeezed
them into Pharaoh's cup, and put the cup into Pharaoh's hand.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` 'This is what it means,' Joseph told him. 'The three branches are
three days.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In another three days Pharaoh will lift up your head by restoring
you to your position. Then you will hand Pharaoh his cup, as you did
before, when you were his cup-bearer.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But be sure to remember me when things go well with you, and keep
faith with me by kindly reminding Pharaoh about me, to get me out of
this house.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews in the first place,
and even here I have done nothing to warrant being put in the dungeon.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The chief baker, seeing that the interpretation had been
favourable, said to Joseph, 'I too had a dream; there were three wicker
trays on my head.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` In the top tray there were all kinds of pastries for Pharaoh, such
as a baker might make, and the birds were eating them off the tray on
my head.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Joseph replied as follows, 'This is what it means: the three trays
are three days.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` In another three days Pharaoh will lift up your head by hanging you
on a gallows, and the birds will eat the flesh off your bones.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And so it happened; the third day was Pharaoh's birthday and he
gave a banquet for all his officials. Of his officials he lifted up the
head of the chief cup-bearer and the chief baker,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` the chief cup-bearer by restoring him to his cup-bearing, so that
he again handed Pharaoh his cup;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and by hanging the chief baker, as Joseph had explained to them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But the chief cup-bearer did not remember Joseph; he had forgotten
him.

Notas de rodap√©:
40:1-4 - Joseph is imprisoned and becomes responsible for the
prisoners. His leadership, even under adverse circumstances,
demonstrates God's sovereignty in his life. Joseph is an example of
integrity and responsibility, even in times of trial (see also
40:5-8 - The dreams of Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker reveal the
importance of dream interpretation in Egyptian culture. Joseph,
trusting in God, offers explanations that highlight his gift and his
37:5-10).
40:9-15 - The interpretation of the cupbearer's dream, which results in
his restoration, shows how God can use difficult situations to further
His will. Joseph also asks the cupbearer to remember him upon his
10:30-31).
40:16-19 - The interpretation of the baker's dream, which predicts his
death, emphasizes the seriousness of divine revelation. This highlights
that not all the results of God's promises are positive, but reflect
12:5).
40:20-23 - The cupbearer forgets Joseph, illustrating the fragility of
human promises. This passage teaches patience and trust in God, even
