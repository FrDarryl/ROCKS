greatest of nations, she is now like a widow. Once the princess of
states, she is now put to forced labour.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` All night long she is weeping, tears running down her cheeks. Not
one of all her lovers remains to comfort her. Her friends have all
betrayed her and become her enemies.

nations she finds no respite; her persecutors all overtake her where
there is no way out.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` The roads to Zion are in mourning; no one comes to her festivals
now. Her gateways are all deserted; her priests groan; her young girls
are grief-stricken; she suffers bitterly.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Her foes now have the upper hand, her enemies prosper, for Yahweh
has made her suffer for her many, many crimes; her children have gone
away into captivity driven in front of the oppressor.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And from the daughter of Zion all her splendour has departed. Her
princes were like stags which could find no pasture, exhausted, as they
flee before the hunter.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Jerusalem remembers her days of misery and distress; when her people
fell into the enemy's clutches there was no one to help her. Her
enemies looked on and laughed at her downfall.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Jerusalem has sinned so gravely that she has become a thing unclean.
All who used to honour her despise her, having seen her nakedness; she
herself groans aloud and turns her face away.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Her filth befouls her skirts -- she never thought to end like this,
and hence her astonishing fall with no one to comfort her. Yahweh, look
at my misery, for the enemy is triumphant!

"10" = ''':sup:`10` The enemy stretched out his hand for everything she treasured; she
saw the heathen enter her sanctuary, whom you had forbidden to enter
your Assembly.

comforter who could revive me is far away. My children are shattered,

all you peoples, and see my sorrow. My young girls and my young men
have gone into captivity. Qophp

expired in the city, as they searched for food to keep themselves
alive.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Look, Yahweh. I am in distress! My inmost being is in ferment; my
heart turns over inside me -- how rebellious I have been! Outside, the
sword bereaves; inside it is like death.

exile and the loss of God's presence. This passage highlights the
consequences of sin and the breaking of the covenant with God (see also
1:3-5 - The city suffers the consequences of the destruction wrought by
