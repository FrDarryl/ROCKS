generation still to come: the praises of Yahweh, his power, the
wonderful deeds he has done.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He instituted a witness in Jacob, he established a law in Israel, he
commanded our ancestors to hand it down to their descendants,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` that a generation still to come might know it, children yet to be
born. They should be sure to tell their own children,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and should put their trust in God, never forgetting God's great
deeds, always keeping his commands,

generation, a generation weak of purpose, their spirit fickle towards
God.

'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` he split rocks in the desert, let them drink as though from the
limitless depths;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` he brought forth streams from a rock, made waters flow down in

torrents; but what of bread? Can he give that, can he provide meat for
his people?'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When he heard them Yahweh vented his anger, fire blazed against
Jacob, his anger mounted against Israel,

heaven;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` mere mortals ate the bread of the Mighty, he sent them as much food
as they could want.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` He roused an east wind in the heavens, despatched a south wind by

dwelling-place.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` They ate as much food as they wanted, he satisfied all their
cravings;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` but their cravings were still upon them, the food was still in
their mouths,

"31" = ''':sup:`31` when the wrath of God attacked them, slaughtering their strongest
men, laying low the flower of Israel.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` Despite all this, they went on sinning, they put no faith in his
marvels.

redeemer.

"37" = ''':sup:`37` their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his
covenant.

oppressor,

"44" = ''':sup:`44` turning their rivers to blood, their streams so that they had
nothing to drink.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` He sent horseflies to eat them up, and frogs to devastate them,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` consigning their crops to the caterpillar, the fruit of their hard
work to the locust;
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` he killed their vines with hail, their sycamore trees with frost,

"48" = ''':sup:`48` delivering up their cattle to hail, and their flocks to
thunderbolts.

"49" = ''':sup:`49` He loosed against them the full heat of his anger, fury, rage and
destruction, a detachment of destroying angels;

'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` as perverse and treacherous as their ancestors, they gave way like
a faulty bow,

their idols.
'''

clutches;

heritage.

wedding-song;

"65" = ''':sup:`65` The Lord arose as though he had been asleep, like a strong man
fighting-mad with wine,

for ever.

his heritage.

Notas de rodapé:
78:1-4 - The psalmist exhorts the people to teach future generations
about God's deeds, so that they will not forget His faithfulness and
greatness. This highlights the importance of tradition and the
6:4).
78:5-8 - God commanded parents to teach His commandments to their
children so that they would trust in the Lord and avoid rebellion.
Religious education is essential to raising a faithful generation (see
78:12-16 - The psalmist recalls God's miracles in the Exodus, such as
the plagues on Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea, to reinforce
confidence in divine sovereignty. These miracles demonstrate God's
105:26–38).
78:17-22 - The people, despite witnessing miracles, continue to disobey
and doubt God. Human unbelief in the face of divine providence is a
78:70-72 - God chooses David as king, taking him from his humble work
as a shepherd to lead Israel with integrity and wisdom. This
demonstrates God's sovereign plan and His care in choosing leaders
13:22).
