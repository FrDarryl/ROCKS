"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the days when the Judges were governing, a famine occurred in the
country and a certain man from Bethlehem of Judah went-he, his wife and
his two sons -- to live in the Plains of Moab.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The man was called Elimelech, his wife Naomi and his two sons Mahlon
and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem of Judah. Going to
the Plains of Moab, they settled there.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she and her two sons were
left.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` These married Moabite women: one was called Orpah and the other
Ruth. They lived there for about ten years.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Mahlon and Chilion then both died too, and Naomi was thus bereft of
her two sons and her husband.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` She then decided to come back from the Plains of Moab with her
daughters-in-law, having heard in the Plains of Moab that God had
visited his people and given them food.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So, with her daughters-in-law, she left the place where she was
living and they took the road back to Judah.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, 'Go back, each of you to
your mother's house.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` May Yahweh show you faithful love, as you have done to those who
have died and to me. Yahweh grant that you may each find happiness with
a husband!' She then kissed them, but they began weeping loudly,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and said, 'No, we shall go back with you to your people.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` 'Go home, daughters,' Naomi replied. 'Why come with me? Have I any
more sons in my womb to make husbands for you?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Go home, daughters, go, for I am now too old to marry again. Even
if I said, "I still have a hope: I shall take a husband this very night
and shall bear more sons,"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` would you be prepared to wait for them until they were grown up?
Would you refuse to marry for their sake? No, daughters, I am bitterly
sorry for your sakes that the hand of Yahweh should have been raised
against me.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` They started weeping loudly all over again; Orpah then kissed her
mother-in-law and went back to her people. But Ruth stayed with her.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Naomi then said, 'Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her
people and to her god. Go home, too; follow your sister-in-law.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Ruth said, 'Do not press me to leave you and to stop going with
you, for wherever you go, I shall go, wherever you live, I shall live.
Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Where you die, I shall die and there I shall be buried. Let Yahweh
bring unnameable ills on me and worse ills, too, if anything but death
should part me from you!'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Seeing that Ruth was determined to go with her, Naomi said no more.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival
set the whole town astir, and the women said, 'Can this be Naomi?'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` To this she replied, 'Do not call me Naomi, call me Mara, for
Shaddai has made my lot bitter.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I departed full, and Yahweh has brought me home empty. Why, then,
call me Naomi, since Yahweh has pronounced against me and Shaddai has
made me wretched?'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` This was how Naomi came home with her daughter-in-law, Ruth the
Moabitess, on returning from the Plains of Moab. They arrived in
Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
