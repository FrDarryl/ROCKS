Valley of Ben-Hinnom. He practised soothsaying, divination and sorcery,
and had dealings with mediums and spirit-guides. He did very many more

'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He put a sculpted image, an idol which he had had made, inside the

Notas de rodap√©:
33:1-6 - Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, turns away from God and promotes
idolatry, including abominable practices such as human sacrifice. His
apostasy highlights the consequences of corrupt leadership and the
gravity of sin (see also Deuteronomy 18:10-12 and 2 Kings 21:1-6).
33:7-9 - Manasseh places an idol in the temple, leading Judah to commit

33:10-13 - After being captured by the Assyrians, Manasseh repents and

immense power of repentance and God's willingness to forgive even the
33:14-16 - After his restoration, Manasseh removes the idols and
restores worship to the Lord. This life transformation demonstrates
that God can redeem even the most lost and bring renewal (see also
33:21-25 - Amon, Manasseh's son, follows in his father's early

Manasseh's repentance, showing that hardness of heart can lead to
