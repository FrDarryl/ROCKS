"1" = ''':sup:`1` Three years after this, Judas and his men learned that Demetrius son
of Seleucus had landed at the port of Tripolis with a strong army and a
fleet,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and that he had occupied the country and had killed Antiochus and
his tutor Lysias.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` A certain Alcimus, a former high priest, had wilfully incurred
defilement at the time of the insurrection; realising that whichever
way he turned there was no security for him, nor any further access to
the holy altar,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` he went to King Demetrius in about the year one hundred and
fifty-one and presented him with a golden crown and a palm, together
with the traditional olive branches from the Temple; there, for that
day, he let the matter rest.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Presently he found an opportunity to further his mad plan. When
Demetrius called him into his council and questioned him about the
dispositions and intentions of the Jews, he replied,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` 'Those Jews called Hasidaeans, who are led by Judas Maccabaeus, are
war-mongers and rebels who are preventing the kingdom from finding
stability.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` That is why, after being deprived of my hereditary dignity -- I mean
the high priesthood -- I have come here now,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` first out of genuine concern for the king's interests, and secondly,
out of a regard for our own fellow-citizens, because the irresponsible
behaviour of those I have mentioned has brought no slight misery on our
entire race.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When your majesty has taken note of all these points, may it please
you to make provision for the welfare of our country and our oppressed
nation, as befits the gracious benevolence you extend to all;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` for, as long as Judas remains alive, the State will never enjoy
peace.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No sooner had he spoken thus than the rest of the King's Friends,
who were hostile to Judas' activities, stoked Demetrius' anger.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The latter at once selected Nicanor, then commander of the
elephants, promoted him to the command of Judaea and despatched him
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` with instructions to dispose of Judas, disperse his followers and
instal Alcimus as high priest of the greatest of temples.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The foreigners in Judaea, who had fled before Judas, flocked to
join Nicanor, thinking that the misfortunes and troubles of the Jews
would be to their own advantage.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When the Jews heard that Nicanor was coming and that the foreigners
were about to attack, they sprinkled dust over themselves and made
supplication to him who had established his people for ever and who
never failed to support his own heritage by direct manifestations.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` On their leader's orders, they at once left the place where they
were and confronted the enemy at the village of Dessau.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Simon, brother of Judas, engaged Nicanor but, owing to the sudden
arrival of the enemy, suffered a slight reverse.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Nicanor, however, had heard how brave Judas and his men were and
how resolutely they always fought for their country, and he did not
dare allow bloodshed to decide the issue.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And so he sent Posidonius, Theodotus and Mattathias to offer the
Jews pledges of friendship and to accept theirs.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` After careful consideration of his terms, the leader communicated
them to his troops, and since they were all clearly of one mind they
agreed to the treaty.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` A day was fixed on which the respective leaders were to meet as
individuals. A litter came out from either side and seats were set up.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Judas had posted armed men in strategic positions, in case of a
sudden treacherous move by the enemy. The leaders held their conference
and reached agreement.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Nicanor took up residence in Jerusalem and did nothing out of place
there; indeed, he sent away the crowds that had flocked to join him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` He kept Judas constantly with him, becoming deeply attached to him
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and encouraged him to marry and have children. Judas married,
settled down and led a normal life.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When Alcimus saw how friendly the two men had become, he went to
Demetrius with a copy of the treaty they had signed and told him that
Nicanor was harbouring thoughts against the interests of the State, and
was planning that Judas, an enemy of the realm, should fill the next
vacancy among the Friends of the King.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The king flew into a rage; roused by the slanders of this villain,
he wrote to Nicanor, telling him of his strong displeasure at these
agreements and ordering him immediately to send Maccabaeus to Antioch
in chains.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When the letter reached Nicanor, he was very much upset, for he
disliked the prospect of breaking an agreement with a man who had done
nothing wrong.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Since, however, there was no way of opposing the king, he waited
for an opportunity to carry out the order by a stratagem.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Maccabaeus began to notice that Nicanor was treating him more
sharply and that his manner of speaking to him was more abrupt than it
had been, and he concluded that such sharpness could have no very good
motive. He therefore collected a considerable number of his followers
and got away form Nicanor.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The latter, realising that the man had well and truly outmanoeuvred
him, went to the greatest and holiest of Temples when the priests were
offering the customary sacrifices, and ordered them to surrender Judas.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` When they protested on oath that they did not know where the wanted
man could be,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` he stretched out his right hand towards the Temple and swore this
oath, 'If you do not hand Judas over to me as prisoner, I shall rase
this dwelling of God to the ground, I shall demolish the altar, and on
this very spot I shall erect a splendid temple to Dionysus.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` With these words he left them. The priests stretched out their
hands to heaven, calling on him who has at all times done battle for
our nation; this was their prayer:
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` 'O Lord in need of nothing, it has pleased you that the Temple
where you dwell should be here with us.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Now, therefore, holy Lord of all holiness, preserve for ever from
all profanation this House, so newly purified.'
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Now, a man called Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was
denounced to Nicanor. He was a man who loved his countrymen and stood
high in their esteem, and he was known as the father of the Jews
because of his kindness.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` In the earlier days of the insurrection he had been convicted of
Judaism, and he had risked both life and limb for Judaism with the
utmost zeal.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Nicanor, by way of demonstrating the enmity he had for the Jews,
sent over five hundred soldiers to arrest him,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` reckoning that if he eliminated this man he would be dealing them a
severe blow.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` When the troops were on the point of capturing the tower and were
forcing the outer door and calling for fire to set the doors alight,
Razis, finding himself completely surrounded, fell on his own sword,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` nobly resolving to die rather than fall into the clutches of these
villains and suffer outrages unworthy of his noble birth.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` But in the heat of conflict he missed his thrust, and while the
troops swarmed in through the doorways, he ran nimbly upstairs to the
parapet and manfully threw himself down among the troops.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` But, as they immediately drew back, he fell into the middle of the
empty space.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Still breathing, and blazing with anger, he struggled to his feet,
blood spurting in all directions, and despite his terrible wounds ran
right through the crowd; then, taking his stand on a steep rock,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` although he had now lost every drop of blood, he tore out his
entrails and taking them in both hands flung them down on the crowd,
calling on the Master of his life and spirit to give them back to him
one day. Thus he died.
