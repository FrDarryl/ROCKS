[26]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a famine in the country -- different from the previous
famine which took place in the time of Abraham -- and Isaac went to
Abimelech, the Philistine king at Gerar.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Yahweh had appeared to him and said, 'Do not go down to Egypt; stay
in the country which I shall point out to you.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Remain for the present in that country; I shall be with you and
bless you, for I shall give all these countries to you and your
descendants in fulfilment of the oath I swore to your father Abraham.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I shall make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven,
and I shall give them all these countries, and all nations on earth
will bless themselves by your descendants
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` in return for Abraham's obedience; for he kept my charge, my
commandments, my statutes and my laws.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Isaac stayed at Gerar.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When the people of the place asked him about his wife he replied,
'She is my sister,' for he was afraid to say, 'She is my wife,'
thinking, 'The people of the place will kill me because of Rebekah,
since she is beautiful.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When he had been there some time, Abimelech the Philistine king
happened to look out of the window and saw Isaac fondling his wife
Rebekah.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Abimelech summoned Isaac and said to him, 'Surely she must be your
wife! How could you have said, "She is my sister"?' Isaac replied,
'Because I thought I might be killed on her account.'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Abimelech said, 'What a thing to do to us! One of the people might
easily have slept with your wife. We should have incurred guilt, thanks
to you.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then Abimelech issued this order to all the people: 'Whoever
touches this man or his wife will be put to death.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Isaac sowed his crops in that country, and that year he reaped a
hundredfold. Yahweh blessed him
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and the man became rich; he prospered more and more until he was
very rich indeed.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He acquired flocks and herds and a large retinue. The Philistines
began to envy him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The Philistines had blocked up all the wells dug by his father's
servants -- in the days of his father Abraham -- filling them in with
earth.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Abimelech said to Isaac, 'You must leave us, for you have
become much more powerful than we are.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Isaac left; he pitched camp in the Valley of Gerar and there he
stayed.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Isaac reopened the wells dug by the servants of his father Abraham
and blocked up by the Philistines after Abraham's death, and he gave
them the same names as his father had given them.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But when Isaac's servants, digging in the valley, found a well of
spring-water there,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` the herdsmen of Gerar disputed it with Isaac's herdsmen, saying,
'That water is ours!' So Isaac named the well Esek, because they had
disputed with him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They dug another well, and there was a dispute over that one too;
so he named it Sitnah.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he left there, and dug another well, and since there was no
dispute over this one, he named it Rehoboth, saying, 'Now Yahweh has
made room for us to thrive in the country.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` From there he went up to Beersheba.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Yahweh appeared to him the same night and said: I am the God of
your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I shall bless
you and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham's sake.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` There he built an altar and invoked the name of Yahweh. There he
pitched his tent, and there Isaac's servants sank a well.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Abimelech came from Gerar to see him, with Ahuzzath his adviser and
Phicol the commander of his army.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Isaac said to them, 'Why do you come to me since you hate me, and
have made me leave you?'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` 'It became clear to us that Yahweh was with you,' they replied,
'and so we thought, "It is time to have a treaty sworn between us,
between us and you." So let us make a covenant with you:
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` that you will not do us any harm, since we never molested you but
were unfailingly kind to you and let you go away in peace. Henceforth,
Yahweh's blessing on you!'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He then made them a feast and they ate and drank.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Early next morning, they exchanged oaths. Then Isaac bade them
farewell and they left him as friends.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` It happened, the same day, that Isaac's servants brought him news
about the well they had been digging. 'We have found water!' they said
to him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So he called the well Sheba, and hence the town is named Beersheba
to this day.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` When Esau was forty years old he married Judith daughter of Beeri
the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` These were a bitter disappointment to Isaac and Rebekah.
