"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Jesus heard that the Pharisees had found out that he was making
and baptising more disciples than John-
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` though in fact it was his disciples who baptised, not Jesus himself-
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he left Judaea and went back to Galilee.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He had to pass through Samaria.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` On the way he came to the Samaritan town called Sychar near the land
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Jacob's well was there and Jesus, tired by the journey, sat down by
the well. It was about the sixth hour.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, 'Give
me something to drink.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The Samaritan woman said to him, 'You are a Jew. How is it that you
ask me, a Samaritan, for something to drink?' -- Jews, of course, do
not associate with Samaritans.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Jesus replied to her: If you only knew what God is offering and who
it is that is saying to you, 'Give me something to drink,' you would
have been the one to ask, and he would have given you living water.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` 'You have no bucket, sir,' she answered, 'and the well is deep: how
do you get this living water?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Are you a greater man than our father Jacob, who gave us this well
and drank from it himself with his sons and his cattle?'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Jesus replied: Whoever drinks this water will be thirsty again;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` but no one who drinks the water that I shall give will ever be
thirsty again: the water that I shall give will become a spring of
water within, welling up for eternal life.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` 'Sir,' said the woman, 'give me some of that water, so that I may
never be thirsty or come here again to draw water.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` 'Go and call your husband,' said Jesus to her, 'and come back
here.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The woman answered, 'I have no husband.' Jesus said to her, 'You
are right to say, "I have no husband";
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` for although you have had five, the one you now have is not your
husband. You spoke the truth there.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` 'I see you are a prophet, sir,' said the woman.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` 'Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, though you say that
Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Jesus said: Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you will
worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know; for
salvation comes from the Jews.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But the hour is coming -- indeed is already here -- when true
worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth: that is the
kind of worshipper the Father seeks.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` God is spirit, and those who worship must worship in spirit and
truth.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The woman said to him, 'I know that Messiah -- that is, Christ --
is coming; and when he comes he will explain everything.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Jesus said, 'That is who I am, I who speak to you.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` At this point his disciples returned and were surprised to find him
speaking to a woman, though none of them asked, 'What do you want from
her?' or, 'What are you talking to her about?'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The woman put down her water jar and hurried back to the town to
tell the people,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` 'Come and see a man who has told me everything I have done; could
this be the Christ?'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` This brought people out of the town and they made their way towards
him.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, 'Rabbi, do have something
to eat';
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` but he said, 'I have food to eat that you do not know about.'
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So the disciples said to one another, 'Has someone brought him
food?'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But Jesus said: My food is to do the will of the one who sent me,
and to complete his work.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Do you not have a saying: Four months and then the harvest? Well, I
tell you, look around you, look at the fields; already they are white,
ready for harvest!
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Already the reaper is being paid his wages, already he is bringing
in the grain for eternal life, so that sower and reaper can rejoice
together.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For here the proverb holds true: one sows, another reaps;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` I sent you to reap a harvest you have not laboured for. Others have
laboured for it; and you have come into the rewards of their labour.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Many Samaritans of that town believed in him on the strength of the
woman's words of testimony, 'He told me everything I have done.'
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` So, when the Samaritans came up to him, they begged him to stay
with them. He stayed for two days, and
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` many more came to believe on the strength of the words he spoke to
them;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and they said to the woman, 'Now we believe no longer because of
what you told us; we have heard him ourselves and we know that he is
indeed the Saviour of the world.'
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` When the two days were over Jesus left for Galilee.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` He himself had declared that a prophet is not honoured in his own
home town.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` On his arrival the Galileans received him well, having seen all
that he had done at Jerusalem during the festival which they too had
attended.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` He went again to Cana in Galilee, where he had changed the water
into wine. And there was a royal official whose son was ill at
Capernaum;
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` hearing that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judaea, he went and
asked him to come and cure his son, as he was at the point of death.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Jesus said to him, 'Unless you see signs and portents you will not
believe!'
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` 'Sir,' answered the official, 'come down before my child dies.'
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` 'Go home,' said Jesus, 'your son will live.' The man believed what
Jesus had said and went on his way home;
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` and while he was still on the way his servants met him with the
news that his boy was alive.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` He asked them when the boy had begun to recover. They replied, 'The
fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.'
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` The father realised that this was exactly the time when Jesus had
said, 'Your son will live'; and he and all his household believed.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` This new sign, the second, Jesus performed on his return from
Judaea to Galilee.
