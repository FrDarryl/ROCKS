"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then he looked angrily round at them, grieved to find them so
obstinate, and said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' He stretched
it out and his hand was restored.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` The Pharisees went out and began at once to plot with the Herodians
against him, discussing how to destroy him.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeside, and great crowds
from Galilee followed him. From Judaea,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and Transjordan and the region
of Tyre and Sidon, great numbers who had heard of all he was doing came
to him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he asked his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of
the crowd, to keep him from being crushed.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` For he had cured so many that all who were afflicted in any way
were crowding forward to touch him.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, would fall down
before him and shout, 'You are the Son of God!'

"12" = ''':sup:`12` But he warned them strongly not to make him known.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` He now went up onto the mountain and summoned those he wanted. So
they came to him

"14" = ''':sup:`14` and he appointed twelve; they were to be his companions and to be
sent out to proclaim the message,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` with power to drive out devils.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And so he appointed the Twelve, Simon to whom he gave the name

"20" = ''':sup:`20` He went home again, and once more such a crowd collected that they
could not even have a meal.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` When his relations heard of this, they set out to take charge of
him; they said, 'He is out of his mind.'

"22" = ''':sup:`22` The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying,
'Beelzebul is in him,' and, 'It is through the prince of devils that he
drives devils out.'

"23" = ''':sup:`23` So he called them to him and spoke to them in parables,

"24" = ''':sup:`24` 'How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against
itself, that kingdom cannot last.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` And if a household is divided against itself, that household can
never last.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now if Satan has rebelled against himself and is divided, he cannot
last either -- it is the end of him.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` But no one can make his way into a strong man's house and plunder
his property unless he has first tied up the strong man. Only then can
he plunder his house.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` 'In truth I tell you, all human sins will be forgiven, and all the
blasphemies ever uttered;

"29" = ''':sup:`29` but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be
forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin.'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` This was because they were saying, 'There is an unclean spirit in

"31" = ''':sup:`31` Now his mother and his brothers arrived and, standing outside, sent
in a message asking for him.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` A crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to
him, 'Look, your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for
you.'

"33" = ''':sup:`33` He replied, 'Who are my mother and my brothers?'

Notas de rodap√©:
3:1-6 - The healing of a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath defies
legal and religious norms, showing that Jesus prioritizes the
restoration of human life over tradition. The Pharisees' reaction
reveals the hardness of their hearts in the face of God's mercy (see
3:7-12 - The crowd follows Jesus because of the miracles He performs,
but He instructs them not to reveal His identity. This indicates that,
while the healings confirm His authority, Jesus wants to focus on His
3:13-19 - Jesus chooses the twelve apostles, establishing a leadership
that will continue His mission on earth. This moment underscores the
importance of divine choice in the formation of the Christian community
6:12-16).
3:20-30 - Jesus is accused of being possessed by Beelzebub, but He
refutes this accusation, explaining that His power comes from God. He
teaches that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is unforgivable,
emphasizing the gravity of the sin of rejecting God's Spirit (see also
3:31-35 - Jesus redefines family ties, saying that those who do God's
will are His true brothers and sisters. This underscores the importance
of obedience to God as the foundation for our relationship with Him and
8:19-21).
