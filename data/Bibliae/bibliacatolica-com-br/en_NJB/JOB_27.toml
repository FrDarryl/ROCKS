"1" = ''':sup:`1` And Job continued his solemn discourse. He said:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I swear by the living God who denies me justice, by Shaddai who has
filled me with bitterness,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` that as long as a shred of life is left in me, and the breath of God
breathes in my nostrils,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` my lips will never speak evil nor my tongue utter any lie.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Far from admitting you to be in the right, I shall maintain my
integrity to my dying day.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I take my stand on my uprightness, I shall not stir: in my heart I
need not be ashamed of my days.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Let my enemy meet the fate of the wicked, my adversary, the lot of
the evil-doer!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For what hope does the godless have when he prays and raises his
soul to God?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Is God likely to hear his cries when disaster descends on him?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Did he make Shaddai all his delight, calling on him at every turn?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But I am showing you the way that God works, making no secret of
Shaddai's designs.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And if you had all understood them for yourselves, you would not
have wasted your breath in empty words.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` This is the fate that God assigns to the wicked, the inheritance
that the violent receive from Shaddai.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Though he have many children, it is but for the sword; his
descendants will never have enough to eat.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Plague will bury those he leaves behind him, and their widows will
have no chance to mourn them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Though he amass silver like dust and gather fine clothes like clay,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` let him gather!-some good man will wear them, while his silver is
shared among the upright.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` All he has built himself is a spider's web, made himself a
watchman's shack.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He goes to bed rich, but never again: he wakes to find it has all
gone. As drought and heat make snow disappear, so does Sheol anyone who
has sinned.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Terror assails him in broad daylight, and at night a whirlwind
sweeps him off. The womb that shaped him forgets him and his name is
recalled no longer. Thus wickedness is blasted as a tree is struck.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` An east wind picks him up and drags him away, snatching him up from
his homestead. He used to ill-treat the childless woman and show no
kindness to the widow.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Pitilessly he is turned into a target, and forced to flee from the
hands that menace him. But he who lays mighty hold on tyrants rises up
to take away a life that seemed secure.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` His downfall is greeted with applause, he is hissed wherever he
goes.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` He had his time of glory, now he vanishes, wilting like the
saltwort once it is picked, and withering like an ear of corn.
