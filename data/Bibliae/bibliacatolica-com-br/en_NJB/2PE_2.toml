be brought into disrepute on their account.
'''

"6" = ''':sup:`6` He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by reducing them to
ashes as a warning to future sinners;

"7" = ''':sup:`7` but rescued Lot, an upright man who had been sickened by the
debauched way in which these vile people behaved-
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` for that upright man, living among them, was outraged in his upright

"9" = ''':sup:`9` All this shows that the Lord is well able to rescue the good from
their trials, and hold the wicked for their punishment until the Day of
Judgement,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` especially those who follow the desires of their corrupt human
nature and have no respect for the Lord's authority. Such self-willed

complaint or accusation against them in the Lord's presence.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` But these people speak evil of what they do not understand; they
are like brute beasts, born only to be caught and killed, and like
beasts they will be destroyed, being injured in return for the injuries
they have inflicted.

blots, and amuse themselves by their trickery even when they are
sharing your table;

"14" = ''':sup:`14` with their eyes always looking for adultery, people with an
insatiable capacity for sinning, they will seduce any but the most
stable soul. Where greed is concerned they are at their peak of

and the gloom of darkness is stored up for them.

have scarcely escaped from those who live in error, by playing on the
disordered desires of their human nature and by debaucheries.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` and anyone who has escaped the pollution of the world by coming to
know our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and who then allows himself to
be entangled and mastered by it a second time, ends up by being worse
than he was before.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` It would have been better for them never to have learnt the way of
uprightness, than to learn it and then desert the holy commandment that
was entrusted to them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` What they have done is exactly as the proverb rightly says: The dog
goes back to its vomit and: As soon as the sow has been washed, it
wallows in the mud.
