"1" = ''':sup:`1` I urge you, then, brothers, remembering the mercies of God, to offer
your bodies as a living sacrifice, dedicated and acceptable to God;
that is the kind of worship for you, as sensible people.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Do not model your behaviour on the contemporary world, but let the
renewing of your minds transform you, so that you may discern for
yourselves what is the will of God -- what is good and acceptable and
mature.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And through the grace that I have been given, I say this to every
one of you: never pride yourself on being better than you really are,
but think of yourself dispassionately, recognising that God has given
to each one his measure of faith.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Just as each of us has various parts in one body, and the parts do
not all have the same function:
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` in the same way, all of us, though there are so many of us, make up
one body in Christ, and as different parts we are all joined to one
another.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then since the gifts that we have differ according to the grace that
was given to each of us: if it is a gift of prophecy, we should
prophesy as much as our faith tells us;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` if it is a gift of practical service, let us devote ourselves to
serving; if it is teaching, to teaching;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` if it is encouraging, to encouraging. When you give, you should give
generously from the heart; if you are put in charge, you must be
conscientious; if you do works of mercy, let it be because you enjoy
doing them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Let love be without any pretence. Avoid what is evil; stick to what
is good.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` In brotherly love let your feelings of deep affection for one
another come to expression and regard others as more important than
yourself.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` In the service of the Lord, work not halfheartedly but with
conscientiousness and an eager spirit.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Be joyful in hope, persevere in hardship; keep praying regularly;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` share with any of God's holy people who are in need; look for
opportunities to be hospitable.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Bless your persecutors; never curse them, bless them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Rejoice with others when they rejoice, and be sad with those in
sorrow.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Give the same consideration to all others alike. Pay no regard to
social standing, but meet humble people on their own terms. Do not
congratulate yourself on your own wisdom.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Never pay back evil with evil, but bear in mind the ideals that all
regard with respect.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` As much as possible, and to the utmost of your ability, be at peace
with everyone.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Never try to get revenge: leave that, my dear friends, to the
Retribution. As scripture says: Vengeance is mine -- I will pay them
back, the Lord promises.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And more: If your enemy is hungry, give him something to eat; if
thirsty, something to drink. By this, you will be heaping red-hot coals
on his head.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Do not be mastered by evil, but master evil with good.
