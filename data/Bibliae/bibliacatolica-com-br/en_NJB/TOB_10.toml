"1" = ''':sup:`1` Every day, meanwhile, Tobit kept reckoning the days required for the
journey there and the journey back. The full number went by, and still
his son had not come.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then he thought, 'I hope he has not been delayed there! I hope
Gabael is not dead, so that no one will give him the silver.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he began to worry.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` His wife Anna kept saying, 'My son is dead! He is no longer among
the living!' And she began to weep and mourn over her son. She kept
saying,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` 'Alas! I should never have let you leave me, my child, you, the
light of my eyes.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Tobit would reply, 'Hush, my sister! Do not worry. All is well
with him. Something has happened there to delay them. His companion is
someone we can trust, one of our kinsmen at that. Do not lose heart, my
sister.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` He will soon be here.' But all she would say was, 'Leave me alone;
do not try to deceive me. My child is dead.' And every day she would go
abruptly out to watch the road by which her son had left. She trusted
no eyes but her own. Once the sun had set she would come home again,
only to weep and moan all night, unable to sleep. After the fourteen
days of feasting that Raguel had sworn to keep for his daughter's
marriage, Tobias came to him and said,' Let me go now; my father and
mother must have lost all hope of seeing me again. So I beg you father,
to let me return to my father's house; I have told you the plight he
was in when I left him.'

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Raguel said to Tobias, 'Stay, my son, stay with me. I shall send
messengers to your father Tobit to give him news of you.'

"9" = ''':sup:`9` But Tobias pressed him, 'No, I beg you to let me go back to my
father's house.'

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Without more ado, Raguel committed Sarah his bride into his
keeping. He gave Tobias half his wealth, slaves, men and women, oxen
and sheep, donkeys and camels, clothes and money and household things.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And so he let them leave happily. To Tobias he said these parting
words, 'Good health, my son, and a happy journey! May the Lord of
heaven be gracious to you and to your wife Sarah! I hope to see your
children before I die.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` To his daughter Sarah he said, 'Go now to your father-in-law's
house, since henceforward they are as much your parents as those who
gave you life. Go in peace, my daughter, I hope to hear nothing but
good of you, as long as I live.' He said goodbye to them and let them
go. Edna in her turn said to Tobias, 'Dear son and brother, may it
please the Lord to bring you back again! I hope to live long enough to
see the children of you and my daughter Sarah before I die. In the
sight of the Lord I give my daughter into your keeping. Never make her
unhappy as long as you live. Go in peace, my son. Henceforward I am
your mother and Sarah is your sister. May we all live happily for the
rest of our lives!' And she kissed them both and saw them set out
happily.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Tobias left Raguel's house with his mind at ease. In his gladness
he blessed the Lord of heaven and earth, the King of all that is, for
the happy issue of his travels. He gave this blessing to Raguel and his
wife Edna, 'May it be my happiness to honour you for the rest of my
life!'
