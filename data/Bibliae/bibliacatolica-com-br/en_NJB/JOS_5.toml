"1" = ''':sup:`1` When all the kings of the Amorites living to westward across the
Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites living on the seaboard,
heard that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the
Israelites until they had crossed, their hearts failed and they lost
all courage to resist the Israelites.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` At this time Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Make flint knives and
circumcise the Israelites again (a second time).
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites on the Hill
of Foreskins.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The reason why Joshua circumcised them was this. All the males of
the people who had come out of Egypt of age to bear arms had died in
the desert on their journey after leaving Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now, all the people who came out had been circumcised; but none of
those born in the desert, during the journey, after leaving Egypt, had
been circumcised;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` for the Israelites walked the desert for forty years, until the
whole nation had died out, that is, the men who had come out of Egypt
of age to bear arms; they had not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and
Yahweh had sworn to them never to let them see the land which he had
sworn to their ancestors that he would give us a land flowing with milk
and honey.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But in place of these he set their sons, and these were the ones
whom Joshua circumcised: they were uncircumcised because they had not
been circumcised during the journey.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they stayed
resting in the camp till they were well again.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Yahweh then said to Joshua, 'Today I have taken the shame of Egypt
away from you.' Hence, the place has been called Gilgal ever since.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The Israelites pitched their camp at Gilgal and kept the Passover
there on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plain of
Jericho.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` On the very next day after the Passover, they ate what the land
produced, unleavened bread and roasted ears of corn.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The manna stopped the day after they had eaten the produce of the
land. The Israelites from that year onwards ate the produce of Canaan
and had no more manna.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man
standing in front of him, grasping a naked sword. Joshua walked towards
him and said to him, 'Are you on our side or on that of our enemies?'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He replied, 'On neither side. I have come now as the captain of the
army of Yahweh.' Joshua fell on his face to the ground, worshipping
him, and said, 'What has my Lord to say to his servant?'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The captain of the army of Yahweh answered Joshua, 'Take your
sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.'
And Joshua did so.
