leave to make a three -days' journey into the desert and sacrifice to
Yahweh our God, or he will strike us with a plague or with the sword.'

"4" = ''':sup:`4` The king of Egypt said to them, 'Moses and Aaron, what do you mean
by distracting the people from their work? Get back to your forced
labour.'

"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Pharaoh said, 'Now that the people have grown to such numbers in
the country, what do you mean by interrupting their forced labour?'

"6" = ''':sup:`6` That very day, Pharaoh gave the order to the people's taskmasters
and their scribes,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` 'Do not go on providing the people with straw for brickmaking as
before; let them go and gather straw for themselves.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` But you will exact the same quantity of bricks from them as before,
not reducing it at all, since they are lazy, and that is why their cry
is, "Let us go and sacrifice to our God."

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Give these people more work to do, and see they do it instead of
listening to lying speeches.'

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Get back to your work at once. You will not be provided with straw;
all the same, you will deliver the quota of bricks.'

being told, 'You will not reduce your daily production of bricks.'

standing in their way.

have brought us into bad odour with Pharaoh and his officials; you have
put a sword into their hand to kill us.'
