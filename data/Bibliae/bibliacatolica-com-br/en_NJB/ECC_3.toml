"1" = ''':sup:`1` There is a season for everything, a time for every occupation under
heaven:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` A time for giving birth, a time for dying; a time for planting, a
time for uprooting what has been planted.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` A time for killing, a time for healing; a time for knocking down, a
time for building.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` A time for tears, a time for laughter; a time for mourning, a time
for dancing.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` A time for throwing stones away, a time for gathering them; a time
for embracing, a time to refrain from embracing.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` A time for searching, a time for losing; a time for keeping, a time
for discarding.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` A time for tearing, a time for sewing; a time for keeping silent, a
time for speaking.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` A time for loving, a time for hating; a time for war, a time for
peace.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` What do people gain from the efforts they make?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I contemplate the task that God gives humanity to labour at.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` All that he does is apt for its time; but although he has given us
an awareness of the passage of time, we can grasp neither the beginning
nor the end of what God does.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I know there is no happiness for a human being except in pleasure
and enjoyment through life.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And when we eat and drink and find happiness in all our
achievements, this is a gift from God.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I know that whatever God does will be for ever. To this there is
nothing to add, from this there is nothing to subtract, and the way God
acts inspires dread.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What is, has been already, what will be, is already; God seeks out
anyone who is persecuted.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Again I observe under the sun: crime is where justice should be,
the criminal is where the upright should be.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And I think to myself: the upright and the criminal will both be
judged by God, since there is a time for every thing and every action
here.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` I think to myself: where human beings are concerned, this is so
that God can test them and show them that they are animals.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For the fate of human and the fate of animal is the same: as the
one dies, so the other dies; both have the selfsame breath. Human is in
no way better off than animal -- since all is futile.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Everything goes to the same place, everything comes from the dust,
everything returns to the dust.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Who knows if the human spirit mounts upward or if the animal spirit
goes downward to the earth?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` I see there is no contentment for a human being except happiness in
achievement; such is the lot of a human beings. No one can tell us what
will happen after we are gone.

3:1-8 - The Preacher presents a famous poem about time, asserting that
there is a time for everything under heaven. Life is composed of
seasons, and each event is under God's sovereignty, illustrating divine
17:26).
3:9-11 - Although man is aware of time and eternity, he cannot grasp

3:12-13 - The Preacher affirms that the best thing a human being can do
is to enjoy their work and the fruits of their labor, a gift from God.
This reflects God's common grace toward all humanity (see also
3:14-15 - What God does is eternal and unchanging. Everything that
happens has a purpose, and man can neither add to nor subtract from
God's plan. This highlights divine sovereignty and the reverence we

3:16-17 - The Preacher reflects on the injustice and evil in the world,
but reaffirms that God will judge all actions in due time. God's
ultimate justice is certain, even if it is not currently visible (see
