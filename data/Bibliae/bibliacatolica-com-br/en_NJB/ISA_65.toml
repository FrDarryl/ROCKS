mountain, who lay the table for Gad, who fill cups of mixed wine for
Meni,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` you I shall destine to the sword and all of you will stoop to be
slaughtered, because I called and you would not answer, I spoke and you
would not listen; you have done what I consider evil, you chose to do
what displeases me.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Therefore Lord Yahweh says this: You will see my servants eating
while you go hungry; you will see my servants drinking while you go
thirsty; you will see my servants rejoicing while you are put to shame;

shriek for sorrow of heart and howl with a broken spirit.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` And you will leave your name behind as a curse for my chosen ones,
'May Lord Yahweh strike you dead!' But to his servants he will give
another name.

truth, and whoever swears an oath on earth will swear by the God of

I am creating Jerusalem to be 'Joy' and my people to be 'Gladness'.

more will the sound of weeping be heard there, nor the sound of a
shriek;

and eat their fruit.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` They will not build for others to live in, or plant for others to
eat; for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and my
chosen ones will themselves use what they have made.

for they are the race of Yahweh's blessed ones and so are their
offspring.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thus, before they call I shall answer, before they stop speaking I
shall have heard.
