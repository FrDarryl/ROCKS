"1" = ''':sup:`1` Since these promises have been made to us, my dear friends, we
should wash ourselves clean of everything that pollutes either body or
spirit, bringing our sanctification to completion in the fear of God.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Keep a place for us in your hearts. We have not injured anyone, or
ruined anyone, or taken advantage of anyone.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I am not saying this to condemn anybody; as I have already told you,
you are in our hearts -- so that together we live and together we die.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I can speak with the greatest frankness to you; and I can speak with
the greatest pride about you: in all our hardship, I am filled with
encouragement and overflowing with joy.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Even after we had come to Macedonia, there was no rest for this body
of ours. Far from it; we were beset by hardship on all sides, there
were quarrels all around us and misgivings within us.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But God, who encourages all those who are distressed, encouraged us
through the arrival of Titus;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and not simply by his arrival only, but also by means of the
encouragement that you had given him, as he told us of your desire to
see us, how sorry you were and how concerned for us; so that I was all
the more joyful.

it. Even if I did regret it -- and I realise that the letter distressed
you, even though not for long-

because the distress that you were caused led to repentance; your
distress was the kind that God approves and so you have come to no kind
of harm through us.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For to be distressed in a way that God approves leads to repentance
and then to salvation with no regrets; it is the world's kind of
distress that ends in death.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Just look at this present case: at what the result has been of your
being made to feel distress in the way that God approves -- what
concern, what defence, what indignation and what alarm; what yearning,
and what enthusiasm, and what justice done. In every way you have
cleared yourselves of blame in this matter.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So although I wrote a letter to you, it was not for the sake of the
offender, nor for the one offended, but only so that you yourselves
should fully realise in the sight of God what concern you have for us.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` That is what I have found encouraging. In addition to all this to
encourage us, we were made all the more joyful by Titus' joy, now that
his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And if I boasted about you to him in any way, then I have not been
made to look foolish; indeed, our boast to Titus has been proved to be
as true as anything we said to you.

remembers how obedient you have all been, and how you welcomed him with
fear and trembling.
