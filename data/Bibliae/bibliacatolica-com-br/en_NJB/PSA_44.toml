to make room for them you harried peoples.
'''

which made them victorious, but your hand it was and your arm, and the
light of your presence, for you loved them.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` it was you who saved us from our opponents, you who put to shame
those who hate us.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Our boast was always of God, we praised your name without
ceasing.Pause
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Yet now you have abandoned and humiliated us, you no longer take the
field with our armies,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` you leave us to fall back before the enemy, those who hate us
plunder us at will.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` You hand us over like sheep for slaughter, you scatter us among the
nations,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` you sell your people for a trifle and make no profit on the sale.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` You make us the butt of our neighbours, the mockery and scorn of
those around us,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` All day long I brood on my disgrace, the shame written clear on my
face,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` from the sound of insult and abuse, from the sight of hatred and
vengefulness.

disloyal to your covenant,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` our hearts never turning away, our feet never straying from your
path.

a foreign god,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` would not God have found this out, for he knows the secrets of the
heart?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For your sake we are being massacred all day long, treated as sheep
to be slaughtered.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Wake, Lord! Why are you asleep? Awake! Do not abandon us for good.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Why do you turn your face away, forgetting that we are poor and
harrassed?
