"1" = ''':sup:`1` Job spoke next. He said:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` If only my misery could be weighed, and all my ills be put together
on the scales!
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But they outweigh the sands of the seas: what wonder then if my
words are wild?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The arrows of Shaddai stick fast in me, my spirit absorbs their
poison, God's terrors stand paraded against me.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox low when its
fodder is within reach?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Is not food insipid, eaten without salt, is there any taste in
egg-white?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the very things my appetite revolts at are now my diet in
sickness.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Will no one hear my prayer, will not God himself grant my hope?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` May it please God to crush me, to give his hand free play and do
away with me!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This thought, at least, would give me comfort (a thrill of joy in
unrelenting pain), that I never rebelled against the Holy One's
decrees.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But have I the strength to go on waiting? And why be patient, when
doomed to such an end?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Is mine the strength of stone, is my flesh made of bronze?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Can I support myself on nothing? Has not all help deserted me?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Refuse faithful love to your neighbour and you forsake the fear of
Shaddai.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Like the torrent, my brothers have proved deceptive, as fleeting
torrents they flow:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` the ice makes their waters turgid when, above them, the snow melts,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` but, come the burning summer, they run dry, they vanish in the heat
of the sun.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Caravans leave the trail to find them, go deep into wastelands, and
are lost.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The caravans of Tema look to them, and on them Sheba's convoys
build their hopes.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Their trust brings only embarrassment, they reach them only to be
thwarted.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And this is how you now treat me, terrified at the sight of me, you
take fright.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Have I said to you, 'Give me something, make some present for me at
your own cost,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` snatch me from the grasp of an oppressor, ransom me from the grip
of a violent man'?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Put me right, and I shall say no more; show me where I have been at
fault.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Fair comment can be borne without resentment, but what are your
strictures aimed at?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Do you think mere words deserve censure, desperate speech that the
wind blows away?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Soon you will be haggling over the price of an orphan, and selling
your friend at bargain price!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Come, I beg you, look at me: man to man, I shall not lie.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Relent then, no harm is done; relent then, since I am upright.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Is evil to be found on my lips? Can I not recognise misfortune when
I taste it?
