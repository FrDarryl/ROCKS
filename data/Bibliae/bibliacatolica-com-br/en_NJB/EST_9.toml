"1" = ''':sup:`1` The king's command and decree came into force on the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month, Adar, and the day on which the enemies of the
Jews had hoped to crush them produced the very opposite effect: the
Jews it was who crushed their enemies.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In their towns throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the Jews
assembled to strike at those who had planned to injure them. No one
resisted them, since the various peoples were now all afraid of them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Provincial officers-of-state, satraps, governors and royal
officials, all supported the Jews for fear of Mordecai.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And indeed Mordecai was a power in the palace and his fame was
spreading through all the provinces; Mordecai was steadily growing more
powerful.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, with
resulting slaughter and destruction, and worked their will on their
opponents.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In the citadel of Susa alone, the Jews put to death and slaughtered
five hundred men,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` notably Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Parmashtha, Arisai, Aridai and Jezatha,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the persecutor of the
Jews. But they took no plunder.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to
the king that same day.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The king said to Queen Esther, 'In the citadel of Susa the Jews
have killed five hundred men and also the ten sons of Haman. What must
they have done in the other provinces of the realm? Tell me your
request; I grant it to you. Tell me what else you would like; it is
yours for the asking.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` 'If such is the king's pleasure,' Esther replied, 'let the Jews of
Susa be allowed to enforce today's decree tomorrow as well. And as for
the ten sons of Haman, let their bodies be hanged on the gallows.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Whereupon, the king having given the order, the edict was
promulgated in Susa and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thus the Jews of Susa reassembled on the fourteenth day of the
month of Adar and killed three hundred men in the city. But they took
no plunder.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The other Jews who lived in the king's provinces also assembled to
defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies. They
slaughtered seventy-five thousand of their opponents. But they took no
plunder.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the
fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But for the Jews of Susa, who had assembled on the thirteenth and
fourteenth days, the fifteenth was the day they rested, making that a
day of feasting and gladness.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` This is why Jewish country people, those who live in undefended
villages, keep the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of
gladness, feasting and holiday-making, and the exchanging of presents
with one another, (a) whereas for those who live in cities the day of
rejoicing and exchanging presents with their neighbours is the
fifteenth day of Adar.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Mordecai committed these events to writing. Then he sent letters to
all the Jews living in the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and
far,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` enjoining them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of
the month of Adar every year,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` as the days on which the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies,
and the month in which their sorrow had been turned into gladness, and
mourning into a holiday. He therefore told them to keep these as days
of festivity and gladness when they were to exchange presents and make
gifts to the poor.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Once having begun, the Jews continued observing these practices,
Mordecai having written them an account
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` of how Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the persecutor of all
the Jews, had plotted their destruction and had cast the pur, that is,
the lot, for their overthrow and ruin;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` but how, when he went back to the king to ask him to order the
hanging of Mordecai, the wicked scheme which he had devised against the
Jews recoiled on his own head, and both he and his sons were hanged on
the gallows;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and that, hence, these days were called Purim, from the word pur.
And so, because of what was written in this letter, and because of what
they had seen for themselves and of what had happened to them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` the Jews willingly bound themselves, their descendants and all who
should join them, to celebrate these two days without fail, in the
manner prescribed and at the time appointed, year after year.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Thus commemorated and celebrated from generation to generation, in
every family, in every province, in every city, these days of Purim
will never be abrogated among the Jews, nor will their memory perish
from their race.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, wrote with full authority to
ratify this second letter,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and sent letters to all the Jews of the hundred and twenty-seven
provinces of the realm of Ahasuerus, in terms of peace and loyalty
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` enjoining them to observe these days of Purim at the appointed
time, as Mordecai the Jew had recommended, and in the manner prescribed
for themselves and their descendants, with additional ordinances for
fasts and lamentations.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The ordinance of Esther fixed the law of Purim, which was then
recorded in a book.
