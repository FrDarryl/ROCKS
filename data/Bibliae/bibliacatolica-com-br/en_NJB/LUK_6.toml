and his followers were hungry-
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` how he went into the house of God and took the loaves of the
offering and ate them and gave them to his followers, loaves which the
priests alone are allowed to eat?'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And he said to them, 'The Son of man is master of the Sabbath.'

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Now on another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and began to

"8" = ''':sup:`8` But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man with the withered
hand, 'Get up and stand out in the middle!' And he came forward and
stood there.

of people from all parts of Judaea and Jerusalem and the coastal region
of Tyre and Sidon
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` who had come to hear him and to be cured of their diseases. People
tormented by unclean spirits were also cured,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him because power
came out of him that cured them all.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then fixing his eyes on his disciples he said: How blessed are you
who are poor: the kingdom of God is yours.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Blessed are you who are hungry now: you shall have your fill.
Blessed are you who are weeping now: you shall laugh.

'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Treat others as you would like people to treat you.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` If you love those who love you, what credit can you expect? Even
sinners love those who love them.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit can you
expect? For even sinners do that much.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And if you lend to those from whom you hope to get money back, what
credit can you expect? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the
same amount.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Instead, love your enemies and do good to them, and lend without
any hope of return. You will have a great reward, and you will be

because the standard you use will be the standard used for you.'

"39" = ''':sup:`39` He also told them a parable, 'Can one blind person guide another?
Surely both will fall into a pit?
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Disciple is not superior to teacher; but fully trained disciple

"41" = ''':sup:`41` Why do you observe the splinter in your brother's eye and never
notice the great log in your own?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` How can you say to your brother, "Brother, let me take out that
splinter in your eye," when you cannot see the great log in your own?

rotten tree that produces sound fruit.

from thorns, nor gather grapes from brambles.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Good people draw what is good from the store of goodness in their
hearts; bad people draw what is bad from the store of badness. For the

"47" = ''':sup:`47` 'Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and acts on them
-- I will show you what such a person is like.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Such a person is like the man who, when he built a house, dug, and
dug deep, and laid the foundations on rock; when the river was in flood
it bore down on that house but could not shake it, it was so well
built.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` But someone who listens and does nothing is like the man who built

it, it collapsed; and what a ruin that house became!'
