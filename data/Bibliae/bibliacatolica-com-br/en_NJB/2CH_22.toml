in succession to him, since the marauders who had attacked the camp

of Jehoram, king of Judah became king.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he came to the throne and he
reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah,
descendant of Omri.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He too followed the example of the House of Ahab, for his mother
being his adviser brought about his condemnation.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He did what is displeasing to Yahweh as the House of Ahab did, for
they were his advisers after his father's death, to his undoing.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He followed their advice and went with Jehoram son of Ahab, king of
Israel, to make war on Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-Gilead. But the
Aramaeans wounded Jehoram,

"6" = ''':sup:`6` who returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had
received at Ramoth, fighting against Hazael king of Aram. Ahaziah son

Ahab because he was ailing.
'''

"9" = ''':sup:`9` and then went in search of Ahaziah. The latter was captured while
hiding in Samaria, and taken to Jehu who put him to death. But they
gave him burial because, they said, 'He was the grandson of Jehoshaphat

Notas de rodapé:
22:1-4 - Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, reigns in Judah and follows the evil
ways of his mother Athaliah and father. Family influence is a
significant theme, showing how idolatrous practices can be passed down
13:22).
22:5-7 - Ahaziah allies with Jehoram, king of Israel, to fight Hazael
of Syria, demonstrating his pursuit of alliances that distance himself
from dependence on God. This alliance leads to his death, highlighting
the futility of trusting in human alliances rather than in God (see
22:8-9 - Ahaziah is killed during the battle, and his mother Athaliah
takes the throne. This transition of power highlights how corruption
can be perpetuated through wicked leaders and the importance of
34:2).
22:10-12 - Athaliah seeks to destroy the royal line, but Joash, son of
Ahaziah, is hidden and saved. This illustrates God’s providence in
preserving the faithful remnant, even in times of persecution (see also
22:13-15 - Athaliah's role as ruler is marked by idolatry and
corruption, representing a contrast to godly principles. Her reign
