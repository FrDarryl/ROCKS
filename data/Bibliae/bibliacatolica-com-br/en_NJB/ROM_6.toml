"1" = ''':sup:`1` What should we say then? Should we remain in sin so that grace may
be given the more fully?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Out of the question! We have died to sin; how could we go on living
in it?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` You cannot have forgotten that all of us, when we were baptised into
Christ Jesus, were baptised into his death.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So by our baptism into his death we were buried with him, so that as
Christ was raised from the dead by the Father's glorious power, we too
should begin living a new life.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` If we have been joined to him by dying a death like his, so we shall
be by a resurrection like his;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` realising that our former self was crucified with him, so that the
self which belonged to sin should be destroyed and we should be freed
from the slavery of sin.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Someone who has died, of course, no longer has to answer for sin.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But we believe that, if we died with Christ, then we shall live with
him too.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` We know that Christ has been raised from the dead and will never die
again. Death has no power over him any more.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For by dying, he is dead to sin once and for all, and now the life
that he lives is life with God.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` In the same way, you must see yourselves as being dead to sin but
alive for God in Christ Jesus.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` That is why you must not allow sin to reign over your mortal bodies
and make you obey their desires;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` or give any parts of your bodies over to sin to be used as
instruments of evil. Instead, give yourselves to God, as people brought
to life from the dead, and give every part of your bodies to God to be
instruments of uprightness;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and then sin will no longer have any power over you -- you are
living not under law, but under grace.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What is the implication? That we are free to sin, now that we are
not under law but under grace? Out of the question!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` You know well that if you undertake to be somebody's slave and obey
him, you are the slave of him you obey: you can be the slave either of
sin which leads to death, or of obedience which leads to saving
justice.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Once you were slaves of sin, but thank God you have given
whole-hearted obedience to the pattern of teaching to which you were
introduced;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and so, being freed from serving sin, you took uprightness as your
master.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I am putting it in human terms because you are still weak human
beings: as once you surrendered yourselves as servants to immorality
and to a lawlessness which results in more lawlessness, now you have to
surrender yourselves to uprightness which is to result in
sanctification.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When you were the servants of sin, you felt no obligation to
uprightness,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and what did you gain from living like that? Experiences of which
you are now ashamed, for that sort of behaviour ends in death.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But, now you are set free from sin and bound to the service of God,
your gain will be sanctification and the end will be eternal life.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For the wage paid by sin is death; the gift freely given by God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - God's grace should not be used as an excuse for sin, because as
Christians, we have died to sin. Life transformation is evidenced by
6:3-4 - Baptism symbolizes union with Christ in His death and
resurrection, being an act of rebirth to a new life in Christ (see also
6:6-7 - The old human nature was crucified with Christ, so that we are
now freed from the dominion of sin. Justification brings the freedom to
4:22-24).
6:12-14 - The Christian must not allow sin to reign in his mortal body,
but instead offer himself to God as an instrument of righteousness.
Corinthians 6:19-20).
06:23 - The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus. This verse is a crucial contrast between the fate of
3:16).
