greater than before.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` 'I am a Jew', Paul said, 'and was born at Tarsus in Cilicia. I was
brought up here in this city. It was under Gamaliel that I studied and
was taught the exact observance of the Law of our ancestors. In fact, I
was as full of duty towards God as you all are today.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I even persecuted this Way to the death and sent women as well as
men to prison in chains
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify. I
even received letters from them to the brothers in Damascus, which I
took with me when I set off to bring prisoners back from there to
Jerusalem for punishment.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` 'It happened that I was on that journey and nearly at Damascus when
in the middle of the day a bright light from heaven suddenly shone
round me.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why are
you persecuting me?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I answered, "Who are you, Lord?" and he said to me, "I am Jesus the
Nazarene, whom you are persecuting."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The people with me saw the light but did not hear the voice which
spoke to me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I said, "What am I to do, Lord?" The Lord answered, "Get up and go
into Damascus, and there you will be told what you have been appointed
to do."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Since the light had been so dazzling that I was blind, I got to
Damascus only because my companions led me by the hand.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` 'Someone called Ananias, a devout follower of the Law and highly
thought of by all the Jews living there,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` came to see me; he stood beside me and said, "Brother Saul, receive
your sight." Instantly my sight came back and I was able to see him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then he said, "The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his
will, to see the Upright One and hear his own voice speaking,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` because you are to be his witness before all humanity, testifying
to what you have seen and heard.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And now why delay? Hurry and be baptised and wash away your sins,
calling on his name."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` 'It happened that, when I got back to Jerusalem, and was praying in
the Temple, I fell into a trance
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and then I saw him. "Hurry," he said, "leave Jerusalem at once;
they will not accept the testimony you are giving about me."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "Lord," I answered, "they know that I used to go from synagogue to
synagogue, imprisoning and flogging those who believed in you;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and that when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I,
too, was standing by, in full agreement with his murderers, and in
charge of their clothes."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then he said to me, "Go! I am sending you out to the gentiles far
away." '
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So far they had listened to him, but at these words they began to
shout, 'Rid the earth of the man! He is not fit to live!'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` They were yelling, waving their cloaks and throwing dust into the
air,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and so the tribune had him brought into the fortress and ordered
him to be examined under the lash, to find out the reason for the
outcry against him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But when they had strapped him down Paul said to the centurion on
duty, 'Is it legal for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and has
not been brought to trial?'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When he heard this the centurion went and told the tribune; 'Do you
realise what you are doing?' he said. 'This man is a Roman citizen.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So the tribune came and asked him, 'Tell me, are you a Roman
citizen?' Paul answered 'Yes'.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` To this the tribune replied, 'It cost me a large sum to acquire
this citizenship.' 'But I was born to it,' said Paul.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then those who were about to examine him hurriedly withdrew, and
the tribune himself was alarmed when he realised that he had put a
Roman citizen in chains.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The next day, since he wanted to know for sure what charge the Jews
were bringing, he freed Paul and gave orders for a meeting of the chief
priests and the entire Sanhedrin; then he brought Paul down and set him
in front of them.
