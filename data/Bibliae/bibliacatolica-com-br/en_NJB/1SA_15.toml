"1" = ''':sup:`1` Samuel said to Saul, 'I am the man whom Yahweh sent to anoint you as
king of his people Israel, so now listen to the words of Yahweh.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This is what Yahweh Sabaoth says, "I intend to punish what Amalek
did to Israel -- laying a trap for him on the way as he was coming up
from Egypt.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now, go and crush Amalek; put him under the curse of destruction
with all that he possesses. Do not spare him, but kill man and woman,
babe and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey." '
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Saul summoned the people and reviewed them at Telaim: two hundred
thousand foot soldiers (and ten thousand men of Judah).
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Saul advanced on the town of Amalek and lay in ambush in the river
bed.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Saul said to the Kenites, 'Go away, leave your homes among the
Amalekites, in case I destroy you with them -- you acted with faithful
love towards all the Israelites when they were coming up from Egypt.'
So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Saul then crushed the Amalekites, beginning at Havilah in the
direction of Shur, which is to the east of Egypt.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive and, executing the curse
of destruction, put all the people to the sword.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But Saul and the army spared Agag with the best of the sheep and
cattle, the fatlings and lambs and all that was good. They did not want
to consign these to the curse of destruction; they consigned only what
was poor and worthless.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The word of Yahweh came to Samuel,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` 'I regret having made Saul king, since he has broken his allegiance
to me and not carried out my orders.' Samuel was appalled and cried to
Yahweh all night long.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` In the morning, Samuel set off to find Saul. Samuel was told, 'Saul
has been to Carmel, to raise himself a monument there, but now has
turned about, moved on and gone down to Gilgal.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Samuel reached Saul, Saul said, 'May you be blessed by Yahweh!
I have carried out Yahweh's orders.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Samuel replied, 'Then what is this bleating of sheep in my ears and
the lowing of cattle that I hear?'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Saul said, 'They have been brought from Amalek, the people having
spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice them to Yahweh,
your God; the rest we have consigned to the curse of destruction.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Samuel then said to Saul, 'Stop! Let me tell you what Yahweh said
to me last night.' He said, 'Go on.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Samuel said, 'Small as you may be in your own eyes, are you not the
leader of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh has anointed you as king of
Israel.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When Yahweh sent you on a mission he said to you, "Go and put those
sinners, the Amalekites, under the curse of destruction and make war on
them until they are exterminated."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Why then did you not obey Yahweh's voice? Why did you fall on the
booty and do what is wrong in Yahweh's eyes?'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Saul replied to Samuel, 'But I did obey Yahweh's voice. I went on
the mission which Yahweh gave me; I brought back Agag king of the
Amalekites; I put Amalek under the curse of destruction;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and from the booty the people have taken the best sheep and cattle
of what was under the curse of destruction only to sacrifice them to
Yahweh your God in Gilgal.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` To which, Samuel said: Is Yahweh pleased by burnt offerings and
sacrifices or by obedience to Yahweh's voice? Truly, obedience is
better than sacrifice, submissiveness than the fat of rams.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Rebellion is a sin of sorcery, presumption a crime of idolatry!
'Since you have rejected Yahweh's word, he has rejected you as king.'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Saul then said to Samuel, 'I have sinned, having broken Yahweh's
order and your instructions because I was afraid of the people and
yielded to their demands.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now, please forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I can
worship Yahweh.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Samuel said to Saul, 'I will not come back with you, since you have
rejected Yahweh's word and Yahweh has rejected you as king of Israel.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` As Samuel turned away to leave, Saul caught at the hem of his cloak
and it tore,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and Samuel said to him, 'Today Yahweh has torn the kingdom of
Israel from you and given it to a neighbour of yours who is better than
you.'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` (The Glory of Israel, however, does not lie or go back on his word,
not being human and liable to go back on his word.)
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` 'I have sinned,' Saul said, 'but please still show me respect in
front of my people's elders and in front of Israel, and come back with
me, so that I can worship Yahweh your God.'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Samuel followed Saul back and Saul worshipped Yahweh.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Samuel then said, 'Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites!' Agag came
towards him unsteadily saying, 'Truly death is bitter!'
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Samuel said: As your sword has left women childless, so will your
mother be left childless among women! Samuel then butchered Agag before
Yahweh at Gilgal.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Samuel left for Ramah, and Saul went up home to Gibeah of Saul.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Samuel did not see Saul again till his dying day. Samuel indeed

Israel.

Notas de rodapé:
15:1-3 - God, through Samuel, commands Saul to completely destroy the
Amalekites, a nation that was an enemy of Israel. This is a clear
command that tests Saul's complete obedience to God (see also
15:9-11 - Saul and the people disobey God by sparing King Agag and the
best of their flocks. This reveals Saul's failure to follow God's
commands completely, resulting in the rejection of his kingship (see
15:22-23 - Samuel confronts Saul, saying that “to obey is better than
sacrifice.” The central lesson here is that God values obedience and
submission to His will more than any external ritual (see also
15:24-26 - Saul confesses his sin, but his motivation is fear of the
people rather than genuine repentance. Samuel reaffirms that God has
rejected him as king, establishing that a leader's heart is more
Corinthians 7:10).
15:32-33 - Samuel executes King Agag, completing the order Saul failed
to carry out. This underscores Samuel's zeal for God's justice and the
