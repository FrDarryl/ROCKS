"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now it happened that one day while he was teaching the people in the
Temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the scribes
came up, together with the elders,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and spoke to him. 'Tell us,' they said, 'what authority have you for
acting like this? Or who gives you this authority?'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` In reply he said to them, 'And I will ask you a question, just one.
Tell me:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` John's baptism: what was its origin, heavenly or human?'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And they debated this way among themselves, 'If we say heavenly, he
will retort, "Why did you refuse to believe him?";
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and if we say human, the whole people will stone us, for they are
convinced that John was a prophet.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So their reply was that they did not know where it came from.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And Jesus said to them, 'Nor will I tell you my authority for acting
like this.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he went on to tell the people this parable, 'A man planted a
vineyard and leased it to tenants, and went abroad for a long while.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When the right time came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get
his share of the produce of the vineyard. But the tenants thrashed him,
and sent him away empty-handed.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But he went on to send a second servant; they thrashed him too and
treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He still went on to send a third; they wounded this one too, and
threw him out.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the owner of the vineyard thought, "What am I to do? I will
send them my own beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But when the tenants saw him they put their heads together saying,
"This is the heir, let us kill him so that the inheritance will be
ours."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 'Now what
will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He will come and make an end of these tenants and give the vineyard
to others.' Hearing this they said, 'God forbid!'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But he looked hard at them and said, 'Then what does this text in
the scriptures mean: The stone which the builders rejected has become
the cornerstone?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Anyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces; anyone it
falls on will be crushed.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the scribes and the chief priests would have liked to lay hands
on him that very moment, because they realised that this parable was
aimed at them, but they were afraid of the people.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So they awaited their opportunity and sent agents to pose as
upright men, and to catch him out in something he might say and so
enable them to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the
governor.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They put to him this question, 'Master, we know that you say and
teach what is right; you favour no one, but teach the way of God in all
honesty.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Is it permissible for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But he was aware of their cunning and said,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` 'Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and title are on it?' They
said, 'Caesar's.'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He said to them, 'Well then, pay Caesar what belongs to Caesar --
and God what belongs to God.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` They were unable to catch him out in anything he had to say in
public; they were amazed at his answer and were silenced.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Some Sadducees -- those who argue that there is no resurrection --
approached him and they put this question to him,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` 'Master, Moses prescribed for us, if a man's married brother dies
childless, the man must marry the widow to raise up children for his
brother.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Well then, there were seven brothers; the first, having married a
wife, died childless.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The second
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and then the third married the widow. And the same with all seven,
they died leaving no children.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Finally the woman herself died.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Now, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since she had
been married to all seven?'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus replied, 'The children of this world take wives and husbands,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` but those who are judged worthy of a place in the other world and
in the resurrection from the dead do not marry
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` because they can no longer die, for they are the same as the
angels, and being children of the resurrection they are children of
God.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And Moses himself implies that the dead rise again, in the passage
about the bush where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac and the God of Jacob.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Now he is God, not of the dead, but of the living; for to him
everyone is alive.'
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Some scribes then spoke up. They said, 'Well put, Master.'
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` They did not dare to ask him any more questions.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` He then said to them, 'How can people maintain that the Christ is
son of David?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Why, David himself says in the Book of Psalms: The Lord declared to
my Lord, take your seat at my right hand,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` till I have made your enemies your footstool.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` David here calls him Lord; how then can he be his son?'
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` While all the people were listening he said to the disciples,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` 'Beware of the scribes who like to walk about in long robes and
love to be greeted respectfully in the market squares, to take the
front seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets,
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` who devour the property of widows, and for show offer long prayers.
The more severe will be the sentence they receive.'
