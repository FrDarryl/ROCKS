was a scroll that was written on back and front and was sealed with
seven seals.

worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But there was no one, in heaven or on the earth or under the earth,
who was able to open the scroll and read it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I wept bitterly because nobody could be found to open the scroll and
read it,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` but one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep. Look, the Lion of
the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed, and so he will
open the scroll and its seven seals.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then I saw, in the middle of the throne with its four living
creatures and the circle of the elders, a Lamb standing that seemed to
have been sacrificed; it had seven horns, and it had seven eyes, which
are the seven Spirits that God has sent out over the whole world.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The Lamb came forward to take the scroll from the right hand of the
One sitting on the throne,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` and when he took it, the four living creatures prostrated themselves

holding a harp and had a golden bowl full of incense which are the
prayers of the saints.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` They sang a new hymn: You are worthy to take the scroll and to break
its seals, because you were sacrificed, and with your blood you bought

"11" = ''':sup:`11` In my vision, I heard the sound of an immense number of angels

power, riches, wisdom, strength, honour, glory and blessing.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then I heard all the living things in creation -- everything that
lives in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and in the sea,
crying: To the One seated on the throne and to the Lamb, be all praise,
honour, glory and power, for ever and ever.

Notas de rodap√©:
5:1-5 - John sees the scroll sealed with seven seals, and no one is
worthy to open it until the Lamb, Christ, appears as the one worthy to
open the seals. Christ's victory over death makes Him worthy to reveal
5:6-10 - The Lamb is described as having been slain and worthy of
worship from all creation. His work of redemption is universal, and His
5:11-14 - Worship of the Lamb extends to all the heavenly orders,
showing that Christ is the center of all worship in heaven and on
earth. Christ's victory is an invitation for all creation to surrender
