us out of Egypt?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Did we not tell you as much in Egypt? Leave us alone, we said, we
would rather work for the Egyptians! We prefer to work for the
Egyptians than to die in the desert!'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Moses said to the people, 'Do not be afraid! Stand firm, and you
will see what Yahweh will do to rescue you today: the Egyptians you see

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Yahweh then said to Moses, 'Why cry out to me? Tell the Israelites

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Your part is to raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the

dry ground,

The cloud was dark, and the night passed without the one drawing any

Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud and threw the Egyptian army
into confusion.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He so clogged their chariot wheels that they drove on only with
difficulty, which made the Egyptians say, 'Let us flee from Israel, for
Yahweh is fighting on their side against the Egyptians!'

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then Yahweh said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand over the sea and
let the waters flow back on the Egyptians and on their chariots and
their horsemen.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and, as day broke, the
sea returned to its bed. The fleeing Egyptians ran straight into it,

Pharaoh's entire army, which had followed the Israelites into the sea;
