"1" = ''':sup:`1` Give a welcome to anyone whose faith is not strong, but do not get
into arguments about doubtful points.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` One person may have faith enough to eat any kind of food; another,
less strong, will eat only vegetables.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Those who feel free to eat freely are not to condemn those who are
unwilling to eat freely; nor must the person who does not eat freely
pass judgement on the one who does -- because God has welcomed him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And who are you, to sit in judgement over somebody else's servant?
Whether he deserves to be upheld or to fall is for his own master to
decide; and he shall be upheld, for the Lord has power to uphold him.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` One person thinks that some days are holier than others, and another
thinks them all equal. Let each of them be fully convinced in his own
mind.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The one who makes special observance of a particular day observes it
in honour of the Lord. So the one who eats freely, eats in honour of
the Lord, making his thanksgiving to God; and the one who does not,
abstains from eating in honour of the Lord and makes his thanksgiving
to God.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For none of us lives for himself and none of us dies for himself;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` while we are alive, we are living for the Lord, and when we die, we
die for the Lord: and so, alive or dead, we belong to the Lord.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It was for this purpose that Christ both died and came to life
again: so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Why, then, does one of you make himself judge over his brother, and
why does another among you despise his brother? All of us will have to
stand in front of the judgement-seat of God:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` as scripture says: By my own life says the Lord, every knee shall
bow before me, every tongue shall give glory to God.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It is to God, then, that each of us will have to give an account of
himself.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Let us each stop passing judgement, therefore, on one another and
decide instead that none of us will place obstacles in any brother's
way, or anything that can bring him down.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am sure, and quite convinced in the Lord Jesus, that no food is
unclean in itself; it is only if someone classifies any kind of food as
unclean, then for him it is unclean.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And indeed, if through any kind of food you are causing offence to
a brother, then you are no longer being guided by love. You are not to
let the food that you eat cause the ruin of anyone for whom Christ
died.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` A privilege of yours must not be allowed to give rise to harmful
talk;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` for it is not eating and drinking that make the kingdom of God, but
the saving justice, the peace and the joy brought by the Holy Spirit.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` It is the person who serves Christ in these things that will be
approved by God and respected by everyone.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So then, let us be always seeking the ways which lead to peace and
the ways in which we can support one another.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Do not wreck God's work for the sake of food. Certainly all foods
are clean; but all the same, any kind can be evil for someone to whom
it is an offence to eat it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` It is best to abstain from eating any meat, or drinking any wine,
or from any other activity which might cause a brother to fall away, or
to be scandalised, or to weaken.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Within yourself, before God, hold on to what you already believe.
Blessed is the person whose principles do not condemn his practice.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But anyone who eats with qualms of conscience is condemned, because
this eating does not spring from faith -- and every action which does
not spring from faith is sin.
