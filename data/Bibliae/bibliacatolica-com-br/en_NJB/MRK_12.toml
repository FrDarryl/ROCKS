"1" = ''':sup:`1` He went on to speak to them in parables, 'A man planted a vineyard;
he fenced it round, dug out a trough for the winepress and built a
tower; then he leased it to tenants and went abroad.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from
them his share of the produce of the vineyard.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But they seized the man, thrashed him and sent him away empty
handed.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Next he sent another servant to them; him they beat about the head
and treated shamefully.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And he sent another and him they killed; then a number of others,
and they thrashed some and killed the rest.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He had still someone left: his beloved son. He sent him to them last
of all, thinking, "They will respect my son."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But those tenants said to each other, "This is the heir. Come on,
let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So they seized him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and make an
end of the tenants and give the vineyard to others.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Have you not read this text of scripture: The stone which the
builders rejected has become the cornerstone;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` this is the Lord's doing, and we marvel at it ?'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And they would have liked to arrest him, because they realised that
the parable was aimed at them, but they were afraid of the crowds. So
they left him alone and went away.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Next they sent to him some Pharisees and some Herodians to catch
him out in what he said.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` These came and said to him, 'Master, we know that you are an honest
man, that you are not afraid of anyone, because human rank means
nothing to you, and that you teach the way of God in all honesty. Is it
permissible to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or not?'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Recognising their hypocrisy he said to them, 'Why are you putting
me to the test? Hand me a denarius and let me see it.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` They handed him one and he said to them, 'Whose portrait is this?
Whose title?' They said to him, 'Caesar's.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Jesus said to them, 'Pay Caesar what belongs to Caesar -- and God
what belongs to God.' And they were amazed at him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then some Sadducees -- who deny that there is a resurrection --
came to him and they put this question to him,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` 'Master, Moses prescribed for us that if a man's brother dies
leaving a wife but no child, the man must marry the widow to raise up
children for his brother.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now there were seven brothers; the first married a wife and then
died leaving no children.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The second married the widow, and he too died leaving no children;
with the third it was the same,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and none of the seven left any children. Last of all the woman
herself died.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now at the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she
be, since she had been married to all seven?'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Jesus said to them, 'Surely the reason why you are wrong is that
you understand neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For when they rise from the dead, men and women do not marry; no,
they are like the angels in heaven.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now about the dead rising again, have you never read in the Book of
Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him and said: I
am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` He is God, not of the dead, but of the living. You are very much
mistaken.'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` One of the scribes who had listened to them debating appreciated
that Jesus had given a good answer and put a further question to him,
'Which is the first of all the commandments?'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus replied, 'This is the first: Listen, Israel, the Lord our God
is the one, only Lord,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all
your soul, with all your mind and with all your strength.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The second is this: You must love your neighbour as yourself. There
is no commandment greater than these.'
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The scribe said to him, 'Well spoken, Master; what you have said is
true, that he is one and there is no other.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and
strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself, this is far more
important than any burnt offering or sacrifice.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus, seeing how wisely he had spoken, said, 'You are not far from
the kingdom of God.' And after that no one dared to question him any
more.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` While teaching in the Temple, Jesus said, 'How can the scribes
maintain that the Christ is the son of David?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` David himself, moved by the Holy Spirit, said: The Lord declared to
my Lord, take your seat at my right hand till I have made your enemies
your footstool.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` David himself calls him Lord; in what way then can he be his son?'
And the great crowd listened to him with delight.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` In his teaching he said, 'Beware of the scribes who like to walk
about in long robes, to be greeted respectfully in the market squares,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` to take the front seats in the synagogues and the places of honour
at banquets;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` these are the men who devour the property of widows and for show
offer long prayers. The more severe will be the sentence they receive.'
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` He sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting
money into the treasury, and many of the rich put in a great deal.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` A poor widow came and put in two small coins, the equivalent of a
penny.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Then he called his disciples and said to them, 'In truth I tell
you, this poor widow has put more in than all who have contributed to
the treasury;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` for they have all put in money they could spare, but she in her
poverty has put in everything she possessed, all she had to live on.'
