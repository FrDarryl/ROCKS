"1" = ''':sup:`1` Israelites, hear what Yahweh says, for Yahweh indicts the citizens
of the country: there is no loyalty, no faithful love, no knowledge of
God in the country,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` only perjury and lying, murder, theft, adultery and violence,
bloodshed after bloodshed.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This is why the country is in mourning and all its citizens pining
away, the wild animals also and birds of the sky, even the fish in the
sea will disappear.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But let no one denounce, no one rebuke; it is you, priest, that I
denounce.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Priest, you will stumble in broad daylight, and the prophet will
stumble with you in the dark, and I will make your mother perish.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` My people perish for want of knowledge. Since you yourself have
rejected knowledge, so I shall reject you from my priesthood; since you
have forgotten the teaching of your God, I in my turn shall forget your
children.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` The more of them there have been, the more they have sinned against
me; they have bartered their Glory for Shame.

'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` they consult their block of wood, and their stick explains what
they should do. For an urge to go whoring has led them astray and
whoring they go and desert their God;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` they offer sacrifice on the mountain tops, they burn incense on the
hills, under oak and poplar and terebinth, for pleasant is their shade.
So, although your daughters play the whore and your daughters-in-law
commit adultery,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I shall not punish your daughters for playing the whore nor your
daughters-in-law for committing adultery, when the men themselves are
wandering off with whores and offering sacrifice with sacred
prostitutes, for a people with no understanding is doomed.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Though you, Israel, play the whore, there is no need for Judah to
sin too. Do not go to Gilgal, do not go up to Beth-Aven, do not swear
oaths 'by Yahweh's life',

"16" = ''':sup:`16` for Israel is as stubborn as a stubborn heifer; so is Yahweh likely
to pasture him like a lamb in a broad meadow?
