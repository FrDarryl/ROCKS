thousand sheep.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The priests were too few, however, and were unable to dismember all
the burnt offerings, so their brothers, the Levites, helped them until
the work was finished and the priests had sanctified themselves; for
the Levites had been more conscientious about sanctifying themselves
than the priests had.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` In addition to the abundance of burnt offerings, there were also
the fatty pieces for communion sacrifices and the libations for the
