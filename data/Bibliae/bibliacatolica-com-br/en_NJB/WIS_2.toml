Notas de rodap√©:
2:1-5 - The wicked doubt God's justice and claim that life is fleeting.
This materialistic view reflects a lack of spiritual understanding and
2:6-9 - The pursuit of temporal pleasures and the denial of any divine
responsibility lead to arrogance. The author emphasizes that true
wisdom opposes this mindset and seeks what is eternal (see also
2:10-12 - The persecution of the righteous is a consequence of
rejecting wisdom. The wicked try to eliminate those who live
righteously, revealing their true nature and contempt for the truth
2:13-16 - The righteous are seen as an affront to the lives of the
wicked, for their righteousness exposes moral corruption. The contrast
between the righteous and the wicked is emphasized, showing how the
light of wisdom overshadows the darkness of unrighteousness (see also
2:17-24 - The death and resurrection of Christ are prefigured in this
passage, which reveals wisdom's victory over death. The assurance of
eternal life for the righteous is a source of hope and encouragement
