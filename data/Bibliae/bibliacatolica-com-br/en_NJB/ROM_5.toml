"1" = ''':sup:`1` So then, now that we have been justified by faith, we are at peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` it is through him, by faith, that we have been admitted into God's
favour in which we are living, and look forward exultantly to God's
glory.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Not only that; let us exult, too, in our hardships, understanding
that hardship develops perseverance,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and perseverance develops a tested character, something that gives
us hope,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and a hope which will not let us down, because the love of God has
been poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to
us.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When we were still helpless, at the appointed time, Christ died for
the godless.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` You could hardly find anyone ready to die even for someone upright;
though it is just possible that, for a really good person, someone
might undertake to die.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So it is proof of God's own love for us, that Christ died for us
while we were still sinners.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` How much more can we be sure, therefore, that, now that we have been
justified by his death, we shall be saved through him from the
retribution of God.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through
the death of his Son, how much more can we be sure that, being now
reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` What is more, we are filled with exultant trust in God, through our
Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have already gained our
reconciliation.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Well then; it was through one man that sin came into the world, and
through sin death, and thus death has spread through the whole human
race because everyone has sinned.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Sin already existed in the world before there was any law, even
though sin is not reckoned when there is no law.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Nonetheless death reigned over all from Adam to Moses, even over
those whose sin was not the breaking of a commandment, as Adam's was.
He prefigured the One who was to come . . .
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` There is no comparison between the free gift and the offence. If
death came to many through the offence of one man, how much greater an
effect the grace of God has had, coming to so many and so plentifully
as a free gift through the one man Jesus Christ!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Again, there is no comparison between the gift and the offence of
one man. One single offence brought condemnation, but now, after many
offences, have come the free gift and so acquittal!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It was by one man's offence that death came to reign over all, but
how much greater the reign in life of those who receive the fullness of
grace and the gift of saving justice, through the one man, Jesus
Christ.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` One man's offence brought condemnation on all humanity; and one
man's good act has brought justification and life to all humanity.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Just as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by one
man's obedience are many to be made upright.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When law came on the scene, it was to multiply the offences. But
however much sin increased, grace was always greater;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` so that as sin's reign brought death, so grace was to rule through
saving justice that leads to eternal life through Jesus Christ our
Lord.
