"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the eleventh year, on the first day of the third month, the word
of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` 'Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and his throng of
subjects: "What can compare with you for greatness?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I know: a cedar tree in the Lebanon with noble branches, dense
foliage, lofty height. Its top pierces the clouds.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The waters have made it grow, the deep has made it tall, pouring its
rivers round the place where it is planted, sending rivulets to all the
wild trees.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` This is why its height was greater than that of other wild trees,
its branches increased in number, its boughs stretched wide, because of
the plentiful waters making it grow.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` All the birds of heaven nested in its branches; under its boughs all
wild animals dropped their young; in its shade sat many, many people.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It was beautiful in its size, in the span of its boughs; for its
roots were in plentiful waters.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` There was no cedar like it in the garden of God, no cypress had
branches such as these, no plane tree could match its boughs, no tree
in the garden of God could rival its beauty.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I had made it so lovely with its many branches that it was the envy
of every tree in Eden, in the garden of God.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` "Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: "Since it has raised itself
to its full height, has lifted its top into the clouds, and has grown
arrogant about its height,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I have handed it over to the prince of the nations, for him to
treat as its wickedness deserves; I have rejected it.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Foreigners, the most barbarous of nations, have cut it down and
deserted it. On the mountains, in all the valleys, lie its branches;
its broken boughs are in every ravine throughout the country; everybody
in the country has fled its shade and deserted it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` On its wreckage perch all the birds of heaven; all the wild animals
have advanced on its branches.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` "So in future let no tree rear its height beside the waters, none
push its top into the clouds, no watered tree stretch its height
towards them. For all of them are doomed to death, to the depths of the
underworld, with the common run of humanity, with those who sink into
oblivion.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "The Lord Yahweh says this: The day it went down to Sheol, I
imposed mourning, I closed the deep over it. I stopped its rivers and
the plentiful waters dried up; I made Lebanon dark because of it, and
all the wild trees wilted because of it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` With the noise when it fell I made the nations quake, as I hurled
it down to Sheol, with those who sink into oblivion. In the depths of
the underworld all the trees of Eden took comfort, the pick of the
loveliest trees of the Lebanon, all irrigated by the waters.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And its offspring among the nations, once living in its shade, went
down to Sheol with it, to those who have been slaughtered by the sword.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Which of the trees of Eden compares with you for glory and
greatness? Yet you have been hurled down with the trees of Eden, to the
depths of the underworld, among the uncircumcised, and there you lie
with those who have been slaughtered by the sword. So much for Pharaoh
and all his throng-- declared the Lord Yahweh."'

Notas de rodap√©:
31:1-9 - The allegory of the cedar tree of Lebanon is used to describe
Egypt, which, though great and strong, will be overthrown. The tree
symbolizes the Egyptian power, which was exalted but which, before God,
31:10-14 - The fall of the great tree (Egypt) will be a spectacle for
all nations, who will learn from God's judgment. The destruction of
human empires serves as a warning to all nations that no human
31:15-17 - The fall of Egypt will be like the fall of other great
nations that have fallen in the past. This reinforces the theme of the
ephemerality of human kingdoms and the fact that all are susceptible to
31:18:00 - Egypt, like the fallen tree, will be forgotten by all
nations, and its greatness will be remembered only by its fall. The
pride and self-sufficiency of powerful nations are temporary, for only
6:19-21).
