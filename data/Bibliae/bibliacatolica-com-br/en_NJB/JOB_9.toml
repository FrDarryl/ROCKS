"1" = ''':sup:`1` Job spoke next. He said:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Indeed, I know it is as you say: how could anyone claim to be
upright before God?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Anyone trying to argue matters with him, could not give him one
answer in a thousand.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Among the wisest and the hardiest, who then can successfully defy
him?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He moves the mountains, though they do not know it; he throws them
down when he is angry.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He shakes the earth, and moves it from its place, making all its
pillars tremble.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The sun, at his command, forbears to rise, and on the stars he sets
a seal.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He and no other has stretched out the heavens and trampled on the
back of the Sea.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He has made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the Mansions of the
South.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The works he does are great and unfathomable, and his marvels
cannot be counted.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` If he passes me, I do not see him; he slips by, imperceptible to
me.

'What are you doing?'

"13" = ''':sup:`13` God does not renounce his anger: beneath him, Rahab's minions still
lie prostrate.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And here am I, proposing to defend myself and select my arguments
against him!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Even if I am upright, what point is there in answering him? I can
only plead for mercy with my judge!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And if he deigned to answer my citation, I cannot believe he would
listen to what I said,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` he who crushes me for one hair, who, for no reason, wounds and
wounds again,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` not even letting me regain my breath, with so much bitterness he
fills me!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Shall I try force? Look how strong he is! Or go to court? But who
will summon him?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` If I prove myself upright, his mouth may condemn me, even if I am
innocent, he may pronounce me perverse.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But am I innocent? I am no longer sure, and life itself I despise!
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` It is all one, and hence I boldly say: he destroys innocent and
guilty alike.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When a sudden deadly scourge descends, he laughs at the plight of
the innocent.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When a country falls into the power of the wicked, he veils the
faces of its judges. Or if not he, who else?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` My days pass: more swiftly than a runner they flee away with never
a glimpse of happiness,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` they skim past like a reed canoe, like an eagle swooping on its
prey.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` If I decide to stifle my complaining, change countenance, and wear
a smiling face,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` fear seizes me at the thought of all my woes, for I know you do not
regard me as innocent.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And if I have done wrong, why should I put myself to useless
trouble?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` If I wash myself in melted snow, clean my hands with soda,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` you will only plunge me into the dung, till my clothes themselves
recoil from me!
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` For he is not human like me: impossible for me to answer him or
appear alongside him in court.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` There is no arbiter between us, to lay his hand on both,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` to stay his rod from me, or keep away his daunting terrors.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Nonetheless, unafraid of him, I shall speak: since I do not see
myself like that at all!

prosperity of the wicked is a recurring theme in Scripture and raises
