"1" = ''':sup:`1` Solomon then summoned the elders of Israel to Jerusalem to bring the
ark of the covenant of Yahweh up from the City of David, that is, Zion.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` All the men of Israel assembled round King Solomon in the month of
Ethanim, at the time of the feast (that is, the seventh month).
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the
ark
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred utensils which were in
the Tent.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` King Solomon and all Israel, present with him before the ark,
sacrificed countless, innumerable sheep and oxen.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The priests brought the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place,
in the Debir of the Temple, that is, in the Holy of Holies, under the
wings of the winged creatures
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` for the winged creatures spread their wings over the place where the
ark stood, forming a canopy over the ark and its shafts.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` These were so long, however, that the ends of the shafts could be
seen from the Holy Place in front of the Debir, though they could not
be seen from outside. They are still there today.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which
Moses had placed in it at Horeb, the tablets of the covenant which
Yahweh made with the Israelites when they came out of Egypt.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now when the priests came out of the Holy Place, the cloud filled
the Temple of Yahweh,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and because of the cloud the priests could not stay and perform
their duties. For the glory of Yahweh filled the Temple of Yahweh.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Solomon said: Yahweh has chosen to dwell in thick cloud.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I have built you a princely dwelling, a residence for you for ever.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The king then turned round and blessed the whole assembly of
Israel, while the whole assembly of Israel stood.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He said, 'Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, who has carried out by
his hand what he promised with his mouth to my father David, when he
said,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt I chose no
city, in any of the tribes of Israel, to have a temple built where my
name should be; but I did choose David to rule my people Israel."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` My father David had set his heart on building a temple for the name
of Yahweh, God of Israel,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` but Yahweh said to my father David, "You have set your heart on
building a temple for my name, and in this you have done well;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and yet, you are not the man to build the temple; but your son, yet
to be born to you, will be the one to build the temple for my name."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Yahweh has kept the promise which he made: I have succeeded my
father David and am seated on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised;
I have built the temple for the name of Yahweh, God of Israel,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and in it I have made a place for the ark containing the covenant
of Yahweh which he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of
Egypt.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then, in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel, Solomon
stood facing the altar of Yahweh and, stretching out his hands towards
heaven,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` said, 'Yahweh, God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven
above or on earth beneath, as loyal to the covenant and faithful in
love to your servants as long as they walk wholeheartedly in your way.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` You have kept the promise you made to your servant, my father
David, as you promised him you would. Today you have carried it out by
your power.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And now, Yahweh, God of Israel, keep the promise which you made to
your servant David when you said, "You will never lack for a man to sit
before me on the throne of Israel, provided that your sons are careful
how they behave, walking before me as you yourself have done."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So now, God of Israel, let the words come true which you spoke to
your servant, my father David.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Yet will God really live with human beings on earth? Why, the
heavens, the highest of the heavens, cannot contain you. How much less
this temple built by me!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Even so, listen favourably to the prayer and entreaty of your
servant, Yahweh my God; listen to the cry and to the prayer which your
servant makes to you today:
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` day and night may your eyes watch over this temple, over this place
of which you have said, "My name will be there." Listen to the prayer
which your servant offers in this place.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` 'Listen to the entreaty of your servant and of your people Israel;
whenever they pray in this place, listen from the place where you
reside in heaven; and when you hear, forgive.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` 'If someone has wronged his neighbour and a curse is laid on him to
make him swear an oath here before your altar in this Temple,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` then listen from the place where you reside in heaven and do
justice between your servants: condemning the guilty one by making him
suffer for his conduct, and acquitting the upright by rewarding him as
his uprightness deserves.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` 'When your people Israel are defeated by the enemy because they
have sinned against you, but then return to you and acknowledge your
name, and pray and seek your favours in this Temple,

"34" = ''':sup:`34` then listen from the place where you reside in heaven; forgive the
sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to the country which you
gave to their ancestors.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` 'When the heavens are shut and there is no rain because they have
sinned against you, if they pray in this place and praise your name
and, having been humbled by you, desist from their sin,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` then listen from the place where you reside in heaven and forgive
the sin of your servant and your people Israel -- for you are
constantly showing them the good way which they must follow -- and send
rain on your country, which you have given to your people as their
heritage.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` 'Should there be famine in the country, or pestilence, wind-blast
or mildew, locust or caterpillar; should their enemy lay siege to one
of their gates; should there be any plague or any disease:

"38" = ''':sup:`38` whatever be the prayer or entreaty of any individual aware of a
particular affliction: when that person stretches out the hands towards
this Temple,

"39" = ''':sup:`39` then listen from heaven where you reside; forgive and, since you
know what is in the heart, deal with each as their conduct deserves --
for you alone know what is in every human heart-

"40" = ''':sup:`40` so that they may reverence you throughout their lives in the
country which you gave to our ancestors.

"41" = ''':sup:`41` 'Even the foreigner, not belonging to your people Israel but coming
from a distant country, attracted by your name-

"42" = ''':sup:`42` for they too will hear of your name, of your mighty hand and
outstretched arm -- if a foreigner comes and prays in this Temple,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` listen from heaven where you reside, and grant all that the
foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may
acknowledge your name and, like your people Israel, revere you and know
that this Temple, which I have built, bears your name.

"44" = ''':sup:`44` 'If your people go out to war against the enemy, on whatever
missions you send them, and they pray to Yahweh, turning towards the
city which you have chosen and towards the Temple which I have built
for your name,

uphold their cause.

"46" = ''':sup:`46` 'When they sin against you -- for there is no one who does not sin
-- and you are angry with them and abandon them to the enemy, and their
captors carry them off to a hostile country, be it far away or near,

"47" = ''':sup:`47` if they come to their senses in the country to which they have been
taken as captives and repent and entreat you in the country of their
captors, saying, "We have sinned, we have acted perversely and
wickedly,"

"48" = ''':sup:`48` and turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the country
of the enemies who have taken them captive, and pray to you, turning
towards the country which you gave to their ancestors, towards the city
which you have chosen and towards the Temple which I have built for
your name,

"49" = ''':sup:`49` listen to their prayer and their entreaty from the place where you
reside in heaven, uphold their case,

"50" = ''':sup:`50` forgive your people for having sinned against you and for all the
crimes against you of which they have been guilty, and allow them to
arouse the pity of their captors so that these may have pity on them:

"51" = ''':sup:`51` for they are your people and your heritage whom you brought out of
Egypt, that iron foundry!

"52" = ''':sup:`52` 'May your eyes be open to the entreaty of your servant and the
entreaty of your people Israel, to listen to them, whatever they ask of
you.

"53" = ''':sup:`53` For you it was who set them apart from all the peoples of the earth
to be your heritage, as you declared through your servant Moses when
you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh.'

"54" = ''':sup:`54` When Solomon had finished offering to Yahweh this whole prayer and
entreaty, he rose from where he was kneeling with hands stretched out
towards heaven before the altar of Yahweh,

"55" = ''':sup:`55` and stood upright. And in a loud voice he blessed the whole
assembly of Israel.

"56" = ''':sup:`56` 'Blessed be Yahweh,' he said, 'who has granted rest to his people
Israel, keeping all his promises. Of all the promises of good that he
made through his servant Moses, not one has failed.

never desert us or cast us off.

ways and keep the commandments and laws and ordinances which he gave to
our ancestors.

with Yahweh our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his
servant and the cause of Israel his people, as each day requires,

"60" = ''':sup:`60` so that all the peoples of the earth may come to know that Yahweh
is God indeed and that there is no other.

"61" = ''':sup:`61` May your hearts be wholly with Yahweh our God, following his laws
and keeping his commandments as at this present day.'
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` The king and all Israel with him offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` Solomon offered a communion sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen
and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep to Yahweh; and thus the king
and all the Israelites dedicated the Temple of Yahweh.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` On the same day the king consecrated the middle part of the court
in front of the Temple of Yahweh; for that was where he presented the
burnt offerings, oblations and fatty parts of the communion sacrifices,
since the bronze altar which stood before Yahweh was too small to hold
the burnt offering, oblation and the fatty parts of the communion
sacrifice.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` And then Solomon and with him all Israel from the Pass of Hamath to
the Torrent of Egypt -- a great assembly -- celebrated the feast before
Yahweh our God for seven days.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` On the eighth day he dismissed the people, who bade farewell to the
king and went home joyful and happy of heart over all the goodness
which Yahweh had shown to his servant and his people Israel.
