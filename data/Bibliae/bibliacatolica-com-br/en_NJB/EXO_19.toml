you, out of all peoples, shall be my personal possession, for the whole
world is mine.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` For me you shall be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation." Those are

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Even the priests, who do have access to Yahweh, must sanctify
themselves, or Yahweh may burst out against them.'
