"1" = ''':sup:`1` 'Because of the sins which you have committed before God you are to
be deported to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar king of the Babylonians.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Once you have reached Babylon you will stay there for many years, as
long as seven generations; after which I shall bring you home in peace.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now in Babylon you will see gods made of silver, of gold, of wood,
being carried shoulder-high, and filling the gentiles with fear.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Be on your guard! Do not imitate the foreigners, do not have any
fear of their gods
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` as you see their worshippers prostrating themselves before and
behind them. Instead, say in your hearts, "Master, it is you that we
must worship."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For my angel is with you; your lives will be in his care.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` 'Overlaid with gold and silver, their tongues polished smooth by a
craftsman, they are counterfeit and have no power to speak.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` As though for a girl fond of finery, these people take gold and make
crowns for the heads of their gods.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And sometimes, the priests filch gold and silver from their gods to
spend on themselves, even giving some of it to the prostitutes on the
terrace.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` They dress up these gods of silver, gold and wood, in clothes, like
human beings; on their own they cannot protect themselves from either
tarnish or woodworm;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` when they have been dressed in purple cloaks, their faces have to
be dusted, because of the temple dust which settles thick on them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` One holds a sceptre like the governor of a province, yet is
powerless to put to death anyone who offends him;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` another holds sword and mace in his right hand, yet is powerless to
defend himself against war or thieves.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` From this it is evident that they are not gods; do not be afraid of
them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` 'Just as a pot in common use becomes useless once it is broken, so
are these gods enshrined inside their temples.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Their eyes are full of dust raised by the feet of those who enter.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Just as the doors are locked on all sides on someone who has
offended a king and is under sentence of death, so the priests secure
the temples of these gods with gates and bolts and bars for fear of
burglary.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They light more lamps for them than they do for themselves, and the
gods see none of them.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They are like one of the temple beams, which are said to be gnawed
away from within; the termites creep out of the ground and eat them and
their clothes too, and they feel nothing.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Their faces are blackened by the smoke that rises from the temple.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Bats, swallows, birds of every kind perch on their bodies and
heads, and so do cats.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` From this, you can see for yourselves that they are not gods; do
not be afraid of them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` 'The gold with which they are parading their futility before the
world is supposed to make them look beautiful, but if someone does not
rub off the tarnish, these gods will not be shining much on their own,
and even while they were being cast, they felt nothing.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` However much was paid for them, there is still no breath of life in
them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Being unable to walk, they have to be carried on men's shoulders,
which shows how futile they are. It is humiliating for their
worshippers, too, who have to stand them up again if they fall over.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Once they have been stood up, they cannot move on their own; if
they tilt askew, they cannot right themselves; offerings made to them
might as well be made to the dead.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Whatever is sacrificed to them, the priests re-sell and pocket the
profit; while their wives salt down part of it, but give nothing to the
poor or to the helpless. As to the sacrifices themselves, why, women
during their periods and women in childbed are not afraid to touch
them!
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` From all this you can tell that they are not gods; do not be afraid
of them.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` 'Indeed, how can they even be called gods, when women do the
offering to these gods of silver, gold and wood?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` In their temples, the priests stay sitting down, their garments
torn, heads and beard shaved and heads uncovered;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` they roar and shriek before their gods as people do at funeral
feasts.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The priests take robes from the gods to clothe their own wives and
children.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Whether these gods are treated badly or well, they are incapable of
paying back either treatment; as incapable too of making or unmaking
kings,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` equally incapable of distributing wealth or money. If anyone fails
to honour a vow he has made to them, they cannot call him to account.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` They can neither save anyone from death nor rescue the weak from
the strong,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` nor restore sight to the blind, nor save anyone in trouble,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` nor take pity on a widow, nor be generous to an orphan.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` These wooden gods overlaid with gold and silver are about as much
use as rocks cut out of the mountain side. Their worshippers will be
confounded!
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So how can anyone think or say that they are gods?
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` 'The Chaldaeans themselves do them no honour; if they find someone
who is dumb and cannot speak, they present him to Bel, entreating him
for the gift of speech, as though he could perceive it!
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And they are incapable of drawing the conclusion and abandoning
those gods -- such is their lack of perception.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Women with strings round their waists sit in the streets, burning
bran like incense;
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` when one of these has been picked up by a passer-by and been to bed
with him, she then gloats over her neighbour for not having been
thought as worthy as herself and for not having had her string broken.

"44" = ''':sup:`44` Whatever is done for them is spurious. So how can anyone think or
say that they are gods?
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` 'Made by woodworkers and goldsmiths, they are only what those
workmen decide to make them.

"46" = ''':sup:`46` Their makers have not long to live themselves, so how can the
things they make be gods?
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Their legacy to their descendants is nothing but delusion and
dishonour.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` If war or disasters befall them, the priests discuss where best to
hide themselves and these gods;
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` how can anyone fail to realise that they are not gods, if they
cannot save themselves from war or from disasters?
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And since they are only made of wood overlaid with gold or silver,
it will later become apparent that they are spurious; it will be
obvious to everyone, to nations as to kings, that they are not gods but
the work of human hands, and that there is no divine activity in them.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Does anyone still need convincing that they are not gods?
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` 'They can neither appoint a king over a country, nor give rain to
humankind,
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` nor regulate their own affairs, nor rescue anyone who suffers a
wrong; they are as helpless as crows between sky and ground.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` If fire falls on the temple of these wooden gods overlaid with gold
or silver, their priests fly to safety while they for their part stay
there like beams, to be burnt.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` They cannot put up any resistance to a king or to enemies.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` So how can anyone think or say that they are gods?
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` 'These wooden gods overlaid with gold or silver cannot evade
thieves or marauders; strong men may rob them of their gold and silver
and make off with the robes they are dressed in; yet they are powerless
to help even themselves.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Better to be a king displaying his prowess, a household pot of use
to its owner, than to be these counterfeit gods; or merely the door of
a house, protecting what is inside, than these counterfeit gods; or a
wooden pillar in a palace than these counterfeit gods.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` The sun, the moon and the stars, which shine and have been given
work to do, are obedient;
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` similarly, the lightning, as it flashes, is a fine sight; in the
same way, the wind blows across every country,
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` the clouds execute the order God gives them to pass over the whole
earth, and the fire, sent from above to consume mountain and forest,
carries out its orders.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` Now these gods are not their equals, either in beauty or in power.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` So, no one can think or say that they are gods, powerless as they
are to administer justice or to do anyone any good.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` Therefore, knowing that they are not gods, do not be afraid of
them.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` 'For they can neither curse nor bless kings,

"66" = ''':sup:`66` nor produce signs in heaven for the nations, nor shine like the
sun, nor shed light like the moon.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` The animals are better off than they are, being able to look after
themselves by making for cover.
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` There is not the slightest shred of evidence that they are gods; so
do not be afraid of them!
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` 'Their wooden gods overlaid with gold and silver are like a
scarecrow in a field of cucumbers -- protecting nothing.
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` Or again, their wooden gods overlaid with gold and silver are like
a thorn-bush in a garden -- any kind of bird may perch on it -- or like
a corpse thrown out into the dark.
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` From the purple and linen rotting on their backs you can tell that
they are not gods; and in the end, eaten away, they will be the
dishonour of the country.
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` Better, then, someone upright who has no idols; dishonour will
never come near him.'

Notas de rodapé:
6:1-4 - Baruch delivers a warning about the idols of Babylon, which are
false representations of power and divinity. This passage denounces the
futility of idolatry and the uselessness of gods made by human hands,
reinforcing God's exclusivity as the only one worthy of worship (see
6:5-8 - The description of idols as objects made of wood and silver
reveals their weakness and inability to save or protect. This invites
us to reflect on true worship of God, and how He alone can truly
6:9-13 - The idols are described as being manipulated by the priests,
who treat them as if they were living deities, but these idols have no
life or power. This point reinforces the idea that true faith in God is
not based on images or objects, but on a direct relationship with the
6:14-16 - The critique of idols continues, reminding us that these
false objects have no power over humans or creation. Rather, the Lord
is the Creator of all things, and He alone deserves praise and worship.
This rejection of idolatry is central to biblical theology (see also
6:17-22 - The chapter concludes with a call for the people of Israel to
turn away from idolatry and to the one living God. The rejection of
idols is a reaffirmation of biblical monotheism, which emphasizes the
oneness of God and the need for exclusive worship of Him (see also
