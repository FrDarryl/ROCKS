to fight Israel, and Achish said to David, 'It is understood that you
and your men go into battle with me.'

at Ramah, his own town. Saul had expelled the necromancers and wizards
from the country.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Meanwhile the Philistines had mustered and had come and pitched camp
at Shunem. Saul mustered all Israel and they encamped at Gilboa.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and his heart
trembled violently.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Saul consulted Yahweh, but Yahweh gave him no answer, either by
dream, divination or prophet.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Saul then said to his servants, 'Find a necromancer for me, so that
I can go and consult her.' His servants replied, 'There is a
necromancer at En-Dor.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And so Saul, disguising himself and changing his clothes, set out
accompanied by two men; their visit to the woman took place at night.
'Disclose the future to me', he said, 'by means of a ghost. Conjure up
the one I shall name to you.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The woman replied, 'Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has
outlawed necromancers and wizards from the country; why are you setting
a trap for my life, then, to have me killed?'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But Saul swore to her by Yahweh, 'As Yahweh lives,' he said, 'no
blame shall attach to you for this business.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The woman asked, 'Whom shall I conjure up for you?' He replied,
'Conjure up Samuel.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The woman then saw Samuel and, giving a great cry, she said to
Saul, 'Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The king said, 'Do not be afraid! What do you see?' The woman
replied to Saul, 'I see a ghost rising from the earth.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` 'What is he like?' he asked. She replied, 'It is an old man coming
up; he is wrapped in a cloak.' Saul then knew that it was Samuel and,
bowing to the ground, prostrated himself.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Samuel said to Saul, 'Why have you disturbed my rest by conjuring
me up?' Saul replied, 'I am in great distress; the Philistines are
waging war on me, and God has abandoned me and no longer answers me
either by prophet or by dream; and so I have summoned you to tell me
what I ought to do.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Samuel said, 'Why consult me, when Yahweh has abandoned you and has
become your enemy?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Yahweh has treated you as he foretold through me; he has snatched
the sovereignty from your hand and given it to your neighbour, David,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` because you disobeyed Yahweh's voice and did not execute his fierce
anger against Amalek. That is why Yahweh is treating you like this
today.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` What is more, Yahweh will deliver Israel and you too, into the
power of the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me;
and Yahweh will hand over the army of Israel into the power of the
Philistines.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground. He was terrified
by what Samuel had said and was also weak from having eaten nothing all
that day and night.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The woman went to Saul and, seeing his terror, said, 'Look, your
servant has obeyed your order; I have taken my life in my hands and
obeyed the command which you gave me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Now please, you in your turn listen to what your servant has to
say. Let me offer you a piece of bread. Eat something and get some
strength for your journey.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But he refused. 'I will not eat,' he said. His servants however
pressed him, and so did the woman. Allowing himself to be persuaded by
them, he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The woman owned a fattened calf which she quickly slaughtered, and
she took some flour and kneaded it and with it baked some unleavened
cakes

"25" = ''':sup:`25` which she served to Saul and his servants; they ate, and then set
off and left the same night.

Urim, leading him to seek guidance from forbidden sources. This
situation reflects Saul's declining spiritual state and his failure to

rebukes Saul for his disobedience. Samuel's message reinforces the
impending judgment on Saul and his dynasty, confirming David's
