"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes,
since I was in charge of the wine, I took the wine and offered it to
the king. Now, he had never seen me looking depressed before.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So the king said to me, 'Why are you looking depressed? You are not
sick! This must be a sadness of the heart.' Thoroughly alarmed by this,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I said to the king, 'May the king live for ever! How can I not look
depressed when the city where the tombs of my ancestors are lies in
ruins and its gates have been burnt down?'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The king then said to me, 'What would you like me to do?' Praying to
the God of heaven,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I said to the king, 'If the king approves and your servant enjoys
your favour, send me to Judah, to the city of the tombs of my
ancestors, so that I can rebuild it.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The king -- with the queen sitting beside him-said, 'How long will
your journey take, and when will you come back?' Once I had given him a
definite time, the king approved my mission.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I then said to the king, 'If the king approves, may I be given
orders for the governors of Transeuphrates to let me pass through on my
way to Judah?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Also an order for Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, to supply me
with timber for the beams of the gates of the citadel of the Temple,
for the city walls and for the house which I am to occupy?' These the
king granted me because the kindly hand of my God was over me.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When I reached the governors of Transeuphrates, I gave them the
king's orders. The king had sent an escort of army officers and cavalry
along with me.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the official of Ammon heard
about this, they were exceedingly displeased that someone had come to
promote the welfare of the Israelites.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And so I reached Jerusalem. After I had been there three days,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I got up during the night with a few other men -- I had not told
anyone what my God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem -- taking no
animal with me other than my own mount.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Under cover of dark I went out through the Valley Gate towards the
Dragon's Fountain as far as the Dung Gate, and examined the wall of
Jerusalem where it was broken down and its gates burnt out.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I then crossed to the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but it was
impassable to my mount.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So I went up the Valley in the dark, examining the wall; I then
went in again through the Valley Gate, coming back
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` without the officials knowing where I had gone or what I had been
doing. So far I had said nothing to the Jews: neither to the priests,
the nobles, the officials nor any other persons involved in the
undertaking.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I then said to them, 'You see what a sorry state we are in:
Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates have been burnt down. Come on, we
must rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and put an end to our humiliating
position!'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And I told them how the kindly hand of my God had been over me, and
the words which the king had said to me. At this they said, 'Let us
start building at once!' and they set their hands to the good work.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the official of Ammon, and
Geshem the Arab heard about this, they laughed at us and jeered. They
said, 'What is this you are doing? Are you going to revolt against the
king?'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But I gave them this answer, 'The God of heaven will grant us
success and we, his servants, mean to start building; as for you, you
have neither share nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem.'
