houses in turn, and to invite their three sisters to eat and drink with
them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Once each series of banquets was over, Job would send for them to
come and be purified, and at dawn on the following day he would make a
burnt offering for each of them. 'Perhaps', Job would say, 'my sons
have sinned and in their heart blasphemed.' So that was what Job used
to do each time.

then, I warrant you, he will curse you to your face.'

But keep your hands off his person.' So Satan left the presence of
Yahweh.
