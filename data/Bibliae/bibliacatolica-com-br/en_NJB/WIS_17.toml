uninstructed souls have gone astray.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` While the wicked supposed they had a holy nation in their power,
they themselves lay prisoners of the dark, in the fetters of long
night, confined under their own roofs, banished from eternal
providence.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` While they thought to remain unnoticed with their secret sins,
curtained by dark forgetfulness, they were scattered in fearful dismay,
terrified by apparitions.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The hiding place sheltering them could not ward off their fear;
terrifying noises echoed round them; and gloomy, grim-faced spectres
haunted them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` No fire had power enough to give them light, nor could the brightly
blazing stars illuminate that dreadful night.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The only light for them was a great, spontaneous blaze -- a fearful
sight to see! And in their terror, once that sight had vanished, they
thought what they had seen more terrible than ever.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Their magical illusions were powerless now, and their claims to
intelligence were ignominiously confounded;

"8" = ''':sup:`8` for those who promised to drive out fears and disorders from sick
souls were now themselves sick with ludicrous fright.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Even when there was nothing frightful to scare them, the vermin
creeping past and the hissing of reptiles filled them with panic;

"10" = ''':sup:`10` they died convulsed with fright, refusing even to look at empty

under pressure from conscience it always assumes the worst.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Fear, indeed, is nothing other than the failure of the help offered
by reason;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` the less you rely within yourself on this, the more alarming it is
not to know the cause of your suffering.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And they, all locked in the same sleep, while that darkness lasted
-- which was in fact quite powerless and had issued from the depths of
equally powerless Hades-
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` were now chased by monstrous spectres, now paralysed by the
fainting of their souls; for a sudden, unexpected terror had attacked
them.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And thus, whoever it might be that fell there stayed clamped to the
spot in this prison without bars.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Whether he was ploughman or shepherd, or somebody at work in the
desert, he was still overtaken and suffered the inevitable fate, for
all had been bound by the one same chain of darkness.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The soughing of the wind, the tuneful noise of birds in the
spreading branches, the measured beat of water in its powerful course,
the headlong din of rocks cascading down,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` the unseen course of bounding animals, the roaring of the most
savage of wild beasts, the echo rebounding from the clefts in the
mountains, all held them paralysed with fear.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` For the whole world shone with the light of day and, unhindered,
went about its work;

"21" = ''':sup:`21` over them alone there spread a heavy darkness, image of the dark
that would receive them. But heavier than the darkness was the burden
they were to themselves.
