Notas de rodap√©:
1:1-3 - The author, identified as "the Preacher," introduces the theme
of the vanity and futility of earthly life. He questions the value of
human accomplishments, highlighting the impermanence of everything done
1:4-7 - The Preacher observes the repetitive cycles of nature to
illustrate the monotony of human existence. Creation, despite its
constancy, offers no lasting meaning to life, emphasizing human
1:8-11 - Dissatisfaction is a recurring theme. No achievement or
experience is enough to fill the inner void, and the forgetfulness of
past generations demonstrates the transience of human achievements (see
1:12-14 - The Preacher shares his quest for wisdom and knowledge, only
to discover that this too is "vanity." Human wisdom, however valuable,
cannot eliminate life's difficulties, but rather enhances our awareness
1:15-18 - Increased knowledge brings increased sorrow, for wisdom
exposes the difficulties and limitations of human existence. This
contrast between wisdom and sorrow highlights the weakness of wisdom
3:19).
