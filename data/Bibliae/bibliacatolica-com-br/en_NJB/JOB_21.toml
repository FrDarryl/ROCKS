me.

be perturbed!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Give your attention to me; you will be dumbfounded and will place
your hand over your mouth.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` I myself am appalled at the very thought, and my flesh creeps.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why do the wicked still live on, their power increasing with their
age?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They see their posterity assured, and their offspring secure before
their eyes.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The peace of their houses has nothing to fear, the rod that God
wields is not for them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` No mishap with their bull at breeding-time, nor miscarriage with
their cow at calving.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice to the sound of
the pipe.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` They end their lives in happiness and go down in peace to Sheol.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Yet these are the ones who say to God, 'Go away! We do not want to
learn your ways.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` What is the point of our serving Shaddai? What should we gain from
praying to him?'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Surely they have won their own prosperity, since God is kept so far
from their plans?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Do we often see the light of the wicked put out, or disaster
overtake him, or the retribution of God destroy his possessions,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` or the wind blow him away like a straw, or a whirlwind carry him
off like chaff?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So God is storing up punishment for his children? But the wicked
himself should be punished, and should know it!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He himself should witness his own ruin, and himself drink the anger
of Shaddai.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Once he is gone, what joy can he gain from his family, once the
number of his months has been cut off?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But who can teach wisdom to God, to him who is judge of those on
high?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And again: one person dies in the fullness of strength, in all
possible happiness and ease,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` thighs padded with fat and the marrow in the bones good and moist.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Another dies in bitterness of heart, never having tasted happiness.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` They lie together down in the dust and the worms soon cover them
both.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Oh, I know what is in your minds, what you so spitefully think
about me!

"28" = ''':sup:`28` 'What has become of the great lord's house,' you say, 'where is the
tent where the wicked used to live?'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Have you never questioned people who travel, do you not understand
the testimony they give:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` on the day of disaster, the wicked is spared, on the day of
retribution, he is kept safe?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And who is there then to reproach him for his deeds and to pay him
back for the things he has done?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He is carried away to the cemetery, and a watch is kept at his
tomb.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The clods of the ravine lie easy on him, and the whole population
walk behind.

"34" = ''':sup:`34` So what sense is there in your empty consolation? your answers are
the left-overs of infidelity!
