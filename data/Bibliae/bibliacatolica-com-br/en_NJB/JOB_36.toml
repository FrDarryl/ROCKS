"1" = ''':sup:`1` Elihu went on speaking. He said:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Be patient a little longer while I explain, for I have more to say
on God's behalf.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I shall range far afield for my arguments to prove my Maker just.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I guarantee, nothing I shall say will be untrue: you have a man of
sound learning here.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` God does not reject anyone whose heart is pure
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` or let the sinner live on in all his power. He does accord fair
judgement to the afflicted;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` he does uphold what the upright deserve. When he raises kings to
thrones, if they grow proud of their unending rule,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` then he fetters them with chains, they are caught in the bonds of
affliction.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He shows them the import of their deeds, of the sins of pride they
have committed.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` In their ears he sounds a warning, ordering them to turn back from
doing wrong.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` If they take notice and obey him, the rest of their days are
prosperous and the years pass pleasantly.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` If not, they go down the Canal and perish in their stupidity.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` The stubborn, who cherish their anger and do not cry for help when
he chains them,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` die in the bloom of youth or live among the male prostitutes of the
temple.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But God saves the afflicted by his affliction, warning him in his
misery.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` You, too, he would like to snatch from torment. While you were
enjoying boundless abundance, with rich food piled high on your table,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` you did not bring the wicked to trial and did not give fair
judgement to the orphan.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Beware of being led astray by abundance, of being corrupted by
expensive presents.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Take the powerful to law, not merely the penniless, those whose arm
is strong, not merely the weak.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Do not crush people you do not know to install your relations in
their place.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Avoid any tendency to wrong-doing, for this is why affliction is
testing you now.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` See, God is sublime in his strength and who can teach lessons as he
does?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Who has even told him which course to take, or dared to say to him,
'You have done wrong'?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Consider, rather, how you may praise his work, a theme that many
have sung.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` This is something that everyone can see, gazing, as we do, from
afar.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Yes, the greatness of God exceeds our knowledge, the number of his
years is past counting.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` It is he who makes the raindrops small and pulverises the rain into
mist.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And the clouds then pour this out, sending it streaming down on the
human race.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And who can fathom how he spreads the clouds, or why such crashes
thunder from his tent?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He spreads a mist before him and covers the tops of the mountains.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` By these means, he sustains the peoples, giving them plenty to eat.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He gathers up the lightning in his hands, assigning it the mark
where to strike.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` His crashing gives warning of its coming, anger flashes out against
iniquity.
