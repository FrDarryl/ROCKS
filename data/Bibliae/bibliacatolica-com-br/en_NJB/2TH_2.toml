they believe what is false,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and so that those who do not believe the truth and take their
pleasure in wickedness may all be condemned.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But we must always thank God for you, brothers whom the Lord loves,
because God chose you from the beginning to be saved by the Spirit who
makes us holy and by faith in the truth.
