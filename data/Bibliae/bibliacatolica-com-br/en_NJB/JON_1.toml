"3" = ''':sup:`3` Jonah set about running away from Yahweh, and going to Tarshish. He
went down to Jaffa and found a ship bound for Tarshish; he paid his
fare and boarded it, to go with them to Tarshish, to get away from
Yahweh.

storm at sea that the ship threatened to break up.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The sailors took fright, and each of them called on his own god, and
to lighten the ship they threw the cargo overboard. Jonah, however, had
gone below, had lain down in the hold and was fast asleep,

"6" = ''':sup:`6` when the boatswain went up to him and said, 'What do you mean by
sleeping? Get up! Call on your god! Perhaps he will spare us a thought

"12" = ''':sup:`12` He replied, 'Take me and throw me into the sea, and then it will
calm down for you. I know it is my fault that this great storm has

us perish for the sake of this man's life, and do not hold us
responsible for causing an innocent man's death; for you, Yahweh, have
acted as you saw fit.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And taking hold of Jonah they threw him into the sea; and the sea
