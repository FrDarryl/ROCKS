"2" = ''':sup:`2` 'Son of man, speak to the people of your country. Say to them, "When
I send the sword against the people of that country, take one of their
number and post him as a watchman;

horn to warn the people.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` If someone hears the sound of the horn but pays no attention and the

his own death.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` He has heard the sound of the horn and paid no attention; his death
will be his own responsibility. But the life of someone who pays
attention will be secure.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` "If, however, the watchman has seen the sword coming but has not
blown his horn, and so the people are not alerted and the sword
overtakes them and destroys a single one of them, that person will
indeed die for his guilt, but I shall hold the watchman responsible for
his death."

"7" = ''':sup:`7` 'Son of man I have appointed you as watchman for the House of
Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, warn them from me.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` If I say to someone wicked, "Evil- doer, you are to die," and you do
not speak to warn the wicked person to renounce such ways, the wicked
person will die for this guilt, but I shall hold you responsible for
the death.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` If, however, you do warn someone wicked to renounce such ways and
repent, and that person does not repent, then the culprit will die for
this guilt, but you yourself will have saved your life.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` 'Son of man, say to the House of Israel, "You are continually
saying: Our crimes and sins weigh heavily on us; we are wasting away
because of them. How are we to go on living?"

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Say to them, "As I live -- declares the Lord Yahweh -- I do not
take pleasure in the death of the wicked but in the conversion of the
wicked who changes his ways and saves his life. Repent, turn back from
your evil ways. Why die, House of Israel?"

"12" = ''':sup:`12` 'Son of man, say to the members of your nation, "The uprightness of
an upright person will not save him once he takes to wrong-doing; the
wickedness of a wicked person will not ruin him once he renounces his
wickedness. No one upright will be able to live on the strength of
uprightness, having once taken to sinning.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` If I say to someone upright: You are to live, and then, trusting in
this uprightness, he does wrong, none of the uprightness will be
remembered; because of the wrong-doing, he will die.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` If, however, I say to someone wicked: You are to die, and he turns
back from sin and does what is lawful and upright,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` if he returns pledges, restores what he has stolen, keeps the laws
that give life and no longer does wrong, he will live and will not die.

done what is lawful and upright, he will live.

But it is what you do that is unjust.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` When an upright person gives up being upright and does wrong, he
dies for it.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` And when a wicked person gives up being wicked and does what is
lawful and upright, because of this he lives.

you by what you do, House of Israel." '

month, a fugitive arrived from Jerusalem and said to me, 'The city has
been taken.'

fugitive arrived; he had opened my mouth before the fugitive came to me
the next morning; my mouth had been opened and I was dumb no longer.

'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` 'Son of man, the people living in those ruins on the soil of Israel
say this, "Abraham was alone when he was given possession of this
country. But we are many; the country has been given us as our
heritage."

"25" = ''':sup:`25` 'Very well, tell them, "The Lord Yahweh says this: You eat blood,
you raise your eyes to your foul idols, you shed blood; are you to own
the country?

"26" = ''':sup:`26` You rely on your swords, you engage in loathsome practices, each of
you defiles his neighbour's wife; are you to own the country?"

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Tell them this, "The Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, I swear it,

"28" = ''':sup:`28` I shall make the country a desolate waste, and the pride of its

"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I make the country a
desolate waste because of all the filthy things they have done."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` 'Son of man, the members of your nation are talking about you on
the ramparts and in doorways. They keep saying to one another, "Come
and hear the word that has come from Yahweh."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` They throng towards you; my people sit down in front of you and
listen to your words, but they do not act on them. What they act on is
the lie in their mouths, and their hearts are set on dishonest gain.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` As far as they are concerned, you are like a love song pleasantly
sung to a good musical accompaniment. They listen to your words, but no
one acts on them.

know that there has been a prophet among them.'
