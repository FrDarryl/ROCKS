"3" = ''':sup:`3` He took me in spirit to a desert, and there I saw a woman riding a
scarlet beast which had seven heads and ten horns and had blasphemous
titles written all over it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and glittered with gold
and jewels and pearls, and she was holding a gold winecup filled with
the disgusting filth of her prostitution;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` on her forehead was written a name, a cryptic name: 'Babylon the
Great, the mother of all the prostitutes and all the filthy practices
on the earth.'

"6" = ''':sup:`6` I saw that she was drunk, drunk with the blood of the saints, and
the blood of the martyrs of Jesus; and when I saw her, I was completely
mystified.

meaning of this woman, and of the beast she is riding, with the seven

the beginning of the world in the book of life, will be astonished when
they see how the beast was once alive and is alive no longer, and is
still to come.

destruction.

given their royal power but will have royal authority only for a single
hour and in association with the beast.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` They are all of one mind in putting their strength and their powers
at the beast's disposal,
