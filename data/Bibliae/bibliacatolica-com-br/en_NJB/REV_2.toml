you cannot stand wicked people, and how you put to the test those who
were self-styled apostles, and found them false.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I know too that you have perseverance, and have suffered for my name
without growing tired.

your lamp-stand from its place.

Satan lives.

Jezebel who claims to be a prophetess, and by her teaching she is
