"1" = ''':sup:`1` It happened that while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul made his way
overland as far as Ephesus, where he found a number of disciples.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` When he asked, 'Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you became
believers?' they answered, 'No, we were never even told there was such
a thing as a Holy Spirit.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He asked, 'Then how were you baptised?' They replied, 'With John's
baptism.'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Paul said, 'John's baptism was a baptism of repentance; but he
insisted that the people should believe in the one who was to come
after him -- namely Jesus.'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord
Jesus,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and the moment Paul had laid hands on them the Holy Spirit came down
on them, and they began to speak with tongues and to prophesy.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` There were about twelve of these men in all.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He began by going to the synagogue, where he spoke out fearlessly
and argued persuasively about the kingdom of God. He did this for three
months,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` till the attitude of some of the congregation hardened into
unbelief. As soon as they began attacking the Way in public, he broke
with them and took his disciples apart to hold daily discussions in the
lecture room of Tyrannus.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This went on for two years, with the result that all the
inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, were able to hear the word
of the Lord.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So remarkable were the miracles worked by God at Paul's hands
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` that handkerchiefs or aprons which had touched him were taken to
the sick, and they were cured of their illnesses, and the evil spirits
came out of them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But some itinerant Jewish exorcists too tried pronouncing the name
of the Lord Jesus over people who were possessed by evil spirits; they
used to say, 'I adjure you by the Jesus whose spokesman is Paul.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Among those who did this were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief
priest.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The evil spirit replied, 'Jesus I recognise, and Paul I know, but
who are you?'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and the man with the evil spirit hurled himself at them and
overpowered first one and then another, and handled them so violently
that they fled from that house stripped of clothing and badly mauled.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Everybody in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, heard about this
episode; everyone was filled with awe, and the name of the Lord Jesus
came to be held in great honour.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Some believers, too, came forward to admit in detail how they had
used spells
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and a number of them who had practised magic collected their books
and made a bonfire of them in public. The value of these was calculated
to be fifty thousand silver pieces.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` In this powerful way the word of the Lord spread more and more
widely and successfully.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When all this was over Paul made up his mind to go back to
Jerusalem through Macedonia and Achaia. 'After I have been there,' he
said, 'I must go on to see Rome as well.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, ahead of him to
Macedonia, while he remained for a time in Asia.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` It was during this time that a serious disturbance broke out in
connection with the Way.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` A silversmith called Demetrius, who provided work for a large
number of craftsmen making silver shrines of Diana,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` called a general meeting of them with others in the same trade. 'As
you know,' he said, 'it is on this industry that we depend for our
prosperity.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now you must have seen and heard how, not just in Ephesus but
nearly everywhere in Asia, this man Paul has persuaded and converted a
great number of people with his argument that gods made by hand are not
gods at all.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` This threatens not only to discredit our trade, but also to reduce
the sanctuary of the great goddess Diana to unimportance. It could end
up by taking away the prestige of a goddess venerated all over Asia,
and indeed all over the world.'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` This speech roused them to fury, and they started to shout, 'Great
is Diana of the Ephesians!'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The whole town was filled with the uproar and the mob made a
concerted rush to the theatre, dragging along two of Paul's Macedonian
travelling companions, Gaius and Aristarchus.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Paul wanted to make an appeal to the people, but the disciples
refused to let him;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` in fact, some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent
messages urging him not to take the risk of going into the theatre.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` By now everybody was shouting different things, till the assembly
itself had no idea what was going on; most of them did not even know
why they had gathered together.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Some of the crowd prevailed upon Alexander, whom the Jews pushed
forward; he raised his hand for silence with the intention of
explaining things to the people.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` As soon as they realised he was a Jew, they all started shouting in
unison, 'Great is Diana of the Ephesians!' and they kept this up for
two hours.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` When the town clerk eventually succeeded in calming the crowd, he
said, 'Citizens of Ephesus! Is there anybody who does not know that the
city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of great Diana and
of her statue that fell from heaven?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Nobody can contradict this and there is no need for you to get
excited or do anything rash.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` These men you have brought here are not guilty of any sacrilege or
blasphemy against our goddess.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If Demetrius and the craftsmen he has with him want to complain
about anyone, there are the assizes and the proconsuls; let them take
the case to court.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And if you want to ask any more questions you must raise them in
the regular assembly.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` We could easily be charged with rioting for today's happenings:
there is no ground for it all, and we can give no justification for
this gathering.' When he had finished this speech he dismissed the
assembly.

Notas de rodap√©:
19:1-7 - Paul encounters disciples in Ephesus who had not received the
Holy Spirit and instructs them to be baptized correctly. This shows the
importance of fully understanding the gospel and the work of the Spirit
19:11-12 - God performs extraordinary miracles through Paul, including
healing the sick and casting out evil spirits. These miracles confirm
Paul's divine authority and the truth of the message he preaches (see
19:23-27 - The Ephesian artisans, who make idols, are outraged by
Paul's preaching because it threatens their profits. The clash between
the gospel and idolatrous practices is a recurring theme in the New
