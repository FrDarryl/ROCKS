"1" = ''':sup:`1` Demetrius, hearing that Nicanor and his army had fallen in battle,
sent Bacchides and Alcimus a second time into Judaea, and with them the
right wing of his army.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` They took the road to Galilee and besieged Mesaloth in Arbela, and
captured it, putting many people to death.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` In the first month of the year 152, they encamped outside Jerusalem;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` they then moved on, making their way to Beer-Zaith with twenty
thousand foot and two thousand horse.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Judas lay in camp at Elasa, with three thousand picked men.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When they saw the huge size of the enemy forces they were terrified,
and many slipped out of the camp, until no more than eight hundred of
the force were left.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` With battle now inevitable, Judas realised that his army had melted
away; he was aghast, for he had no time to rally them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Yet, dismayed as he was, he said to those who were left, 'Up! Let us
face the enemy; we may yet have the strength to fight them.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` His men tried to dissuade him, declaring, 'We have no strength for
anything but to escape with our lives this time; then we can come back
with our brothers to fight them; by ourselves we are too few.'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Judas retorted, 'That I should do such a thing as run away from
them! If our time has come, at least let us die like men for our
countrymen, and leave nothing to tarnish our reputation.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The army marched out of camp and drew up, facing the enemy. The
cavalry was drawn up in two squadrons; the slingers and archers marched
in the van of the army, and all the best fighters were put in the front
rank;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Bacchides was on the right wing. The phalanx advanced from between
the two squadrons, sounding the trumpets; the men on Judas' side also
blew their trumpets,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and the earth shook with the noise of the armies. The engagement
lasted from morning until evening.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Judas saw that Bacchides and the main strength of his army lay on
the right; all the stout-hearted rallied to him,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and they crushed the right wing, pursuing them as far as the Azara
Hills.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But when the Syrians on the left wing saw that the right had been
broken, they turned and followed hot on the heels of Judas and his men
to take them in the rear.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The fight became desperate, and there were many casualties on both
sides.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Judas himself fell, and the remnant fled.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Jonathan and Simon took up their brother Judas and buried him in
his ancestral tomb at Modein.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` All Israel wept and mourned him deeply and for many days they
repeated this dirge.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` 'What a downfall for the strong man, the man who kept Israel safe!'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The other deeds of Judas, the battles he fought, the exploits he
performed, and all his titles to greatness have not been recorded; but
they were very many.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` After the death of Judas, the renegades came out of hiding
throughout Israel and all the evil-doers reappeared.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` At that time there was a severe famine, and the country went over
to their side.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Bacchides deliberately chose the enemies of religion to administer
the country.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` These traced and searched out the friends of Judas and brought them
before Bacchides, who ill-treated and mocked them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` A terrible oppression began in Israel; there had been nothing like
it since the disappearance of prophecy among them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The friends of Judas then all united in saying to Jonathan,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` 'Since your brother Judas died, there has been no one like him to
head the resistance against our enemies, people like Bacchides and
others who hate our nation.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Accordingly, we have today chosen you to take his place as our
ruler and leader and to fight our campaigns.'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Whereupon, Jonathan took command, in succession to his brother
Judas.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Bacchides, when he heard the news, made plans to kill Jonathan.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But this became known to Jonathan, his brother Simon and all his
supporters, and they took refuge in the desert of Tekoa, camping by the
water-supply at Asphar storage-well.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` (Bacchides came to know of this on the Sabbath day, and he too
crossed the Jordan with his entire army.)
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Jonathan sent his brother, who was one of his commanders, to ask
his friends the Nabataeans to store their considerable baggage for
them.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` The sons of Amrai, however, those of Medeba, intercepted them,
captured John and everything he had and made off with their prize.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Later, Jonathan and his brother Simon were told that the sons of
Amrai were celebrating an important wedding, and were escorting the
bride, a daughter of one of the great notables of Canaan, from Nabata
with a large retinue.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Remembering the bloody end of their brother John, they went up and
hid under cover of the mountain.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` As they were keeping watch, a noisy procession came into sight with
a great deal of baggage, and the bridegroom, with his groomsmen and his
family, came out to meet it with tambourines and a band, and rich,
warlike display.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` The Jews rushed down on them from their ambush and killed them,
inflicting heavy casualties; the survivors escaped to the mountain,
leaving their entire baggage train to be captured.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Thus, the wedding was turned into mourning and the music of their
band into lamentation.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Having in this way avenged in full the blood of their brother, they
returned to the marshes of the Jordan.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` As soon as Bacchides heard this, he came on the Sabbath day with a
considerable force to the steep banks of the Jordan.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Jonathan said to his men, 'Up! Let us fight for our lives, for
today it is not as in the old days.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` You can see, we shall have to fight on our front and to our rear;
we have the waters of the Jordan on one side, the marsh and scrub on
the other, and we have no line of withdrawal.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` This is the moment to call on Heaven, to deliver you from the
clutches of your enemies.'
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` The engagement was begun by Jonathan, who aimed a blow at
Bacchides, but the Syrian disengaged himself and withdrew,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` whereupon Jonathan and his men leapt into the Jordan and swam to
the other bank; the enemy did not, however, cross the Jordan in
pursuit.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` That day, Bacchides lost about a thousand men.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Bacchides went back to Jerusalem and began fortifying some of the
Judaean towns: the fortresses of Jericho, Emmaus, Beth-Horon, Bethel,
Timnath, Pharathon and Tephon, with high walls and barred gates,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` and stationed a garrison in each of them to harass Israel.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` He also fortified the town of Beth-Zur, Gezer and the Citadel, and
placed troops in them with supplies of provisions.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` He took the sons of the leading men of the country as hostages, and
had them placed under guard in the Citadel of Jerusalem.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` In the year 153, in the second month, Alcimus ordered the
demolition of the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary, destroying
the work of the prophets. Alcimus had just begun the demolition
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` when he suffered a stroke, and his work was interrupted. His mouth
became obstructed, and his paralysis made him incapable of speaking at
all or giving directions to his household;
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` it was not long before he died in great agony.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` On the death of Alcimus, Bacchides went back to the king, and
Judaea was left in peace for two years.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` The renegades then all agreed on a plan. 'Now is the time,' they
said, 'while Jonathan and his supporters are living in peace and are
full of confidence, for us to bring back Bacchides, and he will arrest
the lot of them in one night.'
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` So they went to him and reached an understanding.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` Bacchides at once set out with a large force, and sent secret
instructions to all his allies in Judaea to seize Jonathan and his
supporters. But they were unable to do this because their plan became
known,
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` and Jonathan and his men arrested some fifty of the men of the
country who were ringleaders in the plot, and put them to death.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` Jonathan and Simon then retired with their partisans to Beth-Bassi
in the desert; they rebuilt the ruinous parts of the place and
fortified it.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` When Bacchides heard this, he mustered his whole force and notified
his adherents in Judaea.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` He then proceeded to lay siege to Beth-Bassi, the fighting was
protracted, and he constructed siege-engines.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` Jonathan, however, leaving his brother Simon in the town, broke out
into the countryside with a handful of men.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` He launched a blow at Odomera and his brothers, and at the sons of
Phasiron in their encampment; whereupon, these too came into the
struggle, joining forces with him.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` Simon and his people, meanwhile, made a sortie from the town and
set fire to the siege-engines.
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` Taking the offensive against Bacchides, they defeated him. He was
greatly disconcerted to find that his plan and his assault had come to
nothing,
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` and vented his anger on those renegades who had induced him to
enter the country, putting many of them to death; he then decided to
take his own troops home.
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` Discovering this, Jonathan sent envoys to negotiate peace terms and
the release of prisoners with him.
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` Bacchides agreed to this, accepting his proposals and swearing
never to seek occasion to harm him for the rest of his life.
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` Having surrendered to Jonathan those prisoners he had earlier taken
in Judaea, he turned about and withdrew to his own country, and never
again came near their frontiers.
'''
"73" = ''':sup:`73` The sword no longer hung over Israel, and Jonathan settled in
Michmash, where he began to judge the people and to rid Israel of the
godless.
