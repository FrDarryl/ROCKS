"1" = ''':sup:`1` At about this time, Antiochus was preparing for his second attack on
Egypt.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` It then happened that all over the city for nearly forty days there
were apparitions of horsemen galloping through the air in cloth of
gold, troops of lancers fully armed,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` squadrons of cavalry in order of battle, attacks and charges this
way and that, a flourish of shields, a forest of pikes, a brandishing
of swords, a hurling of missiles, a glittering of golden accoutrements
and armour of all kinds.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So everyone prayed that this manifestation might prove a good omen.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then, on the strength of a false report that Antiochus was dead,
Jason took at least a thousand men and launched an unexpected attack on
the city. When the walls had been breached and the city was finally on
the point of being taken, Menelaus took refuge in the Citadel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Jason, however, made a pitiless slaughter of his fellow-citizens,
oblivious of the fact that success against his own countrymen was the
greatest of disasters, but rather picturing himself as winning trophies
from some enemy, and not from his fellow- countrymen.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Even so, he did not manage to seize power; and, in the end, his
machinations brought him nothing but shame, and he took refuge once
more in Ammanitis.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` His career of wickedness was thus brought to a halt: imprisoned by
Aretas, the Arab despot, escaping from his town, hunted by everyone,
detested for having overthrown the laws, abhorred as the butcher of his
country and his countrymen, he drifted to Egypt.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He who had exiled so many from their fatherland, himself perished on
foreign soil, having travelled to Sparta, hoping that, for kinship's
sake, he might find harbour there.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So many carcases he had thrust out to lie unburied; now he himself
had none to mourn him, no funeral rites, no place in the tomb of his
ancestors.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When the king came to hear of what had happened, he concluded that
Judaea was in revolt. He therefore marched from Egypt, raging like a
wild beast, and began by storming the city.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He then ordered his soldiers to cut down without mercy everyone
they encountered, and to butcher all who took refuge in their houses.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It was a massacre of young and old, a slaughter of women and
children, a butchery of young girls and infants.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` There were eighty thousand victims in the course of those three
days, forty thousand dying by violence and as many again being sold
into slavery.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Not content with this, he had the audacity to enter the holiest
Temple in the entire world, with Menelaus, that traitor to the laws and
to his country, as his guide;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` with impure hands he seized the sacred vessels; with impious hands
he seized the offerings presented by other kings for the
aggrandisement, glory and dignity of the holy place.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Holding so high an opinion of himself, Antiochus did not realise
that the Lord was temporarily angry at the sins of the inhabitants of
the city, hence his unconcern for the holy place.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Had they not been entangled in many sins, Antiochus too, like
Heliodorus when King Seleucus sent him to inspect the Treasury, would
have been flogged the moment he arrived and checked in his presumption.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The Lord, however, had not chosen the people for the sake of the
holy place, but the holy place for the sake of the people;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and so the holy place itself, having shared the disasters that
befell the people, in due course also shared their good fortune; having
been abandoned by the Almighty in his anger, once the great Sovereign
was placated it was reinstated in all its glory.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Antiochus, having extracted eighteen hundred talents from the
Temple, hurried back to Antioch; in his pride he would have undertaken
to make the dry land navigable and the sea passable on foot, so high
his arrogance soared.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But he left officials behind to plague the nation: in Jerusalem,
Philip, a Phrygian by race, and by nature more barbarous than the man
who appointed him;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` on Mount Gerizim, Andronicus; and, besides these, Menelaus, who
lorded it over his countrymen worse than all the others. In his rooted
hostility to the Jews,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` the king also sent the Mysarch Apollonius at the head of an army
twenty-two thousand strong, with orders to put to death all men in
their prime and to sell the women and children.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Arriving in Jerusalem and posing as a man of peace, this man waited
until the holy day of the Sabbath and then, taking advantage of the
Jews as they rested from work, ordered his men to parade fully armed;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` all those who came out to watch he put to the sword; then, rushing
into the city with his armed troops, he cut down an immense number of
people.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Judas, also known as Maccabaeus, however, with about nine others,
withdrew into the desert. He lived like the wild animals in the hills
with his companions, eating nothing but wild plants to avoid
contracting defilement.
