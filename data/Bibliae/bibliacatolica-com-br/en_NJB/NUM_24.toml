Notas de rodap√©:
24:1-2 - Balaam, now aware that God blesses Israel, no longer seeks
enchantments, but allows the Spirit of God to lead him. This shows that
the true prophet is one who submits to the control of the Holy Spirit
24:5-9 - Balaam, inspired by the Spirit, prophesies God's blessing upon
Israel, describing them as a prosperous and powerful nation. This
vision anticipates Israel's role as an instrument of divine blessing
24:10-11 - Balak, frustrated, drives Balaam out, because instead of
cursing, Balaam blessed Israel three times. This emphasizes that the
power of the prophetic word is in the hands of God, not man (see also

Israel and defeat their enemies. This prophecy is often seen as a
24:18-19 - Balaam's prophecy continues, predicting Israel's final
victory over her enemies, symbolizing the triumph of God's Kingdom over
Corinthians 15:24-25).
