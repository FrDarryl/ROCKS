'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Pilate answered them, 'Do you want me to release for you the king of
the Jews?'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For he realised it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had
handed Jesus over.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The chief priests, however, had incited the crowd to demand that he

"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then save yourself; come down from the cross!'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The chief priests and the scribes mocked him among themselves in
the same way with the words, 'He saved others, he cannot save himself.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now,
for us to see it and believe.' Even those who were crucified with him
taunted him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` When the sixth hour came there was darkness over the whole land
until the ninth hour.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Eloi, eloi,
lama sabachthani?' which means, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?'

is calling on Elijah.'
