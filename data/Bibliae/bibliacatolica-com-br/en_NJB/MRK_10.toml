"1" = ''':sup:`1` After leaving there, he came into the territory of Judaea and
Transjordan. And again crowds gathered round him, and again he taught
them, as his custom was.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Some Pharisees approached him and asked, 'Is it lawful for a man to
divorce his wife?' They were putting him to the test.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He answered them, 'What did Moses command you?'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They replied, 'Moses allowed us to draw up a writ of dismissal in
cases of divorce.'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Jesus said to them, 'It was because you were so hard hearted
that he wrote this commandment for you.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But from the beginning of creation he made them male and female.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` This is why a man leaves his father and mother,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and the two become one flesh. They are no longer two, therefore, but
one flesh.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So then, what God has united, human beings must not divide.'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Back in the house the disciples questioned him again about this,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and he said to them, 'Whoever divorces his wife and marries another
is guilty of adultery against her.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another she is
guilty of adultery too.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` People were bringing little children to him, for him to touch them.
The disciples scolded them,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` but when Jesus saw this he was indignant and said to them, 'Let the
little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as
these that the kingdom of God belongs.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` In truth I tell you, anyone who does not welcome the kingdom of God
like a little child will never enter it.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then he embraced them, laid his hands on them and gave them his
blessing.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He was setting out on a journey when a man ran up, knelt before him
and put this question to him, 'Good master, what must I do to inherit
eternal life?'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good but God
alone.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You know the commandments: You shall not kill; You shall not commit
adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not give false witness; You
shall not defraud; Honour your father and mother.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he said to him, 'Master, I have kept all these since my
earliest days.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Jesus looked steadily at him and he was filled with love for him,
and he said, 'You need to do one thing more. Go and sell what you own
and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;
then come, follow me.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But his face fell at these words and he went away sad, for he was a
man of great wealth.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Jesus looked round and said to his disciples, 'How hard it is for
those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The disciples were astounded by these words, but Jesus insisted,
'My children,' he said to them, 'how hard it is to enter the kingdom of
God!
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than
for someone rich to enter the kingdom of God.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` They were more astonished than ever, saying to one another, 'In
that case, who can be saved?'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Jesus gazed at them and said, 'By human resources it is impossible,
but not for God: because for God everything is possible.'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Peter took this up. 'Look,' he said to him, 'we have left
everything and followed you.'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus said, 'In truth I tell you, there is no one who has left
house, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children or land for my sake
and for the sake of the gospel
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` who will not receive a hundred times as much, houses, brothers,
sisters, mothers, children and land -- and persecutions too -- now in
this present time and, in the world to come, eternal life.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Many who are first will be last, and the last, first.'
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` They were on the road, going up to Jerusalem; Jesus was walking on
ahead of them; they were in a daze, and those who followed were
apprehensive. Once more taking the Twelve aside he began to tell them
what was going to happen to him,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` 'Now we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man is about to
be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn
him to death and will hand him over to the gentiles,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` who will mock him and spit at him and scourge him and put him to
death; and after three days he will rise again.'
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached him. 'Master,' they
said to him, 'We want you to do us a favour.'
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He said to them, 'What is it you want me to do for you?'
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` They said to him, 'Allow us to sit one at your right hand and the
other at your left in your glory.'
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But Jesus said to them, 'You do not know what you are asking. Can
you drink the cup that I shall drink, or be baptised with the baptism
with which I shall be baptised?'
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` They replied, 'We can.' Jesus said to them, 'The cup that I shall
drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I shall be
baptised you shall be baptised,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` but as for seats at my right hand or my left, these are not mine to
grant; they belong to those to whom they have been allotted.'
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` When the other ten heard this they began to feel indignant with
James and John,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` so Jesus called them to him and said to them, 'You know that among
the gentiles those they call their rulers lord it over them, and their
great men make their authority felt.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Among you this is not to happen. No; anyone who wants to become
great among you must be your servant,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` and anyone who wants to be first among you must be slave to all.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` For the Son of man himself came not to be served but to serve, and
to give his life as a ransom for many.'
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` They reached Jericho; and as he left Jericho with his disciples and
a great crowd, Bartimaeus -- that is, the son of Timaeus -- a blind
beggar, was sitting at the side of the road.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout and
cry out, 'Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me.'
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And many of them scolded him and told him to keep quiet, but he
only shouted all the louder, 'Son of David, have pity on me.'
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Jesus stopped and said, 'Call him here.' So they called the blind
man over. 'Courage,' they said, 'get up; he is calling you.'
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` So throwing off his cloak, he jumped up and went to Jesus.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Then Jesus spoke, 'What do you want me to do for you?' The blind
man said to him, 'Rabbuni, let me see again.'
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Jesus said to him, 'Go; your faith has saved you.' And at once his
sight returned and he followed him along the road.
