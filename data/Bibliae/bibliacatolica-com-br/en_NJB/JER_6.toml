Disaster for us! The light is fading, the evening shadows lengthen.

man weighed down with years.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Their houses will pass to other men, so will their fields and
wives. Yes, I shall stretch my hand over those living in this country,

Peace!' whereas there is no peace.

their noise is like the roaring of the sea; they are riding horses,
they are ready to fight against you as one man, against you, daughter
of Zion.

for an only son, a very bitter dirge. For on us suddenly the destroyer
is coming.

how they behave.
