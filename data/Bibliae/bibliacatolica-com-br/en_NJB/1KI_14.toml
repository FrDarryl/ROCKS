House of Jeroboam.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Yahweh will make Israel shake, till it quivers like a reed in the
water; he will uproot Israel from this prosperous land which he gave to
their ancestors and scatter them beyond the River for provoking Yahweh

"21" = ''':sup:`21` In Judah, Rehoboam son of Solomon became king; he was forty-one
years old when he came to the throne and he reigned for seventeen years
in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel, to give his name a home there. His mother's name was Naamah,
the Ammonite.

sacred poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.

king of Egypt advanced on Jerusalem
