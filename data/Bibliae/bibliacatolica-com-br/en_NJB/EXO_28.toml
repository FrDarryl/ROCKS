waistband of the ephod.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` The breastplate will be secured by a violet-purple cord passed
through its rings and those of the ephod, so that the breastplate will
sit above the waistband and not come apart from the ephod.

breastplate of judgement, on his heart, when he enters the sanctuary,
as a reminder, before Yahweh, always.

it will not get torn.

red-purple and crimson, and finely woven linen all round the hem, with
golden bells between them all round:

"34" = ''':sup:`34` a golden bell and then a pomegranate, alternately, all round the
lower hem of the robe.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Aaron must wear it when he officiates, and the tinkling will be
heard when he goes into the sanctuary into Yahweh's presence, or leaves
it, and so he will not incur death.

"36" = ''':sup:`36` 'You will make a flower of pure gold and on it, as you would
engrave a seal, you will engrave, "Consecrated to Yahweh".

"37" = ''':sup:`37` You will put it on a violet-purple cord; it will go on the turban;
the front of the turban is the place where it must go.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` This will go on Aaron's brow, and Aaron will thus take on himself
the short-comings in the holy things consecrated by the Israelites, in
all their holy offerings. It will be on his brow permanently, to make
them acceptable to Yahweh.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The tunic you will weave of fine linen, and make a turban of fine
linen, and an embroidered waistband.
