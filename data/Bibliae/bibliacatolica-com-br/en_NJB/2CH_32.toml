"1" = ''':sup:`1` After these loyal actions, Sennacherib king of Assyria advanced and
invaded Judah, and laid siege to the fortified towns, intending to
demolish them.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Hezekiah, realising that Sennacherib's advance was the preliminary
to an attack on Jerusalem,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` consulted his officers and warriors about sealing off the waters of
the springs outside the city, and they supported him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So a large number of people were called out to block all the springs
and cut off the watercourse flowing through the country. 'Why', they
said, 'should the kings of Assyria find plenty of water when they
arrive?'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Acting with determination, he also repaired all the damaged parts of
the wall, built towers on it, constructed a second wall on the outer
side, strengthened the Millo of the City of David and made quantities
of missiles and shields.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He then appointed generals to command the people, summoned them to
him in the square by the city gate and spoke as follows to encourage
them,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` 'Be strong and brave; do not be afraid or tremble when you face the
king of Assyria and the whole horde he brings with him, for there are
more on our side than on his.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He has only human strength, but we have Yahweh our God to help us
and fight our battles.' The people took heart at the words of Hezekiah
king of Judah.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Next, Sennacherib king of Assyria, who was then besieging Lachish
with all his forces, sent his representatives to Jerusalem, to Hezekiah
king of Judah, and all Judah at Jerusalem, with the following message,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` 'Sennacherib king of Assyria says this, "What gives you the
confidence to remain in the fortress of Jerusalem?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Isn't Hezekiah deluding you, only to condemn you to die of famine
and thirst, when he says: Yahweh our God will save us from the King of
Assyria's clutches?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Isn't Hezekiah the very man who has suppressed his high places and
altars, and given the order to Judah and to Jerusalem: You must worship
before one altar and on that alone offer incense?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Don't you know what I and my ancestors have done to all the peoples
of the other countries? Have the national gods of those countries had
the slightest success in saving their countries from my clutches?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Of all the gods of those nations whom my ancestors devoted to
destruction, which one has been able to save his people from my
clutches, for your god to be able to save you from my clutches?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do not let Hezekiah mislead you. Do not let him delude you like
this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been
able to save his people from me or from my ancestors' clutches. No more
will your god be able to save you from my clutches."'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And his representatives said a great deal more, maligning Yahweh
God, and his servant Hezekiah.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He also wrote a letter to insult Yahweh, God of Israel, maligning
him as follows, 'Just as the national gods of the other countries could
not save their peoples from my clutches, so Hezekiah's god cannot save
his people from my clutches.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They then shouted loudly in the Judaean language to the people of
Jerusalem on the ramparts to frighten and confuse them, in the hope of
capturing the city,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` maligning the God of Jerusalem as though he were one of the
man-made gods of other peoples in the world.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed and
cried out to Heaven about this,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and Yahweh sent an angel who destroyed every warrior, commander and
officer in the king of Assyria's camp. So he had to retire shamefacedly
to his own country and when he went into the temple of his god, some of
his own sons there struck him down with the sword.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the
clutches of Sennacherib king of Assyria and of everyone else, and gave
them peace on every side.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Many people then brought gifts to Yahweh in Jerusalem and valuable
presents to Hezekiah king of Judah; from then on, all the other nations
held him in high esteem.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` About then Hezekiah fell ill and was at the point of death. He
prayed to Yahweh, who heard him and granted him a sign.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But Hezekiah made no return for the benefit which he had received;
he became proud and brought retribution on himself and on Judah and
Jerusalem.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then, however, Hezekiah did humble himself in his pride, and so did
the inhabitants of Jerusalem; as a result of which, Yahweh's
retribution did not overtake them during Hezekiah's lifetime.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Hezekiah enjoyed immense riches and honour. He built himself
treasuries for gold, silver, precious stones, spices, jewels and every
kind of desirable object,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` as well as storehouses for his returns of grain, new wine and olive
oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle and pens for the flocks.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He also provided himself with donkeys in addition to his immense
wealth of flocks and herds, since God had made him immensely wealthy.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon
and directed them straight down on the west side of the City of David.
Hezekiah succeeded in all that he undertook,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` although when the envoys were sent to him by the rulers of Babylon
to enquire about the extraordinary thing which had taken place in the
country, God left him alone to test him and discover what lay in his
heart.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The rest of the history of Hezekiah, and his deeds of faithful
love, are recorded in the Vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz, in
the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then Hezekiah fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried in the
upper section of the tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem paid him honours at his death. His son
Manasseh succeeded him.

Notas de rodap√©:
32:1-8 - Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invades Judah, but Hezekiah
encourages the people to trust in the Lord, who is more powerful than
any human army. This trust in God in the midst of danger reflects faith
32:9-19 - Sennacherib tries to intimidate the people of Judah by
blaspheming God. This attempt to discredit the faithful reveals the
world's contempt for God's power, but it also highlights the conflict
37:23).
32:20-22 - Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah pray, and God delivers
Jerusalem by sending an angel who destroys the Assyrian army. This
shows that fervent prayer and faith can result in divine deliverance
32:24-26 - Hezekiah becomes seriously ill, but prays to the Lord and is
healed. However, he gives in to pride, but later repents. This
highlights the importance of repentance and humility before God (see
32:27-33 - Hezekiah prospers and is remembered for his accomplishments,
but his death follows a period of pride. This account serves as a
warning against the danger of spiritual pride, even for the most
