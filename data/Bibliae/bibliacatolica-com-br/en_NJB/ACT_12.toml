"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was about this time that King Herod started persecuting certain
members of the church.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He had James the brother of John beheaded,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and when he saw that this pleased the Jews he went on to arrest
Peter as well.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` As it was during the days of Unleavened Bread that he had arrested
him, he put him in prison, assigning four sections of four soldiers
each to guard him, meaning to try him in public after the Passover.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All the time Peter was under guard the church prayed to God for him
unremittingly.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` On the night before Herod was to try him, Peter was sleeping between
two soldiers, fastened with two chains, while guards kept watch at the
main entrance to the prison.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then suddenly an angel of the Lord stood there, and the cell was
filled with light. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him. 'Get up!'
he said, 'Hurry!' -- and the chains fell from his hands.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The angel then said, 'Put on your belt and sandals.' After he had
done this, the angel next said, 'Wrap your cloak round you and follow
me.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He followed him out, but had no idea that what the angel did was all
happening in reality; he thought he was seeing a vision.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` They passed through the first guard post and then the second and
reached the iron gate leading to the city. This opened of its own
accord; they went through it and had walked the whole length of one
street when suddenly the angel left him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` It was only then that Peter came to himself. And he said, 'Now I
know it is all true. The Lord really did send his angel and save me
from Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` As soon as he realised this he went straight to the house of Mary
the mother of John Mark, where a number of people had assembled and
were praying.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He knocked at the outside door and a servant called Rhoda came to
answer it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` She recognised Peter's voice and was so overcome with joy that,
instead of opening the door, she ran inside with the news that Peter
was standing at the main entrance.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They said to her, 'You are out of your mind,' but she insisted that
it was true. Then they said, 'It must be his angel!'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Peter, meanwhile, was still knocking. When they opened the door,
they were amazed to see that it really was Peter himself.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He raised his hand for silence and described to them how the Lord
had led him out of prison. He added, 'Tell James and the brothers.'
Then he left and went elsewhere.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When daylight came there was a great commotion among the soldiers,
who could not imagine what had become of Peter.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Herod put out an unsuccessful search for him; he had the guards
questioned, and before leaving Judaea to take up residence in Caesarea
he gave orders for their execution.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now Herod was on bad terms with the Tyrians and Sidonians. Yet they
sent a joint deputation which managed to enlist the support of Blastus,
the king's chamberlain, and through him negotiated a treaty, since
their country depended for its food supply on the king's territory.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` A day was fixed, and Herod, wearing his robes of state and seated
on a throne, began to make a speech to them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The people acclaimed him with, 'It is a god speaking, not a man!'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and at that moment the angel of the Lord struck him down, because
he had not given the glory to God. He was eaten away by worms and died.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The word of God continued to spread and to gain followers.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Barnabas and Saul completed their task at Jerusalem and came back,
bringing John Mark with them.
