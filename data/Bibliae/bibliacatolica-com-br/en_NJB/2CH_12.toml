and all Israel with him, abandoned the Law of Yahweh;

"2" = ''':sup:`2` and thus it happened that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam,
Shishak king of Egypt marched on Jerusalem, because they had been
unfaithful to Yahweh,

"3" = ''':sup:`3` with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand cavalry and
countless hordes of Libyans, Sukkiim and Cushites who came from Egypt
with him.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` They captured the fortified towns of Judah and reached Jerusalem.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The prophet Shemaiah then came to Rehoboam and the generals of
Judah, who had fallen back on Jerusalem before Shishak's advance, and
said to them, 'Yahweh says this, "You have abandoned me and so I have
abandoned you into Shishak's clutches." '
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` At this, the Israelite generals and the king humbled themselves and
said, 'Yahweh is just!'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Yahweh saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh
came to Shemaiah as follows, 'They have humbled themselves. I shall not
destroy them but shall grant them some degree of deliverance. My
retribution will not be poured out on Jerusalem by means of Shishak;

the difference between serving me and serving kings of other

"9" = ''':sup:`9` So Shishak king of Egypt advanced on Jerusalem and carried off the
treasures of the Temple and the treasures of the royal palace. He took
everything away, including the golden shields which Solomon had made.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` To replace these, King Rehoboam made bronze shields, entrusting
them to the commanders of the guard who guarded the king's palace gate.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Whenever the king went to the Temple of Yahweh, the guards would
come out carrying them, returning them to the guardroom afterwards.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Because King Rehoboam had humbled himself, the retribution of
Yahweh turned away from him so as not to destroy him completely; and
there were also some good features in Judah.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Thus he was able to strengthen his position in Jerusalem and
continue as king; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he came to
the throne and remained king for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
chosen by Yahweh from all the tribes of Israel to put his name there.
His mother's name was Naamah the Ammonite.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But he did wrong in not setting his heart on seeking Yahweh.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The history of Rehoboam, from first to last, is this not all
written down in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the
seer? Warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam went on throughout the
period.

City of David; his son Abijah succeeded him.
