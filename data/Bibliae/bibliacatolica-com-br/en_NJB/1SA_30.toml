Notas de rodap√©:
30:1-3 - When David returns to Ziklag, he discovers that the city has
been sacked by the Amalekites, and their families have been taken
captive. This highlights the vulnerability of David and his men and the
devastating impact war can have on families (see also Deuteronomy
30:4-6 - David and his men mourn deeply, but while the people talk of
stoning him, David draws strength from the Lord. David's dependence on
God in times of crisis is an example of faith and spiritual leadership
30:7-8 - David inquires of the Lord through the priest Abiathar, asking
whether he should pursue the Amalekites. God responds with a promise of
success. This moment demonstrates the importance of seeking divine
30:9-10 - David continues with 600 men, but 200 are left behind because
they are exhausted. Even in the face of difficulties, David continues
his mission with a smaller group, trusting in God's promise (see also
30:16-20 - David defeats the Amalekites and recovers everything that
was taken, including their families. David's victory is not only a
personal restoration, but also demonstrates God's faithfulness in
17:8-16).
