throne of David, you, your officials and your people who go through
these gates.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Yahweh says this: Act uprightly and justly; rescue from the hands of
the oppressor anyone who has been wronged, do not exploit or ill-treat
the stranger, the orphan, the widow; shed no innocent blood in this
place.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For if you are scrupulous in obeying this command, then kings
occupying the throne of David will continue to make their entry through
the gates of this palace riding in chariots or on horseback, they,
their officials and their people.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But if you do not listen to these words, then I swear by myself,
Yahweh declares, this palace shall become a ruin!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "Yes, this is what Yahweh says about the palace of the king of
Judah: You are like Gilead to me, like a peak of Lebanon. All the same,
I will reduce you to a desert, to uninhabited towns.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` I dedicate men to destroy you, each man with his weapons; they will
cut down your finest cedars and throw them on the fire.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` "And when many nations pass this city, they will say to one another:
Why has Yahweh treated this great city like this?

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the answer will be: Because they abandoned the covenant of
Yahweh their God to worship other gods and serve them." '
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Do not weep for the man who is dead, do not raise the dirge for
him. Weep rather for the one who has gone away, since he will never
come back, never see his native land again.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For this is what Yahweh has said about Shallum son of Josiah, king
of Judah, who succeeded Josiah his father and was forced to leave this
place, 'He will never come back to it

"14" = ''':sup:`14` who says, "I shall build myself a spacious palace with airy
upstairs rooms," who makes windows in it, panels it with cedar, and
paints it vermilion.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Are you more of a king because of your passion for cedar? Did your
father go hungry or thirsty? But he did what is just and upright, so
all went well for him.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` He used to examine the cases of poor and needy, then all went well.
Is not that what it means to know me? Yahweh demands.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` You on the other hand have eyes and heart for nothing but your own
interests, for shedding innocent blood and perpetrating violence and
oppression.'

"18" = ''':sup:`18` That is why Yahweh says this about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of
Judah: 'No lamenting for him, "My poor brother! My poor sister!" No
lamenting for him, "His poor lordship! His poor majesty!"

listen!" From your youth this has been how you behaved, refusing to
listen to my voice.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` The wind will shepherd all your shepherds away and your lovers will
go into captivity. Then you will blush deep with shame at the thought
of all your wickedness.

the cedars, how you will groan when anguish overtakes you, pangs like
those of a woman in labour!

"24" = ''':sup:`24` 'As I live, Yahweh declares, even if Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king
of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, I would still wrench
you off!

"25" = ''':sup:`25` I shall hand you over to those determined to kill you, to those you
dread, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to the Chaldaeans.

Notas de rodap√©:
22:1-5 - The warning to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, is clear: his
