"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now, it happened that Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem, learned that
Joshua had conquered Ai and put the town under the curse of
destruction, treating Ai and its king as he had already treated Jericho
and its king; and also that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
with Israel and were living with them.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There was consternation at this, since Gibeon was as important a
town as any of the royal towns themselves (it was larger than Ai),
while all its citizens were fighting men.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Consequently, Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king
of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir
king of Eglon,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` 'Join me up here and help me to conquer Gibeon, since it has made
peace with Joshua and the Israelites.'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The five Amorite kings joined forces and went up there, that is, the
king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of
Lachish and the king of Eglon, they and all their armies; laying siege
to Gibeon, they attacked it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, 'Do not
desert your servants; come up here quickly to save us and help us,
since all the Amorite kings living in the highlands have allied
themselves against us.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Joshua came up from Gilgal, he, all the fighting men and all the
bravest of his army.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Do not be afraid of these people; I have put
them at your mercy; not one of them will put up any resistance.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Having marched from Gilgal throughout the night, Joshua caught them
unawares.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Yahweh threw them into disorder at the sight of Israel, defeating
them completely at Gibeon; furthermore, he pursued them by way of the
Descent of Beth-Horon and harassed them as far as Azekah (and as far as
Makkedah).
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And as they fled from Israel down the Descent of Beth-Horon, Yahweh
hurled huge hailstones from heaven on them all the way to Azekah, and
they died. More of them died under the hailstones than under the swords
of the Israelites.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Joshua then spoke to Yahweh, the day Yahweh delivered the Amorites
to the Israelites. In the presence of Israel, Joshua said: Sun, stand
still over Gibeon, and, moon, you too, over the Vale of Aijalon!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the sun stood still, and the moon halted, until the people had
taken vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of
the Just? The sun stood still in the middle of the sky and delayed its
setting for almost a whole day.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` There was never a day like that before or since, when Yahweh obeyed
the voice of a man -- for Yahweh was fighting for Israel.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Joshua, and all Israel with him, then went back to the camp at
Gilgal.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` As regards the five kings, these had fled and hidden in the cave of
Makkedah,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and news of this was brought to Joshua. 'The five kings have been
found hiding in the cave at Makkedah.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Joshua said, 'Roll great stones over the mouth of the cave and post
men there to keep guard.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You yourselves, do not stay there doing nothing; pursue the enemy,
cut off their line of retreat and do not let them enter their towns,
for Yahweh your God has put them at your mercy.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When Joshua and the Israelites had finished inflicting a very great
defeat on them, to the point of destroying them, those who had escaped
alive took refuge in their fortresses.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The people came back to Joshua's camp at Makkedah; they were all
safe and sound, and no one dared to attempt anything against the
Israelites.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Joshua then said, 'Clear the mouth of the cave and bring the five
kings out to me.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` They did so, and brought the five kings out of the cave to take
them to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of
Jarmuth, the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When these kings had been brought out, Joshua assembled all the men
of Israel and said to the chiefs of the warriors who had fought with
him, 'Come forward and put your feet on the necks of these kings!' They
came forward and put their feet on their necks.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` 'Be fearless and undaunted,' Joshua went on, 'be strong and stand
firm, for this is how Yahweh will deal with all the enemies you fight.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` With this, Joshua struck and killed them and had them hanged on
five trees; they hung there till evening.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` At the hour of sunset, on Joshua's orders, they were taken down
from the trees and thrown into the cave where they had been hiding.
Great stones were laid over the mouth of the cave, and these are still
there to this very day.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The same day Joshua captured Makkedah, putting it and its king to
the sword; he delivered them over to the curse of destruction, with
every living creature there, and let no one escape, and he treated the
king of Makkedah as he had treated the king of Jericho.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on from Makkedah to Libnah
and attacked it
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and Yahweh put this, too, and its king at Israel's mercy; and
Israel put every living creature there to the sword, and left none
alive, and treated its king like the king of Jericho.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on from Libnah to Lachish and
besieged it and attacked it.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Yahweh put Lachish at Israel's mercy, and Israel took it on the
second day and put it and every living creature in it to the sword, as
they had treated Libnah.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Horam king of Gezer then marched up to help Lachish, but Joshua
beat him and his people until not one was left alive.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on from Lachish to Eglon.
They besieged it and attacked it.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The same day they took it and put it to the sword. That day he
delivered over to the curse of destruction every living creature there,
treating it as he had treated Lachish.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on up from Eglon to Hebron.
They attacked it,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` took it and put it to the sword, with its king, its dependencies
and every living creature in it. As he had treated Eglon, so here, he
left no one alive. He delivered it over to the curse of destruction,
with every living creature in it.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Joshua, and all Israel with him, then turned back on Debir and
attacked it.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` He took it and its king and all the places belonging to it; they
put them to the sword, and every living creature there they delivered
over to the curse of destruction. He left no one alive. As he had
treated Hebron, as he had treated Libnah and its king, so he treated
Debir and its king.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Thus Joshua subjugated the whole country: the highlands, the Negeb,
the lowlands and watered foothills, and all their kings. He left not
one survivor and put every living thing under the curse of destruction,
as Yahweh, God of Israel, had commanded.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Joshua conquered them from Kadesh-Barnea to Gaza, and the whole
region of Goshen as far as Gibeon.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` All these kings and their territory Joshua captured in a single
campaign, because Yahweh, God of Israel, fought for Israel.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And then Joshua, and all Israel with him, went back to the camp at
Gilgal.
