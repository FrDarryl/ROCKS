"1" = ''':sup:`1` It is widely reported that there is sexual immorality among you,
immorality of a kind that is not found even among gentiles: that one of
you is living with his stepmother.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And you so filled with your own self-importance! It would have been
better if you had been grieving bitterly, so that the man who has done
this thing were turned out of the community.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` For my part, however distant I am physically, I am present in spirit
and have already condemned the man who behaved in this way, just as
though I were present in person.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` When you have gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus, with
the presence of my spirit, and in the power of our Lord Jesus,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` hand such a man over to Satan, to be destroyed as far as natural
life is concerned, so that on the Day of the Lord his spirit may be
saved.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Your self-satisfaction is ill founded. Do you not realise that only
a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Throw out the old yeast so that you can be the fresh dough,
unleavened as you are. For our Passover has been sacrificed, that is,

people living immoral lives.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` I was not including everybody in this present world who is sexually
immoral, or everybody who is greedy, or dishonest or worships false
gods -- that would mean you would have to cut yourselves off completely
from the world.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` In fact what I meant was that you were not to have anything to do
with anyone going by the name of brother who is sexually immoral, or is
greedy, or worships false gods, or is a slanderer or a drunkard or
dishonest; never even have a meal with anybody of that kind.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` It is no concern of mine to judge outsiders. It is for you to judge
those who are inside, is it not?

"13" = ''':sup:`13` But outsiders are for God to judge. You must banish this evil-doer
from among you.
