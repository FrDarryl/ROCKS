with seven heads and ten horns, and each of the seven heads crowned
with a coronet.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Its tail swept a third of the stars from the sky and hurled them to
the ground, and the dragon stopped in front of the woman as she was at
the point of giving birth, so that it could eat the child as soon as it
was born.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The woman was delivered of a boy, the son who was to rule all the

"14" = ''':sup:`14` but she was given a pair of the great eagle's wings to fly away
from the serpent into the desert, to the place where she was to be
