[21]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` This is what happened next: Naboth of Jezreel had a vineyard close
by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and Ahab said to Naboth, 'Give me your vineyard to be my vegetable
garden, since it adjoins my palace; I will give you a better vineyard
for it or, if you prefer, I will give you its value in money.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Naboth, however, said to Ahab, 'Yahweh forbid that I should give you
my ancestral heritage!'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Ahab went home gloomy and out of temper at the words of Naboth of
Jezreel, 'I will not give you my heritage from my ancestors.' He lay
down on his bed and turned his face away and refused to eat.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` His wife Jezebel came to him. 'Why are you so dispirited,' she said,
'that you refuse to eat?'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He said, 'I have been talking to Naboth of Jezreel. I said, "Give me
your vineyard either for money or, if you prefer, for another vineyard
in exchange." But he said, "I will not give you my vineyard." '
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then his wife Jezebel said, 'Some king of Israel you make! Get up,
eat and take heart; I myself shall get you the vineyard of Naboth the
Jezreelite.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So she wrote a letter in Ahab's name and sealed it with his seal,
sending the letter to the elders and notables of the city where Naboth
lived.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` In the letter, she wrote, 'Proclaim a fast, and put Naboth in a
prominent place among the people.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` There confront him with a couple of scoundrels who will accuse him
as follows, "You have cursed God and the king." Then take him outside
and stone him to death.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The men of Naboth's city, the elders and notables living in his
city, did what Jezebel ordered, as was written in the letter which she
had sent him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` They proclaimed a fast and put Naboth in a prominent place among
the people.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The two scoundrels then came and confronted him, and the scoundrels
then publicly accused Naboth as follows, 'Naboth has cursed God and the
king.' He was then taken outside the city and stoned to death.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` They then sent word to Jezebel, 'Naboth has been stoned to death.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said
to Ahab, 'Get up! Take possession of the vineyard which Naboth of
Jezreel refused to sell you, for Naboth is no longer alive, he is
dead.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the
vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel and take possession of it.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` 'Up! Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, in Samaria. You will find
him in Naboth's vineyard; he has gone down to take possession of it.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You are to say this to him, "Yahweh says this: You have committed
murder and now you usurp as well. For this -- and Yahweh says this --
in the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, the dogs will
lick your blood too." '
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Ahab said to Elijah, 'So you have caught me, O my enemy!' Elijah
answered, 'I have caught you! For your double dealing, and since you
have done what is displeasing to Yahweh,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I shall now bring disaster down on you; I shall sweep away your
descendants and wipe out every manjack of the House of Ahab, fettered
or free in Israel.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` I shall treat your House as I treated the house of Jeroboam son of
Nebat and of Baasha son of Ahijah, for provoking my anger and leading
Israel into sin.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` (Against Jezebel too Yahweh spoke these words, "The dogs will eat
Jezebel in the Field of Jezreel.")
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Those of Ahab's family who die in the city, the dogs will eat; and
those who die in the open country, the birds of the air will eat.'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And indeed there never was anyone like Ahab for double dealing and
for doing what is displeasing to Yahweh, urged on by Jezebel his wife.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` He behaved in the most abominable way, adhering to idols, just as
the Amorites had, whom Yahweh had dispossessed for the Israelites.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When Ahab heard these words, he tore his garments and put sackcloth
next to his skin and fasted; he slept in the sackcloth; he walked with
slow steps.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` 'Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he has
humbled himself before me, I shall not bring the disaster in his days;
I shall bring the disaster down on his House in his son's days.'

21:1-4 - Ahab desires Naboth's vineyard, but Naboth refuses to sell it
because of Israel's inheritance law. Naboth's faithfulness to God's Law
contrasts with Ahab's selfish desire and greed, revealing the conflict

21:5-10 - Ahab's wife, Jezebel, plots Naboth's death to satisfy the
king's desire. This evil act of conspiracy and murder highlights the
corruption of power and the wickedness of the human heart (see also
21:17-19 - God sends Elijah to confront Ahab after the murder of
Naboth. Elijah's prophecy against Ahab and Jezebel reveals that no one
is above God's justice, not even the king. This underscores the
21:25-26 - The Bible emphasizes that Ahab was Israel's worst king,
incited by Jezebel to commit abominations. His life is an example of
how persistent sin and evil influence can corrupt an entire nation (see
21:27-29 - Ahab, repentant, humbles himself before God upon hearing
Elijah's condemnation. God, in His mercy, postpones full judgment on
his house. This shows that even the worst of sinners can experience
