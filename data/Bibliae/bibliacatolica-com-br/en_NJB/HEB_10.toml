"1" = ''':sup:`1` So, since the Law contains no more than a reflection of the good
things which were still to come, and no true image of them, it is quite
incapable of bringing the worshippers to perfection, by means of the
same sacrifices repeatedly offered year after year.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Otherwise, surely the offering of them would have stopped, because
the worshippers, when they had been purified once, would have no
awareness of sins.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But in fact the sins are recalled year after year in the sacrifices.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Bulls' blood and goats' blood are incapable of taking away sins,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and that is why he said, on coming into the world: You wanted no
sacrifice or cereal offering, but you gave me a body.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` You took no pleasure in burnt offering or sacrifice for sin;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` then I said, 'Here I am, I am coming,' in the scroll of the book it
is written of me, to do your will, God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He says first You did not want what the Law lays down as the things
to be offered, that is: the sacrifices, the cereal offerings, the burnt
offerings and the sacrifices for sin, and you took no pleasure in them;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and then he says: Here I am! I am coming to do your will. He is
abolishing the first sort to establish the second.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And this will was for us to be made holy by the offering of the
body of Jesus Christ made once and for all.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Every priest stands at his duties every day, offering over and over
again the same sacrifices which are quite incapable of taking away
sins.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He, on the other hand, has offered one single sacrifice for sins,
and then taken his seat for ever, at the right hand of God,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` where he is now waiting till his enemies are made his footstool.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` By virtue of that one single offering, he has achieved the eternal
perfection of all who are sanctified.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The Holy Spirit attests this to us, for after saying:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` No, this is the covenant I will make with them, when those days
have come. the Lord says: In their minds I will plant my Laws writing
them on their hearts,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and I shall never more call their sins to mind, or their offences.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When these have been forgiven, there can be no more sin offerings.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` We have then, brothers, complete confidence through the blood of
Jesus in entering the sanctuary,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` by a new way which he has opened for us, a living opening through
the curtain, that is to say, his flesh.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And we have the high priest over all the sanctuary of God.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So as we go in, let us be sincere in heart and filled with faith,
our hearts sprinkled and free from any trace of bad conscience, and our
bodies washed with pure water.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Let us keep firm in the hope we profess, because the one who made
the promise is trustworthy.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Let us be concerned for each other, to stir a response in love and
good works.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Do not absent yourself from your own assemblies, as some do, but
encourage each other; the more so as you see the Day drawing near.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` If, after we have been given knowledge of the truth, we should
deliberately commit any sins, then there is no longer any sacrifice for
them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` There is left only the dreadful prospect of judgement and of the
fiery wrath that is to devour your enemies.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Anyone who disregards the Law of Moses is ruthlessly put to death
on the word of two witnesses or three;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and you may be sure that anyone who tramples on the Son of God, and
who treats the blood of the covenant which sanctified him as if it were
not holy, and who insults the Spirit of grace, will be condemned to a
far severer punishment.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` We are all aware who it was that said: Vengeance is mine; I will
pay them back. And again: The Lord will vindicate his people.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Remember the great challenge of the sufferings that you had to meet
after you received the light, in earlier days;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` sometimes by being yourselves publicly exposed to humiliations and
violence, and sometimes as associates of others who were treated in the
same way.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` For you not only shared in the sufferings of those who were in
prison, but you accepted with joy being stripped of your belongings,
knowing that you owned something that was better and lasting.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Do not lose your fearlessness now, then, since the reward is so
great.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` You will need perseverance if you are to do God's will and gain
what he has promised.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Only a little while now, a very little while, for come he certainly
will before too long.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` My upright person will live through faith but if he draws back, my
soul will take no pleasure in him.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` We are not the sort of people who draw back, and are lost by it; we
are the sort who keep faith until our souls are saved.
