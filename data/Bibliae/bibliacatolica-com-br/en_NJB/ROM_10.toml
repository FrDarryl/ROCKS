they may be saved.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Not recognising God's saving justice they have tried to establish
their own, instead of submitting to the saving justice of God.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the Law has found its fulfilment in Christ so that all who have
faith will be justified.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Moses writes of the saving justice that comes by the Law and says
that whoever complies with it will find life in it.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` But the saving justice of faith says this: Do not think in your
heart, 'Who will go up to heaven?' --

"7" = ''':sup:`7` that is to bring Christ down; or 'Who will go down to the depths?'
-- that is to bring Christ back from the dead.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` What does it say, then? The word is very near to you; it is in your

"14" = ''':sup:`14` How then are they to call on him if they have not come to believe
in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard of
him? And how will they hear of him unless there is a preacher for them?

"15" = ''':sup:`15` And how will there be preachers if they are not sent? As scripture
says: How beautiful are the feet of the messenger of good news.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But in fact they have not all responded to the good news. As Isaiah
says: Lord, who has given credence to what they have heard from us?

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But it is in that way faith comes, from hearing, and that means
hearing the word of Christ.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Well then, I say, is it possible that they have not heard? Indeed
they have: in the entire earth their voice stands out, their message
reaches the whole world.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Well, another question, then: is it possible that Israel did not
