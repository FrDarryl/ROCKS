"1" = ''':sup:`1` Yes, I have applied myself to all this and experienced all this to
be so: that is to say, that the upright and the wise, with their
activities, are in the hands of God. We do not understand either love
or hate, where we are concerned, both of them are futile. And for all
of us is reserved a common fate, for the upright and for the wicked,
for the food and for the bad; whether we are ritually pure or not,
whether we offer sacrifice or not: it is the same for the good and for
the sinner, for someone who takes a vow, as for someone who fears to do
so.

'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This is another evil among those occurring under the sun: that there
should be the same fate for everyone. The human heart, however, is full
of wickedness; folly lurks in our hearts throughout our lives, until we
end among the dead.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But there is hope for someone still linked to the rest of the
living: better be a live dog than a dead lion.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The living are at least aware that they are going to die, but the
dead know nothing whatever. No more wages for them, since their memory
is forgotten.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Their love, their hate, their jealousy, have perished long since,
and they will never have any further part in what goes on under the
sun.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` So, eat your bread in joy, drink your wine with a glad heart, since
God has already approved your actions.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Spend your life with the woman you love, all the days of futile life
God gives you under the sun, throughout your futile days, since this is
your lot in life and in the effort you expend under the sun.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Whatever work you find to do, do it with all your might, for there
is neither achievement, nor planning, nor science, nor wisdom in Sheol

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Another thing I have observed under the sun: that the race is not
won by the speediest, nor the battle by the champions; it is not the
wise who get food, nor the intelligent wealth, nor the learned favour:
chance and mischance befall them all.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` We do not know when our time will come: like fish caught in the
treacherous net, like birds caught in the snare, just so are we all
trapped by misfortune when it suddenly overtakes us.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Here is another example of the wisdom I have acquired under the sun
and it strikes me as important:
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` There was once a small town, with only a few inhabitants; a mighty
king made war on it, laying siege to it and building great siege-works
round it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But there was in that town a poverty-stricken sage who by his
wisdom saved the town. No one remembered this poor man afterwards.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So I say: Wisdom is more effective than brute force, but the wisdom
of a poor man is not valued: no one listens to what he has to say.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The calm words of the wise make themselves heard above the shouts
of someone commanding an army of fools.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Wisdom is worth more than weapons of war, but a single sin undoes a
deal of good.

9:11-12 - The race of life does not always favor the swift, nor war the
strong. This highlights that circumstances can be unexpected and that
wisdom is more valuable than strength, for life is full of surprises
9:13-18 - The story of the city saved by one man's wisdom reveals that
even the wise can be ignored. Wisdom, though valuable, is not always
recognized, highlighting the fleeting nature of human recognition (see
