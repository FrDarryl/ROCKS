her suppliant's mourning attire and dressed herself in her full
splendour. Radiant as she then appeared, she invoked God who watches
over all people and saves them. With her, she took two
ladies-in-waiting. With a delicate air she learned on one, while the
other accompanied her carrying her train. Rosy with the full flush of
her beauty, her face radiated joy and love: but her heart shrank with
hear. Having passed through door after door, she found herself in the
presence of the king. He was sitting on his royal throne, dressed in
all his robes of state, glittering with gold and precious stones-- a
formidable sight. He looked up, afire with majesty and, blazing with
anger, saw her. The queen sank to the floor. As she fainted, the colour
drained from her face and her head fell against the lady-in-waiting
beside her. But God changed the king's heart, inducing a milder spirit.
He sprang from his throne in alarm and took her in his arms until she
recovered, comforting her with soothing words. 'What is the matter,
Esther?' he said. 'I am your brother. Take heart, you are not going to
die; our order applies only to ordinary people. Come to me.'

"2" = ''':sup:`2` (a) 'Sire,' she said, 'to me you looked like one of God's angels,
and my heart was moved with fear of your majesty. For you are a figure
of wonder, my lord, and your face is full of graciousness.' (b) But as
she spoke she fell down in a faint. The king grrew more agitated, and
his courtiers all set about reviving her.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` 'What is the matter, Queen Esther?' the king said. 'Tell me what you
want; even if it is half my kingdom, I grant it you.'

"4" = ''':sup:`4` 'Would it please the king,' Esther replied, 'to come with Haman
today to the banquet I have prepared for him?'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The king said, 'Tell Haman to come at once, so that Esther may have
her wish.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared
and, during the banquet, the king again said to Esther, 'Tell me your
request; I grant it to you. Tell me what you want; even if it is half
my kingdom, it is yours for the asking.'

"7" = ''':sup:`7` 'What do I want, what is my request?' Esther replied.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` 'If I have found favour in the king's eyes, and if it is his
pleasure to grant what I ask and to agree to my request, let the king
and Haman come to the banquet I intend to give them tomorrow, and then
I shall do as the king says.'

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Haman left full of joy and high spirits that day; but when he saw
Mordecai at the Chancellery, neither standing up nor stirring at his
approach, he felt a gust of anger.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He restrained himself, however. Returning home, he sent for his
friends and Zeresh his wife

"11" = ''':sup:`11` and held forth to them about his dazzling wealth, his many
children, how the king had raised him to a position of honour and
promoted him over the heads of the king's officers-of-state and
ministers.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` 'What is more,' he added, 'Queen Esther has just invited me and the
king -- no one else except me -- to a banquet she was giving, and
better still she has invited me and the king again tomorrow.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But what do I care about all this when all the while I see Mordecai
the Jew sitting there at the Chancellery?'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` 'Have a fifty-cubit gallows run up,' said Zeresh his wife and all
his friends, 'and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged
on it. Then you can go with the king to the banquet, without a care in
the world!' Delighted with this advice, Haman had the gallows erected.
