the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` 'Anyone who welcomes one little child like this in my name welcomes
me.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` But anyone who is the downfall of one of these little ones who have
faith in me would be better drowned in the depths of the sea with a
great millstone round his neck.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Alas for the world that there should be such causes of falling!
Causes of falling indeed there must be, but alas for anyone who
provides them!

fire.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` In truth I tell you, if he finds it, it gives him more joy than do
the ninety-nine that did not stray at all.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Similarly, it is never the will of your Father in heaven that one
of these little ones should be lost.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` 'If your brother does something wrong, go and have it out with him
alone, between your two selves. If he listens to you, you have won back
your brother.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you:
whatever the misdemeanour, the evidence of two or three witnesses is
required to sustain the charge.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But if he refuses to listen to these, report it to the community;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` At this, the servant threw himself down at his master's feet, with
the words, "Be patient with me and I will pay the whole sum."

"31" = ''':sup:`31` His fellow-servants were deeply distressed when they saw what had
happened, and they went to their master and reported the whole affair
to him.
