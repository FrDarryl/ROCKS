"1" = ''':sup:`1` So if in Christ there is anything that will move you, any incentive
in love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any warmth or sympathy -- I
appeal to you,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` make my joy complete by being of a single mind, one in love, one in
heart and one in mind.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Nothing is to be done out of jealousy or vanity; instead, out of
humility of mind everyone should give preference to others,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` everyone pursuing not selfish interests but those of others.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Make your own the mind of Christ Jesus:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Who, being in the form of God, did not count equality with God
something to be grasped.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming as
human beings are; and being in every way like a human being,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he was humbler yet, even to accepting death, death on a cross.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And for this God raised him high, and gave him the name which is
above all other names;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` so that all beings in the heavens, on earth and in the underworld,
should bend the knee at the name of Jesus

"11" = ''':sup:`11` and that every tongue should acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord, to
the glory of God the Father.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So, my dear friends, you have always been obedient; your obedience
must not be limited to times when I am present. Now that I am absent it
must be more in evidence, so work out your salvation in fear and
trembling.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` It is God who, for his own generous purpose, gives you the
intention and the powers to act.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Let your behaviour be free of murmuring and complaining
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` so that you remain faultless and pure, unspoilt children of God
surrounded by a deceitful and underhand brood, shining out among them
like bright stars in the world,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` proffering to it the Word of life. Then I shall have reason to be
proud on the Day of Christ, for it will not be for nothing that I have
run the race and toiled so hard.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Indeed, even if my blood has to be poured as a libation over your
sacrifice and the offering of your faith, then I shall be glad and join
in your rejoicing-
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and in the same way, you must be glad and join in my rejoicing.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I hope, in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you soon, so that my
mind may be set at rest when I hear how you are.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` There is nobody else that I can send who is like him and cares as
sincerely for your well-being;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` they all want to work for themselves, not for Jesus Christ.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But you know what sort of person he has proved himself, working
with me for the sake of the gospel like a son with his father.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` That is the man, then, that I am hoping to send to you immediately
I can make out what is going to happen to me;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but I am confident in the Lord that I shall come myself, too,
before long.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Nevertheless I thought it essential to send to you Epaphroditus, my
brother and fellow-worker and companion-in-arms since he came as your
representative to look after my needs;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` because he was missing you all and was worrying because you had
heard that he was ill.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Indeed he was seriously ill and nearly died; but God took pity on
him -- and not only on him but also on me, to spare me one grief on top
of another.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So I am sending him back as promptly as I can so that you will have
the joy of seeing him again, and that will be some comfort to me in my
distress.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Welcome him in the Lord, then, with all joy; hold people like him
in honour,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` because it was for Christ's work that he came so near to dying,
risking his life to do the duty to me which you could not do
yourselves.
