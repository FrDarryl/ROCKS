for you have deserted your God to play the whore, you have loved the

"2" = ''':sup:`2` The threshing-floor and wine-press will not feed them; they will be
disappointed of new wine.

back to Egypt, and eat polluted food in Assyria.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` No more will they pour libations of wine to Yahweh, and their
sacrifices will not win his favour but will be like funeral fare for
them: whoever eats them will be polluted; for their food will be for
themselves alone, not being offered in Yahweh's home.
