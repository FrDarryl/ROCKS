Notas de rodap√©:
19:1-3 - The hardening of the Egyptians' hearts even after so many
plagues is a sign of divine justice. God allows them to persist in
their stubbornness, resulting in their final destruction in the Red Sea
19:6-7 - Creation collaborates with God to free His people, altering
its natural laws to benefit the righteous. The sea parts to allow the
Israelites to pass, showing that nature is also subject to God's will
19:9-10 - The Israelites pass through the sea as if walking on dry
land, while the Egyptians meet their doom. Their safe crossing
symbolizes God's salvation and trust in His protection (see also
19:13-14 - The Egyptians suffer the plagues because they persecuted
God's people. Those who reject God's mercy and persecute the righteous
19:22 - In all these events, God demonstrates His justice and mercy. He
acts distinctly to save the righteous and punish the wicked, showing
that His providence is perfect and His judgment infallible (see also
