"2" = ''':sup:`2` David then went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came out
trembling to meet David and said, 'Why are you alone? Why is nobody
with you?'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` David replied to Ahimelech the priest, 'The king has given me an
order and said to me, "Do not let anyone know anything about the
mission on which I am sending you, or about the order which I have
given you." I have arranged to meet the guards at such and such a
place.

me, or whatever there is.'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The priest replied to David, 'I have no ordinary bread to hand;
there are only consecrated loaves of permanent offering -- provided
that the men have kept themselves from women?'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` David replied to the priest, 'Certainly, women have been forbidden
to us, as always when I set off on a campaign. The men's things are
clean. Though this is a profane journey, they are certainly clean today
as far as their things are concerned.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The priest then gave him what had been consecrated, for the only
bread there was the loaves of permanent offering, which is taken out of

hand? I did not bring either my sword or my weapons with me, because
the king's business was urgent.'

"10" = ''':sup:`10` The priest replied, 'The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you
killed in the Valley of the Terebinth is here, wrapped in a piece of
clothing behind the ephod; if you care to take it, do so, for that is
the only one here.' David said, 'There is nothing like that one; give
it to me.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` David journeyed on and that day fled out of Saul's reach, going to
Achish king of Gath.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Achish's servants said to him, 'Is not this David, the king of the
country? Was it not of him that they sang as they danced: Saul has
killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands?'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` David pondered on these words and became very frightened of Achish
king of Gath.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When their eyes were on him, he played the madman and, when they
held him, he feigned lunacy. He drummed his feet on the doors of the
gate and let his spittle run down his beard.

bring him to me?

"16" = ''':sup:`16` Have I not enough madmen, without your bringing me this one to
weary me with his antics? Is he to join my household?'
