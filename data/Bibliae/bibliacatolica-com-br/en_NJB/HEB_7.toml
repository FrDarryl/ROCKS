"1" = ''':sup:`1` Melchizedek, king of Salem, a priest of God Most High, came to meet
Abraham when he returned from defeating the kings, and blessed him;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. By the interpretation of
his name, he is, first, 'king of saving justice' and also king of
Salem, that is, 'king of peace';
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he has no father, mother or ancestry, and his life has no beginning
or ending; he is like the Son of God. He remains a priest for ever.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now think how great this man must have been, if the patriarch
Abraham gave him a tenth of the finest plunder.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` We know that any of the descendants of Levi who are admitted to the
priesthood are obliged by the Law to take tithes from the people, that
is, from their own brothers although they too are descended from
Abraham.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But this man, who was not of the same descent, took his tithe from
Abraham, and he gave his blessing to the holder of the promises.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now it is indisputable that a blessing is given by a superior to an
inferior.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Further, in the normal case it is ordinary mortal men who receive
the tithes, whereas in that case it was one who is attested as being
alive.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It could be said that Levi himself, who receives tithes, actually
paid tithes, in the person of Abraham,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` because he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek
came to meet him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now if perfection had been reached through the levitical priesthood
-- and this was the basis of the Law given to the people -- why was it
necessary for a different kind of priest to arise, spoken of as being
of the order of Melchizedek rather than of the order of Aaron?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Any change in the priesthood must mean a change in the Law as well.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So our Lord, of whom these things were said, belonged to a
different tribe, the members of which have never done service at the
altar;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` everyone knows he came from Judah, a tribe which Moses did not
mention at all when dealing with priests.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` This becomes even more clearly evident if another priest, of the
type of Melchizedek, arises who is a priest
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` not in virtue of a law of physical descent, but in virtue of the
power of an indestructible life.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For he is attested by the prophecy: You are a priest for ever of
the order of Melchizedek.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The earlier commandment is thus abolished, because of its weakness
and ineffectiveness
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` since the Law could not make anything perfect; but now this
commandment is replaced by something better-the hope that brings us
close to God.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now the former priests became priests without any oath being sworn,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but this one with the swearing of an oath by him who said to him,
The Lord has sworn an oath he will never retract: you are a priest for
ever;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` the very fact that it occurred with the swearing of an oath makes
the covenant of which Jesus is the guarantee all the greater.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Further, the former priests were many in number, because death put
an end to each one of them;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but this one, because he remains for ever, has a perpetual
priesthood.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It follows, then, that his power to save those who come to God
through him is absolute, since he lives for ever to intercede for them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Such is the high priest that met our need, holy, innocent and
uncontaminated, set apart from sinners, and raised up above the
heavens;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` he has no need to offer sacrifices every day, as the high priests
do, first for their own sins and only then for those of the people;
this he did once and for all by offering himself.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The Law appoints high priests who are men subject to weakness; but
the promise on oath, which came after the Law, appointed the Son who is
made perfect for ever.

7:1-3 - Melchizedek is presented as a mysterious and superior figure,
