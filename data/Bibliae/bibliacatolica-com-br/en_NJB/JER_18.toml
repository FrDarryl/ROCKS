"3" = ''':sup:`3` So I went down to the potter's house; and there he was, working at
the wheel.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the vessel he was making came out wrong, as may happen with clay
when a potter is at work. So he began again and shaped it into another
vessel, as he thought fit.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then the word of Yahweh came to me as follows,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` 'House of Israel, can I not do to you what this potter does? Yahweh
demands. Yes, like clay in the potter's hand, so you are in mine, House
of Israel.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Sometimes I announce that I shall uproot, break down and destroy a
certain nation or kingdom,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` but should the nation I have threatened abandon its wickedness, I
then change my mind about the disaster which I had intended to inflict
on it.

nation or kingdom,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` but should that nation do what displeases me and refuse to listen

"11" = ''':sup:`11` So now, say this to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, "Yahweh says this: Listen, I am preparing a disaster for
you, I am working out a plan against you. So now, each one of you, turn
back from your evil ways, amend your conduct and actions."

"12" = ''':sup:`12` They, however, will say, "It is no use! We shall follow our own

Nothing! They have been made to stumble in their ways, the ancient
paths, to walk in paths, on an unmade road,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Like the east wind, I shall scatter them before the enemy. I shall
