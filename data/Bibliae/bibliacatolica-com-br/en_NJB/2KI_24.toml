Notas de rodap√©:
24:1-4 - During the reign of Jehoiakim, the Babylonian king
Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah. Manasseh's sins continued to take their
toll on Judah, resulting in its subjugation to the Babylonian empire.
This reflected God's justice in punishing persistent idolatry (see also
24:10-12 - Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem, and Jehoiakim surrenders.
He is taken captive to Babylon, marking the beginning of Judah's
downfall. This event fulfills the prophets' warnings about impending
24:13-14 - The Temple and palace treasures are plundered, and many of
Jerusalem's inhabitants are taken into exile. This plundering of sacred
goods symbolizes the spiritual and material devastation of Judah (see
24:15-16 - King Jehoiachin and the nobles of Judah are exiled, leaving
only the poorest in the land. This deportation of the leaders and
warriors signals the humiliation of Judah and the fulfillment of the
24:18-20 - Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, does what is evil in the
