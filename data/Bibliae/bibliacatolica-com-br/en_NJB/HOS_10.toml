Yahweh, but what could the king do for us?'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Speeches are made, oaths sworn to no purpose, agreements concluded,
and so-called justice spreads like a poisonous weed along the furrows
of the fields!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Samaria's citizens will tremble for the calf of Beth-Aven; the
people there will mourn for it, so will its idol-priests, as they exult
in its glory once it has been carried away!

10:3-6 - Israel is described as a nation that, faced with oppression,
seeks a solution in false hopes and its own strength. Dependence on
idols is a major flaw that will lead to the destruction of the kingdom
10:7-10 - Israel's destruction is imminent, with the king being taken
into exile and the nation suffering divine punishment. The people are
being punished for their rebellion, and God laments their destruction,
but justice is necessary because of their unfaithfulness (see also
10:11-12 - God calls Israel to repentance, comparing them to a land in
need of righteousness. He calls the people to cultivate righteousness
10:13-15 - Israel's sin is compared to a deep wound, and the people
will continue to be punished until they repent. God's judgment is
