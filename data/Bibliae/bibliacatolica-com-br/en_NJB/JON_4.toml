Notas de rodap√©:
4:1-3 - Jonah is furious at God's mercy toward Nineveh. This episode
reveals the human challenge of understanding divine grace, especially
when it extends to those we consider enemies or unworthy (see also
4:4-6 - God causes a plant to grow to provide shade for Jonah, and then
causes it to wither. The lesson is that we must trust in God's wisdom
and providence, who knows what is best for us and teaches us through
4:7-9 - God questions Jonah about his anger toward the dying plant.
This situation illustrates the human tendency to cling to the ephemeral
and to fail to understand God's compassion for the greater good of all
4:10-11 - God explains to Jonah that He has compassion on Nineveh, a
large city with over 120,000 people. This reinforces the idea that
God's mercy extends to everyone, without exception, and that God
Timothy 2:4).
