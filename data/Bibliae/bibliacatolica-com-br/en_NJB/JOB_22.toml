"1" = ''':sup:`1` Eliphaz of Teman spoke next. He said:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Can a human being contribute anything to God, when even someone
intelligent can benefit only himself?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Does Shaddai derive any benefit from your uprightness, or profit
from your blameless conduct?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Do you think he is punishing you for your piety and bringing you to
justice for that?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` No, for your great wickedness, more likely, for your unlimited sins!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` You have exacted unearned pledges from your brothers, stripped
people naked of their clothes,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` failed to give water to the thirsty and refused bread to the hungry;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` handed the land over to a strong man, for some favoured person to
move in,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` sent widows away empty-handed and crushed the arms of orphans.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` No wonder, then, if snares are all around you, and sudden terrors
make you afraid;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` if light has turned to darkness, so that you cannot see, and you
have been submerged in the flood.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Does not God live high in the heavens, does he not see the zenith
of the stars?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And because he is up there, you have said, 'What does God know? Can
he judge through the dark cloud?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The clouds, to him, are an impenetrable veil, as he goes his way on
the rim of the heavens.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And will you still follow the ancient trail trodden by the wicked,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` those who were borne off before their time, whose foundations were
swamped by a flood,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` for having said to God, 'Go away! What can Shaddai do to us?'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Yet he himself had filled their houses with good things, although
excluded from the plans of the wicked!
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` At such a spectacle, the upright rejoice, and the innocent deride
them:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` 'See how our enemies have been destroyed! See how their wealth has
perished in the flames!'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Well then! Make peace with him, be reconciled, and all your
happiness will be restored to you.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Welcome the teaching from his lips, and keep his words close to
your heart.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` If you return, humbled, to Shaddai and drive wickedness far from
your tent,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` if you lay your gold down on the dust, Ophir down among the pebbles
of the torrent,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Shaddai will be bars of gold to you and silver piled in heaps.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then Shaddai will be all your delight, and you will lift your face
to God.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` You will pray, and he will hear; and you will be able to fulfil
your vows.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Whatever you undertake will go well, and light will shine on your
path;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` for he casts down the pride of the arrogant, but he saves those of
downcast eyes.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He rescues anyone who is innocent; have your hands clean, and you
will be saved.

Notas de rodap√©:
22:1-5 - Eliphaz responds to Job, asserting that his suffering must be
a consequence of his sins. This approach reflects retributive theology,
which seeks to link suffering to punishment without considering the
18:30).
22:6-9 - Eliphaz accuses Job of being greedy and oppressive, suggesting
that his misery is a result of his own actions. This accusation
reflects a superficial understanding of God's justice and ignores the
2:13).
22:10-11 - Eliphaz mentions that Job is surrounded by snares,
reinforcing the idea that he is under divine judgment. This view limits
our understanding of God's action and ignores His love and mercy (see
22:12-14 - Eliphaz speaks of God's greatness, emphasizing that He is
omnipresent and omniscient. This statement reinforces the idea that Job
cannot escape divine judgment, but it also highlights God's majesty and
22:15-20 - Eliphaz invites Job to turn to God in repentance, implying
that restoration depends on his attitude. This approach downplays God's
grace and the complexity of the relationship between sin, repentance,
