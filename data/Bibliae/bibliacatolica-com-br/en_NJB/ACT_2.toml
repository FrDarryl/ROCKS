"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Pentecost day came round, they had all met together,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` when suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of a violent wind
which filled the entire house in which they were sitting;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and there appeared to them tongues as of fire; these separated and
came to rest on the head of each of them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak
different languages as the Spirit gave them power to express
themselves.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now there were devout men living in Jerusalem from every nation
under heaven,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and at this sound they all assembled, and each one was bewildered to
hear these men speaking his own language.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` They were amazed and astonished. 'Surely,' they said, 'all these men
speaking are Galileans?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` How does it happen that each of us hears them in his own native
language?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Parthians, Medes and Elamites; people from Mesopotamia, Judaea and
Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya round Cyrene;
residents of Rome-
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Jews and proselytes alike -- Cretans and Arabs, we hear them
preaching in our own language about the marvels of God.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Everyone was amazed and perplexed; they asked one another what it
all meant.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Some, however, laughed it off. 'They have been drinking too much
new wine,' they said.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then Peter stood up with the Eleven and addressed them in a loud
voice: 'Men of Judaea, and all you who live in Jerusalem, make no
mistake about this, but listen carefully to what I say.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` These men are not drunk, as you imagine; why, it is only the third
hour of the day.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` On the contrary, this is what the prophet was saying:
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` In the last days -- the Lord declares -- I shall pour out my Spirit
on all humanity. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy, your young
people shall see visions, your old people dream dreams.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Even on the slaves, men and women, shall I pour out my Spirit.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I will show portents in the sky above and signs on the earth below.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before
the day of the Lord comes, that great and terrible Day.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And all who call on the name of the Lord will be saved.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` 'Men of Israel, listen to what I am going to say: Jesus the
Nazarene was a man commended to you by God by the miracles and portents
and signs that God worked through him when he was among you, as you
know.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` This man, who was put into your power by the deliberate intention
and foreknowledge of God, you took and had crucified and killed by men
outside the Law.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But God raised him to life, freeing him from the pangs of Hades;
for it was impossible for him to be held in its power since,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` as David says of him: I kept the Lord before my sight always, for
with him at my right hand nothing can shake me.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So my heart rejoiced my tongue delighted; my body, too, will rest
secure,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` for you will not abandon me to Hades or allow your holy one to see
corruption.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` You have taught me the way of life, you will fill me with joy in
your presence.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` 'Brothers, no one can deny that the patriarch David himself is dead
and buried: his tomb is still with us.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But since he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn him an oath
to make one of his descendants succeed him on the throne,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` he spoke with foreknowledge about the resurrection of the Christ:
he is the one who was not abandoned to Hades, and whose body did not
see corruption.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` God raised this man Jesus to life, and of that we are all
witnesses.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Now raised to the heights by God's right hand, he has received from
the Father the Holy Spirit, who was promised, and what you see and hear
is the outpouring of that Spirit.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` For David himself never went up to heaven, but yet he said: The
Lord declared to my Lord, take your seat at my right hand,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` till I have made your enemies your footstool.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` 'For this reason the whole House of Israel can be certain that the
Lord and Christ whom God has made is this Jesus whom you crucified.'
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Hearing this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the
other apostles, 'What are we to do, brothers?'
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` 'You must repent,' Peter answered, 'and every one of you must be
baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,
and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The promise that was made is for you and your children, and for all
those who are far away, for all those whom the Lord our God is calling
to himself.'
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` He spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments, and he
urged them, 'Save yourselves from this perverse generation.'
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` They accepted what he said and were baptised. That very day about
three thousand were added to their number.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` These remained faithful to the teaching of the apostles, to the
brotherhood, to the breaking of bread and to the prayers.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And everyone was filled with awe; the apostles worked many signs
and miracles.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And all who shared the faith owned everything in common;
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` they sold their goods and possessions and distributed the proceeds
among themselves according to what each one needed.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Each day, with one heart, they regularly went to the Temple but met
in their houses for the breaking of bread; they shared their food
gladly and generously;
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` they praised God and were looked up to by everyone. Day by day the
Lord added to their community those destined to be saved.
