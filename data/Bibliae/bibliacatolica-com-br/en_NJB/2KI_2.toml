"2" = ''':sup:`2` and Elijah said to Elisha, 'You stay here, for Yahweh is only
sending me to Bethel.' But Elisha replied, 'As Yahweh lives and as you
yourself live, I will not leave you!' and they went down to Bethel.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The brotherhood of prophets living at Bethel came out to meet Elisha
and said, 'Do you know that Yahweh will carry your lord and master away
today?' 'Yes, I know,' he said, 'be quiet.'

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Elijah said, 'Elisha, you stay here, Yahweh is only sending me to
Jericho.' But he replied, 'As Yahweh lives and as you yourself live, I
will not leave you!' and they went on to Jericho.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` The brotherhood of prophets living at Jericho went up to Elisha and
said, 'Do you know that Yahweh will carry your lord and master away
today?' 'Yes, I know,' he said, 'be quiet.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Elijah said, 'Elisha, you stay here, Yahweh is only sending me to
the Jordan.' But he replied, 'As Yahweh lives and as you yourself live,
I will not leave you!' And they went on together.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Fifty of the brotherhood of prophets followed them, halting some
distance away as the two of them stood beside the Jordan.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water; and the
water divided to left and right, and the two of them crossed over
dry-shod.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, 'Make your request.
What can I do for you before I am snatched away from you?' Elisha
answered, 'Let me inherit a double share of your spirit.'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` 'Your request is difficult,' Elijah said. 'If you see me while I am
being snatched away from you, it will be as you ask; if not, it will
not be so.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now as they walked on, talking as they went, a chariot of fire
appeared and horses of fire coming between the two of them; and Elijah
went up to heaven in the whirlwind.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Elisha saw it, and shouted, 'My father! My father! Chariot of
Israel and its chargers!' Then he lost sight of him, and taking hold of
his own clothes he tore them in half.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He picked up Elijah's cloak which had fallen, and went back and
stood on the bank of the Jordan.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He took Elijah's cloak and struck the water. 'Where is Yahweh, the
God of Elijah?' he cried. As he struck the water it divided to right
and left, and Elisha crossed over.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The brotherhood of prophets saw him in the distance, and said, 'The
spirit of Elijah has come to rest on Elisha'; they went to meet him and
bowed to the ground before him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` 'Look,' they said, 'your servants have fifty strong men with them,
let them go and look for your master; the Spirit of Yahweh may have
taken him up and thrown him down on a mountain or into a valley.' 'Send
no one,' he replied.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But they so shamed him with their insistence that he consented. So
they sent fifty men who searched for three days without finding him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They then came back to Elisha who had stayed in Jericho; he said,
'Didn't I tell you not to go?'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The people of the city said to Elisha, 'The city is pleasant to
live in, as my lord indeed can see, but the water is foul and the
country suffers from miscarriages.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` 'Bring me a new bowl,' he said, 'and put some salt in it.' They
brought it to him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then he went to the source of the water, threw salt into it and
said, 'Yahweh says this, "I make this water wholesome: neither death
nor miscarriage shall come from it any more." '
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the water became wholesome, as it is today, exactly as Elisha
had said it would.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` From there he went up to Bethel, and while he was on the road, some
small boys came out of the town and jeered at him. 'Hurry up, baldy!'
they shouted. 'Come on up, baldy!'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` He turned round and looked at them; and he cursed them in the name
of Yahweh. And two bears came out of the forest and savaged forty-two
of the boys.

Notas de rodapé:
2:1-2 - Elijah knows his departure to heaven is near, and his disciple
Elisha insists on accompanying him. This reflects Elisha's loyalty and
and 1 Kings 19:19-21).
2:8-10 - Elijah parts the waters of the Jordan with his mantle,
demonstrating God's power working through him. Elisha requests a double
portion of Elijah's spirit, seeking to continue the work with the same
2:11-12 - Elijah is taken up to heaven in a whirlwind in a chariot of
fire, a unique event that reaffirms the sacredness of his mission and
2:13-14 - Elisha receives Elijah's mantle and performs his first
miracle by dividing the Jordan, showing that God's power is now upon
him. This confirms his succession as Israel's prophet (see also
2:23-25 - Young men mock Elisha, and he curses them in the name of the
Lord, resulting in his death by two she-bears. This incident teaches us
about the respect that should be given to God's servants and the
Chronicles 36:16).
