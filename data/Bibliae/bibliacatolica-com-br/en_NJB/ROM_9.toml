[9]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` This is the truth and I am speaking in Christ, without pretence, as
my conscience testifies for me in the Holy Spirit;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` there is great sorrow and unremitting agony in my heart:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I could pray that I myself might be accursed and cut off from
Christ, if this could benefit the brothers who are my own flesh and
blood.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They are Israelites; it was they who were adopted as children, the
glory was theirs and the covenants; to them were given the Law and the
worship of God and the promises.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` To them belong the fathers and out of them, so far as physical
descent is concerned, came Christ who is above all, God, blessed for
ever. Amen.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` It is not that God's promise has failed. Not all born Israelites
belong to Israel,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and not all the descendants of Abraham count as his children, for
Isaac is the one through whom your Name will be carried on.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` That is, it is not by being children through physical descent that
people become children of God; it is the children of the promise that
are counted as the heirs.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The actual words of the promise were: I shall come back to you at
this season, and Sarah will have a son.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Even more to the point is what was said to Rebecca when she was
pregnant by our ancestor, Isaac,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` before her children were born, so that neither had yet done
anything either good or bad, but in order that it should be God's
choice which prevailed
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` -not human merit, but his call -- she was told: the elder one will
serve the younger.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Or as scripture says elsewhere: I loved Jacob but hated Esau.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` What should we say, then? That God is unjust? Out of the question!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For speaking to Moses, he said: I am gracious to those to whom I am
gracious and I take pity on those on whom I take pity.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So it is not a matter of what any person wants or what any person
does, but only of God having mercy.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Scripture says to Pharaoh: I raised you up for this reason, to
display my power in you and to have my name talked of throughout the
world.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` In other words, if God wants to show mercy on someone, he does so,
and if he wants to harden someone's heart, he does so.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then you will ask me, 'How then can he ever blame anyone, since no
one can oppose his will?'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But you -- who do you think you, a human being, are, to answer back
to God? Something that was made, can it say to its maker: why did you
make me this shape?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` A potter surely has the right over his clay to make out of the same
lump either a pot for special use or one for ordinary use.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But suppose that God, although all the time he wanted to reveal his
retribution and demonstrate his power, has with great patience gone on
putting up with those who are the instruments of his retribution and
designed to be destroyed;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` so that he may make known the glorious riches ready for the people
who are the instruments of his faithful love and were long ago prepared
for that glory.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` We are that people, called by him not only out of the Jews but out
of the gentiles too.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Just as he says in the book of Hosea: I shall tell those who were
not my people, 'You are my people,' and I shall take pity on those on
whom I had no pity.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And in the very place where they were told, 'You are not my
people,' they will be told that they are 'children of the living God'.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And about Israel, this is what Isaiah cried out: Though the people
of Israel are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` for without hesitation or delay the Lord will execute his sentence
on the earth.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` As Isaiah foretold: Had the Lord Sabaoth not left us a few
survivors, we should be like Sodom, we should be the same as Gomorrah.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` What should we say, then? That the gentiles, although they were not
looking for saving justice, found it, and this was the saving justice
that comes of faith;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` while Israel, looking for saving justice by law-keeping, did not
succeed in fulfilling the Law.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And why? Because they were trying to find it in actions and not in
faith, and so they stumbled over the stumbling-stone-
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` as it says in scripture: Now I am laying in Zion a stumbling-stone,
a rock to trip people up; but he who relies on this will not be brought
to disgrace.
