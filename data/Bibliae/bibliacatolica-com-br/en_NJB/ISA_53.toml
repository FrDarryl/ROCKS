"1" = ''':sup:`1` Who has given credence to what we have heard? And who has seen in it
a revelation of Yahweh's arm?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Like a sapling he grew up before him, like a root in arid ground. He
had no form or charm to attract us, no beauty to win our hearts;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he was despised, the lowest of men, a man of sorrows, familiar with
suffering, one from whom, as it were, we averted our gaze, despised,
for whom we had no regard.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yet ours were the sufferings he was bearing, ours the sorrows he was
carrying, while we thought of him as someone being punished and struck
with affliction by God;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` whereas he was being wounded for our rebellions, crushed because of
our guilt; the punishment reconciling us fell on him, and we have been
healed by his bruises.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` We had all gone astray like sheep, each taking his own way, and
Yahweh brought the acts of rebellion of all of us to bear on him.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Ill-treated and afflicted, he never opened his mouth, like a lamb
led to the slaughter-house, like a sheep dumb before its shearers he
never opened his mouth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Forcibly, after sentence, he was taken. Which of his contemporaries
was concerned at his having been cut off from the land of the living,
at his having been struck dead for his people's rebellion?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He was given a grave with the wicked, and his tomb is with the rich,
although he had done no violence, had spoken no deceit.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It was Yahweh's good pleasure to crush him with pain; if he gives
his life as a sin offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his
life, and through him Yahweh's good pleasure will be done.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` After the ordeal he has endured, he will see the light and be
content. By his knowledge, the upright one, my servant will justify
many by taking their guilt on himself.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Hence I shall give him a portion with the many, and he will share
the booty with the mighty, for having exposed himself to death and for
being counted as one of the rebellious, whereas he was bearing the sin
of many and interceding for the rebellious.
