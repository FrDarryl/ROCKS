this month each man must take an animal from the flock for his family:
one animal for each household.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` If the household is too small for the animal, he must join with his
neighbour nearest to his house, depending on the number of persons.
When you choose the animal, you will take into account what each can
eat.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` It must be an animal without blemish, a male one year old; you may
choose it either from the sheep or from the goats.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` You must keep it till the fourteenth day of the month when the whole
assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter it at twilight.
'''

'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You must not leave any of it over till the morning: whatever is
left till morning you must burn.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` This is how you must eat it: with a belt round your waist, your
sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. You must eat it
hurriedly: it is a Passover in Yahweh's honour.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` That night, I shall go through Egypt and strike down all the
first-born in Egypt, man and beast alike, and shall execute justice on
all the gods of Egypt, I, Yahweh!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. When
I see the blood I shall pass over you, and you will escape the
destructive plague when I strike Egypt.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` This day must be commemorated by you, and you must keep it as a
feast in Yahweh's honour. You must keep it as a feast-day for all
generations; this is a decree for all time.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "For seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you
must clean the leaven out of your houses, for anyone who eats leavened
bread from the first to the seventh day must be outlawed from Israel.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` On the first day you must hold a sacred assembly, and on the
seventh day a sacred assembly. On those days no work may be done; you
will prepare only what each requires to eat.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` You must keep the feast of Unleavened Bread because it was on that
same day that I brought your armies out of Egypt. You will keep that
day, generation after generation; this is a decree for all time.

the evening of the twenty-first day, you must eat unleavened bread.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For seven days there may be no leaven in your houses, since anyone,
either stranger or citizen of the country, who eats leavened bread will
be outlawed from the community of Israel.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` You will eat nothing with leaven in it; wherever you live, you will
eat unleavened bread." '
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, 'Go and
choose a lamb or kid for your families, and kill the Passover victim.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the
basin, and with the blood from the basin touch the lintel and both
door-posts; then let none of you venture out of the house till morning.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then, when Yahweh goes through Egypt to strike it, and sees the
blood on the lintel and on both door-posts, he will pass over the door
and not allow the Destroyer to enter your homes and strike.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` You will observe this as a decree binding you and your children for
all time,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and when you have entered the country which Yahweh will give you,
as he has promised, you will observe this ritual.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when your children ask you, "What does this ritual mean?"
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` you will tell them, "It is the Passover sacrifice in honour of
Yahweh who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, and
struck Egypt but spared our houses." ' And the people bowed in worship.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The Israelites then went away and did as Yahweh had ordered Moses
and Aaron.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And at midnight Yahweh struck down all the first-born in Egypt from
the first-born of Pharaoh, heir to his throne, to the first-born of the
prisoner in the dungeon, and the first-born of all the livestock.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up in the
night, and there was great wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house
without its dead.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` It was still dark when Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said,
'Up, leave my subjects, you and the Israelites! Go and worship Yahweh
as you have asked!
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And take your flocks and herds as you have asked, and go! And bless
me too!'
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The Egyptians urged the people on and hurried them out of the
country because, they said, 'Otherwise we shall all be dead.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` So the people carried off their dough still unleavened, their bowls
wrapped in their cloaks, on their shoulders.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The Israelites did as Moses had told them and asked the Egyptians
for silver and golden jewellery, and clothing.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Yahweh made the Egyptians so much impressed with the people that
they gave them what they asked. So they despoiled the Egyptians.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` The Israelites left Rameses for Succoth, about six hundred thousand
on the march-men, that is, not counting their families.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` A mixed crowd of people went with them, and flocks and herds,
quantities of livestock.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And with the dough which they had brought from Egypt they baked
unleavened cakes, because the dough had not risen, since they had been
driven out of Egypt without time to linger or to prepare food for
themselves.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` The time that the Israelites spent in Egypt was four hundred and
thirty years.

"42" = ''':sup:`42` The night when Yahweh kept vigil to bring them out of Egypt must be
kept as a vigil in honour of Yahweh by all Israelites, for all
generations.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, 'This is the ritual for the
Passover: no alien may eat it,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` but any slave bought for money may eat it, once you have
circumcised him.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` No stranger and no hired servant may eat it.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` It must be eaten in one house alone; you will not take any of the
meat out of the house; nor may you break any of its bones.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` 'The whole community of Israel must keep it.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Should a stranger residing with you wish to keep the Passover in
honour of Yahweh, all the males of his household must be circumcised:
he will then be allowed to keep it and will count as a citizen of the
country. But no uncircumcised person may eat it.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` The same law will apply to the citizen and the stranger resident
among you.'
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` The Israelites all did as Yahweh had ordered Moses and Aaron,

their armies.
