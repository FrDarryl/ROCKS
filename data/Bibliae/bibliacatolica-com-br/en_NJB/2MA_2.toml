"1" = ''':sup:`1` 'It is on record that the prophet Jeremiah ordered the deportees to
take the fire, as we have described,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and how, having given them the Law, the prophet warned the deportees
never to forget the Lord's precepts, nor to let their thoughts be
tempted by the sight of gold and silver statues or the finery adorning
them.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Among other similar admonitions, he urged them not to let the Law
depart from their hearts.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` 'The same document also describes how the prophet, warned by an
oracle, gave orders for the tent and the ark to go with him, when he
set out for the mountain which Moses had climbed to survey God's
heritage.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` On his arrival, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling, into which he put
the tent, the ark and the altar of incense, afterwards blocking up the
entrance.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Some of his companions went back later to mark out the path but were
unable to find it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Jeremiah learned this, he reproached them, "The place is to
remain unknown", he said, "until God gathers his people together again
and shows them his mercy.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the Lord will bring these things once more to light, and the
glory of the Lord will be seen, and so will the cloud, as it was
revealed in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the holy
place might be gloriously hallowed."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` 'It was also recorded how Solomon in his wisdom offered the
sacrifice of the dedication and completion of the sanctuary.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` As Moses had prayed to the Lord and fire had come down from heaven
and burned up the sacrifice, so Solomon also prayed, and the fire from
above consumed the burnt offerings.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Moses had said, "Because the sacrifice for sin had not been eaten,
it was burnt instead."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Solomon similarly observed the eight-day festival.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` 'In addition to the above, it was also recorded, both in these
writings and in the Memoirs of Nehemiah, how Nehemiah founded a library
and made a collection of the books dealing with the kings and the
prophets, the writings of David and the letters of the kings on the
subject of offerings.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Similarly, Judas made a complete collection of the books dispersed
in the late war, and these we still have.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` God, who has saved his whole people, conferring heritage, kingdom,
priesthood and sanctification on all of us,

"18" = ''':sup:`18` as he has promised in the Law, will surely, as our hope is in him,
be swift to show us mercy and gather us together from everywhere under
heaven to the holy place, since he has rescued us from great evils and
has purified it.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The story of Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, the purification of
the great Temple, the dedication of the altar,

"20" = ''':sup:`20` together with the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes and his son
Eupator,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` and the celestial manifestations that came to hearten the brave
champions of Judaism, so that, few though they were, they pillaged the
whole country, routed the barbarian hordes,

"22" = ''':sup:`22` recovered the sanctuary renowned the whole world over, liberated
the city and re-established the laws by then all but abolished, the
Lord showing his favour by all his gracious help to them-
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` all this, already related in five books by Jason of Cyrene, we
shall attempt to condense into a single work.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Considering the spate of figures and the difficulty encountered,
because of the mass of material, by those who wish to immerse
themselves in historical records,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` we have aimed at providing diversion for those who merely want
something to read, a saving of labour for those who enjoy committing
things to memory, and profit for each and all.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For us who have undertaken the drudgery of this abridgement, it has
been no easy task but a matter of sweat and midnight oil,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` comparable to the exacting task of someone organising a banquet,
whose aim is to satisfy a variety of tastes. Nevertheless, for the sake
of rendering a general service, we remain glad to endure this drudgery,

"28" = ''':sup:`28` leaving accuracy of detail to the historian, and concentrating our
effort on tracing the outlines in this condensed version.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Just as the architect of a new house is responsible for the
construction as a whole, while the man undertaking the ceramic painting
has to take into consideration only the decorative requirements, so, I
think, it is with us.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` To make the subject his own, to explore its by-ways, to be
meticulous about details, is the business of the original historian,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` but the person making the adaptation must be allowed to aim at
conciseness of expression and to forgo any exhaustive treatment of his
subject.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So now let us begin our narrative, without adding any more to what
has been said above; there would be no sense in expanding the preface
to the history and curtailing the history itself.
