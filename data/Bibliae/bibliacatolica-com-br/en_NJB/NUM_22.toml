Moab, beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and Moab was terrified of the people, because there were so many of
them. Moab was afraid of the Israelites;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` he said to the elders of Midian, 'This horde will soon have cropped
everything round us as closely as an ox crops grass in the
countryside.' Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at the time.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, at Pethor on the
River, in the territory of the Amawites, saying, 'Look, a people coming
from Egypt has overrun the whole countryside; they have halted at my
very door.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I beg you come and curse this people for me, for they are stronger
than I am. We may then be able to defeat them and drive them out of the
country. For this I know: anyone you bless is blessed, anyone you curse
is accursed.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian set out, taking the fee
for the divination with them. They found Balaam and gave him Balak's
message.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He said to them, 'Stay the night here, and I will answer as Yahweh
directs me.' So the chiefs of Moab stayed with Balaam.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` God came to Balaam and said, 'Who are these men staying with you?'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Balaam said to God, 'Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent me
this message,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "Look, a people coming from Egypt has overrun the whole
countryside. Come now and curse them for me; I may then be able to
defeat them and drive them out." '
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` God said to Balaam, 'You are not to go with them. You are not to
curse the people, for they are blessed.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the morning Balaam got up and said to the chiefs sent by Balak,
'Go back to your country, for Yahweh will not let me go with you.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So the chiefs of Moab got up, went back to Balak and said, 'Balaam
refuses to come with us.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And again Balak sent chiefs, more numerous and more renowned than
the first.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` They came to Balaam and said, 'A message from Balak son of Zippor,
"Now do not refuse to come to me.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I will load you with honours and do whatever you say. I beg you
come and curse this people for me." '
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` In reply, Balaam said to Balak's envoys, 'Even if Balak gave me his
house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the order of
Yahweh my God in anything, great or small.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Now please stay the night here yourselves, and I will learn what
else Yahweh has to tell me.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` God came to Balaam during the night and said to him, 'Have not
these men come to summon you? Get up, go with them, but do only what I
tell you to do.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Balaam got up and saddled his donkey and set out with the chiefs of
Moab.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` His going kindled Yahweh's anger, and the angel of Yahweh took his
stand on the road to bar his way. Balaam was riding his donkey and his
two servants were with him.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with a
drawn sword in his hand, and she turned off the road into the open
country. Balaam then struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The angel of Yahweh then went and stood on a narrow path among the
vineyards, with a wall to the right and a wall to the left.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh and scraped against the wall,
scraping Balaam's foot against it, so he struck her again.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The angel of Yahweh then moved and stood in a place so narrow that
there was no room to pass either to right or left.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam.
Balaam flew into a rage and struck the donkey with his stick.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Yahweh then gave the donkey the power to talk, and she said to
Balaam, 'What harm have I done you, for you to strike me three times
like this?'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Balaam answered the donkey, 'Because you have been making a fool of
me! If I had been carrying a sword, I should have killed you by now.'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The donkey said to Balaam, 'Am I not your donkey, and have I not
been your mount all your life? Have I ever behaved like this with you
before?' 'No,' he replied.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Yahweh then opened Balaam's eyes and he saw the angel of Yahweh
standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed his
head and threw himself on his face.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And the angel of Yahweh said to him, 'Why did you strike your
donkey three times like that? I myself had come to bar your way; while
I am here your road is blocked.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The donkey saw me and turned aside because of me three times. You
are lucky she did turn aside, or I should have killed you by now,
though I would have spared her.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, 'I have sinned. I did not know
you were standing in the road to stop me. But if what I am doing
displeases you, I will go home again.'
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, 'Go with these men, but say
only what I tell you to say.' So Balaam went on with the chiefs sent by
Balak.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Balak learned that Balaam was coming and went out to meet him, in
the direction of Ar in Moab, at the Arnon frontier on the country's
furthest boundary.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Balak said to Balaam, 'Did I not send messengers to summon you? Why
did you not come to me? Did you think, perhaps, I could confer no
honours on you?'
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Balaam said to Balak, 'I have come to you after all. I suppose you
know I cannot say anything on my own? The words God puts into my mouth
are what I shall say.'
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Balaam set out with Balak. They came to Kiriath-Huzoth.

Notas de rodap√©:
22:1-4 - Moab fears Israel because of their victories over Sihon and
Og. This fear leads Balak, king of Moab, to seek a curse against
Israel. The narrative illustrates how God's favor on His people strikes
2:9-11).
22:5-6 - Balak sends messengers to Balaam, asking him to curse Israel.
This demonstrates his belief in the efficacy of prophetic words in
determining a nation's fate, though the ultimate power belongs to God
22:12 - God commands Balaam not to curse Israel, for they are blessed.
This verse reaffirms God's promise of blessing to Abraham and his
descendants, showing that no one can undo what God blesses (see also
22:21-23 - On the road to Moab, the angel of the Lord blocks Balaam's
path. Balaam's spiritual blindness, in contrast to the donkey's vision,
22:31-35 - Balaam finally sees the angel of the Lord and repents. God's
message is clear: Balaam can only speak what God commands. This
highlights God's sovereignty over the words and actions of the prophets
