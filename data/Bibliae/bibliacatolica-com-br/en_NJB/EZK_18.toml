cause to repeat this proverb in Israel.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Look, all life belongs to me; the father's life and the son's life,
both alike belong to me. The one who has sinned is the one to die.

idols of the House of Israel, does not defile his neighbour's wife or

good among his people, will most certainly die in his guilt.

the son has been law-abiding and upright, has kept all my laws and
followed them, most certainly he will live.

Lord Yahweh -- and not prefer to see him renounce his wickedness and

dies because of the wrong which he himself has done.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Similarly, when the wicked abandons wickedness to become
law-abiding and upright, he saves his own life.

certainly live: he will not die.

Notas de rodap√©:
18:1-4 - God declares that each person will be held accountable for
their own actions. This principle of individual responsibility
contrasts with the idea of inherited guilt and teaches that everyone
has the opportunity to repent and change (see also Deuteronomy 24:16
18:5-9 - The righteous who live according to God's righteousness are
blessed. This reaffirms that God's righteousness is based on personal
choices and not on family inheritance or social status (see also
18:10-13 - The condemnation of the wicked son shows that God judges
personal righteousness, not that of others. The practice of wickedness
18:14-17 - The wicked man's change of heart, who repents and turns to
righteousness, is accepted by God. This highlights God's mercy and the
18:30-32 - God calls the people of Israel to repentance. Spiritual
death can be avoided through transformation, for God does not delight
in the death of the wicked, but desires all to be saved (see also
