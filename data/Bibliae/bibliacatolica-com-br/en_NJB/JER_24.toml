Notas de rodap√©:
24:1-2 - Jeremiah sees a vision of two baskets of figs before the
temple. The baskets symbolize the destiny of the people of Judah: one
for exile and the other for restoration. The choice between good and
evil is a matter of obedience to God (see also Deuteronomy 30:19-20 and
24:3-7 - The good figs represent the exiles who will be restored, while
the rotten figs represent those who will remain in Jerusalem and suffer
destruction. The promise of restoration for the righteous, even in
24:8-10 - The rotten figs represent the people who will remain in Judah
and be destroyed by sword, famine, and pestilence. Choosing to follow
evil leads to condemnation, while obedience to God brings restoration
