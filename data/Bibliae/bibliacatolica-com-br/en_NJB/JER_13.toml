round my waist.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` 'Take the waistcloth that you have bought and are wearing round your
waist. Up, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a hole in the
rock.'

"5" = ''':sup:`5` So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as Yahweh had ordered me.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` A long time later, Yahweh said to me, 'Up, go to the Euphrates and
fetch the waistcloth I ordered you to hide there.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So I went to the Euphrates, and I searched, and I took the
waistcloth from the place where I had hidden it. And there was the
waistcloth ruined, no use for anything.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` 'Yahweh says this, "In the same way I shall ruin the pride of Judah,
the immense pride of Jerusalem.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` This evil people, these people who refuse to listen to my words,
who follow their own stubborn inclinations and run after other gods,
serving and worshipping them -- this people will become like this
waistcloth, no good for anything.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` For just as a waistcloth clings to a man's waist, so I made the
whole House of Israel and the whole House of Judah cling to me, Yahweh

have not listened."

you, can you do right, being so accustomed to wrong?

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-11 - The parable of the filthy belt is used to illustrate the
corruption of the people of Judah. God compares Israel to a belt,
which, when used incorrectly, becomes useless. Disobedience to the Lord
13:12-14 - The prophecy that the wine jars will be broken symbolizes
Judah's impending destruction. The people's pride and confidence in
13:15-17 - The call to repentance is made to avoid destruction. God
warns the people not to harden their hearts, for divine judgment is
approaching, and repentance is the only way to avoid calamity (see also
13:18-23 - The humiliation of Judah and the judgment upon the nation
are foretold, for the people have turned away from God. The analogy of
the woman and the girdle illustrates the nearness of the judgment that
will be visited upon Judah (see also 2 Kings 24:10-16 and Lamentations
1:18).
13:24-27 - The people will be scattered among the nations, and their
idolatries will be punished. God speaks against the people's pride,
announcing their dispersion and punishment for their sin, but with the
7:34).
