"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the tenth year, on the twelfth day of the tenth month, the word
of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` 'Son of man, turn towards Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against
him and against the whole of Egypt.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Speak and say, "The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against you,
Pharaoh king of Egypt- the great crocodile wallowing in his Niles who
thought: My Nile is mine, I made it.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I shall put hooks through your jaws, make your Nile fish stick to
your scales, and pull you out of your Niles with all your Nile fish
sticking to your scales.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I shall drop you in the desert, with all your Nile fish. You will
fall in the wilds and not be taken up or buried. I shall give you as
food to the wild animals and the birds of heaven,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, for
they have given no more support than a reed to the House of Israel.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Wherever they grasped you, you broke in their hands and cut their
hands all over. Whenever they leaned on you, you broke, making all
their limbs give way.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` "So, the Lord Yahweh says this: I shall send the sword against you
to denude you of human and animal.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Egypt will become a desolate waste, and they will know that I am
Yahweh. Because he thought: The Nile is mine, I made it,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` very well, I am against you and your Niles. I shall make Egypt a
waste and a desolation, from Migdol to Syene and beyond to the
frontiers of Ethiopia.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` No human foot will pass through it, no animal foot will pass
through it. For forty years it will remain uninhabited.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I shall make Egypt the most desolate of countries; for forty years
its cities will be the most desolate of wasted cities. And I shall
scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the
countries.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The Lord Yahweh, however, says this: After forty years have passed,
I shall gather the Egyptians back from the nations where they were
dispersed.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I shall bring the Egyptian captives back and re-install them in the
land of Pathros, in the country of their origin. There they will
constitute a modest kingdom.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Egypt will be the most modest of kingdoms and no longer dominate
other nations; for I shall reduce it, so that it will not rule other
nations ever again.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` It will no longer be anything for the House of Israel to trust in,
but will be a reminder of the guilt which lay in turning to it for
help. And they will know that I am Lord Yahweh." '
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` In the twenty-seventh year, on the first day of the first month,
the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` 'Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken his army in a
great expedition against Tyre. Their heads have all gone bald, their
shoulders are all chafed, but even so he has derived no profit, either
for himself or for his army, from the expedition mounted against Tyre.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Since this is so, the Lord Yahweh says this, "Look, I shall hand
Egypt over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He will carry off its
riches, loot it, put it to the sack; that will be the wages for his
army.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` As wages for the trouble he has taken, I am giving him Egypt
instead (for they have been working for me)-declares the Lord Yahweh.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "That day, I shall raise up a new stock for the House of Israel and
allow you to open your mouth among them. And they will know that I am
Yahweh." '
