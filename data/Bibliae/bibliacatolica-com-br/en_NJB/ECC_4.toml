"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then again, I contemplate all the oppression that is committed under
the sun. Take for instance the tears of the oppressed. No one to
comfort them! The power their oppressors wield. No one to comfort them!

"2" = ''':sup:`2` So, rather than the living who still have lives to live, I
congratulate the dead who have already met death;

"3" = ''':sup:`3` happier than both of these are those who are yet unborn and have not
seen the evil things that are done under the sun.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` I see that all effort and all achievement spring from mutual
jealousy. This too is futility and chasing after the wind.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` The fool folds his arms and eats his own flesh away.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` a person is quite alone -- no child, no brother; and yet there is no
end to his efforts, his eyes can never have their fill of riches. For

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Better a youngster poor and wise than a monarch old and silly who
