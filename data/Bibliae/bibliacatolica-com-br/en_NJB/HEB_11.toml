the existence of realities that are unseen.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` It is for their faith that our ancestors are acknowledged.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It is by faith that we understand that the ages were created by a
word from God, so that from the invisible the visible world came to be.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` It was because of his faith that Abel offered God a better sacrifice
than Cain, and for that he was acknowledged as upright when God himself
made acknowledgement of his offerings. Though he is dead, he still
speaks by faith.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` It was because of his faith that Enoch was taken up and did not
experience death: he was no more, because God took him; because before
his assumption he was acknowledged to have pleased God.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Now it is impossible to please God without faith, since anyone who
comes to him must believe that he exists and rewards those who seek
him.
'''

the promise was faithful to it.

the mark of death on him, descendants as numerous as the stars of
heaven and the grains of sand on the seashore which cannot be counted.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` All these died in faith, before receiving any of the things that

them, recognising that they were only strangers and nomads on earth.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` People who use such terms about themselves make it quite plain that
they are in search of a homeland.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If they had meant the country they came from, they would have had
the opportunity to return to it;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` but in fact they were longing for a better homeland, their heavenly
homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, since
he has founded the city for them.

Esau for the still distant future.

bowed in reverence, as he leant on his staff.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` It was by faith that, when he was about to die, Joseph mentioned
the Exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions about his own
remains.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` It was by faith that Moses, when he was born, was kept hidden by
his parents for three months; because they saw that he was a fine
child; they were not afraid of the royal edict.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` It was by faith that, when he was grown up, Moses refused to be
known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and chose to be ill-treated in company with God's people rather
than to enjoy the transitory pleasures of sin.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` He considered that the humiliations offered to the Anointed were
something more precious than all the treasures of Egypt, because he had
his eyes fixed on the reward.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` It was by faith that he left Egypt without fear of the king's
anger; he held to his purpose like someone who could see the Invisible.

of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, or of David, Samuel and the
prophets.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` These were men who through faith conquered kingdoms, did what was
upright and earned the promises. They could keep a lion's mouth shut,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` put out blazing fires and emerge unscathed from battle. They were
weak people who were given strength to be brave in war and drive back
foreign invaders.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Some returned to their wives from the dead by resurrection; and
others submitted to torture, refusing release so that they would rise
again to a better life.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Some had to bear being pilloried and flogged, or even chained up in
prison.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` They were stoned, or sawn in half, or killed by the sword; they
were homeless, and wore only the skins of sheep and goats; they were in
want and hardship, and maltreated.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` They were too good for the world and they wandered in deserts and
mountains and in caves and ravines.
