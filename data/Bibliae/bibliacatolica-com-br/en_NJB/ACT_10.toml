"1" = ''':sup:`1` One of the centurions of the Italica cohort stationed in Caesarea
was called Cornelius.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He and the whole of his household were devout and God-fearing, and
he gave generously to Jewish causes and prayed constantly to God.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` One day at about the ninth hour he had a vision in which he
distinctly saw the angel of God come into his house and call out to
him, 'Cornelius!'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He stared at the vision in terror and exclaimed, 'What is it, Lord?'
The angel answered, 'Your prayers and charitable gifts have been
accepted by God.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now you must send some men to Jaffa and fetch a man called Simon,
known as Peter,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` who is lodging with Simon the tanner whose house is by the sea.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When the angel who said this had gone, Cornelius called two of the
slaves and a devout soldier of his staff,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` told them all that had happened, and sent them off to Jaffa.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Next day, while they were still on their journey and had only a
short distance to go before reaching the town, Peter went to the
housetop at about the sixth hour to say his prayers.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He felt hungry and was looking forward to his meal, but before it
was ready he fell into a trance
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and saw heaven thrown open and something like a big sheet being let
down to earth by its four corners;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` it contained every kind of animal, reptile and bird.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` A voice then said to him, 'Now, Peter, kill and eat!'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But Peter answered, 'Certainly not, Lord; I have never yet eaten
anything profane or unclean.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Again, a second time, the voice spoke to him, 'What God has made
clean, you have no right to call profane.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` This was repeated three times, and then suddenly the container was
drawn up to heaven again.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Peter was still at a loss over the meaning of the vision he had
seen, when the men sent by Cornelius arrived. They had asked where
Simon's house was and they were now standing at the door,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` calling out to know if the Simon known as Peter was lodging there.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` While Peter's mind was still on the vision, the Spirit told him,
'Look! Some men have come to see you.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Hurry down, and do not hesitate to return with them; it was I who
told them to come.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Peter went down and said to them, 'I am the man you are looking
for; why have you come?'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` They said, 'The centurion Cornelius, who is an upright and
God-fearing man, highly regarded by the entire Jewish people, was told
by God through a holy angel to send for you and bring you to his house
and to listen to what you have to say.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So Peter asked them in and gave them lodging. Next day, he was
ready to go off with them, accompanied by some of the brothers from
Jaffa.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` They reached Caesarea the following day, and Cornelius was waiting
for them. He had asked his relations and close friends to be there,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and as Peter reached the house Cornelius went out to meet him, fell
at his feet and did him reverence.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Peter helped him up. 'Stand up,' he said, ' after all, I am
only a man!'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Talking together they went in to meet all the people assembled
there,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and Peter said to them, 'You know it is forbidden for Jews to mix
with people of another race and visit them; but God has made it clear
to me that I must not call anyone profane or unclean.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` That is why I made no objection to coming when I was sent for; but
I should like to know exactly why you sent for me.'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Cornelius replied, 'At this time three days ago I was in my house
saying the prayers for the ninth hour, when I suddenly saw a man in
front of me in shining robes.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He said, "Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your charitable
gifts have not been forgotten by God;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` so now you must send to Jaffa and fetch Simon known as Peter who is
lodging in the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come.
Here we all are, assembled in front of you to hear all the instructions
God has given you.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then Peter addressed them, 'I now really understand', he said,
'that God has no favourites,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` but that anybody of any nationality who fears him and does what is
right is acceptable to him.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` 'God sent his word to the people of Israel, and it was to them that
the good news of peace was brought by Jesus Christ -- he is the Lord of
all.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` You know what happened all over Judaea, how Jesus of Nazareth began
in Galilee, after John had been preaching baptism.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` God had anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and
because God was with him, Jesus went about doing good and curing all
who had fallen into the power of the devil.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Now we are witnesses to everything he did throughout the
countryside of Judaea and in Jerusalem itself: and they killed him by
hanging him on a tree,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` yet on the third day God raised him to life and allowed him to be
seen,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` not by the whole people but only by certain witnesses that God had
chosen beforehand. Now we are those witnesses -- we have eaten and
drunk with him after his resurrection from the dead-
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and he has ordered us to proclaim this to his people and to bear
witness that God has appointed him to judge everyone, alive or dead.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` It is to him that all the prophets bear this witness: that all who
believe in Jesus will have their sins forgiven through his name.'
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` While Peter was still speaking the Holy Spirit came down on all the
listeners.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Jewish believers who had accompanied Peter were all astonished that
the gift of the Holy Spirit should be poured out on gentiles too,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` since they could hear them speaking strange languages and
proclaiming the greatness of God. Peter himself then said,
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` 'Could anyone refuse the water of baptism to these people, now they
have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?'
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` He then gave orders for them to be baptised in the name of Jesus
Christ. Afterwards they begged him to stay on for some days.
