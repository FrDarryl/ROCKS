reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He followed the example of the kings of Israel as the House of Ahab
were doing, he having married one of Ahab's daughters; and he did what

'''

his chariots. Under cover of dark, he and his chariot commanders broke
through the Edomites surrounding him.
'''

of the bowels;

"19" = ''':sup:`19` in due time, after about two years, his bowels protruded as a
