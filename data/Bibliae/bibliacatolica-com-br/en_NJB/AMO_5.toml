"1" = ''':sup:`1` Listen to this word which I utter against you, it is a dirge, House
of Israel:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` She has fallen down, never to rise again, the virgin Israel. There
she lies on her own soil, with no one to lift her up.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For Lord Yahweh says this: The town which used to put a thousand in
the field will be left with a hundred, and the one which used to put a
hundred will be left with ten, to fight for the House of Israel.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For Yahweh says this to the House of Israel: Seek me out and you
will survive,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` but do not seek out Bethel, do not go to Gilgal, do not journey to
Beersheba, for Gilgal is going into captivity and Bethel will be
brought to nothing.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Seek out Yahweh and you will survive or else he will sweep like fire
upon the House of Joseph and burn it down, with no one at Bethel able
to quench the flames.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` They turn justice into wormwood and throw uprightness to the ground.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He it is who makes the Pleiades and Orion, who turns shadow dark as
death into morning and day to darkest night, who summons the waters of
the sea and pours them over the surface of the land. Yahweh is his
name.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He brings destruction on the strong and ruin comes on the fortress.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` They hate the man who teaches justice at the city gate and detest
anyone who declares the truth.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For trampling on the poor man and for extorting levies on his
wheat: although you have built houses of dressed stone, you will not
live in them; although you have planted pleasant vineyards, you will
not drink wine from them:
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` for I know how many your crimes are and how outrageous your sins,
you oppressors of the upright, who hold people to ransom and thrust the
poor aside at the gates.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` That is why anyone prudent keeps silent now, since the time is
evil.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Seek good and not evil so that you may survive, and Yahweh, God
Sabaoth, be with you as you claim he is.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Hate evil, love good, let justice reign at the city gate: it may be
that Yahweh, God Sabaoth, will take pity on the remnant of Joseph.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Therefore Yahweh Sabaoth, the Lord, says this: In every public
square there will be lamentation, in every street they will cry out,
'Alas! Alas!' The farmer will be called on to mourn, the professional
mourners to lament,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and there will be wailing in every vineyard, for I mean to pass
through among you, Yahweh says.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Disaster for you who long for the Day of Yahweh! What will the Day
of Yahweh mean for you? It will mean darkness, not light,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` as when someone runs away from a lion, only to meet a bear; he goes
into his house and puts his hand on the wall, only for a snake to bite
him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Will not the Day of Yahweh be darkness, not light, totally dark,
without a ray of light?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I hate, I scorn your festivals, I take no pleasure in your solemn
assemblies.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When you bring me burnt offerings . . . your oblations, I do not
accept them and I do not look at your communion sacrifices of fat
cattle.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Spare me the din of your chanting, let me hear none of your
strumming on lyres,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but let justice flow like water, and uprightness like a
never-failing stream!
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Did you bring me sacrifices and oblations those forty years in the
desert, House of Israel?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now you must shoulder Sakkuth your king and the star of your God,
Kaiwan, those idols you made for yourselves;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` for I am about to drive you into captivity beyond Damascus, Yahweh
says -- God Sabaoth is his name.

that they may live. Seeking good is closely linked to repentance and
