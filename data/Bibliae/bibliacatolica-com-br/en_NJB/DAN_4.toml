"1" = ''':sup:`1` 'I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living comfortably in my house, prosperously
in my palace.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I had a dream; it appalled me. Dread assailed me as I lay in bed;
the visions that passed through my head tormented me.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So I decreed that all the sages of Babylon be summoned to explain to
me what the dream meant.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Magicians, soothsayers, Chaldaeans and exorcists came, and I told
them what I had dreamt, but they could not interpret it for me.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Daniel, renamed Belteshazzar after my own god, and in whom the
spirit of the holy gods resides, then came into my presence. I told him
my dream:

"6" = ''':sup:`6` ' "Belteshazzar, chief of magicians," I said, "I know that the
spirit of the holy gods resides in you and that no mystery puts you at
a loss. This is the dream I have had; tell me what it means.

these: I saw a tree in the middle of the world; it was very tall.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` The tree grew taller and stronger, until its top reached the sky and
it could be seen from the very ends of the earth.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Its foliage was beautiful, its fruit abundant, in it was food for
all. For the wild animals it provided shade, the birds of heaven nested
in its branches, all living creatures found their food on it.

Next, a Watchful One, a holy one, came down from heaven.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` At the top of his voice he shouted: Cut the tree down, lop off its
branches, strip off its leaves, throw away its fruit; let the animals
flee from its shelter and the birds from its branches.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, bound with hoops
of iron and bronze, in the grass of the countryside. Let it be drenched
by the dew of heaven and have its lot with the animals, eating grass!

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Let it cease to have a human heart, and be given the heart of a
beast, and seven times shall pass over him!
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Such is the sentence proclaimed by the Watchers, the verdict
announced by the holy ones- so that every living thing may learn that
the Most High rules over human sovereignty; he confers it on whom he
pleases, and raises the lowest of humankind.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` ' "This was the dream I had-I, Nebuchadnezzar the king. Now it is
for you, Belteshazzar, to pronounce on its meaning, since not one of
the sages in my kingdom has been able to interpret it for me; you,
however, can do so, since the spirit of the holy gods resides in you."'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Daniel, known as Belteshazzar, was confused for a time and upset.
The king said, 'Belteshazzar, do not be upset at the dream and its
meaning.' Belteshazzar answered, 'My lord, may the dream apply to those
who hate you, and its meaning to your foes!

all in it, providing shade for the wild animals, with the birds of
heaven nesting in its branches:

"19" = ''':sup:`19` that tree is yourself, Your Majesty, for you have grown great and
strong; your stature is now so great that it reaches the sky, and your
empire extends to the ends of the earth.

from heaven and saying, "Cut the tree down and destroy it, but leave

its lot with the wild animals until seven times have passed over":

"21" = ''':sup:`21` the meaning of this, Your Majesty, the verdict of the Most High
passed on my lord the king, is this:

the wild animals, you will feed on grass, as oxen do, you will be
drenched by the dew of heaven; seven times will pass over you until you
have learnt that the Most High rules over human sovereignty and confers
it on whom he pleases.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` 'And the order, "Leave the stump and roots of the tree", means that
your kingdom will be kept for you until you come to understand that
Heaven rules all.

break with your sins, break with your crimes by showing mercy to the

"26" = ''':sup:`26` At the end of twelve months, while strolling on the roof of the
royal palace in Babylon,

royal residence, by the force of my might and for the majesty of my
glory?'

heaven: 'Of you, King Nebuchadnezzar, it is decreed: the empire has
been taken from you,

human sovereignty and gives it to whom he pleases.'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The words were immediately fulfilled: Nebuchadnezzar was driven
from human society and ate grass as oxen do; he was drenched by the dew
of heaven; his hair grew like an eagle's feathers, and his nails became
like a bird's talons.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` 'When the time was over, I, Nebuchad- nezzar, raised my eyes to
heaven: my reason returned. And I blessed the Most High, praising and
glorifying him who lives for ever, for his empire is an everlasting
empire, his kingship endures, age after age.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` All who dwell on earth count for nothing; as he thinks fit, he
disposes the army of heaven and those who dwell on earth. No one can
arrest his hand or ask him, "What have you done?"

"33" = ''':sup:`33` 'At that moment my reason returned and, for the honour of my royal
state, my glory and splendour returned too. My counsellors and noblemen
acclaimed me; I was restored to my throne, and to my past greatness
even more was added.

"34" = ''':sup:`34` And now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, extol and glorify the King of
heaven, all of whose deeds are true, all of whose ways are right, and
who can humble those who walk in pride.'

4:4-18 - The king has a dream about a great tree being cut down, and

4:19-27 - Daniel interprets the dream and advises the king to repent to

for humility before God, who alone is sovereign over all the kingdoms
4:28-33 - The fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy occurs when
Nebuchadnezzar is temporarily removed from his position, living like an
animal until he acknowledges God's sovereignty. This event serves as a
warning against human pride and self-sufficiency (see also
4:34-37 - Nebuchadnezzar repents and praises God for His sovereignty.
His restoration is a lesson in the importance of recognizing God's
