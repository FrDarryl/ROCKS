more than that,' said the man of God.

Lebanon ran over the thistle and squashed it.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "Look at me, the conqueror of Edom," you say, and now aspire to
even greater glory. But stay where you belong! Why challenge disaster,
to your own and Judah's ruin?'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Amaziah would not listen, for this was an act of God to deliver

Notas de rodap√©:
25:1-4 - Amaziah, son of Joash, begins his reign and seeks to do what
is right, but not with a sincere heart. This shows that the appearance
of righteousness does not replace the need for a heart truly committed
25:5-10 - Amaziah hires mercenary soldiers, but is warned by a prophet
not to trust them. This warning highlights the importance of depending

their gods. This transition highlights the danger of allowing temporary
victories to lead to idolatry, reinforcing the need for continued
10:14).
25:17-24 - Amaziah confronts Joash, king of Israel, leading to a
disastrous battle. The dispute between the kingdoms illustrates the
consequences of a proud heart and a lack of respect for God's word (see
25:25-28 - Amaziah is defeated and murdered, ending his life in
unfaithfulness. This narrative serves as a warning about the cost of
straying and the importance of remaining faithful to the Lord to the
