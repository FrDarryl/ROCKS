"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Micaiah daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. When war broke out between Abijah
and Jeroboam,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Abijah took the field with an army of four hundred thousand picked
warriors, while Jeroboam took the field against him with eight hundred
thousand picked warriors.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Abijah took position on Mount Zemaraim, in the highlands of Ephraim.
'Jeroboam and all Israel,' he cried, 'listen to me!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Do you not know that Yahweh, God of Israel, has given eternal
sovereignty of Israel to David and his sons by an inviolable covenant?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, the slave of Solomon son of David, rose
in revolt against his master.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Worthless men, scoundrels, rallied to him, proving too strong for
Rehoboam son of Solomon, as Rehoboam was then inexperienced and timid
and unable to resist them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And now you propose to resist Yahweh's sovereignty as exercised by
the sons of David because there is a great number of you and you have
the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Have you not driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron and
the Levites, to make priests of your own like the peoples of foreign
countries? Anyone who comes with a bull and seven rams to get himself
consecrated can become priest of these gods that are no gods.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But for our part, our God is Yahweh, and we have not abandoned him;
our priests are sons of Aaron who minister to Yahweh, and those who
serve are Levites;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` morning after morning, evening after evening, they present burnt
offerings and perfumed incense to Yahweh, they put the bread of
permanent offering on the clean table and nightly light the lamps on
the golden lamp-stand; for we keep the decree of Yahweh our God,
although you have abandoned him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` See how God is with us, at our head, and his priests with trumpets
to sound the alarm against you! Israelites, do not make war on Yahweh,
God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now Jeroboam had sent a party round to ambush them from the rear;
thus the main force confronted Judah and the ambush lay to their rear.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when Judah looked round, they found themselves being attacked
from front and rear. They called on Yahweh, the priests sounded the
trumpets,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and the men of Judah raised the war cry and, as they raised the
cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So the Israelites fled before Judah, because God had given Judah
the upper hand,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and Abijah and his army inflicted a great slaughter on them: five
hundred thousand of Israel's picked men fell, killed.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So the Israelites were humbled on that occasion, while the Judaeans
won, since they had relied on Yahweh, God of their ancestors.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Abijah pursued Jeroboam, taking from him the towns of Bethel with
its dependencies, Jeshanah with its dependencies and Ephron with its
dependencies,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` nor did Jeroboam regain strength during Abijah's lifetime.
Eventually Yahweh struck him and he died,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but Abijah grew stronger than ever; he married fourteen wives and
fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The rest of the history of Abijah, his conduct and his sayings, are
recorded in the midrash of the prophet Iddo.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When Abijah fell asleep with his ancestors, he was buried in the
City of David; his son Asa succeeded him. In his time the country was
at peace for ten years.

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-3 - Abijah becomes king of Judah and confronts Jeroboam,
highlighting the importance of faithful leadership and the need to
remain loyal to God. His rise is a reminder of God's sovereignty in the
history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah (see also 1 Kings 15:1-2
13:4-12 - Abijah declares that the kingdom of Judah is in covenant with
God and that Jeroboam is in rebellion. This emphasizes the importance
of recognizing and defending divine truth, as well as the
responsibility of leaders to guide their people in accordance with
13:13-18 - The battle between Judah and Israel illustrates the victory
that comes from faithfulness to God. Abijah and his army are
strengthened by the Lord, showing that strength is not in numbers, but
13:19-22 - Abijah's success in his military campaign underscores God's
blessing on those who remain faithful. His life also reminds us that
success should not be measured solely by earthly achievements, but by
128:1-2).
