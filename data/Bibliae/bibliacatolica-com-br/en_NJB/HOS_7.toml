"1" = ''':sup:`1` Whenever I would heal Israel, I am confronted by the guilt of
Ephraim and the evil-doings of Samaria; for deceit is their principle
of behaviour; the thief breaks into the house, marauders raid in the
open;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and they never pause to consider that I remember all their wicked
deeds; and now their own deeds hem them in and stare me in the face.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They amuse the king with their wickedness and the chief men with
their lies.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They are all adulterers, hot as an oven which the baker need not
stoke from the time he has kneaded the dough until it rises.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` At the holiday for our king, the ministers become inflamed with
wine, while he accepts the homage of people
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` who laugh at him. Their hearts are like an oven as they plot, all
night their passion slumbers, then in the morning it bursts into flame;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` yes, all of them as hot as ovens, they consume their rulers. All
their kings have fallen thus, not one of them has ever called on me.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Ephraim mixes with the nations. Ephraim is a half-baked cake.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Foreigners have eaten his strength away but he is unconscious of it;
even his hair is turning grey but he is unconscious of it.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` (Israel's arrogance is his own accuser; but they do not come back
to Yahweh their God or seek him, despite all this.)
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Ephraim is like a silly, witless pigeon calling on Egypt, turning
to Assyria.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Wherever they turn, I shall spread my net over them, I shall bring
them down like the birds of the sky, I shall punish them for their
perversity.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Woe to them for having fled from me! Ruin seize them for having
wronged me! I have rescued them again and again and they have only told
lies about me.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Theirs is no heartfelt cry to me when they lament on their beds;
when they gash themselves over the grain and new wine, they are still
rebelling against me.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Though I supported and gave strength to their arms, they plan how
to hurt me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` They turn to what does not exist, they are like a faulty bow. Their
leaders will fall by the sword because of their arrogant talk; how they
will be laughed at in Egypt!

Notas de rodap√©:
7:1-3 - The Lord laments Israel's persistence in sin, despite His
warnings. Their unfaithfulness is clear, and the consequences are
inevitable. Israel's heart has become hardened, turning even further
7:4-7 - The people of Israel are compared to a furnace, boiling over
and consuming itself. This metaphor represents the internal destruction
caused by sin, where the leadership and the people as a whole are
7:8-10 - Israel mixed with other nations, compromising its identity and
faith. Israel's unfaithfulness is symbolized by the mixing of wheat and
rye, which hinders spiritual growth and God's blessing on the people
7:11-16 - Israel fails to acknowledge its sinful condition and
continues to seek alliances with other nations rather than trusting in
God. This pride and lack of repentance result in its destruction (see
07:16 - God laments Israel's fall, for they have turned away from His
guidance and sought their own ways. Unfaithfulness is the cause of
Israel's suffering, and their failure to return to God makes the
1:21).
