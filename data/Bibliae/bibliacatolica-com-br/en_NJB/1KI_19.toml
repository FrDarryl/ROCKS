Judah, where he left his servant.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` He himself went on into the desert, a day's journey, and sitting
under a furze bush wished he were dead. 'Yahweh,' he said, 'I have had
enough. Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.'

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then he lay down and went to sleep. Then all of a sudden an angel
touched him and said, 'Get up and eat.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He looked round, and there at his head was a scone baked on hot
stones, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the angel of Yahweh came back a second time and touched him and
said, 'Get up and eat, or the journey will be too long for you.'

"8" = ''':sup:`8` So he got up and ate and drank, and strengthened by that food he
walked for forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, God's
mountain.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` There he went into a cave and spent the night there. Then the word
of Yahweh came to him saying, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He replied, 'I am full of jealous zeal for Yahweh Sabaoth, because
the Israelites have abandoned your covenant, have torn down your altars
and put your prophets to the sword. I am the only one left, and now
they want to kill me.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then he was told, 'Go out and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.'
For at that moment Yahweh was going by. A mighty hurricane split the
mountains and shattered the rocks before Yahweh. But Yahweh was not in
the hurricane. And after the hurricane, an earthquake. But Yahweh was
not in the earthquake.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And after the earthquake, fire. But Yahweh was not in the fire. And

"15" = ''':sup:`15` 'Go,' Yahweh said, 'go back by the same way to the desert of
Damascus. You must go and anoint Hazael as king of Aram.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` You must anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king of Israel, and anoint
Elisha son of Shaphat, of Abel-Meholah, as prophet to succeed you.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Anyone who escapes the sword of Hazael will be put to death by
Jehu; and anyone who escapes the sword of Jehu will be put to death by
Elisha.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` But I shall spare seven thousand in Israel; all the knees that have
not bent before Baal, all the mouths that have not kissed him.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Leaving there, he came on Elisha son of Shaphat as he was ploughing
behind twelve yoke of oxen, he himself being with the twelfth. Elijah
passed near to him and threw his cloak over him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Elisha left his oxen and ran after Elijah. 'Let me kiss my father
and mother, then I will follow you,' he said. Elijah answered, 'Go, go
back; for have I done anything to you?'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Elisha turned away, took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He
used the oxen's tackle for cooking the meat, which he gave the people
to eat. He then rose and, following Elijah, became his servant.
