a piece of wood frailer than the vessel that bears him.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Agreed, the ship is the product of a craving for gain, its building
embodies the wisdom of the shipwright;

pathway even through the sea, and a safe way over the waves,

so people entrust their lives to the smallest piece of wood, cross the
waves on a raft, yet are kept safe and sound.

hope of the world took refuge on a raft and, steered by your hand,
preserved the seed of a new generation for the ages to come.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` but accursed the man-made idol, yes, it and its maker, he for having
made it, and it because, though perishable, it has been called god.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` For God holds the godless and his godlessness in equal hatred;

"10" = ''':sup:`10` both work and workman will alike be punished.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Hence even the idols of the nations will have a visitation since,
in God's creation, they have become an abomination, a scandal for human
souls, a snare for the feet of the foolish.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The idea of making idols was the origin of fornication, their
discovery corrupted life.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` They did not exist at the beginning, they will not exist for ever;

child so soon carried off, and now pays divine honours to what
yesterday was only a corpse, handing on mysteries and ceremonies to his
people;

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Rulers were the ones who ordered that statues should be worshipped:
people who could not honour them in person, because they lived too far
away, would have a portrait made of their distant countenance, to have
an image that they could see of the king whom they honoured; meaning,
by such zeal, to flatter the absent as if he were present.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` And this became a snare for life: that people, whether enslaved by
misfortune or by tyranny, should have conferred the ineffable Name on
sticks and stones.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` It is not enough, however, for them to have such misconceptions
about God; for, living in the fierce warfare of ignorance, they call
these terrible evils peace.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` With their child-murdering rites, their occult mysteries, or their
frenzied orgies with outlandish customs,

"24" = ''':sup:`24` they no longer retain any purity in their lives or their marriages,
one treacherously murdering another or wronging him by adultery.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Everywhere a welter of blood and murder, theft and fraud,
corruption, treachery, riot, perjury,

"26" = ''':sup:`26` disturbance of decent people, forgetfulness of favours, pollution
of souls, sins against nature, disorder in marriage, adultery and
debauchery.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For the worship of idols with no name is the beginning, cause, and
end of every evil.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` For these people either carry their merrymaking to the point of
frenzy, or they prophesy what is not true, or they live wicked lives,
or they perjure themselves without hesitation;

"29" = ''':sup:`29` since they put their trust in lifeless idols they do not reckon
their false oaths can harm them.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But they will be justly punished for this double crime: for
degrading the concept of God by adhering to idols; and for wickedly
perjuring themselves in contempt for what is holy.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` For it is not the power of the things by which they swear but the
punishment reserved for sinners that always follows the offences of
wicked people.
