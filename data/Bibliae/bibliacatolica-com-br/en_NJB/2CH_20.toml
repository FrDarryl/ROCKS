'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` said, 'Yahweh, God of our ancestors, are you not God in heaven, and

'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` saying, "If disaster, war, flood, pestilence or famine befall us,

rescue us."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` 'Now see, the Ammonites and Moabites and the people of Mount Seir,
whom you would not allow Israel to invade when they came out of Egypt
-- on the contrary, Israel avoided them, and did not destroy them-
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` see how they reward us, by coming to drive us out of your
possession which you allotted to us!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Our God, will you not pass sentence on them, since we are helpless
against this vast horde about to attack us? Because we do not know what
to do, we look to you.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` All Judah, including their families, wives and children, were
standing before Yahweh,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` when, in the middle of the assembly, the spirit of Yahweh came on

Mattaniah the Levite, a member of the clan of Asaph,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` who then cried, 'Listen, all Judah and you citizens of Jerusalem,
and you, King Jehoshaphat! Yahweh says this to you, "Do not be afraid,
do not be daunted by this vast horde, for the war is not your affair
but God's.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Go down against them tomorrow; they are coming up by the Slope of
Ziz and you will encounter them at the end of the ravine near the
desert of Jeruel.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` You will not need to fight in this battle. Take up your position,

and Jerusalem, be fearless, be dauntless; march out against them
tomorrow and Yahweh will be with you." '
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Jehoshaphat bowed his head, his face to the ground, and all Judah

to praise Yahweh, God of Israel, at the top of their voices.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Early next morning they prepared to set out for the desert of
Tekoa. As they were setting out, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, 'Listen
to me, Judah and you citizens of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God
and you will be secure; believe in his prophets and you will be
successful.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then, having conferred with the people, he appointed singers who
were to praise Yahweh and go out ahead of the army in sacred vestments,
singing Praise Yahweh, for his faithful love endures for ever!
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The moment they began their shouts of praise, Yahweh sprang an
ambush on the Ammonites, Moabites and the people of Mount Seir who were
invading Judah, and that was the end of them,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` for the Ammonites and Moabites turned on the people of Mount Seir,
and put them under the curse of destruction and then, having finished
off the people of Seir, set to work slaughtering one another.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When Judah reached the point overlooking the desert and looked
towards the horde, there were nothing but corpses lying on the ground;
no one escaped.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When Jehoshaphat arrived to take the booty, they found quantities
of cattle and innumerable possessions, clothes and valuables, which
they seized for themselves; it was impossible to carry it, and it took
them three days to collect it.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, where
they blessed Yahweh -- hence the place was given the name Valley of
Beracah, which it still has today.

Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat at their head as Yahweh had given them cause
to rejoice over their enemies.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` To the sound of lyre, harp and trumpet they came to Jerusalem, to
the Temple of Yahweh,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and a panic from Yahweh seized all the neighbouring kings when they
heard how Yahweh had fought against the enemies of Israel.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And henceforth Jehoshaphat's reign was undisturbed, for his God
gave him peace all round.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old
when he came to the throne and he reigned for twenty-five years in
Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He followed the example of his father Asa undeviatingly, doing what
Yahweh regards as right.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The high places, however, were not abolished; the people had still
not set their hearts on the God of their ancestors.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The rest of the history of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, is
written down in the records of Jehu son of Hanani, which are quoted in
the Book of the Kings of Israel.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Afterwards, Jehoshaphat formed a partnership with Ahaziah king of
Israel, which was very wrong of him.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He joined him in building some ships to go to Tarshish; they built
them at Ezion-Geber.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah then prophesied against

Yahweh has wrecked your efforts.' The ships were wrecked and were never
fit to sail for Tarshish.
