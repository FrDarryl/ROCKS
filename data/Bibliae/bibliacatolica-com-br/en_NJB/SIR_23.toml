my heart, to be merciless to my errors and not let my sins go
unchecked,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` for fear my errors should multiply and my sins then abound and I
fall before my adversaries, and my enemy gloat over me?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Lord, father and God of my life, do not let my eyes be proud,

'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Do not get into the habit of swearing, do not make a habit of naming
the Holy One;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` for just as a slave who is constantly overseen will never be
without bruises, so someone who is always swearing and uttering the
Name will not be exempt from sin.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` A man for ever swearing is full of iniquity, and the scourge will
not depart from his house. If he offends, his sin will be on him, if he

will not be treated as innocent, for his house will be filled with
calamities.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` One way of talking is like death, let it not be found in the

this involves sinful words.
'''

of it as long as he lives.

'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` desire, blazing like a furnace, will not die down until it has been
sated- the man who lusts after members of his own family is not going
to stop until he is quite burnt out; every food is sweet to the
promiscuous, and he will not desist until he dies;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and the man who sins against the marriage bed and says to himself,
'Who can see me? There is darkness all round me, the walls hide me, no
one can see me, why should I worry? The Most High will not remember my
sins.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` What he fears are human eyes, he does not realise that the eyes of

commandments.
