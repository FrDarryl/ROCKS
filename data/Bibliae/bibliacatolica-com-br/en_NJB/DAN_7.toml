"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream
and visions that passed through his head as he lay in bed. He wrote the
dream down, and this is how the narrative began:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Daniel said, 'I have been seeing visions in the night. I saw that
the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` four great beasts emerged from the sea, each different from the
others.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The first was like a lion with eagle's wings and, as I looked, its
wings were torn off, and it was lifted off the ground and set standing
on its feet like a human; and it was given a human heart.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And there before me was a second beast, like a bear, rearing up on
one side, with three ribs in its mouth, between its teeth. "Up!" came
the command. "Eat quantities of flesh!"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` After this I looked; and there before me was another beast, like a
leopard, and with four bird's wings on its flanks; it had four heads
and was granted authority.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Next, in the visions of the night, I saw another vision: there
before me was a fourth beast, fearful, terrifying, very strong; it had
great iron teeth, and it ate its victims, crushed them, and trampled
their remains underfoot. It was different from the previous beasts and
had ten horns.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` 'While I was looking at these horns, I saw another horn sprouting
among them, a little one; three of the original horns were pulled out
by the roots to make way for it; and in this horn I saw eyes like human
eyes, and a mouth full of boasting.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` While I was watching, thrones were set in place and one most
venerable took his seat. His robe was white as snow, the hair of his
head as pure as wool. His throne was a blaze of flames, its wheels were
a burning fire.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` A stream of fire poured out, issuing from his presence. A thousand
thousand waited on him, ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him. The court was in session and the books lay open.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` 'I went on watching: then, because of the noise made by the
boastings of the horn, as I watched, the beast was put to death, and
its body destroyed and committed to the flames.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The other beasts were deprived of their empire, but received a
lease of life for a season and a time.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I was gazing into the visions of the night, when I saw, coming on
the clouds of heaven, as it were a son of man. He came to the One most
venerable and was led into his presence.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` On him was conferred rule, honour and kingship, and all peoples,
nations and languages became his servants. His rule is an everlasting
rule which will never pass away, and his kingship will never come to an
end.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` 'I, Daniel, was deeply disturbed and the visions that passed
through my head alarmed me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So I approached one of those who were standing by and asked him
about all this. And in reply he revealed to me what these things meant.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` "These four great beasts are four kings who will rise up from the
earth.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Those who receive royal power are the holy ones of the Most High,
and kingship will be theirs for ever, for ever and ever."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then I asked about the fourth beast, different from all the rest,
very terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze claws; it ate its victims,
crushed them, and trampled their remains underfoot;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and about the ten horns on its head -- and why the other horn
sprouted and the three original horns fell, and why this horn had eyes
and a mouth full of boasting, and why it looked more impressive than
its fellows.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` This was the horn I had watched making war on the holy ones and
proving the stronger,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` until the coming of the One most venerable who gave judgement in
favour of the holy ones of the Most High, when the time came for the
holy ones to assume kingship.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` This is what he said: "The fourth beast is to be a fourth kingdom
on earth, different from all other kingdoms. It will devour the whole
world, trample it underfoot and crush it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As for the ten horns: from this kingdom will rise ten kings, and
another after them; this one will be different from the previous ones
and will bring down three kings;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` he will insult the Most High, and torment the holy ones of the Most
High. He will plan to alter the seasons and the Law, and the Saints
will be handed over to him for a time, two times, and half a time.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But the court will sit, and he will be stripped of his royal
authority which will be finally destroyed and reduced to nothing.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And kingship and rule and the splendours of all the kingdoms under
heaven will be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High,
whose royal power is an eternal power, whom every empire will serve and
obey."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` 'Here the narrative ends. 'I, Daniel, was greatly disturbed in
mind, and I grew pale; but I kept these things to myself.'
