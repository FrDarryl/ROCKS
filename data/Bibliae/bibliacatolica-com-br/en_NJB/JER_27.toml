Notas de rodap√©:
27:1-7 - Jeremiah receives a divine command to submit to the rule of

nations can save Judah. He emphasizes that resistance to Nebuchadnezzar
is futile and that peace will come only when the people submit to God's
27:12-15 - Jeremiah urges King Zedekiah and the people to submit to
Babylon to avoid destruction. Failure to submit to Nebuchadnezzar would
result in suffering and loss, and true peace would come through
27:16-22 - Jeremiah warns against false prophets who promise the
immediate restoration of the temple furnishings. The message is clear:
the temple and sacred objects cannot be restored without first
Peter 2:1-3).
27:23:00 - Jeremiah's prophecy about the future of the temple vessels
