"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now I want you to realise, brothers, that the circumstances of my

'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` My chains in Christ have become well known not only to all the
Praetorium, but to everybody else,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and so most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence from
my chains and are getting more and more daring in announcing the
Message without any fear.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` It is true that some of them are preaching Christ out of malice and
rivalry; but there are many as well whose intentions are good;

defence of the gospel.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` I am caught in this dilemma: I want to be gone and to be with
Christ, and this is by far the stronger desire-

need.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` This much I know for certain, that I shall stay and stand by you
all, to encourage your advance and your joy in the faith,

"26" = ''':sup:`26` so that my return to be among you may increase to overflowing your
pride in Jesus Christ on my account.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But you must always behave in a way that is worthy of the gospel of
Christ, so that whether I come to you and see for myself or whether I
only hear all about you from a distance, I shall find that you are
standing firm and united in spirit, battling, as a team with a single
aim, for the faith of the gospel.
