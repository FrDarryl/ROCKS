"1" = ''':sup:`1` Rachel, seeing that she herself gave Jacob no children, became
jealous of her sister. And she said to Jacob, 'Give me children, or I
shall die!'
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` This made Jacob angry with Rachel, and he retorted, 'Am I in the
position of God, who has denied you motherhood?'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So she said, 'Here is my slave-girl, Bilhah. Sleep with her and let
her give birth on my knees; through her, then, I too shall have
children!'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So she gave him her slave-girl Bilhah as concubine. Jacob slept with
her,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son by Jacob.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then Rachel said, 'God has done me justice; yes, he has heard my
prayer and given me a son.' Accordingly she named him Dan.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Again Rachel's slave-girl Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a
second son by Jacob.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then Rachel said, 'I have fought a fateful battle with my sister,
and I have won!' So she named him Naphtali.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Now Leah, seeing that she had ceased to bear children, took her
slave-girl Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as concubine.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So Leah's slave-girl Zilpah gave birth to a son by Jacob.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then Leah exclaimed, 'What good fortune!' So she named him Gad.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Leah's slave-girl Zilpah gave birth to a second son by Jacob.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Leah said, 'What blessedness! Women will call me blessed!' So
she named him Asher.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` One day, at the time of the wheat harvest, Reuben found some
mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Rachel said
to Leah, 'Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Leah replied, 'Is it not enough to have taken my husband, without
your taking my son's mandrakes as well?' So Rachel said, 'Very well, he
can sleep with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes.'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When Jacob came back from the fields that night, Leah went out to
meet him and said, 'You must come to me, for I have hired you at the
price of my son's mandrakes.' So he slept with her that night.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` God heard Leah, and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son by
Jacob.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then Leah said, 'God has given me my reward for giving my
slave-girl to my husband.' So she named him Issachar.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Again Leah conceived and gave birth to a sixth son by Jacob,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and said, 'God has given me a fine gift; now my husband will bring
me presents, for I have borne him six sons.' So she named him Zebulun.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then God remembered Rachel; he heard her and opened her womb.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` She conceived and gave birth to a son, and said, 'God has taken
away my disgrace!'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` She named him Joseph, saying, 'May Yahweh add another son for me!'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban,
'Release me and let me go home to my own country.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Give me my wives for whom I have worked for you, and my children,
and let me go. You are well aware how long I have worked for you.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Laban replied, 'If I have done what pleases you . . . I have learnt
by divination that Yahweh has blessed me because of you.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So name your wages,' he added, 'and I will pay.'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He replied, 'You know how hard I have worked for you, and how your
stock has fared in my charge.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The little you had before I came has increased enormously, and
Yahweh has blessed you wherever I have been. When am I to provide for
my own household too?'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Laban said, 'How much am I to pay you?' Jacob replied, 'You need
not pay me anything. I shall change my mind and go on tending your
flock, if you do this one thing for me.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` 'Go through your entire flock today and remove every black animal
among the sheep, and every speckled or spotted one among the goats.
These will be my wages,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and my uprightness will answer for me later: when you come to check
my wages, every goat I have that is not speckled or spotted, and every
sheep that is not black will count as stolen by me.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Laban replied, 'Good, just as you say.'
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` That same day he removed the striped and speckled he-goats and all
the spotted and speckled she-goats, every one that had white on it, and
all the black sheep, and entrusted these to his sons.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then he put a three days' journey between himself and Jacob, while
Jacob grazed the rest of Laban's flock.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Jacob then got fresh shoots from poplar, almond and plane trees,
and peeled them in white strips, laying bare the white part of the
shoots.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` He set up the shoots he had peeled in front of the animals, in the
troughs, in the water-holes where the animals came to drink. Since they
mated when they came to drink,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` the goats thus mated in front of the shoots and so the goats
produced striped, spotted and speckled young.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` The ewes, on the other hand, Jacob kept apart and made these face
whatever was striped or black in Laban's flock. Thus he built up droves
of his own which he did not put with Laban's flocks.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Furthermore, whenever the sturdier animals were mating, Jacob put
the shoots where the animals could see them, in the troughs, so that
they would mate in front of the shoots.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` But when the animals were feeble, he did not put them there; so
Laban got the feeble, and Jacob the sturdy.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Thus the man grew extremely rich, and came to own large flocks, men
and women slaves, camels and donkeys.
