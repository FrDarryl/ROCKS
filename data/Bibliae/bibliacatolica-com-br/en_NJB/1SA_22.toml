brothers and his father's whole family heard this and joined him there.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` All those in distress, all those in debt, all those who had a
grievance, gathered round him and he became their leader. There were

going to give you all fields and vineyards and make all of you
commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` that you all conspire against me? No one warned me when my son made
a pact with the son of Jesse; none of you felt sorry for me or warned
me when my son incited my servant to become my enemy, as he is now.'

the priests of Yahweh.
