Notas de rodap√©:
42:1-6 - The remnant of Judah seeks Jeremiah's guidance, committing to
obey God's word. Seeking God's guidance, even after so much
destruction, symbolizes the search for restoration and understanding in
42:7-22 - God responds through Jeremiah, telling the people to stay in
Judah and not flee to Egypt. This message reveals the principle of
trusting God, even when the apparent solution seems to be fleeing from
42:13-17 - God warns of the consequences of going to Egypt, where the
people will face the sword, famine, and pestilence. Rejecting God's
counsel leads to destruction, demonstrating that disobeying God in
difficult times results in greater affliction (see also Deuteronomy
42:18-22 - God reaffirms that those who remain in Judah will be
preserved, while those who go to Egypt will face condemnation. This
shows that, even in extreme situations, obedience to God is the key to
7:24-27).
