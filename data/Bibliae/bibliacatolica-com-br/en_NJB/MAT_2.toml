"1" = ''':sup:`1` After Jesus had been born at Bethlehem in Judaea during the reign of
King Herod, suddenly some wise men came to Jerusalem from the east
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` asking, 'Where is the infant king of the Jews? We saw his star as it
rose and have come to do him homage.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When King Herod heard this he was perturbed, and so was the whole of
Jerusalem.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He called together all the chief priests and the scribes of the
people, and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They told him, 'At Bethlehem in Judaea, for this is what the prophet
wrote:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are by no means the
least among the leaders of Judah, for from you will come a leader who
will shepherd my people Israel.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Herod summoned the wise men to see him privately. He asked them
the exact date on which the star had appeared
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and sent them on to Bethlehem with the words, 'Go and find out all
about the child, and when you have found him, let me know, so that I
too may go and do him homage.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Having listened to what the king had to say, they set out. And
suddenly the star they had seen rising went forward and halted over the
place where the child was.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The sight of the star filled them with delight,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and going into the house they saw the child with his mother Mary,
and falling to their knees they did him homage. Then, opening their
treasures, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But they were given a warning in a dream not to go back to Herod,
and returned to their own country by a different way.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` After they had left, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to
Joseph in a dream and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with
you, and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because
Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him,
left that night for Egypt,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` where he stayed until Herod was dead. This was to fulfil what the
Lord had spoken through the prophet: I called my son out of Egypt.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Herod was furious on realising that he had been fooled by the wise
men, and in Bethlehem and its surrounding district he had all the male
children killed who were two years old or less, reckoning by the date
he had been careful to ask the wise men.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then were fulfilled the words spoken through the prophet Jeremiah:
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` A voice is heard in Ramah, lamenting and weeping bitterly: it is
Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted because they
are no more.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` After Herod's death, suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared in a
dream to Joseph in Egypt
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother with you and go
back to the land of Israel, for those who wanted to kill the child are
dead.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him,
went back to the land of Israel.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But when he learnt that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as
ruler of Judaea he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream
he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` There he settled in a town called Nazareth. In this way the words
spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled: He will be called a
Nazarene.
