"3" = ''':sup:`3` We too were all among them once, living only by our natural
inclinations, obeying the demands of human self-indulgence and our own
whim; our nature made us no less liable to God's retribution than the
rest of the world.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` But God, being rich in faithful love, through the great love with
which he loved us,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` even when we were dead in our sins, brought us to life with Christ

Christ Jesus.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` do not forget, I say, that you were at that time separate from
Christ and excluded from membership of Israel, aliens with no part in
the covenants of the Promise, limited to this world, without hope and

"13" = ''':sup:`13` But now in Christ Jesus, you that used to be so far off have been
brought close, by the blood of Christ.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` For he is the peace between us, and has made the two into one
entity and broken down the barrier which used to keep them apart, by
destroying in his own person the hostility,
