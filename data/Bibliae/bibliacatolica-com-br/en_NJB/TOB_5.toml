everything you have told me.

nor I him. What token am I to give him for him to believe me and hand
the silver over to me? And besides, I do not know what roads to take
for this journey into Media.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then Tobit answered his son Tobias, 'Each of us set his signature to
a note which I cut in two, so that each could keep half of it. I took
one piece, and put the other with the silver. To think it was twenty
years ago I left this silver in his keeping! And now, my child, find a
trustworthy travelling companion-- we shall pay him for his time until
you arrive back-- and then go and collect the silver from Gabael.'

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Tobias went out to look for a man who knew the way to go with him to
Media. Outside he found Raphael the angel standing facing him, though
he did not guess he was an angel of God.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` He said, 'Where do you come from, friend?' The angel replied, 'I am
one of your brother Israelites; I have come to these parts to look for
work.' Tobias asked, 'Do you know the road to Media?'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The other replied, 'Certainly I do, I have been there many times; I
have knowledge and experience of all the ways. I have often been to
Media and stayed with Gabael one of our kinsmen who lives at Rhages in
Media. It usually takes two full days to get from Ecbatana to Rhages;
Rhages lies in the mountains, and Ecbatana is in the middle of the
plain.'

need you to come with me; I shall pay you for your time.'

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Tobias went in and told his father that he had found one of their
brother Israelites. And the father said, 'Fetch him in; I want to find
out about his family and tribe. I must see if he is going to be a
reliable companion for you, my child.' So Tobias went out and called
him,'Friend,' he said,'my father wants you,'

"10" = ''':sup:`10` The angel came into the house; Tobit greeted him, and the other
answered, wishing him happiness in plenty. Tobit replied, 'Can I ever
be happy again? I am a blind man; I no longer see the light of heaven;
I am sunk in darkness like the dead who see the light no more. I am a
man buried alive; I hear people speak but cannot see them.' The angel
said,' Take comfort; before long God will heal you. Take comfort.'
Tobit said, 'My son Tobias wishes to go to Media. Will you join him as
his guide? Brother, I will pay you.' He replied,' I am willing to go
with him; I know all the ways; I have often been to Media, I have
crossed all its plains and mountains, and I know all its roads.'

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Tobit said, 'Brother, what family and what tribe do you belong to?
Will you tell me, brother?'

"12" = ''':sup:`12` 'What does my tribe matter to you?' the angel said. Tobit said, 'I
want to be quite sure whose son you are and what your name is.'

"13" = ''':sup:`13` The angel said, 'I am Azarias, son of the great Ananias, one of
your kinsmen.'

"14" = ''':sup:`14` 'Welcome and greetings, brother! Do not be offended at my wanting
to know the name of your family; I find you are my kinsman of a good
and honourable line. I know Ananias and Nathan, the two sons of the
great Shemaiah. They used to go to Jerusalem with me; we have
worshipped together there and they have never strayed from the right
path. Your brothers are worthy men; you come of good stock; welcome.'

"15" = ''':sup:`15` He went on, 'I engage you at a drachma a day, with the same
expenses as my own son's. Complete the journey with my son

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and I shall go beyond the agreed wage.' The angel replied, 'I shall
complete the journey with him. Do not be afraid. On the journey outward
all will be well; on the journey back all will be well; the road is
safe.'

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Tobit said, 'Blessings on you, brother!' Then he turned to his son.
'My child', he said, 'prepare what you need for the journey, and set
off with your brother. May God in heaven protect you abroad and bring
you both back to me safe and sound! May his angel go with you and
protect you, my child!' Tobias left the house to set out and kissed his
father and mother. Tobit said,' A happy journey!'

"18" = ''':sup:`18` His mother burst into tears and said to Tobit, 'Why must you send
my child away? Is he not the staff of our hands, as he goes about
before us?

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Surely money is not the only thing that matters? Surely it is not
as precious as our child?

"20" = ''':sup:`20` The way of life God had already given us was good enough.'

"21" = ''':sup:`21` He said, 'Do not think such thoughts. Going away and coming back,
