Notas de rodap√©:
12:1-2 - Israel continues to rebel against God, seeking help in
alliances with foreign nations. This behavior reflects the people's
ingratitude, having forgotten God's faithfulness throughout their
history, as seen in the passages about Abraham and Jacob (see also 2
12:3-6 - The example of Jacob, who wrestled with God and prevailed, is
used to call Israel to repentance and true worship. God is presented as

in obedience and faithfulness to the Lord. The call is for the people

voice and seek His guidance to restore the covenant (see also
