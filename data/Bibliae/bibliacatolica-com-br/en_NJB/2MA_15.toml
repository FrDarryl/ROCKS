"1" = ''':sup:`1` Nicanor heard that Judas and his men were in the neighbourhood of
Samaria, so he decided to attack them, at no risk to himself, on the
day of rest.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Those Jews who had been compelled to follow him, said, 'Do not
massacre them in such a savage, barbarous way. Respect the day on which
the All-seeing has conferred a special holiness.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` At this the triple-dyed scoundrel asked if there were in heaven a
sovereign who had ordered the keeping of the Sabbath day.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When they answered, 'The living Lord himself, the Heavenly
Sovereign, has ordered the observance of the seventh day,'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` he retorted, 'And I, as sovereign on earth, order you to take up
arms and do the king's business.' For all that, he did not manage to
carry out his wicked plan.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` While Nicanor, in his unlimited boastfulness and pride, was planning
to erect a general trophy with the spoils taken from Judas and his men,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Maccabaeus remained firm in his confident conviction that the Lord
would stand by him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He urged his men not to be dismayed by the foreigners' attacks but,
keeping in mind the help that had come to them from Heaven in the past,
to be confident that this time too victory would be theirs with the
help of the Almighty.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He put fresh heart into them by citing the Law and the Prophets and,
by stirring up memories of the battles they had already won, he filled
them with new enthusiasm.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Having thus aroused their courage, he ended his exhortation by
demonstrating the treachery of the foreigners and how they had violated
their oaths.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Having armed each one of them not so much with the safety given by
shield and lance as with that confidence which springs from noble
language, he encouraged them all by describing to them a convincing
dream -- a vision, as it were.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` What he had seen was this: Onias, the former high priest, that
paragon of men, modest of bearing and gentle of manners, suitably
eloquent and trained from boyhood in the practice of every virtue --
Onias was stretching out his hands and praying for the whole Jewish
community.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Next, there appeared a man equally remarkable for his great age and
dignity and invested with a marvellous and impressive air of majesty.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Onias began to speak: 'This is a man', he said, 'who loves his
brothers and prays much for the people and the holy city-Jeremiah, the
prophet of God.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Jeremiah then stretched out his right hand and presented Judas with
a golden sword, saying as he gave it,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` 'Take this holy sword as a gift from God; with it you will shatter
the enemy.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Encouraged by the noble words of Judas, which had the power to
inspire valour and give the young the spirit of mature men, they
decided not to entrench themselves in a camp, but bravely to take the
offensive and, in hand-to-hand fighting, to commit the result to the
fortune of war, since the city, their holy religion and the Temple were
in danger.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Their concern for their wives and children, their brothers and
relatives, had shrunk to minute importance; their chief and greatest
fear was for the consecrated Temple.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Those left behind in the city felt a similar anxiety, alarmed as
they were about the forthcoming encounter in the open country.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Everyone now awaited the coming issue. The enemy had already
concentrated their forces and stood formed up in order of battle, with
the elephants drawn up in a strategic position and the cavalry disposed
on the wings.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Maccabaeus took note of these masses confronting him, the
glittering array of armour and the fierce aspect of the elephants;
then, raising his hands to heaven, he called on the Lord who works
miracles, in the knowledge that it is not by force of arms but as he
sees fit to decide, that victory is granted by him to such as deserve
it.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` His prayer was worded thus: 'You, Master, sent your angel in the
days of Hezekiah king of Judaea, and he destroyed no less than one
hundred and eighty-five thousand of Sennacherib's army;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` now, once again, Sovereign of heaven, send a good angel before us
to spread terror and dismay.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` May these men be struck down by the might of your arm, since they
have come with blasphemy on their lips to attack your holy people.' And
on these words he finished.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Nicanor and his men advanced to the sound of trumpets and war
songs,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` but the men of Judas closed with the enemy uttering invocations and
prayers.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Fighting with their hands and praying to God in their hearts, they
cut down at least thirty-five thousand men and were greatly cheered by
this manifestation of God.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When the engagement was over and they were withdrawing in triumph,
they recognised Nicanor, lying dead in full armour.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` With shouting and confusion all around, they blessed the sovereign
Master in their ancestral tongue.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He who, as protagonist, had devoted himself, body and soul, to his
fellow-citizens, and had preserved the love he felt even in youth for
those of his own race, gave orders for Nicanor's head to be cut off,
with his arm up to the shoulder, and taken to Jerusalem.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When he arrived there himself, he called his countrymen together,
stationed the priests in front of the altar and then sent for the
people from the Citadel.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He showed them the head of the abominable Nicanor, and the hand
which this infamous man had stretched out so insolently against the
holy House of the Almighty.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then, cutting out godless Nicanor's tongue, he gave orders for it
to be fed piecemeal to the birds, and for the salary of his folly to be
hung up in front of the Temple.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` At this, everyone sent blessings heavenwards to the glorious Lord,
saying, 'Blessed be he who has preserved his holy place from
pollution!'
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` He hung Nicanor's head from the Citadel, a clear and evident sign
to all of the help of the Lord.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` They all decreed by public vote never to let that day go by
unobserved, but to celebrate the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
called Adar in Aramaic, the eve of what is called the Day of Mordecai.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` So ends the episode of Nicanor, and as, since then, the city has
remained in the possession of the Hebrews, I shall bring my own work to
an end here too.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If it is well composed and to the point, that is just what I
wanted. If it is worthless and mediocre, that is all I could manage.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Just as it is injurious to drink wine by itself, or again water
alone, whereas wine mixed with water is pleasant and produces a
delightful sense of well-being, so skill in presenting the incidents is
what delights the understanding of those who read the book. And her i
