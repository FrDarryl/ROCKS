"5" = ''':sup:`5` to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I am astonished that you are so promptly turning away from the one
who called you in the grace of Christ and are going over to a different
gospel-

"7" = ''':sup:`7` not that it is another gospel; except that there are trouble-makers
among you who are seeking to pervert the gospel of Christ.

Damascus.
