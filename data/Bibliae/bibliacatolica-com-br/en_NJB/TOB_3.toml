"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then, sad at heart, I sighed and wept, and began this prayer of
lamentation:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` You are just, O Lord, and just are all your works. All your ways are
grace and truth, and you are the Judge of the world.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Therefore, Lord, remember me, look on me. Do not punish me for my
sins or for my needless faults or those of my ancestors.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For we have sinned against you and broken your commandments; and you
have given us over to be plundered, to captivity and death, to be the
talk, the laughing-stock and scorn of all the nations among whom you
have dispersed us.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now all your decrees are true when you deal with me as my faults
deserve, and those of my ancestors. For we have neither kept your
commandments nor walked in truth before you.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So now, do with me as you will; be pleased to take my life from me;
so that I may be delivered from earth and become earth again. Better
death than life for me, for I have endured groundless insult and am in
deepest sorrow. Lord, be pleased to deliver me from this affliction.
Let me go away to my everlasting home; do not turn your face from me, O
Lord. Better death for me than life prolonged in the face of
unrelenting misery: I can no longer bear to listen to insults.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` It chanced on the same day that Sarah the daughter of Raguel, who
lived in Media at Ecbatana, also heard insults from one of her father's
maids.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For she had been given in marriage seven times, and Asmodeus, the
worst of demons, had killed her bridegrooms one after another before
ever they had slept with her as man with wife. The servant-girl said,
'Yes, you kill your bridegrooms yourself. That makes seven already to
whom you have been given, and you have not once been in luck yet.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Just because your bridegrooms have died, that is no reason for
punishing us. Go and join them, and may we be spared the sight of any
child of yours!'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` That day, she grieved, she sobbed, and she went up to her father's
room intending to hang herself. But then she thought, 'Suppose they
were to blame my father! They would say, "You had an only daughter whom
you loved, and now she has hanged herself for grief." I cannot cause my
father a sorrow which would bring down his old age to the dwelling of
the dead. I should do better not to hang myself, but to beg the Lord to
let my die and not live to hear any more insults.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And at this, by the window, with outstretched arms she said this
prayer: You are blessed, O God of mercy! May your name be blessed for
ever, and may all things you have made bless you everlastingly.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now I turn my face and I raise my eyes to you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Let your word deliver me from earth; I can hear myself insulted no
longer.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` O Lord, you know that I have remained pure; no man has touched me;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I have not dishonoured your name or my father's name in this land
of exile. I am my father's only daughter, he has no other child as
heir; he has no brother at his side, nor has he any kinsman left for
whom I ought to keep myself. I have lost seven husbands already; why
should I live any longer? If it does not please you to take my life,
then look on me with pity; I can no longer bear to hear myself defamed.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` This time the prayer of each of them found favour before the glory
of God,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and Raphael was sent to bring remedy to them both. He was to take
the white spots from the eyes of Tobit, so that he might see God's
light with his own eyes; and he was to give Sarah the daughter of
Raguel as bride to Tobias son of Tobit, and to rid her of Asmodeus,
that worst of demons. for it was to Tobias before all other suitors
that she belonged by right. Tobit was coming back from the courtyard
into the house at the same moment as Sarah the daughter of Raguel was
coming down from the upper room.
