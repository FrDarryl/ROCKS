remembered Vashti, how she had behaved, and the measures taken against
her.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` The king's gentlemen-in-waiting said, 'A search should be made on
the king's behalf for beautiful young virgins,

"3" = ''':sup:`3` and the king appoint commissioners throughout the provinces of his
realm to bring all these beautiful young virgins to the citadel of
Susa, to the harem under the authority of Hegai the king's eunuch,
custodian of the women. Here he will give them whatever they need for
enhancing their beauty,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and the girl who pleases the king can take Vashti's place as queen.'
This advice pleased the king and he acted on it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now in the citadel of Susa there lived a Jew called Mordecai son of
Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` who had been deported from Jerusalem among the captives taken away
with Jeconiah king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and was now bringing up a certain Hadassah, otherwise called Esther,
his uncle's daughter, who had lost both father and mother; the girl had
a good figure and a beautiful face, and on the death of her parents
Mordecai had adopted her as his daughter.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` On the promulgation of the royal command and edict a great number of
girls were brought to the citadel of Susa where they were entrusted to
Hegai. Esther, too, was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to
Hegai, the custodian of the women.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The girl pleased him and won his favour. Not only did he quickly
provide her with all she needed for her dressing room and her meals,
but he gave her seven special maids from the king's household and
transferred her and her maids to the best part of the harem.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Esther had not divulged her race or parentage, since Mordecai had
forbidden her to do so.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Mordecai walked up and down in front of the courtyard of the harem
all day and every day, to learn how Esther was and how she was being
treated.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Each girl had to appear in turn before King Ahasuerus after a delay
of twelve months fixed by the regulations for the women; this
preparatory period was occupied as follows: six months with oil of
myrrh, and six months with spices and lotions commonly use for feminine
beauty treatment.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When each girl went to the king, she was given whatever she wanted
to take with her, since she then moved from the harem into the royal
household.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` She went there in the evening, and the following morning returned
to another harem entrusted to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's
officer, custodian of the concubines. She did not go to the king any
more, unless he was particularly pleased with her and had her summoned
by name.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when it was the turn of Esther the daughter of Abihail, whose
nephew Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter, to go into the
king's presence, she did not ask for anything beyond what had been
assigned her by Hegai, the king's officer, custodian of the women.
Esther won the approval of all who saw her.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` She was brought to King Ahasuerus in his royal apartments in the
tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and the king liked Esther better than any of the other women; none
of the other girls found so much favour and approval with him. So he
set the royal diadem on her head and proclaimed her queen instead of
Vashti.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The king then gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his
officers-of-state and ministers, decreed a holiday for all the
provinces and distributed largesse with royal prodigality.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When Esther, like the other girls, had been transferred to the
second harem,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` she did not divulge her parentage or race, in obedience to the
orders of Mordecai, whose instructions she continued to follow as when
she had been under his care.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` At this time Mordecai was attached to the Chancellery and two
malcontents, Bigthan and Teresh, officers in the king's service as
Guards of the Threshold, plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Mordecai came to hear of this and informed Queen Esther, who in
turn, on Mordecai's authority, told the king.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The matter was investigated and proved to be true. The two
conspirators were sent to the gallows, and the incident was recorded in
the Annals, in the royal presence.
