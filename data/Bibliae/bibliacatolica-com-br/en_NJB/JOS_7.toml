"1" = ''':sup:`1` But the Israelites were unfaithful to the curse of destruction.
Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,
took something that fell under the curse of destruction, and the anger
of Yahweh was aroused against the Israelites.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai (which is near Beth-Aven), to
the east of Bethel, having said to them, 'Go up and reconnoitre the
country.' They went up and reconnoitred Ai.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Coming back to Joshua, they said, 'There is no need for the whole
people to go up; let some two or three thousand go and attack Ai. Spare
the whole people such an effort; there are only a few of them!'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Of the people, some three thousand marched up, but these broke
before the people of Ai,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` who killed some thirty-six of them and pursued them from the town
gate as far as Shebarim, and on the slope cut them to pieces. The
hearts of the people melted away and turned to water.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Joshua then tore his clothes and prostrated himself before the ark
of Yahweh till nightfall; the elders of Israel did the same, and all
poured dust on their heads.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Joshua said, 'Alas, Lord Yahweh, why did you bother to bring
this nation across the Jordan, if it was only to put us at the mercy of
the Amorites and destroy us? If only we could have settled down on the
other side of the Jordan!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Forgive me, Lord, but what can I say, now that Israel has turned
tail on the enemy?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The Canaanites, all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of it;
they will unite against us to wipe our name from the earth. And what

'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Stand up! Why are you lying prostrate like
this?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Israel has sinned; they have violated the covenant which I imposed
on them. They have gone so far as to take what was under the curse of
destruction, they have even stolen it; they have actually hidden it;
they have put it in their baggage.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` That is why the Israelites cannot stand up to their foes, why they
have turned tail on their enemies: because they have come under the
curse of destruction themselves. Unless you get rid of the object among
you which has been put under the curse of destruction, I shall be with
you no longer.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` 'Get up, sanctify the people and say, "Sanctify yourselves for
tomorrow, since Yahweh, the God of Israel, declares: The curse of
destruction has now fallen on you, Israel; you will not be able to
stand up to your enemies, until you have rid yourselves of that object
which has been put under the curse of destruction.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Tomorrow morning, therefore, you will come forward tribe by tribe,
and then the tribe which Yahweh selects by lot will come forward clan
by clan, and the clan which Yahweh selects by lot will come forward
family by family, and the family which Yahweh selects by lot will come
forward mam by man.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the man indicated by lot as regards the object which has been
put under the curse of destruction will be delivered to the flames, he
and all his possessions, for having violated the covenant with Yahweh
and for having committed an infamy in Israel." '
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Joshua got up early; he made Israel come forward tribe by tribe,
and the lot indicated the tribe of Judah.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He summoned the clans of Judah, and the lot indicated the clan of
Zerah. He summoned the clan of Zerah, family by family, and the lot
indicated Zabdi.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Joshua then summoned the family of Zabdi, man by man, and the lot
indicated Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe
of Judah.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Joshua then said to Achan, 'My son, give glory to Yahweh, God of
Israel, and confess; tell me what you have done and hide nothing from
me.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Achan replied to Joshua, 'Yes, I am the man who has sinned against
Yahweh, God of Israel, and this is what I have done.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` In the loot, I saw a fine robe from Shinar and two hundred shekels
of silver and an ingot of gold weighing fifty shekels, I set my heart
on them and I took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent,
with the silver underneath.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Joshua sent messengers; they ran to the tent, and the robe was
indeed hidden in the tent, with the silver underneath.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` They took the things out of the tent and, bringing them to Joshua
and all the Israelites, laid them out before Yahweh.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Joshua then took Achan son of Zerah and led him up to the Vale of
Achor, with the silver and the robe and the ingot of gold, his sons,
his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his goats, his tent
and all his belongings. All Israel went with him.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Joshua said, 'Why have you brought misfortune on us? Today may
Yahweh bring misfortune on you!' And all Israel stoned him to death
(and they burned them and threw stones at them).
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Over him, they raised a great mound of stones, which is still there
today. Yahweh then relented from his fierce anger. That was why the
place was called the Vale of Achor, as it still is today.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
7:1 - Achan's sin in taking items destined for destruction brings
defeat to Israel at Ai. This emphasizes the importance of holiness and
obedience to God's Word, showing how individual sin can affect the
6:7).
7:2-5 - The defeat at Ai and the distrust it generated among the
Israelites demonstrate that victory is assured only by obedience to
God. Self-reliance can lead to downfall and disillusionment (see also
7:6-9 - Joshua's intercession, questioning God about the defeat,
highlights the importance of communicating with the Lord in times of
crisis. Prayer is an essential tool for seeking guidance and
7:10-13 - God reveals the cause of the defeat, showing that
disobedience brought a curse upon Israel. This highlights the need for
holiness and the seriousness of sin, reinforcing the need to rid
Peter 1:15-16).
7:19-26 - The judgment of Achan and the destruction of his family
highlight the gravity of sin and the need to restore the holiness of
God's people. This teaches about the consequences of sin and the
12:1-2).
