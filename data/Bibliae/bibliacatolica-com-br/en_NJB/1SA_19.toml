"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
19:1-7 - Jonathan intercedes for David, convincing Saul not to kill
him. Jonathan's loyalty, even before his father, is an example of true
friendship and fidelity to God's plan. This relationship illustrates
how God can use human alliances to protect His servants (see also
19:8-10 - Despite his promise to Jonathan, Saul again tries to kill
David. Saul's continued pursuit reveals the depth of his rebellion and
the growing paranoia that consumes him. David, however, continues to
22:1).
19:11-12 - Michal helps David escape Saul's assassination attempt. She
deceives the king's messengers, demonstrating that God can use even
those close to the enemy to protect his chosen ones (see also
19:18-20 - David flees to Ramah and takes refuge with the prophet
Samuel. Samuel's protection symbolizes God's prophetic intervention in
David's life, highlighting the role of prophets as guardians of the
divine covenant (see also 1 Kings 19:9-10 and 2 Kings 6:8-12).
19:21-24 - When Saul attempts to capture David, God's Spirit causes him
and his messengers to prophesy, thwarting their evil plans. This shows
that God can disarm even the greatest enemies and use situations to
4:28-30).
