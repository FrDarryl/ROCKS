"1" = ''':sup:`1` People should think of us as Christ's servants, stewards entrusted
with the mysteries of God.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` In such a matter, what is expected of stewards is that each one
should be found trustworthy.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` It is of no importance to me how you or any other human court may
judge me: I will not even be the judge of my own self.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` It is true that my conscience does not reproach me, but that is not
enough to justify me: it is the Lord who is my judge.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For that reason, do not judge anything before the due time, until
the Lord comes; he will bring to light everything that is hidden in
darkness and reveal the designs of all hearts. Then everyone will
receive from God the appropriate commendation.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I have applied all this to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so
that you can learn how the saying, 'Nothing beyond what is written' is
true of us: no individual among you must become filled with his own
importance and make comparisons, to another's detriment.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Who made you so important? What have you got that was not given to
you? And if it was given to you, why are you boasting as though it were
your own?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` You already have everything -- you are rich already -- you have come
into your kingdom, without any help from us! Well, I wish you were
kings and we could be kings with you!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on show right at the
end, like men condemned to death: we have been exhibited as a spectacle
to the whole universe, both angelic and human.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Here we are, fools for Christ's sake, while you are the clever ones
in Christ; we are weak, while you are strong; you are honoured, while
we are disgraced.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` To this day, we go short of food and drink and clothes, we are
beaten up and we have no homes;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` we earn our living by labouring with our own hands; when we are
cursed, we answer with a blessing; when we are hounded, we endure it
passively;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` when we are insulted, we give a courteous answer. We are treated
even now as the dregs of the world, the very lowest scum.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am writing all this not to make you ashamed but simply to remind
you, as my dear children;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` for even though you might have ten thousand slaves to look after
you in Christ, you still have no more than one father, and it was I who
fathered you in Christ Jesus, by the gospel.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` That is why I urge you to take me as your pattern
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and why I have sent you Timothy, a dear and faithful son to me in
the Lord, who will remind you of my principles of conduct in Christ, as
I teach them everywhere in every church.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` On the assumption that I was not coming to you, some of you have
become filled with your own self-importance;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` but I shall be coming to you soon, the Lord willing, and then I
shall find out not what these self-important people say, but what power
they have.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For the kingdom of God consists not in spoken words but in power.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` What do you want then? Am I to come to you with a stick in my hand
or in love, and with a spirit of gentleness?
'''
"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
4:1-5 - Paul presents himself as a servant of Christ and steward of
God's mysteries. He emphasizes that the final judgment belongs to God,
not to man, noting that the actions of God's servants will be revealed
25:19-23).
4:6-7 - Paul warns the Corinthians against arrogance and
self-comparison. Everything they have comes from God, and they have no
reason to boast, for God's grace is what makes them special (see also
4:8-13 - Paul mocks the attitude of the Corinthians, who consider
themselves rich and already satisfied, while he and the other apostles
live in poverty and suffering. True greatness in faith is found in
4:14-21 - Paul rebukes the Corinthians, but with love, and presents
himself as a model of discipline and Christian living. He sends Timothy
to teach the true way of living in Christ, calling believers to imitate
3:17).
