"10" = ''':sup:`10` Next, famine having overwhelmed the land of Canaan, they went down
to Egypt where they stayed till they were well nourished. There they
became a great multitude, a race beyond counting.

if they have sinned against their God, let us first be sure that they
really have this reason to fail, then advance and attack them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But if their nation is guiltless, my lord would do better to

powerless people, quite unable to stand a stiff attack.
