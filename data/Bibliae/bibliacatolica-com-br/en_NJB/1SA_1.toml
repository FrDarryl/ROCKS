"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the highlands of
Ephraim whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of
Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He had two wives, one called Hannah, the other Peninnah; Peninnah
had children but Hannah had none.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Every year this man used to go up from his town to worship, and to
sacrifice to Yahweh Sabaoth at Shiloh. (The two sons of Eli, Hophni and
Phinehas, were there as priests of Yahweh.)
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` One day Elkanah offered a sacrifice. Now he used to give portions to
Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` to Hannah, however, he would give only one portion: for, although he
loved Hannah more, Yahweh had made her barren.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Furthermore, her rival would taunt and provoke her, because Yahweh
had made her womb barren.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And this went on year after year; every time they went up to the
temple of Yahweh she used to taunt her. On that day she wept and would
not eat anything;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` so her husband Elkanah said, 'Hannah, why are you crying? Why are
you not eating anything? Why are you so sad? Am I not more to you than
ten sons?'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When they had finished eating in the room, Hannah got up and stood
before Yahweh. Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost
of the temple of Yahweh.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` In the bitterness of her soul she prayed to Yahweh with many tears,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and she made this vow, 'Yahweh Sabaoth! Should you condescend to
notice the humiliation of your servant and keep her in mind instead of
disregarding your servant, and give her a boy, I will give him to
Yahweh for the whole of his life and no razor shall ever touch his
head.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` While she went on praying to Yahweh, Eli was watching her mouth,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` for Hannah was speaking under her breath; her lips were moving but
her voice could not be heard, and Eli thought that she was drunk.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Eli said, 'How much longer are you going to stay drunk? Get rid of
your wine.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` 'No, my lord,' Hannah replied, 'I am a woman in great trouble; I
have not been drinking wine or strong drink -- I am pouring out my soul
before Yahweh.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do not take your servant for a worthless woman; all this time I
have been speaking from the depth of my grief and my resentment.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Eli then replied, 'Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant
what you have asked of him.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` To which she said, 'May your servant find favour in your sight.'
With that, the woman went away; she began eating and was dejected no
longer.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They got up early in the morning and, after worshipping Yahweh, set
out and went home to Ramah. Elkanah lay with his wife Hannah, and
Yahweh remembered her.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Hannah conceived and, in due course, gave birth to a son, whom she
named Samuel, 'since', she said, 'I asked Yahweh for him.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Elkanah, the husband, went up with all his family to offer the
annual sacrifice to Yahweh and to fulfil his vow.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` However, Hannah did not go up, having said to her husband, 'Not
before the child has been weaned. Then I shall bring him and present
him before Yahweh and he will stay there for ever.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Elkanah her husband then said to her, 'Do what you think fit; wait
until you have weaned him. May Yahweh bring about what he has said.' So
the woman stayed behind and nursed her child until she weaned him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, as well as a
three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and took him
into the temple of Yahweh at Shiloh; the child was very young.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` They sacrificed the bull and led the child to Eli.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` She said, 'If you please, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the
woman who stood beside you here, praying to Yahweh.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` This is the child for which I was praying, and Yahweh has granted
me what I asked of him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Now I make him over to Yahweh for the whole of his life. He is made
over to Yahweh.' They then worshipped Yahweh there.
