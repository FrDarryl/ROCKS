here'; they sat down.

who has come back from the Plains of Moab, is selling the piece of land
that belonged to our brother, Elimelech.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` I thought I should tell you about this and say, "Acquire it in the
presence of the men who are sitting here and in the presence of the
elders of my people. If you want to use your right of redemption,
redeem it; if you do not, tell me so that I know, for I am the only
person to redeem it besides yourself, and I myself come after you."'

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Boaz then said, 'The day you acquire the field from Naomi, you also
acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the man who has died, to
perpetuate the dead man's name in his inheritance.'

"6" = ''':sup:`6` The man with the right of redemption then said, 'I cannot use my
right of redemption without jeopardising my own inheritance. Since I

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now, in former times, it was the custom in Israel to confirm a
transaction in matters of redemption or inheritance by one of the
parties taking off his sandal and giving it to the other. This was how
agreements were ratified in Israel.

it for yourself,' he took off his sandal.

be my wife, to perpetuate the dead man's name in his inheritance, so
that the dead man's name will not be lost among his brothers and at the
gate of his town. Today you are witnesses to this.'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` All the people at the gate said, 'We are witnesses'; and the elders
said, 'May Yahweh make the woman about to enter your family like Rachel

Ephrathah, be renowned in Bethlehem!

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And through the children Yahweh will give you by this young woman,

together, Yahweh made her conceive and she bore a son.

you today without anyone to redeem you. May his name be praised in
Israel!
