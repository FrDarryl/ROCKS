take too much on yourselves! The whole community, all its members, are

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Moses then summoned Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab. They replied,
'We will not come.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` What is more, you have not brought us to a country flowing with

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Moses flew into a rage and said to Yahweh, 'Disregard their cereal

Notas de rodap√©:
16:1-3 - Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebel against Moses and Aaron,
questioning their leadership. This rebellion reflects human
dissatisfaction and pride that opposes God's established authority (see
16:4-7 - Moses proposes a test to demonstrate whom God has chosen for

16:46-48 - Moses and Aaron intercede for the people, and Aaron offers
incense to stop the plague sent by God. This shows the importance of
intercession and the priesthood in God's plan of redemption (see also
