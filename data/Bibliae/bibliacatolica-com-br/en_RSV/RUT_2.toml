glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find

"3" = ''':sup:`3` So she set forth and went and gleaned in the field after the
reapers; and she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to
Bo'az, who was of the family of Elim'elech.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` And behold, Bo'az came from Bethlehem; and he said to the reapers,
"The LORD be with you!" And they answered, "The LORD bless you."

"Whose maiden is this?"

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered, "It is
the Moabite maiden, who came back with Na'omi from the country of Moab.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` She said, `Pray, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the
reapers.' So she came, and she has continued from early morning until
now, without resting even for a moment."

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him,
"Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of
me, when I am a foreigner?"

"11" = ''':sup:`11` But Bo'az answered her, "All that you have done for your
mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told me,
and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came
to a people that you did not know before.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` The LORD recompense you for what you have done, and a full reward

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then she said, "You are most gracious to me, my lord, for you have
comforted me and spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not one
of your maidservants."

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And at mealtime Bo'az said to her, "Come here, and eat some bread,
and dip your morsel in the wine." So she sat beside the reapers, and he
passed to her parched grain; and she ate until she was satisfied, and
she had some left over.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` When she rose to glean, Bo'az instructed his young men, saying,
"Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And also pull out some from the bundles for her, and leave it for
her to glean, and do not rebuke her."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` So she gleaned in the field until evening; then she beat out what
she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And she took it up and went into the city; she showed her
mother-in-law what she had gleaned, and she also brought out and gave
her what food she had left over after being satisfied.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where did you glean today? And
where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you." So
she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, "The
man's name with whom I worked today is Bo'az."

"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Na'omi said to her daughter-in-law, "Blessed be he by the LORD,
whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!" Na'omi also
said to her, "The man is a relative of ours, one of our nearest kin."

daughter, that you go out with his maidens, lest in another field you
be molested."
