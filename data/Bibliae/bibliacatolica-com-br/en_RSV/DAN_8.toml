"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the third year of the reign of King Belshaz'zar a vision appeared
to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the capital,
which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was at
the river U'lai.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of
the river. It had two horns; and both horns were high, but one was
higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward; no
beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue
from his power; he did as he pleased and magnified himself.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west across
the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat
had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on
the bank of the river, and he ran at him in his mighty wrath.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and
struck the ram and broke his two horns; and the ram had no power to
stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled upon
him; and there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; but when he was
strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four
conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew exceedingly
great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` It grew great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host of
the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` It magnified itself, even up to the Prince of the host; and the
continual burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his
sanctuary was overthrown.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt
offering through transgression; and truth was cast down to the ground,
and the horn acted and prospered.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to the
one that spoke, "For how long is the vision concerning the continual
burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving
over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled under foot?"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he said to him, "For two thousand and three hundred evenings
and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be restored to its rightful
state."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and
behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the U'lai, and it
called, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened
and fell upon my face. But he said to me, "Understand, O son of man,
that the vision is for the time of the end."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` As he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to
the ground; but he touched me and set me on my feet.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He said, "Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the
latter end of the indignation; for it pertains to the appointed time of
the end.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` As for the ram which you saw with the two horns, these are the
kings of Media and Persia.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn between
his eyes is the first king.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others
arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his
power.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And at the latter end of their rule, when the transgressors have
reached their full measure, a king of bold countenance, one who
understands riddles, shall arise.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` His power shall be great, and he shall cause fearful destruction,
and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the
people of the saints.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in
his own mind he shall magnify himself. Without warning he shall destroy
many; and he shall even rise up against the Prince of princes; but, by
no human hand, he shall be broken.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been told is
true; but seal up the vision, for it pertains to many days hence."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for some days; then I rose
and went about the king's business; but I was appalled by the vision
and did not understand it.
