the filth from the holy place.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done what was evil in

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then they went in to Hezeki'ah the king and said, "We have cleansed

utensils, and the table for the showbread and all its utensils.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` All the utensils which King Ahaz discarded in his reign when he was
faithless, we have made ready and sanctified; and behold, they are
before the altar of the LORD."

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Hezeki'ah the king rose early and gathered the officials of
the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven
he-goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and
for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them
on the altar of the LORD.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and
threw it against the altar; and they killed the rams and their blood
was thrown against the altar; and they killed the lambs and their blood
was thrown against the altar.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then the he-goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and
the assembly, and they laid their hands upon them,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and the priests killed them and made a sin offering with their
blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king
commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made
for all Israel.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And he stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
harps, and lyres, according to the commandment of David and of Gad the
king's seer and of Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was from the
LORD through his prophets.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests
with the trumpets.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then Hezeki'ah commanded that the burnt offering be offered on the
altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song to the LORD began
also, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of
Israel.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` The whole assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the
trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was
finished.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` When the offering was finished, the king and all who were present
with him bowed themselves and worshiped.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Hezeki'ah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to
sing praises to the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer.
And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed down and worshiped.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then Hezeki'ah said, "You have now consecrated yourselves to the
LORD; come near, bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of
the LORD." And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings; and
all who were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was
seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were
for a burnt offering to the LORD.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And the consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three
thousand sheep.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt
offerings, so until other priests had sanctified themselves their
brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was finished -- for
the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in sanctifying
themselves.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Besides the great number of burnt offerings there was the fat of
the peace offerings, and there were the libations for the burnt
offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And Hezeki'ah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had
done for the people; for the thing came about suddenly.
