"1" = ''':sup:`1` But thou, our God, art kind and true, patient, and ruling all things
in mercy.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` For even if we sin we are thine, knowing thy power; but we will not
sin, because we know that we are accounted thine.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For to know thee is complete righteousness, and to know thy power is
the root of immortality.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For neither has the evil intent of human art misled us, nor the
fruitless toil of painters, a figure stained with varied colors,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` whose appearance arouses yearning in fools, so that they desire the
lifeless form of a dead image.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Lovers of evil things and fit for such objects of hope are those who
either make or desire or worship them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For when a potter kneads the soft earth and laboriously molds each
vessel for our service, he fashions out of the same clay both the
vessels that serve clean uses and those for contrary uses, making all
in like manner; but which shall be the use of each of these the worker
in clay decides.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` With misspent toil, he forms a futile god from the same clay -- this
man who was made of earth a short time before and after a little while
goes to the earth from which he was taken, when he is required to
return the soul that was lent him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But he is not concerned that he is destined to die or that his life
is brief, but he competes with workers in gold and silver, and imitates
workers in copper; and he counts it his glory that he molds counterfeit
gods.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` His heart is ashes, his hope is cheaper than dirt, and his life is
of less worth than clay,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` because he failed to know the one who formed him and inspired him
with an active soul and breathed into him a living spirit.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But he considered our existence an idle game, and life a festival
held for profit, for he says one must get money however one can, even
by base means.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For this man, more than all others, knows that he sins when he
makes from earthy matter fragile vessels and graven images.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But most foolish, and more miserable than an infant, are all the
enemies who oppressed thy people.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For they thought that all their heathen idols were gods, though
these have neither the use of their eyes to see with, nor nostrils with
which to draw breath, nor ears with which to hear, nor fingers to feel
with, and their feet are of no use for walking.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For a man made them, and one whose spirit is borrowed formed them;
for no man can form a god which is like himself.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He is mortal, and what he makes with lawless hands is dead, for he
is better than the objects he worships, since he has life, but they
never have.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The enemies of thy people worship even the most hateful animals,
which are worse than all others, when judged by their lack of
intelligence;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and even as animals they are not so beautiful in appearance that
one would desire them, but they have escaped both the praise of God and
his blessing.
