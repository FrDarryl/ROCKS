"1" = ''':sup:`1` "Hear, O Israel; you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in
to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves, cities
great and fortified up to heaven,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and
of whom you have heard it said, `Who can stand before the sons of
Anak?'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Know therefore this day that he who goes over before you as a
devouring fire is the LORD your God; he will destroy them and subdue
them before you; so you shall drive them out, and make them perish
quickly, as the LORD has promised you.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` "Do not say in your heart, after the LORD your God has thrust them
out before you, `It is because of my righteousness that the LORD has
brought me in to possess this land'; whereas it is because of the
wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before
you.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart
are you going in to possess their land; but because of the wickedness
of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out from before you,
and that he may confirm the word which the LORD swore to your fathers,
to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "Know therefore, that the LORD your God is not giving you this good
land to possess because of your righteousness; for you are a stubborn
people.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Remember and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to
wrath in the wilderness; from the day you came out of the land of
Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against
the LORD.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Even at Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so
angry with you that he was ready to destroy you.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the
tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, I remained on the
mountain forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank
water.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the LORD gave me the two tables of stone written with the
finger of God; and on them were all the words which the LORD had spoken
with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire on the day of the
assembly.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And at the end of forty days and forty nights the LORD gave me the
two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then the LORD said to me, `Arise, go down quickly from here; for
your people whom you have brought from Egypt have acted corruptly; they
have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they
have made themselves a molten image.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Furthermore the LORD said to me, `I have seen this people, and
behold, it is a stubborn people;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` let me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from
under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than
they.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was
burning with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
hands.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the LORD your God;
you had made yourselves a molten calf; you had turned aside quickly
from the way which the LORD had commanded you.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two
hands, and broke them before your eyes.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then I lay prostrate before the LORD as before, forty days and
forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all the
sin which you had committed, in doing what was evil in the sight of the
LORD, to provoke him to anger.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure which the LORD
bore against you, so that he was ready to destroy you. But the LORD
hearkened to me that time also.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the LORD was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to destroy
him; and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then I took the sinful thing, the calf which you had made, and
burned it with fire and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it
was as fine as dust; and I threw the dust of it into the brook that
descended out of the mountain.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` "At Tab'erah also, and at Massah, and at Kib'roth-hatta'avah, you
provoked the LORD to wrath.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And when the LORD sent you from Ka'desh-bar'nea, saying, `Go up and
take possession of the land which I have given you,' then you rebelled
against the commandment of the LORD your God, and did not believe him
or obey his voice.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` You have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew
you.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` "So I lay prostrate before the LORD for these forty days and forty
nights, because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And I prayed to the LORD, `O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and
thy heritage, whom thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, whom thou
hast brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not regard the
stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness, or their sin,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` lest the land from which thou didst bring us say, "Because the LORD
was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and
because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the
wilderness."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For they are thy people and thy heritage, whom thou didst bring out
by thy great power and by thy outstretched arm.'
