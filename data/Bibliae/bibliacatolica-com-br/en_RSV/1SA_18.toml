"1" = ''':sup:`1` When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit
to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his
father's house.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then Jonathan made a covenant with David, because he loved him as
his own soul.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and
gave it to David, and his armor, and even his sword and his bow and his
girdle.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And David went out and was successful wherever Saul sent him; so
that Saul set him over the men of war. And this was good in the sight
of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` As they were coming home, when David returned from slaying the
Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and
dancing, to meet King Saul, with timbrels, with songs of joy, and with
instruments of music.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And the women sang to one another as they made merry, "Saul has
slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him; he said,
"They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have
ascribed thousands; and what more can he have but the kingdom?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Saul eyed David from that day on.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And on the morrow an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he
raved within his house, while David was playing the lyre, as he did day
by day. Saul had his spear in his hand;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and Saul cast the spear, for he thought, "I will pin David to the
wall." But David evaded him twice.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him but had
departed from Saul.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Saul removed him from his presence, and made him a commander of
a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And David had success in all his undertakings; for the LORD was
with him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in awe of
him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in
before them.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Saul said to David, "Here is my elder daughter Merab; I will
give her to you for a wife; only be valiant for me and fight the LORD'S
battles." For Saul thought, "Let not my hand be upon him, but let the
hand of the Philistines be upon him."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And David said to Saul, "Who am I, and who are my kinsfolk, my
father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given
to David, she was given to A'driel the Meho'lathite for a wife.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David; and they told Saul, and the
thing pleased him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Saul thought, "Let me give her to him, that she may be a snare for
him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him."
Therefore Saul said to David a second time, "You shall now be my
son-in-law."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Saul commanded his servants, "Speak to David in private and
say, `Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love
you; now then become the king's son-in-law.'"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And
David said, "Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's
son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and of no repute?"
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And the servants of Saul told him, "Thus and so did David speak."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Saul said, "Thus shall you say to David, `The king desires no
marriage present except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he
may be avenged of the king's enemies.'" Now Saul thought to make David
fall by the hand of the Philistines.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well
to be the king's son-in-law. Before the time had expired,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of
the Philistines; and David brought their foreskins, which were given in
full number to the king, that he might become the king's son-in-law.
And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
all Israel loved him,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David's enemy
continually.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then the princes of the Philistines came out to battle, and as
often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of
Saul; so that his name was highly esteemed.
