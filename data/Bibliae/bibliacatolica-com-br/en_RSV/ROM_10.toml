"1" = ''':sup:`1` Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they
may be saved.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but it is not
enlightened.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and
seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's
righteousness.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For Christ is the end of the law, that every one who has faith may
be justified.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is
based on the law shall live by it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But the righteousness based on faith says, Do not say in your heart,
"Who will ascend into heaven?" (that is, to bring Christ down)
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` or "Who will descend into the abyss?" (that is, to bring Christ up
from the dead).
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But what does it say? The word is near you, on your lips and in your
heart (that is, the word of faith which we preach);
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` because, if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and
believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be
saved.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For man believes with his heart and so is justified, and he
confesses with his lips and so is saved.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The scripture says, "No one who believes in him will be put to
shame."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is
Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For, "every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But how are men to call upon him in whom they have not believed?
And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And
how are they to hear without a preacher?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How
beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But they have not all obeyed the gospel; for Isaiah says, "Lord,
who has believed what he has heard from us?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes by the
preaching of Christ.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for "Their voice
has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the
world."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, "I will
make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I
will make you angry."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who
did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But of Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a
disobedient and contrary people."

10:9-13 - Confessing faith in Jesus Christ is fundamental to salvation.

mouth, emphasizing that there is no distinction between Jews and
10:14-17 - The preaching of the gospel is essential for salvation, and
Paul emphasizes the need to send preachers so that everyone can hear
the message of Christ. Faith comes by hearing the word of Christ (see

all, and Israel's refusal to accept Christ fulfills Scripture.
Rejection of God and rejection of the gospel are recurring themes in

10:5-8 - Paul contrasts righteousness based on the law with
righteousness by faith. Righteousness by faith in Christ is accessible
to all, requiring no great deeds, but merely the acceptance of the
