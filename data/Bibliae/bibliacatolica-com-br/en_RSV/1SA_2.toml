"1" = ''':sup:`1` Hannah also prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; my
strength is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I
rejoice in thy salvation.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` "There is none holy like the LORD, there is none besides thee; there
is no rock like our God.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your
mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are
weighed.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those
who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but
she who has many children is forlorn.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and
raises up.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash
heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For
the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and on them he has set the
world.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "He will guard the feet of his faithful ones; but the wicked shall
be cut off in darkness; for not by might shall a man prevail.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them
he will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth;
he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his
anointed."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then Elka'nah went home to Ramah. And the boy ministered to the
LORD, in the presence of Eli the priest.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they had no regard for the
LORD.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man
offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was
boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they
did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would
come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat for the priest
to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And if the man said to him, "Let them burn the fat first, and then
take as much as you wish," he would say, "No, you must give it now; and
if not, I will take it by force."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the
LORD; for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy girded with a linen
ephod.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to
him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly
sacrifice.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Eli would bless Elka'nah and his wife, and say, "The LORD give
you children by this woman for the loan which she lent to the LORD"; so
then they would return to their home.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons
and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to
all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance
to the tent of meeting.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And he said to them, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your
evil dealings from all the people.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the
LORD spreading abroad.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` If a man sins against a man, God will mediate for him; but if a man
sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?" But they would not
listen to the voice of their father; for it was the will of the LORD to
slay them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor
with the LORD and with men.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, "Thus the LORD
has said, `I revealed myself to the house of your father when they were
in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to
go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me; and I
gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the
people of Israel.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Why then look with greedy eye at my sacrifices and my offerings
which I commanded, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves
upon the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Therefore the LORD the God of Israel declares: `I promised that
your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me
for ever'; but now the LORD declares: `Far be it from me; for those who
honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly
esteemed.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Behold, the days are coming, when I will cut off your strength and
the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old
man in your house.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the
prosperity which shall be bestowed upon Israel; and there shall not be
an old man in your house for ever.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The man of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be
spared to weep out his eyes and grieve his heart; and all the increase
of your house shall die by the sword of men.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And this which shall befall your two sons, Hophni and Phin'ehas,
shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do
according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a
sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed for ever.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And every one who is left in your house shall come to implore him
for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, "Put me, I
pray you, in one of the priest's places, that I may eat a morsel of
bread."'"
