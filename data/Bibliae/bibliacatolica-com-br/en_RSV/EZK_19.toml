'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and say: What a lioness was your mother among lions! She couched in
the midst of young lions, rearing her whelps.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion, and he
learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The nations sounded an alarm against him; he was taken in their pit;
and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When she saw that she was baffled, that her hope was lost, she took
another of her whelps and made him a young lion.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned
to catch prey; he devoured men.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And he ravaged their strongholds, and laid waste their cities; and
the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his
roaring.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the nations set against him snares on every side; they spread
their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` With hooks they put him in a cage, and brought him to the king of
Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more
be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard transplanted by the
water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Its strongest stem became a ruler's scepter; it towered aloft among
the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its
branches.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the
east wind dried it up; its fruit was stripped off, its strong stem was
withered; the fire consumed it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now it is transplanted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
land.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And fire has gone out from its stem, has consumed its branches and
fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for a
ruler. This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.
