"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not with a
blameless heart.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his
servants who had slain the king his father.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But he did not put their children to death, according to what is
written in the law, in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded,
"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, or the
children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for
his own sin."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Amazi'ah assembled the men of Judah, and set them by fathers'
houses under commanders of thousands and of hundreds for all Judah and
Benjamin. He mustered those twenty years old and upward, and found that
they were three hundred thousand picked men, fit for war, able to
handle spear and shield.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for
a hundred talents of silver.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, do not let the army
of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel, with all these
E'phraimites.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But if you suppose that in this way you will be strong for war, God
will cast you down before the enemy; for God has power to help or to
cast down."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Amazi'ah said to the man of God, "But what shall we do about the
hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?" The man of
God answered, "The LORD is able to give you much more than this."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Amazi'ah discharged the army that had come to him from
E'phraim, to go home again. And they became very angry with Judah, and
returned home in fierce anger.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But Amazi'ah took courage, and led out his people, and went to the
Valley of Salt and smote ten thousand men of Se'ir.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The men of Judah captured another ten thousand alive, and took them
to the top of a rock and threw them down from the top of the rock; and
they were all dashed to pieces.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But the men of the army whom Amazi'ah sent back, not letting them
go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Sama'ria to
Beth-hor'on, and killed three thousand people in them, and took much
spoil.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` After Amazi'ah came from the slaughter of the E'domites, he brought
the gods of the men of Se'ir, and set them up as his gods, and
worshiped them, making offerings to them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Therefore the LORD was angry with Amazi'ah and sent to him a
prophet, who said to him, "Why have you resorted to the gods of a
people, which did not deliver their own people from your hand?"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But as he was speaking the king said to him, "Have we made you a
royal counselor? Stop! Why should you be put to death?" So the prophet
stopped, but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you,
because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Amazi'ah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Jo'ash the son
of Jeho'ahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look
one another in the face."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And Jo'ash the king of Israel sent word to Amazi'ah king of Judah,
"A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, `Give your
daughter to my son for a wife'; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by
and trampled down the thistle.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You say, `See, I have smitten Edom,' and your heart has lifted you
up in boastfulness. But now stay at home; why should you provoke
trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Amazi'ah would not listen; for it was of God, in order that he
might give them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought
the gods of Edom.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Jo'ash king of Israel went up; and he and Amazi'ah king of Judah
faced one another in battle at Beth-she'mesh, which belongs to Judah.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Jo'ash king of Israel captured Amazi'ah king of Judah, the son
of Jo'ash, son of Ahazi'ah, at Beth-she'mesh, and brought him to
Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred
cubits, from the E'phraim Gate to the Corner Gate.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And he seized all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
were found in the house of God, and O'bed-e'dom with them; he seized
also the treasuries of the king's house, and hostages, and he returned
to Sama'ria.

fathers in the city of David.

Notas de rodap√©:
25:1-4 - Amaziah, son of Joash, begins his reign and seeks to do what
is right, but not with a sincere heart. This shows that the appearance
of righteousness does not replace the need for a heart truly committed
25:5-10 - Amaziah hires mercenary soldiers, but is warned by a prophet
not to trust them. This warning highlights the importance of depending
on God rather than relying on human strategies for battle (see also
25:11-16 - Amaziah defeats the Edomites and turns away, worshiping
their gods. This transition highlights the danger of allowing temporary
victories to lead to idolatry, reinforcing the need for continued
10:14).
25:17-24 - Amaziah confronts Joash, king of Israel, leading to a
disastrous battle. The dispute between the kingdoms illustrates the
consequences of a proud heart and a lack of respect for God's word (see
25:25-28 - Amaziah is defeated and murdered, ending his life in
unfaithfulness. This narrative serves as a warning about the cost of
straying and the importance of remaining faithful to the Lord to the
