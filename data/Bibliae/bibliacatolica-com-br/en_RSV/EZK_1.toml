one toward another; and each creature had two wings covering its body.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound
of many waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult
like the sound of a host; when they stood still, they let down their
wings.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And there came a voice from above the firmament over their heads;
when they stood still, they let down their wings.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of
a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of
a throne was a likeness as it were of a human form.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And upward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it
were gleaming bronze, like the appearance of fire enclosed round about;
and downward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were
the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of
rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. Such was the
