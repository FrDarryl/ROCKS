"14" = ''':sup:`14` And if a stranger sojourns among you, and will keep the passover to
the LORD, according to the statute of the passover and according to its

people of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and did not set out.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and
according to the command of the LORD they remained in camp; then
according to the command of the LORD they set out.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning; and
when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out, or if it
continued for a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up they set
out.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the

they set out.
