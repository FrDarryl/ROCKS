"1" = ''':sup:`1` After these things and these acts of faithfulness Sennach'erib king
of Assyria came and invaded Judah and encamped against the fortified
cities, thinking to win them for himself.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And when Hezeki'ah saw that Sennach'erib had come and intended to
fight against Jerusalem,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he planned with his officers and his mighty men to stop the water of
the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` A great many people were gathered, and they stopped all the springs
and the brook that flowed through the land, saying, "Why should the
kings of Assyria come and find much water?"
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He set to work resolutely and built up all the wall that was broken
down, and raised towers upon it, and outside it he built another wall;
and he strengthened the Millo in the city of David. He also made
weapons and shields in abundance.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he set combat commanders over the people, and gathered them
together to him in the square at the gate of the city and spoke
encouragingly to them, saying,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` "Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dismayed before
the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him; for there is
one greater with us than with him.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God, to
help us and to fight our battles." And the people took confidence from
the words of Hezeki'ah king of Judah.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` After this Sennach'erib king of Assyria, who was besieging Lachish
with all his forces, sent his servants to Jerusalem to Hezeki'ah king
of Judah and to all the people of Judah that were in Jerusalem, saying,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` "Thus says Sennach'erib king of Assyria, `On what are you relying,
that you stand siege in Jerusalem?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Is not Hezeki'ah misleading you, that he may give you over to die
by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, "The LORD our God will
deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria"?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Has not this same Hezeki'ah taken away his high places and his
altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, "Before one altar you shall
worship, and upon it you shall burn your sacrifices"?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples
of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands at all able
to deliver their lands out of my hand?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Who among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly
destroyed was able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God
should be able to deliver you from my hand?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Now therefore do not let Hezeki'ah deceive you or mislead you in
this fashion, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or
kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the
hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my
hand!'"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And his servants said still more against the Lord GOD and against
his servant Hezeki'ah.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he wrote letters to cast contempt on the LORD the God of Israel
and to speak against him, saying, "Like the gods of the nations of the
lands who have not delivered their people from my hands, so the God of
Hezeki'ah will not deliver his people from my hand."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And they shouted it with a loud voice in the language of Judah to
the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall, to frighten and terrify
them, in order that they might take the city.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of
the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men's hands.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Hezeki'ah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,
prayed because of this and cried to heaven.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and
commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he
returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he came into the
house of his god, some of his own sons struck him down there with the
sword.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So the LORD saved Hezeki'ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from
the hand of Sennach'erib king of Assyria and from the hand of all his
enemies; and he gave them rest on every side.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem and precious things
to Hezeki'ah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all
nations from that time onward.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` In those days Hezeki'ah became sick and was at the point of death,
and he prayed to the LORD; and he answered him and gave him a sign.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But Hezeki'ah did not make return according to the benefit done to
him, for his heart was proud. Therefore wrath came upon him and Judah
and Jerusalem.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Hezeki'ah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not
come upon them in the days of Hezeki'ah.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Hezeki'ah had very great riches and honor; and he made for
himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for
spices, for shields, and for all kinds of costly vessels;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` storehouses also for the yield of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls
for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He likewise provided cities for himself, and flocks and herds in
abundance; for God had given him very great possessions.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` This same Hezeki'ah closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon
and directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And
Hezeki'ah prospered in all his works.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And so in the matter of the envoys of the princes of Babylon, who
had been sent to him to inquire about the sign that had been done in
the land, God left him to himself, in order to try him and to know all
that was in his heart.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Now the rest of the acts of Hezeki'ah, and his good deeds, behold,
they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz,
in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Hezeki'ah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
ascent of the tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manas'seh his
son reigned in his stead.

Notas de rodap√©:
32:1-8 - Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invades Judah, but Hezekiah
encourages the people to trust in the Lord, who is more powerful than
any human army. This trust in God in the midst of danger reflects faith

blaspheming God. This attempt to discredit the faithful reveals the
world's contempt for God's power, but it also highlights the conflict
37:23).
32:20-22 - Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah pray, and God delivers
Jerusalem by sending an angel who destroys the Assyrian army. This
shows that fervent prayer and faith can result in divine deliverance
32:24-26 - Hezekiah becomes seriously ill, but prays to the Lord and is
healed. However, he gives in to pride, but later repents. This
highlights the importance of repentance and humility before God (see
32:27-33 - Hezekiah prospers and is remembered for his accomplishments,
but his death follows a period of pride. This account serves as a
warning against the danger of spiritual pride, even for the most
