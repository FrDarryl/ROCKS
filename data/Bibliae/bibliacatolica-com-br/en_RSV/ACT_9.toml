"1" = ''':sup:`1` But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples
of the Lord, went to the high priest
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if
he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them
bound to Jerusalem.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light
from heaven flashed about him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul,
Saul, why do you persecute me?"
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus, whom you
are persecuting;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to
do."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the
voice but seeing no one.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could
see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Anani'as. The Lord said
to him in a vision, "Anani'as." And he said, "Here I am, Lord."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called
Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named
Saul; for behold, he is praying,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and he has seen a man named Anani'as come in and lay his hands on
him so that he might regain his sight."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But Anani'as answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this
man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who
call upon thy name."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of
mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of
Israel;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my
name."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Anani'as departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on
him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the
road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and
be filled with the Holy Spirit."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he
regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and took food and was strengthened. For several days he was with
the disciples at Damascus.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, "He
is the Son of God."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And all who heard him were amazed, and said, "Is not this the man
who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name? And he
has come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief
priests."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the
Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates
day and night, to kill him;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` but his disciples took him by night and let him down over the wall,
lowering him in a basket.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when he had come to Jerusalem he attempted to join the
disciples; and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe
that he was a disciple.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to
him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and disputed
against the Hellenists; but they were seeking to kill him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesare'a,
and sent him off to Tarsus.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Sama'ria had
peace and was built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the
comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also
to the saints that lived at Lydda.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` There he found a man named Aene'as, who had been bedridden for
eight years and was paralyzed.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And Peter said to him, "Aene'as, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and
make your bed." And immediately he rose.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned
to the Lord.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means
Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` In those days she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her,
they laid her in an upper room.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was
there, sent two men to him entreating him, "Please come to us without
delay."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come, they took
him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and
showing tunics and other garments which Dorcas made while she was with
them.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then
turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." And she opened her eyes,
and when she saw Peter she sat up.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints
and widows he presented her alive.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the
Lord.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.
