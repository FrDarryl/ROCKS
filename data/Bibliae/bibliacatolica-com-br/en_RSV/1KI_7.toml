his entire house.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length was a
hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty
cubits, and it was built upon three rows of cedar pillars, with cedar
beams upon the pillars.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were upon the
forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and
its breadth thirty cubits; there was a porch in front with pillars, and
a canopy before them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce
judgment, even the Hall of Judgment; it was finished with cedar from
floor to rafters.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the
hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall
for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken in marriage.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` All these were made of costly stones, hewn according to measure,
sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the
coping, and from the court of the house of the LORD to the great court.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight
and ten cubits.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And above were costly stones, hewn according to measurement, and
cedar.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The great court had three courses of hewn stone round about, and a
course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the LORD,
and the vestibule of the house.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naph'tali, and his father
was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was full of wisdom,
understanding, and skill, for making any work in bronze. He came to
King Solomon, and did all his work.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of
one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference; it
was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers; the second pillar was
the same.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He also made two capitals of molten bronze, to set upon the tops of
the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the
height of the other capital was five cubits.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then he made two nets of checker work with wreaths of chain work
for the capitals upon the tops of the pillars; a net for the one
capital, and a net for the other capital.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Likewise he made pomegranates; in two rows round about upon the one
network, to cover the capital that was upon the top of the pillar; and
he did the same with the other capital.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Now the capitals that were upon the tops of the pillars in the
vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The capitals were upon the two pillars and also above the rounded
projection which was beside the network; there were two hundred
pomegranates, in two rows round about; and so with the other capital.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple; he set up the
pillar on the south and called its name Jachin; and he set up the
pillar on the north and called its name Bo'az.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And upon the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of
the pillars was finished.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to
brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its
circumference.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Under its brim were gourds, for thirty cubits, compassing the sea
round about; the gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was
cast.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west,
three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set upon them,
and all their hinder parts were inward.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the
brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` He also made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits
long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the
panels were set in the frames
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and
cherubim. Upon the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen,
there were wreaths of beveled work.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Moreover each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze; and
at the four corners were supports for a laver. The supports were cast,
with wreaths at the side of each.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Its opening was within a crown which projected upward one cubit;
its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep.
At its opening there were carvings; and its panels were square, not
round.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And the four wheels were underneath the panels; the axles of the
wheels were of one piece with the stands; and the height of a wheel was
a cubit and a half.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims,
their spokes, and their hubs, were all cast.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` There were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the
supports were of one piece with the stands.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit
high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one
piece with it.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved
cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with
wreaths round about.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` After this manner he made the ten stands; all of them were cast
alike, of the same measure and the same form.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver held forty baths, each
laver measured four cubits, and there was a laver for each of the ten
stands.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and
five on the north side of the house; and he set the sea on the
southeast corner of the house.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram
finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the
LORD:
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the
tops of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the
capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of
pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals
that were upon the pillars;
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` the ten stands, and the ten lavers upon the stands;
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the
house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished
bronze.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zarethan.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so
many of them; the weight of the bronze was not found out.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD:
the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence,
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the
north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the
tongs, of gold;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of
pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part
of the house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the nave of the
temple.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD
was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father
had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them
in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
7:1-2 - Solomon built his own palace, which took thirteen years to
complete. This contrasts sharply with the Temple, which took seven
years, indicating that Solomon's priority was serving God (see also
7:13-14 - Solomon called upon Hiram, a highly skilled craftsman, to
create the artistic details of the Temple. This shows that talented
human work, when dedicated to God, can be a means of glorifying Him
7:15-22 - The two bronze pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, were placed at
the entrance to the Temple. These pillars symbolize God's strength and
stability, sustaining His people and His plan of salvation (see also
7:23-26 - The Molten Sea, a large bronze basin, was made for the use of
the priests in the Temple. This reflects the importance of ritual
purity and sanctification before approaching God (see also
7:48-51 - All the Temple furnishings were finished and placed in the
sanctuary. The attention to detail in the objects of worship
demonstrates the reverence due to God and the importance of preparing
8:5).
