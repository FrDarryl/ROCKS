when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king.
Now I had not been sad in his presence.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And the king said to me, "Why is your face sad, seeing you are not
sick? This is nothing else but sadness of the heart." Then I was very
much afraid.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I said to the king, "Let the king live for ever! Why should not my
face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lies
waste, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then the king said to me, "For what do you make request?" So I
prayed to the God of heaven.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant
has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city
of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may rebuild it."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the king said to me (the queen sitting beside him), "How long
will you be gone, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to
send me; and I set him a time.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, let letters be
given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they
may let me pass through until I come to Judah;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may
give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the
temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house which I shall
occupy." And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my
God was upon me.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and
gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of
the army and horsemen.

'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; and I told no
one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no
beast with me but the beast on which I rode.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Jackal's Well and to
the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem which were broken
down and its gates which had been destroyed by fire.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool; but
there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall;
and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was
doing; and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the
officials, and the rest that were to do the work.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem
lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of
Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer disgrace."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And I told them of the hand of my God which had been upon me for
good, and also of the words which the king had spoken to me. And they
said, "Let us rise up and build." So they strengthened their hands for
the good work.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But when Sanbal'lat the Hor'onite and Tobi'ah the servant, the
Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they derided us and despised
us and said, "What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling
against the king?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then I replied to them, "The God of heaven will make us prosper,
and we his servants will arise and build; but you have no portion or
right or memorial in Jerusalem."
