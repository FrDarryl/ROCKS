[31]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the
month, the word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:
"Whom are you like in your greatness?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Behold, I will liken you to a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches
and forest shade, and of great height, its top among the clouds.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The waters nourished it, the deep made it grow tall, making its
rivers flow round the place of its planting, sending forth its streams
to all the trees of the forest.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So it towered high above all the trees of the forest; its boughs
grew large and its branches long, from abundant water in its shoots.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` All the birds of the air made their nests in its boughs; under its
branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and
under its shadow dwelt all great nations.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches;
for its roots went down to abundant waters.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor the fir
trees equal its boughs; the plane trees were as nothing compared with
its branches; no tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches, and all the trees
of Eden envied it, that were in the garden of God.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because it towered high and set
its top among the clouds, and its heart was proud of its height,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations; he
shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it
out.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Foreigners, the most terrible of the nations, will cut it down and
leave it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches will
fall, and its boughs will lie broken in all the watercourses of the
land; and all the peoples of the earth will go from its shadow and
leave it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Upon its ruin will dwell all the birds of the air, and upon its
branches will be all the beasts of the field.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to lofty
height or set their tops among the clouds, and that no trees that drink
water may reach up to them in height; for they are all given over to
death, to the nether world among mortal men, with those who go down to
the Pit.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "Thus says the Lord GOD: When it goes down to Sheol I will make the
deep mourn for it, and restrain its rivers, and many waters shall be
stopped; I will clothe Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of
the field shall faint because of it.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I will make the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast
it down to Sheol with those who go down to the Pit; and all the trees
of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, will be
comforted in the nether world.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They also shall go down to Sheol with it, to those who are slain by
the sword; yea, those who dwelt under its shadow among the nations
shall perish.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of
Eden? You shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether
world; you shall lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain
by the sword. "This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord
GOD."

31:1-9 - The allegory of the cedar tree of Lebanon is used to describe
Egypt, which, though great and strong, will be overthrown. The tree
symbolizes the Egyptian power, which was exalted but which, before God,
31:10-14 - The fall of the great tree (Egypt) will be a spectacle for
all nations, who will learn from God's judgment. The destruction of
human empires serves as a warning to all nations that no human
31:15-17 - The fall of Egypt will be like the fall of other great
nations that have fallen in the past. This reinforces the theme of the
ephemerality of human kingdoms and the fact that all are susceptible to
31:18:00 - Egypt, like the fallen tree, will be forgotten by all
nations, and its greatness will be remembered only by its fall. The
pride and self-sufficiency of powerful nations are temporary, for only
6:19-21).
