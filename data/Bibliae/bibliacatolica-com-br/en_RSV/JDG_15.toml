she? Pray take her instead."

to the Philistines, when I do them mischief."

"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches; and
he turned them tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of

burned her and her father with fire.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he smote them hip and thigh with great slaughter; and he went
down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.

on Lehi.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the men of Judah said, "Why have you come up against us?" They
said, "We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us."

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock
of Etam, and said to Samson, "Do you not know that the Philistines are
rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" And he

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And they said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may

'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` They said to him, "No; we will only bind you and give you into
their hands; we will not kill you." So they bound him with two new
ropes, and brought him up from the rock.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him;

were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds
melted off his hands.

seized it, and with it he slew a thousand men.

with the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his
hand; and that place was called Ra'math-le'hi.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he was very thirsty, and he called on the LORD and said, "Thou
hast granted this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant; and
shall I now die of thirst, and fall into the hands of the
uncircumcised?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and there came
water from it; and when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived.
Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkor'e; it is at Lehi to this
day.
