make him king.

Egypt, whither he had fled from King Solomon), then Jerobo'am returned
from Egypt.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` And they sent and called him; and Jerobo'am and all the assembly of
Israel came and said to Rehobo'am,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` "Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard
service of your father and his heavy yoke upon us, and we will serve
you."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He said to them, "Depart for three days, then come again to me." So
the people went away.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then King Rehobo'am took counsel with the old men, who had stood
before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, "How do you
advise me to answer this people?"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And they said to him, "If you will be a servant to this people today
and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then
they will be your servants for ever."

"8" = ''':sup:`8` But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he said to them, "What do you advise that we answer this people
who have said to me, `Lighten the yoke that your father put upon us'?"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus
shall you speak to this people who said to you, `Your father made our
yoke heavy, but do you lighten it for us'; thus shall you say to them,
`My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And now, whereas my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, I will add

chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So the king did not hearken to the people; for it was a turn of
affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfil his word, which
the LORD spoke by Ahi'jah the Shi'lonite to Jerobo'am the son of Nebat.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the
people answered the king, "What portion have we in David? We have no
inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to
your own house, David." So Israel departed to their tents.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But Rehobo'am reigned over the people of Israel who dwelt in the
cities of Judah.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then King Rehobo'am sent Ador'am, who was taskmaster over the
forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King
Rehobo'am made haste to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this
day.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And when all Israel heard that Jerobo'am had returned, they sent
and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There
was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Rehobo'am came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of
Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen
warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom
to Rehobo'am the son of Solomon.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the word of God came to Shemai'ah the man of God:
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "Say to Rehobo'am the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the
house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` `Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your
kinsmen the people of Israel. Return every man to his home, for this
thing is from me.'" So they hearkened to the word of the LORD, and went
home again, according to the word of the LORD.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Jerobo'am built Shechem in the hill country of E'phraim, and
dwelt there; and he went out from there and built Penu'el.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And Jerobo'am said in his heart, "Now the kingdom will turn back to
the house of David;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD
at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their
lord, to Rehobo'am king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to
Rehobo'am king of Judah."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold. And he said
to the people, "You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your
gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."

"29" = ''':sup:`29` And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` He also made houses on high places, and appointed priests from
among all the people, who were not of the Levites.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And Jerobo'am appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth

the altar; so he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had
made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he
had made.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the
fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month which he had devised of

12:1-5 - Solomon's son, Rehoboam, consults the people about the
workload imposed by his father. This consultation is crucial, as

12:6-11 - Rehoboam ignores the advice of his elders, choosing instead
to follow the advice of the young men who grew up with him, resulting
in a harsh decision against the people. This reflects the importance of
wisdom and prudence in leadership, and the disastrous consequences of
10:16).
12:12-15 - Rehoboam's harsh response to the people results in a revolt
among the northern tribes. Their rejection of wise counsel leads to the
dissolution of the kingdom, fulfilling the Lord's word given through
Ahijah to Jeroboam. The division is seen as part of God's judgment (see
12:16-19 - The ten tribes rebel against Rehoboam and secede from Judah,
forming the Northern Kingdom under Jeroboam. This marks the final
division of Israel into two kingdoms, a consequence of Solomon's
12:25-30 - Jeroboam sets up two golden calves to prevent the people
from going up to Jerusalem to worship, leading Israel into idolatry.
The establishment of rival shrines at Bethel and Dan marks the
