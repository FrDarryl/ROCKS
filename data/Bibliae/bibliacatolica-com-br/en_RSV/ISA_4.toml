Notas de rodapé:
4:2 - The “Branch of the Lord” will be glorious and beautiful. This
prophecy points to the coming of the Messiah and the spiritual
restoration of Israel, where true beauty is found in God (see also
4:3-4 - God will cleanse Jerusalem from sins, removing all impurity.
This renewal symbolizes the holiness God desires for His people and the
4:5 - God will be a covering over His people, protecting them like a
cloud and a flame. This imagery recalls God's protection in the
4:6 - The Lord will be a shelter and a refuge for His people,
protecting them from troubles and storms. This highlights God's loving
25:4).
