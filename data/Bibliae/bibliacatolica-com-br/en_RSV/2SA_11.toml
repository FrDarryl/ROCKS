"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the spring of the year, the time when kings go forth to battle,
David sent Jo'ab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they
ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at
Jerusalem.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and
was walking upon the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the
roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is not
this Bathshe'ba, the daughter of Eli'am, the wife of Uri'ah the
Hittite?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he
lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself from her uncleanness.)
Then she returned to her house.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, "I am with
child."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So David sent word to Jo'ab, "Send me Uri'ah the Hittite." And Jo'ab
sent Uri'ah to David.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Uri'ah came to him, David asked how Jo'ab was doing, and how
the people fared, and how the war prospered.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then David said to Uri'ah, "Go down to your house, and wash your
feet." And Uri'ah went out of the king's house, and there followed him
a present from the king.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But Uri'ah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When they told David, "Uri'ah did not go down to his house," David
said to Uri'ah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go
down to your house?"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Uri'ah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in
booths; and my lord Jo'ab and the servants of my lord are camping in
the open field; shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink, and
to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do
this thing."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then David said to Uri'ah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I
will let you depart." So Uri'ah remained in Jerusalem that day, and the
next.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so
that he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his
couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his
house.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` In the morning David wrote a letter to Jo'ab, and sent it by the
hand of Uri'ah.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` In the letter he wrote, "Set Uri'ah in the forefront of the hardest
fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and
die."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And as Jo'ab was besieging the city, he assigned Uri'ah to the
place where he knew there were valiant men.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the men of the city came out and fought with Jo'ab; and some of
the servants of David among the people fell. Uri'ah the Hittite was
slain also.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then Jo'ab sent and told David all the news about the fighting;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling
all the news about the fighting to the king,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, `Why did
you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would
shoot from the wall?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Who killed Abim'elech the son of Jerub'besheth? Did not a woman
cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at
Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, `Your
servant Uri'ah the Hittite is dead also.'"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Jo'ab had
sent him to tell.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us,
and came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the
entrance of the gate.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall; some of the
king's servants are dead; and your servant Uri'ah the Hittite is dead
also."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` David said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Jo'ab, `Do not
let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now
another; strengthen your attack upon the city, and overthrow it.' And
encourage him."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When the wife of Uri'ah heard that Uri'ah her husband was dead, she
made lamentation for her husband.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his
house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that
David had done displeased the LORD.

fails. His attempts to hide his sin only lead him to commit more
