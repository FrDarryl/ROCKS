"1" = ''':sup:`1` Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So David said to Jo'ab and the commanders of the army, "Go, number
Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know
their number."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But Jo'ab said, "May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as
many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's
servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should he bring
guilt upon Israel?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the king's word prevailed against Jo'ab. So Jo'ab departed and
went throughout all Israel, and came back to Jerusalem.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Jo'ab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In
all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the
sword, and in Judah four hundred and seventy thousand who drew the
sword.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the
king's command was abhorrent to Jo'ab.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But God was displeased with this thing, and he smote Israel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And David said to God, "I have sinned greatly in that I have done
this thing. But now, I pray thee, take away the iniquity of thy
servant; for I have done very foolishly."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` "Go and say to David, `Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer
you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.'"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So Gad came to David and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, `Take
which you will:
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` either three years of famine; or three months of devastation by
your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three
days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence upon the land, and the angel
of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.' Now
decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress; let me fall into
the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but let me not fall
into the hand of man."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell seventy
thousand men of Israel.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but when he was
about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he repented of the evil; and he
said to the destroying angel, "It is enough; now stay your hand." And
the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the
Jeb'usite.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing
between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out
over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell
upon their faces.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And David said to God, "Was it not I who gave command to number the
people? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly. But these
sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God,
be against me and against my father's house; but let not the plague be
upon thy people."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David that David
should go up and rear an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of
Ornan the Jeb'usite.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of
the LORD.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now Ornan was threshing wheat; he turned and saw the angel, and his
four sons who were with him hid themselves.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went forth
from the threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to
the ground.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And David said to Ornan, "Give me the site of the threshing floor
that I may build on it an altar to the LORD -- give it to me at its
full price -- that the plague may be averted from the people."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then Ornan said to David, "Take it; and let my lord the king do
what seems good to him; see, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and
the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for a cereal
offering. I give it all."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But King David said to Ornan, "No, but I will buy it for the full
price; I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt
offerings which cost me nothing."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the
site.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt
offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD, and he
answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then the LORD commanded the angel; and he put his sword back into
its sheath.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the
threshing floor of Ornan the Jeb'usite, he made his sacrifices there.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the
wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the
high place at Gibeon;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was
afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
21:1-2 - Satan incites David to take a census of Israel, revealing the
temptation to trust in human strength rather than divine providence.
This act is considered sinful because it expresses self-sufficiency and
3:5-6).
21:7-8 - After taking the census, David acknowledges his sin and seeks
God's forgiveness. His willingness to admit his wrongdoing and repent
is an example of humility and submission to God's will (see also
21:14-15 - God sends a plague on Israel as a result of David's sin, but
stops the destruction. This action reflects God's justice and mercy,
34:6-7 and Lamentations 3:22).
21:18-22 - David, instructed by the prophet Gad, purchases the
threshing floor of Ornan to build an altar to the Lord. This site later
becomes the Temple Mount, reinforcing the importance of sacrifice and
21:26-27 - When David offers sacrifices, God responds by sending fire
from heaven to consume the offering. This event reaffirms that God
accepts repentance and sincere sacrifice, and it is a reminder of the
18:38-39).
