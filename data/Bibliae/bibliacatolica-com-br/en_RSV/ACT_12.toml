"1" = ''':sup:`1` About that time Herod the king laid violent hands upon some who
belonged to the church.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He killed James the brother of John with the sword;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest
Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him
to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover
to bring him out to the people.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to
God by the church.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was
sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries
before the door were guarding the prison;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the
cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up
quickly." And the chains fell off his hands.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals."
And he did so. And he said to him, "Wrap your mantle around you and
follow me."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done
by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to
the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own
accord, and they went out and passed on through one street; and
immediately the angel left him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Peter came to himself, and said, "Now I am sure that the Lord
has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all
that the Jewish people were expecting."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of
John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and
were praying.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maid named Rhoda
came to answer.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but
ran in and told that Peter was standing at the gate.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They said to her, "You are mad." But she insisted that it was so.
They said, "It is his angel!"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened, they saw him
and were amazed.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to
them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell
this to James and to the brethren." Then he departed and went to
another place.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now when day came, there was no small stir among the soldiers over
what had become of Peter.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And when Herod had sought for him and could not find him, he
examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death.
Then he went down from Judea to Caesare'a, and remained there.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they
came to him in a body, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's
chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on
the king's country for food.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat
upon the throne, and made an oration to them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of man!"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give
God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and died.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But the word of God grew and multiplied.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had
fulfilled their mission, bringing with them John whose other name was
Mark.
