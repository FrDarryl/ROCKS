his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these signs of
mine among them,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` and that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your son's
son how I have made sport of the Egyptians and what signs I have done
among them; that you may know that I am the LORD."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, "Thus says
the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, `How long will you refuse to humble
yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring
locusts into your country,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see
the land; and they shall eat what is left to you after the hail, and
they shall eat every tree of yours which grows in the field,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and they shall fill your houses, and the houses of all your servants
and of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers
have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.'" Then he
turned and went out from Pharaoh.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long shall this man be a
snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God; do
you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh; and he said to
them, "Go, serve the LORD your God; but who are to go?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Moses said, "We will go with our young and our old; we will go
with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for we must
hold a feast to the LORD."

"10" = ''':sup:`10` And he said to them, "The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and
your little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` No! Go, the men among you, and serve the LORD, for that is what you
desire." And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land
of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt,
and eat every plant in the land, all that the hail has left."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the
LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that
night; and when it was morning the east wind had brought the locusts.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the locusts came up over all the land of Egypt, and settled on
the whole country of Egypt, such a dense swarm of locusts as had never
been before, nor ever shall be again.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For they covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was
darkened, and they ate all the plants in the land and all the fruit of
the trees which the hail had left; not a green thing remained, neither
tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, "I have
sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now therefore, forgive my sin, I pray you, only this once, and
entreat the LORD your God only to remove this death from me."

"18" = ''':sup:`18` So he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the LORD turned a very strong west wind, which lifted the
locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not a single locust was left
in all the country of Egypt.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the
children of Israel go.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven
that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness to be
felt."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick
darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;

"23" = ''':sup:`23` they did not see one another, nor did any rise from his place for
three days; but all the people of Israel had light where they dwelt.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then Pharaoh called Moses, and said, "Go, serve the LORD; your
children also may go with you; only let your flocks and your herds
remain behind."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But Moses said, "You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt
offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Our cattle also must go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind,
for we must take of them to serve the LORD our God, and we do not know
with what we must serve the LORD until we arrive there."

"27" = ''':sup:`27` But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them
go.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me; take heed to yourself;
never see my face again; for in the day you see my face you shall die."

Notas de rodap√©:
10:1-2 - God reveals to Moses that He is hardening Pharaoh's heart so
that the Israelites can tell future generations about the Lord's great
deeds. The memory of God's works is a central theme in shaping the
Deuteronomy 6:20-25).
10:3-6 - God sends the threat of the plague of locusts, warning Pharaoh
that Egypt will be devastated. This warning underscores God's mercy in
providing opportunities for repentance before judgment (see also
10:12-15 - Locusts invade Egypt, consuming everything left after the
hailstorm. This plague illustrates the utter destruction caused by
Pharaoh's refusal to obey God, a foretaste of final judgment (see also
10:16-20 - Pharaoh once again asks for forgiveness and pleads for the
plague to be removed, but hardens his heart after the locusts are
removed. This reflects the futility of superficial repentance without a
3:7-9).
10:21-23 - The plague of darkness covers Egypt for three days, while
the Israelites remain in the light. This symbolizes the separation
between those who follow God's light and those who walk in spiritual
