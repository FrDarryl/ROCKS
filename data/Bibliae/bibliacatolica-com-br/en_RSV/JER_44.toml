[44]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews that dwelt in
the land of Egypt, at Migdol, at Tah'panhes, at Memphis, and in the
land of Pathros,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all
the evil that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of
Judah. Behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in
them,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` because of the wickedness which they committed, provoking me to
anger, in that they went to burn incense and serve other gods that they
knew not, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying,
'Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate!'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their
wickedness and burn no incense to other gods.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured forth and kindled in the
cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a
waste and a desolation, as at this day.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And now thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do
you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man
and woman, infant and child, from the midst of Judah, leaving you no
remnant?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning
incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live,
that you may be cut off and become a curse and a taunt among all the
nations of the earth?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of
the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness,
and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of
Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` They have not humbled themselves even to this day, nor have they
feared, nor walked in my law and my statutes which I set before you and
before your fathers.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold,
I will set my face against you for evil, to cut off all Judah.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come
to the land of Egypt to live, and they shall all be consumed; in the
land of Egypt they shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall be
consumed; from the least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword
and by famine; and they shall become an execration, a horror, a curse,
and a taunt.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have
punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the
land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah,
to which they desire to return to dwell there; for they shall not
return, except some fugitives."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then all the men who knew that their wives had offered incense to
other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the
people who dwelt in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "As for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the
LORD, we will not listen to you.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But we will do everything that we have vowed, burn incense to the
queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, as we did, both we and
our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in
the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and
prospered, and saw no evil.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and
pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been
consumed by the sword and by famine."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the women said, "When we burned incense to the queen of heaven
and poured out libations to her, was it without our husbands' approval
that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out libations
to her?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people
who had given him this answer:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "As for the incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in
the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your
princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember it? Did
it not come into his mind?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The LORD could no longer bear your evil doings and the abominations
which you committed; therefore your land has become a desolation and a
waste and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` It is because you burned incense, and because you sinned against
the LORD and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in his law and
in his statutes and in his testimonies, that this evil has befallen
you, as at this day."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, "Hear the word
of the LORD, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives
have declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands,
saying, `We will surely perform our vows that we have made, to burn
incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out libations to her.' Then
confirm your vows and perform your vows!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who dwell in
the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the
LORD, that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of
Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, `As the Lord GOD lives.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Behold, I am watching over them for evil and not for good; all the
men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the
sword and by famine, until there is an end of them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt
to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who
came to the land of Egypt to live, shall know whose word will stand,
mine or theirs.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` This shall be the sign to you, says the LORD, that I will punish
you in this place, in order that you may know that my words will surely
stand against you for evil:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of
Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek
his life, as I gave Zedeki'ah king of Judah into the hand of
Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his
life."

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
44:1-10 - God reveals that the people of Judah, who went to Egypt, are
worshiping foreign gods. Idol worship reflects their alienation from
God and their spiritual blindness, as they seek protection in powerless
44:11-14 - God announces severe judgment for idolaters, stating that
they will not escape punishment. Idolatry brings destruction and ruin,
highlighting the consequences of rejecting God and His authority (see
44:15-19 - The people insist on continuing to worship the queen of
heaven, refusing to repent. This hardening of hearts in the face of
divine warning reflects the harsh reality of lack of repentance, which
44:20-30 - God reaffirms His judgment on Judah and announces that Egypt
will be delivered into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar. This demonstrates
God's sovereignty over the destinies of nations and how His justice is
47:1-15).
