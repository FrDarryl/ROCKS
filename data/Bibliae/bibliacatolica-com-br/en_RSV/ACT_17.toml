"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now when they had passed through Amphip'olis and Apollo'nia, they
came to Thessaloni'ca, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Paul went in, as was his custom, and for three weeks he argued
with them from the scriptures,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to
suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I
proclaim to you, is the Christ."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a
great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked fellows of the
rabble, they gathered a crowd, set the city in an uproar, and attacked
the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of
the brethren before the city authorities, crying, "These men who have
turned the world upside down have come here also,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and Jason has received them; and they are all acting against the
decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they
heard this.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let
them go.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to
Beroe'a; and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessaloni'ca, for
they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures
daily to see if these things were so.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high
standing as well as men.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But when the Jews of Thessaloni'ca learned that the word of God was
proclaimed by Paul at Beroe'a also, they came there too, stirring up
and inciting the crowds.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then the brethren immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea,
but Silas and Timothy remained there.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and
receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as
possible, they departed.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was
provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons,
and in the market place every day with those who chanced to be there.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers met him. And some
said, "What would this babbler say?" Others said, "He seems to be a
preacher of foreign divinities" -- because he preached Jesus and the
resurrection.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And they took hold of him and brought him to the Are-op'agus,
saying, "May we know what this new teaching is which you present?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For you bring some strange things to our ears; we wish to know
therefore what these things mean."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent
their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Paul, standing in the middle of the Are-op'agus, said: "Men of
Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I
found also an altar with this inscription, `To an unknown god.' What
therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of
heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by man,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything,
since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of
the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of
their habitation,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after
him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` for `In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of
your poets have said, `For we are indeed his offspring.'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Deity is
like gold, or silver, or stone, a representation by the art and
imagination of man.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men
everywhere to repent,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in
righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given
assurance to all men by raising him from the dead."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked;
but others said, "We will hear you again about this."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So Paul went out from among them.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionys'ius the
Are-op'agite and a woman named Dam'aris and others with them.

Notas de rodap√©:
17:2-3 - Paul, as he had often done, began preaching in the synagogues,
explaining the Scriptures and showing that the Messiah would have to
suffer. Paul's preaching emphasized the need to understand the
Scriptures in order to understand the plan of salvation (see also
17:22-23 - Paul addresses the Athenians, presenting the "unknown God"
as the true God, emphasizing that He does not dwell in temples made by
human hands. This discourse highlights the contrast between traditional
17:30-31 - Paul calls the Athenians to repentance, for God has
appointed a day of judgment. Jesus' resurrection is the foundation of
Corinthians 5:10).
17:34 - Some Athenians were converted to the gospel after hearing Paul,
reflecting the power of Christ's message to reach prepared hearts. The
conversion of Dionysius and Damaris is an example of God's grace in
