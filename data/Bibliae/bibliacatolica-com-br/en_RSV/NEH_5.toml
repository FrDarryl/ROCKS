"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives
against their Jewish brethren.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For there were those who said, "With our sons and our daughters, we
are many; let us get grain, that we may eat and keep alive."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` There were also those who said, "We are mortgaging our fields, our
vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And there were those who said, "We have borrowed money for the
king's tax upon our fields and our vineyards.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children are as
their children; yet we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be
slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved; but it is
not in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our
vineyards."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I took counsel with myself, and I brought charges against the nobles
and the officials. I said to them, "You are exacting interest, each
from his brother." And I held a great assembly against them,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and said to them, "We, as far as we are able, have bought back our
Jewish brethren who have been sold to the nations; but you even sell
your brethren that they may be sold to us!" They were silent, and could
not find a word to say.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So I said, "The thing that you are doing is not good. Ought you not
to walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations our
enemies?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Moreover I and my brethren and my servants are lending them money
and grain. Let us leave off this interest.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their
olive orchards, and their houses, and the hundredth of money, grain,
wine, and oil which you have been exacting of them."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then they said, "We will restore these and require nothing from
them. We will do as you say." And I called the priests, and took an
oath of them to do as they had promised.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I also shook out my lap and said, "So may God shake out every man
from his house and from his labor who does not perform this promise. So
may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said "Amen" and
praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in
the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of
Ar-ta-xerx'es the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brethren ate the
food allowance of the governor.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens upon the
people, and took from them food and wine, besides forty shekels of
silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do
so, because of the fear of God.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I also held to the work on this wall, and acquired no land; and all
my servants were gathered there for the work.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty men, Jews and
officials, besides those who came to us from the nations which were
about us.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice
sheep; fowls likewise were prepared for me, and every ten days skins of
wine in abundance; yet with all this I did not demand the food
allowance of the governor, because the servitude was heavy upon this
people.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this
people.
