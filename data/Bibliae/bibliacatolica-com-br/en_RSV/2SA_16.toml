"1" = ''':sup:`1` When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant
of Mephib'osheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, bearing two
hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of
summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And the king said to Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba
answered, "The asses are for the king's household to ride on, the bread
and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who
faint in the wilderness to drink."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And the king said, "And where is your master's son?" Ziba said to
the king, "Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, `Today the
house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.'"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belonged to
Mephib'osheth is now yours." And Ziba said, "I do obeisance; let me
ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When King David came to Bahu'rim, there came out a man of the family
of the house of Saul, whose name was Shim'e-i, the son of Gera; and as
he came he cursed continually.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of King David;
and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on
his left.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Shim'e-i said as he cursed, "Begone, begone, you man of blood,
you worthless fellow!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The LORD has avenged upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in
whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into
the hand of your son Ab'salom. See, your ruin is on you; for you are a
man of blood."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Abi'shai the son of Zeru'iah said to the king, "Why should this
dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But the king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of
Zeru'iah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, `Curse
David,' who then shall say, `Why have you done so?'"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And David said to Abi'shai and to all his servants, "Behold, my own
son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Let him
alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` It may be that the LORD will look upon my affliction, and that the
LORD will repay me with good for this cursing of me today."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So David and his men went on the road, while Shim'e-i went along on
the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, and threw stones at
him and flung dust.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary
at the Jordan; and there he refreshed himself.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Now Ab'salom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to
Jerusalem, and Ahith'ophel with him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Ab'salom,
Hushai said to Ab'salom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Ab'salom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend?
Why did you not go with your friend?"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And Hushai said to Ab'salom, "No; for whom the LORD and this people
and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I
will remain.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have
served your father, so I will serve you."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Ab'salom said to Ahith'ophel, "Give your counsel; what shall
we do?"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Ahith'ophel said to Ab'salom, "Go in to your father's concubines,
whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you
have made yourself odious to your father, and the hands of all who are
with you will be strengthened."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So they pitched a tent for Ab'salom upon the roof; and Ab'salom
went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now in those days the counsel which Ahith'ophel gave was as if one
consulted the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of Ahith'ophel
esteemed, both by David and by Ab'salom.
