"1" = ''':sup:`1` My brethren, show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For if a man with gold rings and in fine clothing comes into your
assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and
say, "Have a seat here, please," while you say to the poor man, "Stand
there," or, "Sit at my feet,"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges
with evil thoughts?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Listen, my beloved brethren. Has not God chosen those who are poor
in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has
promised to those who love him?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress
you, is it not they who drag you into court?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Is it not they who blaspheme that honorable name which was invoked
over you?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` If you really fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, "You
shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the
law as transgressors.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become
guilty of all of it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," said also, "Do not
kill." If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become a
transgressor of the law.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of
liberty.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; yet
mercy triumphs over judgment.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but
has not works? Can his faith save him?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled,"
without giving them the things needed for the body, what does it
profit?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But some one will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me
your faith apart from your works, and I by my works will show you my
faith.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe
-- and shudder.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Do you want to be shown, you shallow man, that faith apart from
works is barren?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his
son Isaac upon the altar?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was
completed by works,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and the scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God,
and it was reckoned to him as righteousness"; and he was called the
friend of God.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And in the same way was not also Rahab the harlot justified by
works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from
works is dead.

Notas de rodap√©:
2:1-7 - James warns against discrimination in church gatherings,
pointing out that God chose the poor to be rich in faith. Partiality
contradicts the love of Christ, which welcomes all equally (see also
2:8-13 - The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself is central
to the royal law of Christ. God's judgment is based on mercy, and
2:14-17 - James teaches that faith without works is dead. True faith is
demonstrated by concrete actions of love and service. The example of
Abraham and Rahab illustrates how faith and works must go together (see
2:18-20 - James challenges Christians to demonstrate their faith
through works. Faith without works is empty, and good works are the
3:18).
2:21-26 - James illustrates the relationship between faith and works
with the examples of Abraham and Rahab. Both demonstrated their faith
through bold and obedient actions toward God, reinforcing the truth
