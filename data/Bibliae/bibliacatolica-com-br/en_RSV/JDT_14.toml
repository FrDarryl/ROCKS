"4" = ''':sup:`4` and you and all who live within the borders of Israel shall pursue
them and cut them down as they flee.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` But before you do all this, bring Achior the Ammonite to me, and let
him see and recognize the man who despised the house of Israel and sent
him to us as if to his death."

"6" = ''':sup:`6` So they summoned Achior from the house of Uzziah. And when he came
and saw the head of Holofernes in the hand of one of the men at the
gathering of the people, he fell down on his face and his spirit failed
him.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when they raised him up he fell at Judith's feet, and knelt
before her, and said, "Blessed are you in every tent of Judah! In every

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Now tell me what you have done during these days." Then Judith

"11" = ''':sup:`11` As soon as it was dawn they hung the head of Holofernes on the

of all his personal affairs, "Wake up our lord, for the slaves have

"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when no one answered, he opened it and went into the bedchamber
and found him thrown down on the platform dead, with his head cut off
and missing.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he cried out with a loud voice and wept and groaned and
shouted, and rent his garments.
