"30" = ''':sup:`30` But passing through the midst of them he went away.

"34" = ''':sup:`34` "Ah! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come
to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God."

"35" = ''':sup:`35` But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"

"36" = ''':sup:`36` And they were all amazed and said to one another, "What is this
word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and

"37" = ''':sup:`37` And reports of him went out into every place in the surrounding
region.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's house. Now

But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they
knew that he was the Christ.

"42" = ''':sup:`42` And when it was day he departed and went into a lonely place. And
the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from
leaving them;
