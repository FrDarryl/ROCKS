"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy
to the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of
David, king of Israel, built; you need no longer carry it upon your
shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Prepare yourselves according to your fathers' houses by your

directions of Solomon his son.
'''

fathers' houses of your brethren the lay people, and let there be for
each a part of a father's house of the Levites.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for
your brethren, to do according to the word of the LORD by Moses."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Josi'ah contributed to the lay people, as passover offerings
for all that were present, lambs and kids from the flock to the number
of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls; these were from the
king's possessions.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And his princes contributed willingly to the people, to the priests,
and to the Levites. Hilki'ah, Zechari'ah, and Jehi'el, the chief

And so they did with the bulls.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And they roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the
ordinance; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and
in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests,
because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt
offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for
themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the people of Israel who were present kept the passover at that
time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of
Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Israel had kept such a
passover as was kept by Josi'ah, and the priests and the Levites, and
all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josi'ah this passover was
kept.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` After all this, when Josi'ah had prepared the temple, Neco king of
Egypt went up to fight at Car'chemish on the Euphra'tes and Josi'ah
went out against him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But he sent envoys to him, saying, "What have we to do with each
other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against
the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make
haste. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Nevertheless Josi'ah would not turn away from him, but disguised
himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of
Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megid'do.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the archers shot King Josi'ah; and the king said to his
servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his
second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was
buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for
Josi'ah.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josi'ah; and all the singing men
and singing women have spoken of Josi'ah in their laments to this day.
They made these an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the
Laments.
