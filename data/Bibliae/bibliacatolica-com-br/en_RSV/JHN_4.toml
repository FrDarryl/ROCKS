"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was
making and baptizing more disciples than John
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he left Judea and departed again to Galilee.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He had to pass through Samar'ia.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he came to a city of Samar'ia, called Sy'char, near the field
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Jacob's well was there, and so Jesus, wearied as he was with his
journey, sat down beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` There came a woman of Samar'ia to draw water. Jesus said to her,
"Give me a drink."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, ask a
drink of me, a woman of Samar'ia?" For Jews have no dealings with
Samaritans.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is
that is saying to you, `Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and
he would have given you living water."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the
well is deep; where do you get that living water?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and
drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Jesus said to her, "Every one who drinks of this water will thirst
again,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never
thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of
water welling up to eternal life."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not
thirst, nor come here to draw."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The woman answered him, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her,
"You are right in saying, `I have no husband';
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not
your husband; this you said truly."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say that in
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when
neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for
salvation is from the Jews.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to
worship him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and
truth."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming (he who is
called Christ); when he comes, he will show us all things."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Just then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking
with a woman, but none said, "What do you wish?" or, "Why are you
talking with her?"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and
said to the people,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` "Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the
Christ?"
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` They went out of the city and were coming to him.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Meanwhile the disciples besought him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But he said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So the disciples said to one another, "Has any one brought him
food?"
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me,
and to accomplish his work.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Do you not say, `There are yet four months, then comes the
harvest'? I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see how the fields are
already white for harvest.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so
that sower and reaper may rejoice together.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For here the saying holds true, `One sows and another reaps.'
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor; others have
labored, and you have entered into their labor."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the
woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with
them; and he stayed there two days.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And many more believed because of his word.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` They said to the woman, "It is no longer because of your words that
we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is
indeed the Savior of the world."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` After the two days he departed to Galilee.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own
country.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen
all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone
to the feast.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water
wine. And at Caper'na-um there was an official whose son was ill.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went
and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point
of death.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders you
will not believe."
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` The official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Jesus said to him, "Go; your son will live." The man believed the
word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his
son was living.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` So he asked them the hour when he began to mend, and they said to
him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your
son will live"; and he himself believed, and all his household.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from
Judea to Galilee.
