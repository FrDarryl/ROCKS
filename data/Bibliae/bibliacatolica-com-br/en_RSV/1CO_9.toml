"1" = ''':sup:`1` Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?
Are not you my workmanship in the Lord?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you; for you are
the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` This is my defense to those who would examine me.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Do we not have the right to our food and drink?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a wife, as the other
apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from
working for a living?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard
without eating any of its fruit? Who tends a flock without getting some
of the milk?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Do I say this on human authority? Does not the law say the same?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox
when it is treading out the grain." Is it for oxen that God is
concerned?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our
sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh
in hope of a share in the crop.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` If we have sown spiritual good among you, is it too much if we reap
your material benefits?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` If others share this rightful claim upon you, do not we still more?
Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure
anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of
Christ.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service
get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share
in the sacrificial offerings?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the
gospel should get their living by the gospel.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing
this to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have any
one deprive me of my ground for boasting.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting.
For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my
own will, I am entrusted with a commission.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` What then is my reward? Just this: that in my preaching I may make
the gospel free of charge, not making full use of my right in the
gospel.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to
all, that I might win the more.

the law I became as one under the law -- though not being myself under
the law -- that I might win those under the law.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` To those outside the law I became as one outside the law -- not
being without law toward God but under the law of Christ -- that I
might win those outside the law.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become
all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

blessings.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but only
one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to
receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Well, I do not run aimlessly, I do not box as one beating the air;

"27" = ''':sup:`27` but I pommel my body and subdue it, lest after preaching to others
I myself should be disqualified.
