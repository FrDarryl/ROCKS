"1" = ''':sup:`1` King Nebuchadnez'zar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty
cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura,
in the province of Babylon.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then King Nebuchadnez'zar sent to assemble the satraps, the
prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the
justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to
come to the dedication of the image which King Nebuchadnez'zar had set
up.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors,
the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of
the provinces, were assembled for the dedication of the image that King
Nebuchadnez'zar had set up; and they stood before the image that
Nebuchadnez'zar had set up.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the herald proclaimed aloud, "You are commanded, O peoples,
nations, and languages,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp,
bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the
golden image that King Nebuchadnez'zar has set up;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast
into a burning fiery furnace."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn,
pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the
peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden
image which King Nebuchadnez'zar had set up.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Therefore at that time certain Chalde'ans came forward and
maliciously accused the Jews.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` They said to King Nebuchadnez'zar, "O king, live for ever!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound
of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of
music, shall fall down and worship the golden image;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a
burning fiery furnace.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of
the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego. These men, O
king, pay no heed to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the
golden image which you have set up."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Nebuchadnez'zar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed'nego be brought. Then they brought these men before
the king.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Nebuchadnez'zar said to them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed'nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image
which I have set up?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe,
lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and
worship the image which I have made, well and good; but if you do not
worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace;
and who is the god that will deliver you out of my hands?"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego answered the king, "O
Nebuchadnez'zar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your
gods or worship the golden image which you have set up."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Nebuchadnez'zar was full of fury, and the expression of his
face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego. He ordered
the furnace heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he ordered certain mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed'nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery
furnace.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then these men were bound in their mantles, their tunics, their
hats, and their other garments, and they were cast into the burning
fiery furnace.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Because the king's order was strict and the furnace very hot, the
flame of the fire slew those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed'nego.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, fell bound
into the burning fiery furnace.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then King Nebuchadnez'zar was astonished and rose up in haste. He
said to his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the
fire?" They answered the king, "True, O king."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He answered, "But I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the
fire, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a
son of the gods."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then Nebuchadnez'zar came near to the door of the burning fiery
furnace and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego, servants of the
Most High God, come forth, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed'nego came out from the fire.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's
counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any
power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not
singed, their mantles were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come
upon them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Nebuchadnez'zar said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed'nego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who
trusted in him, and set at nought the king's command, and yielded up
their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own
God.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that
speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego
shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there
is no other god who is able to deliver in this way."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed'nego in the
province of Babylon.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then Azariah stood and offered this prayer; in the midst of the
fire he opened his mouth and said:
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` "Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and worthy of
praise; and thy name is glorified for ever.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy
works are true and thy ways right, and all thy judgments are truth.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Thou hast executed true judgments in all that thou hast brought
upon us and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers, for in truth
and justice thou hast brought all this upon us because of our sins.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` For we have sinfully and lawlessly departed from thee, and have
sinned in all things and have not obeyed thy commandments;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` we have not observed them or done them, as thou hast commanded us
that it might go well with us.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` So all that thou hast brought upon us, and all that thou hast done
to us, thou hast done in true judgment.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Thou hast given us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful
rebels, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And now we cannot open our mouths; shame and disgrace have befallen
thy servants and worshipers.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` For thy name's sake do not give us up utterly, and do not break thy
covenant,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` and do not withdraw thy mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham thy
beloved and for the sake of Isaac thy servant and Israel thy holy one,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` to whom thou didst promise to make their descendants as many as the
stars of heaven and as the sand on the shore of the sea.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any nation, and are brought
low this day in all the world because of our sins.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader, no
burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, no place to make
an offering before thee or to find mercy.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit may we be accepted,
as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls, and with tens
of thousands of fat lambs;
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` such may our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and may we wholly
follow thee, for there will be no shame for those who trust in thee.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And now with all our heart we follow thee, we fear thee and seek
thy face.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Do not put us to shame, but deal with us in thy forbearance and in
thy abundant mercy.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Deliver us in accordance with thy marvelous works, and give glory
to thy name, O Lord! Let all who do harm to thy servants be put to
shame;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` let them be disgraced and deprived of all power and dominion, and
let their strength be broken.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, glorious over
the whole world."
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Now the king's servants who threw them in did not cease feeding the
furnace fires with naphtha, pitch, tow, and brush.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` And the flame streamed out above the furnace forty-nine cubits,
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` and it broke through and burned those of the Chaldeans whom it
caught about the furnace.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to be with
Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the
furnace,
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` and made the midst of the furnace like a moist whistling wind, so
that the fire did not touch them at all or hurt or trouble them.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` Then the three, as with one mouth, praised and glorified and
blessed God in the furnace, saying:
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` "Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers, and to be praised
and highly exalted for ever;

"59" = ''':sup:`59` And blessed is thy glorious, holy name and to be highly praised and
highly exalted for ever;

and highly glorified for ever.

deeps, and to be praised and highly exalted for ever.

glorified for ever.
