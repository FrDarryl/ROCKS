"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then came David to Nob to Ahim'elech the priest; and Ahim'elech came
to meet David trembling, and said to him, "Why are you alone, and no
one with you?"
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And David said to Ahim'elech the priest, "The king has charged me
with a matter, and said to me, `Let no one know anything of the matter
about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.' I have made
an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now then, what have you at hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or
whatever is here."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the priest answered David, "I have no common bread at hand, but
there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from
women."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And David answered the priest, "Of a truth women have been kept from
us as always when I go on an expedition; the vessels of the young men
are holy, even when it is a common journey; how much more today will
their vessels be holy?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So the priest gave him the holy bread; for there was no bread there
but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD,
to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
detained before the LORD; his name was Do'eg the E'domite, the chief of
Saul's herdsmen.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And David said to Ahim'elech, "And have you not here a spear or a
sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with
me, because the king's business required haste."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you
killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth
behind the ephod; if you will take that, take it, for there is none but
that here." And David said, "There is none like that; give it to me."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And David rose and fled that day from Saul, and went to A'chish the
king of Gath.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the servants of A'chish said to him, "Is not this David the
king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances,
`Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And David took these words to heart, and was much afraid of A'chish
the king of Gath.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in
their hands, and made marks on the doors of the gate, and let his
spittle run down his beard.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then said A'chish to his servants, "Lo, you see the man is mad; why
then have you brought him to me?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the
madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"
