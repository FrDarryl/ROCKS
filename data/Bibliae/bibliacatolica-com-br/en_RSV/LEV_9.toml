"5" = ''':sup:`5` And they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of meeting;
and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD commanded you to
do; and the glory of the LORD will appear to you."

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar, and offer your
sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself
and for the people; and bring the offering of the people, and make
atonement for them; as the LORD has commanded."

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And they delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and
the head; and he burned them upon the altar.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the
burnt offering on the altar.

the ordinance.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he presented the cereal offering, and filled his hand from it,
and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the
morning.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` He killed the ox also and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings
for the people; and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he
threw upon the altar round about,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which
covers the entrails, and the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver;

"20" = ''':sup:`20` and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat upon
the altar,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering
before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them;
and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering
and the peace offerings.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting; and when they
came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to
all the people.

"24" = ''':sup:`24` And fire came forth from before the LORD and consumed the burnt
offering and the fat upon the altar; and when all the people saw it,
they shouted, and fell on their faces.
