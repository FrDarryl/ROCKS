"1" = ''':sup:`1` What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may
abound?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ
Jesus were baptized into his death?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as
Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too
might walk in newness of life.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall
certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the sinful
body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For he who has died is freed from sin.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
with him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For we know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die
again; death no longer has dominion over him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he
lives he lives to God.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God
in Christ Jesus.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey
their passions.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but
yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to
life, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law
but under grace.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under
grace? By no means!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one as obedient
slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which
leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have
become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you
were committed,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of
righteousness.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations.
For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater
and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for
sanctification.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to
righteousness.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But then what return did you get from the things of which you are
now ashamed? The end of those things is death.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves
of God, the return you get is sanctification and its end, eternal life.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal
life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - God's grace should not be used as an excuse for sin, because as
Christians, we have died to sin. Life transformation is evidenced by
6:3-4 - Baptism symbolizes union with Christ in His death and
resurrection, being an act of rebirth to a new life in Christ (see also
6:6-7 - The old human nature was crucified with Christ, so that we are
now freed from the dominion of sin. Justification brings the freedom to
4:22-24).
6:12-14 - The Christian must not allow sin to reign in his mortal body,
but instead offer himself to God as an instrument of righteousness.
Corinthians 6:19-20).
06:23 - The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus. This verse is a crucial contrast between the fate of
3:16).
