"1" = ''':sup:`1` And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight
course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Pat'ara.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And having found a ship crossing to Phoeni'cia, we went aboard, and
set sail.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we
sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload
its cargo.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days.
Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when our days there were ended, we departed and went on our
journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way
till we were outside the city; and kneeling down on the beach we prayed
and bade one another farewell.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolema'is;
and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for one day.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` On the morrow we departed and came to Caesare'a; and we entered the
house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed
with him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` While we were staying for some days, a prophet named Ag'abus came
down from Judea.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and
hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, `So shall the Jews at
Jerusalem bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the
hands of the Gentiles.'"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up
to Jerusalem.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my
heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at
Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, "The will
of the Lord be done."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` After these days we made ready and went up to Jerusalem.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And some of the disciples from Caesare'a went with us, bringing us
to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we
should lodge.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` On the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the
elders were present.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had
done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him,
"You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those
who have believed; they are all zealous for the law,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who
are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise
their children or observe the customs.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have
come.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a
vow;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their
expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that
there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you
yourself live in observance of the law.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter
with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been
sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from
unchastity."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with
them and went into the temple, to give notice when the days of
purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for every
one of them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, who
had seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd, and laid hands on
him,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching
men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; moreover
he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy
place."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For they had previously seen Troph'imus the Ephesian with him in
the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then all the city was aroused, and the people ran together; they
seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates
were shut.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And as they were trying to kill him, word came to the tribune of
the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He at once took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and
when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then the tribune came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be
bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another; and as he could
not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought
into the barracks.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the
soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` for the mob of the people followed, crying, "Away with him!"
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the
tribune, "May I say something to you?" And he said, "Do you know Greek?
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt
and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the
wilderness?"
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Paul replied, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cili'cia, a citizen of no
mean city; I beg you, let me speak to the people."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the steps,
motioned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great hush,
he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:
