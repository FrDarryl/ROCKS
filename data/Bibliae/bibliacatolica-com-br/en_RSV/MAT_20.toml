"1" = ''':sup:`1` "For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early
in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them
into his vineyard.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in
the market place;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and to them he said, `You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is
right I will give you.' So they went.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the
same.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing;
and he said to them, `Why do you stand here idle all day?'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` They said to him, `Because no one has hired us.' He said to them,
`You go into the vineyard too.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his
steward, `Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with
the last, up to the first.'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them
received a denarius.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but
each of them also received a denarius.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` saying, `These last worked only one hour, and you have made them
equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching
heat.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But he replied to one of them, `Friend, I am doing you no wrong;
did you not agree with me for a denarius?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Take what belongs to you, and go; I choose to give to this last as
I give to you.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do
you begrudge my generosity?'
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So the last will be first, and the first last."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve
disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be
delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him
to death,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and
crucified, and he will be raised on the third day."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then the mother of the sons of Zeb'edee came up to him, with her
sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And he said to her, "What do you want?" She said to him, "Command
that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at
your left, in your kingdom."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But Jesus answered, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you
able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We are
able."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He said to them, "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right
hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom
it has been prepared by my Father."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of
the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority
over them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` It shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you
must be your servant,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and whoever would be first among you must be your slave;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve, and to
give his life as a ransom for many."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard
that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent; but they cried
out the more, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to
do for you?"
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` They said to him, "Lord, let our eyes be opened."

"34" = ''':sup:`34` And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they received
their sight and followed him.
