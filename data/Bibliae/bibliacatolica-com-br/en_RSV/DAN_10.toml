'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I ate no delicacies, no meat or wine entered my mouth, nor did I
anoint myself at all, for the full three weeks.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on
the bank of the great river, that is, the Tigris,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen,
whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` His body was like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning,
his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of
burnished bronze, and the sound of his words like the noise of a
multitude.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me
did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they
fled to hide themselves.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was
left in me; my radiant appearance was fearfully changed, and I retained
no strength.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of
his words, I fell on my face in a deep sleep with my face to the
ground.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and
knees.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And he said to me, "O Daniel, man greatly beloved, give heed to the
words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for now I have been sent
to you." While he was speaking this word to me, I stood up trembling.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then he said to me, "Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that
you set your mind to understand and humbled yourself before your God,
your words have been heard, and I have come because of your words.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days;
but Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, so I left him
there with the prince of the kingdom of Persia
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and came to make you understand what is to befall your people in
the latter days. For the vision is for days yet to come."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face
toward the ground and was dumb.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips;
then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, "O
my lord, by reason of the vision pains have come upon me, and I retain
no strength.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` How can my lord's servant talk with my lord? For now no strength
remains in me, and no breath is left in me."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Again one having the appearance of a man touched me and
strengthened me.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he said, "O man greatly beloved, fear not, peace be with you;
be strong and of good courage." And when he spoke to me, I was
strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened
me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? But now I will
return to fight against the prince of Persia; and when I am through
with him, lo, the prince of Greece will come.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But I will tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth: there
is none who contends by my side against these except Michael, your
prince.
