beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He digged it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice

grapes.

you, between me and my vineyard.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done in
it? When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?

its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it
shall be trampled down.

and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain
no rain upon it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and

strong drink, who tarry late into the evening till wine inflames them!

feasts; but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD, or see the work
of his hands.

honored men are dying of hunger, and their multitude is parched with
thirst.

beyond measure, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go

"23" = ''':sup:`23` who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his
right!

"24" = ''':sup:`24` Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry
grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and
their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the
LORD of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and
he stretched out his hand against them and smote them, and the
mountains quaked; and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the
streets. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is
stretched out still.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` He will raise a signal for a nation afar off, and whistle for it
from the ends of the earth; and lo, swiftly, speedily it comes!

And if one look to the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the
light is darkened by its clouds.
