'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And the people contended with Moses, and said, "Would that we had

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Why have you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this
evil place? It is no place for grain, or figs, or vines, or
pomegranates; and there is no water to drink."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the
door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces. And the glory of
the LORD appeared to them,

"8" = ''':sup:`8` "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your
brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water; so you

the congregation and their cattle."

and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water
for you out of this rock?"

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not believe

you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given
them."

contended with the LORD, and he showed himself holy among them.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, "Thus says
your brother Israel: You know all the adversity that has befallen us:

"15" = ''':sup:`15` how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long
time; and the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our fathers;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an
angel and brought us forth out of Egypt; and here we are in Kadesh, a
city on the edge of your territory.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field
or vineyard, neither will we drink water from a well; we will go along
the King's Highway, we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the
left, until we have passed through your territory."

"18" = ''':sup:`18` But Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through, lest I come out

highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my cattle, then I will
pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing more."

"20" = ''':sup:`20` But he said, "You shall not pass through." And Edom came out
against them with many men, and with a strong force.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so
Israel turned away from him.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the people of Israel, the whole
congregation, came to Mount Hor.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of
the land of Edom,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter the
land which I have given to the people of Israel, because you rebelled
against my command at the waters of Mer'ibah.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Take Aaron and Elea'zar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;

leaders are held accountable for their actions (see also Deuteronomy
20:14-21 - The Edomites deny passage to the Israelites, despite being
