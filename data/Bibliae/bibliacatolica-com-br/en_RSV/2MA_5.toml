"1" = ''':sup:`1` About this time Antiochus made his second invasion of Egypt.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And it happened that over all the city, for almost forty days, there
appeared golden-clad horsemen charging through the air, in companies
fully armed with lances and drawn swords --
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` troops of horsemen drawn up, attacks and counterattacks made on this
side and on that, brandishing of shields, massing of spears, hurling of
missiles, the flash of golden trappings, and armor of all sorts.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Therefore all men prayed that the apparition might prove to have
been a good omen.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When a false rumor arose that Antiochus was dead, Jason took no less
than a thousand men and suddenly made an assault upon the city. When
the troops upon the wall had been forced back and at last the city was
being taken, Menelaus took refuge in the citadel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But Jason kept relentlessly slaughtering his fellow citizens, not
realizing that success at the cost of one's kindred is the greatest
misfortune, but imagining that he was setting up trophies of victory
over enemies and not over fellow countrymen.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He did not gain control of the government, however; and in the end
got only disgrace from his conspiracy, and fled again into the country
of the Ammonites.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Finally he met a miserable end. Accused before Aretas the ruler of
the Arabs, fleeing from city to city, pursued by all men, hated as a
rebel against the laws, and abhorred as the executioner of his country
and his fellow citizens, he was cast ashore in Egypt;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and he who had driven many from their own country into exile died in
exile, having embarked to go to the Lacedaemonians in hope of finding
protection because of their kinship.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He who had cast out many to lie unburied had no one to mourn for
him; he had no funeral of any sort and no place in the tomb of his
fathers.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When news of what had happened reached the king, he took it to mean
that Judea was in revolt. So, raging inwardly, he left Egypt and took
the city by storm.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he commanded his soldiers to cut down relentlessly every one
they met and to slay those who went into the houses.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then there was killing of young and old, destruction of boys,
women, and children, and slaughter of virgins and infants.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Within the total of three days eighty thousand were destroyed,
forty thousand in hand-to-hand fighting; and as many were sold into
slavery as were slain.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Not content with this, Antiochus dared to enter the most holy
temple in all the world, guided by Menelaus, who had become a traitor
both to the laws and to his country.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He took the holy vessels with his polluted hands, and swept away
with profane hands the votive offerings which other kings had made to
enhance the glory and honor of the place.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Antiochus was elated in spirit, and did not perceive that the Lord
was angered for a little while because of the sins of those who dwelt
in the city, and that therefore he was disregarding the holy place.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But if it had not happened that they were involved in many sins,
this man would have been scourged and turned back from his rash act as
soon as he came forward, just as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king
sent to inspect the treasury.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But the Lord did not choose the nation for the sake of the holy
place, but the place for the sake of the nation.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Therefore the place itself shared in the misfortunes that befell
the nation and afterward participated in its benefits; and what was
forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty was restored again in all its
glory when the great Lord became reconciled.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Antiochus carried off eighteen hundred talents from the temple,
and hurried away to Antioch, thinking in his arrogance that he could
sail on the land and walk on the sea, because his mind was elated.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And he left governors to afflict the people: at Jerusalem, Philip,
by birth a Phrygian and in character more barbarous than the man who
appointed him;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and at Gerizim, Andronicus; and besides these Menelaus, who lorded
it over his fellow citizens worse than the others did. In his malice
toward the Jewish citizens,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Antiochus sent Apollonius, the captain of the Mysians, with an army
of twenty-two thousand, and commanded him to slay all the grown men and
to sell the women and boys as slaves.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When this man arrived in Jerusalem, he pretended to be peaceably
disposed and waited until the holy sabbath day; then, finding the Jews
not at work, he ordered his men to parade under arms.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` He put to the sword all those who came out to see them, then rushed
into the city with his armed men and killed great numbers of people.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But Judas Maccabeus, with about nine others, got away to the
wilderness, and kept himself and his companions alive in the mountains
as wild animals do; they continued to live on what grew wild, so that
they might not share in the defilement.
