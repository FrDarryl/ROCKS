10:1-2 - Ezekiel sees God's glory departing from the temple. The
departure of God's glory symbolizes God's disapproval of the corruption
of the temple and the city of Jerusalem. This reflects the gravity of
sin and the loss of God's presence when the people turn away from God
10:3-5 - The vision of the heavenly chariot with the cherubim
highlights God's sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. The
presence of the cherubim also symbolizes God's majesty and power in all
10:6-7 - God's command to destroy the city is given to armed men. This
reveals the seriousness of God's judgment and justice in punishing
wickedness, while also emphasizing the precise execution of God's plan
10:8-11 - The appearance of the cherubim and the vision of God's throne
reinforce the idea that God is majestic and sovereign. This imagery
conveys the reverence and awe we should have before His presence (see
