[6]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` A copy of a letter which Jeremiah sent to those who were to be taken
to Babylon as captives by the king of the Babylonians, to give them the
message which God had commanded him.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Because of the sins which you have committed before God, you will be
taken to Babylon as captives by Nebuchadnezzar, king of the
Babylonians.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Therefore when you have come to Babylon you will remain there for
many years, for a long time, up to seven generations; after that I will
bring you away from there in peace.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now in Babylon you will see gods made of silver and gold and wood,
which are carried on men's shoulders and inspire fear in the heathen.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So take care not to become at all like the foreigners or to let fear
for these gods possess you, when you see the multitude before and
behind them worshiping them.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But say in your heart, "It is thou, O Lord, whom we must worship."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For my angel is with you, and he is watching your lives.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Their tongues are smoothed by the craftsman, and they themselves are
overlaid with gold and silver; but they are false and cannot speak.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` People take gold and make crowns for the heads of their gods, as
they would for a girl who loves ornaments;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and sometimes the priests secretly take gold and silver from their
gods and spend it upon themselves,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and even give some of it to the harlots in the brothel. They deck
their gods out with garments like men -- these gods of silver and gold
and wood,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` which cannot save themselves from rust and corrosion. When they
have been dressed in purple robes,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` their faces are wiped because of the dust from the temple, which is
thick upon them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Like a local ruler the god holds a scepter, though unable to
destroy any one who offends it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` It has a dagger in its right hand, and has an axe; but it cannot
save itself from war and robbers.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Therefore they evidently are not gods; so do not fear them.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For just as one's dish is useless when it is broken, so are the
gods of the heathen, when they have been set up in the temples. Their
eyes are full of the dust raised by the feet of those who enter.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And just as the gates are shut on every side upon a man who has
offended a king, as though he were sentenced to death, so the priests
make their temples secure with doors and locks and bars, in order that
they may not be plundered by robbers.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They light lamps, even more than they light for themselves, though
their gods can see none of them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` They are just like a beam of the temple, but men say their hearts
have melted, when worms from the earth devour them and their robes.
They do not notice
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` when their faces have been blackened by the smoke of the temple.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Bats, swallows, and birds light on their bodies and heads; and so
do cats.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` From this you will know that they are not gods; so do not fear
them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As for the gold which they wear for beauty -- they will not shine
unless some one wipes off the rust; for even when they were being cast,
they had no feeling.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` They are bought at any cost, but there is no breath in them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Having no feet, they are carried on men's shoulders, revealing to
mankind their worthlessness.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And those who serve them are ashamed because through them these
gods are made to stand, lest they fall to the ground. If any one sets
one of them upright, it cannot move itself; and if it is tipped over,
it cannot straighten itself; but gifts are placed before them just as
before the dead.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The priests sell the sacrifices that are offered to these gods and
use the money; and likewise their wives preserve some with salt, but
give none to the poor or helpless.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Sacrifices to them may be touched by women in menstruation or at
childbirth. Since you know by these things that they are not gods, do
not fear them.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For why should they be called gods? Women serve meals for gods of
silver and gold and wood;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and in their temples the priests sit with their clothes rent, their
heads and beards shaved, and their heads uncovered.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` They howl and shout before their gods as some do at a funeral feast
for a man who has died.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The priests take some of the clothing of their gods to clothe their
wives and children.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Whether one does evil to them or good, they will not be able to
repay it. They cannot set up a king or depose one.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Likewise they are not able to give either wealth or money; if one
makes a vow to them and does not keep it, they will not require it.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` They cannot save a man from death or rescue the weak from the
strong.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` They cannot restore sight to a blind man; they cannot rescue a man
who is in distress.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` They cannot take pity on a widow or do good to an orphan.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` These things that are made of wood and overlaid with gold and
silver are like stones from the mountain, and those who serve them will
be put to shame.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Why then must any one think that they are gods, or call them gods?
Besides, even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` for when they see a dumb man, who cannot speak, they bring him and
pray Bel that the man may speak, as though Bel were able to understand.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Yet they themselves cannot perceive this and abandon them, for they
have no sense.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And the women, with cords about them, sit along the passageways,
burning bran for incense; and when one of them is led off by one of the
passers-by and is lain with, she derides the woman next to her, because
she was not as attractive as herself and her cord was not broken.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Whatever is done for them is false. Why then must any one think
that they are gods, or call them gods?
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` They are made by carpenters and goldsmiths; they can be nothing but
what the craftsmen wish them to be.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` The men that make them will certainly not live very long
themselves; how then can the things that are made by them be gods?
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` They have left only lies and reproach for those who come after.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` For when war or calamity comes upon them, the priests consult
together as to where they can hide themselves and their gods.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` How then can one fail to see that these are not gods, for they
cannot save themselves from war or calamity?
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Since they are made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver, it
will afterward be known that they are false.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` It will be manifest to all the nations and kings that they are not
gods but the work of men's hands, and that there is no work of God in
them.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Who then can fail to know that they are not gods?
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` For they cannot set up a king over a country or give rain to men.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` They cannot judge their own cause or deliver one who is wronged,
for they have no power; they are like crows between heaven and earth.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` When fire breaks out in a temple of wooden gods overlaid with gold
or silver, their priests will flee and escape, but the gods will be
burnt in two like beams.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` Besides, they can offer no resistance to a king or any enemies. Why
then must any one admit or think that they are gods?
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` Gods made of wood and overlaid with silver and gold are not able to
save themselves from thieves and robbers.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Strong men will strip them of their gold and silver and of the
robes they wear, and go off with this booty, and they will not be able
to help themselves.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` So it is better to be a king who shows his courage, or a household
utensil that serves its owner's need, than to be these false gods;
better even the door of a house that protects its contents, than these
false gods; better also a wooden pillar in a palace, than these false
gods.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` For sun and moon and stars, shining and sent forth for service, are
obedient.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` So also the lightning, when it flashes, is widely seen; and the
wind likewise blows in every land.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` When God commands the clouds to go over the whole world, they carry
out his command.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` And the fire sent from above to consume mountains and woods does
what it is ordered. But these idols are not to be compared with them in
appearance or power.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` Therefore one must not think that they are gods nor call them gods,
for they are not able either to decide a case or to do good to men.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` Since you know then that they are not gods, do not fear them.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` For they can neither curse nor bless kings;
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` they cannot show signs in the heavens and among the nations, or
shine like the sun or give light like the moon.
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` The wild beasts are better than they are, for they can flee to
cover and help themselves.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` So we have no evidence whatever that they are gods; therefore do
not fear them.
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` Like a scarecrow in a cucumber bed, that guards nothing, so are
their gods of wood, overlaid with gold and silver.
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` In the same way, their gods of wood, overlaid with gold and silver,
and like a thorn bush in a garden, on which every bird sits; or like a
dead body cast out in the darkness.
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` By the purple and linen that rot upon them you will know that they
are not gods; and they will finally themselves be consumed, and be a
reproach in the land.
'''
"73" = ''':sup:`73` Better therefore is a just man who has no idols, for he will be far
from reproach.
'''

Notas de rodapé:
6:1-4 - Baruch delivers a warning about the idols of Babylon, which are
false representations of power and divinity. This passage denounces the
futility of idolatry and the uselessness of gods made by human hands,
reinforcing God's exclusivity as the only one worthy of worship (see
6:5-8 - The description of idols as objects made of wood and silver
reveals their weakness and inability to save or protect. This invites
us to reflect on true worship of God, and how He alone can truly
6:9-13 - The idols are described as being manipulated by the priests,
who treat them as if they were living deities, but these idols have no
life or power. This point reinforces the idea that true faith in God is
not based on images or objects, but on a direct relationship with the
6:14-16 - The critique of idols continues, reminding us that these
false objects have no power over humans or creation. Rather, the Lord
is the Creator of all things, and He alone deserves praise and worship.
This rejection of idolatry is central to biblical theology (see also
6:17-22 - The chapter concludes with a call for the people of Israel to
turn away from idolatry and to the one living God. The rejection of
idols is a reaffirmation of biblical monotheism, which emphasizes the
oneness of God and the need for exclusive worship of Him (see also
