"1" = ''':sup:`1` One finds in the records that Jeremiah the prophet ordered those who
were being deported to take some of the fire, as has been told,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and that the prophet after giving them the law instructed those who
were being deported not to forget the commandments of the Lord, nor to
be led astray in their thoughts upon seeing the gold and silver statues
and their adornment.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And with other similar words he exhorted them that the law should
not depart from their hearts.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` It was also in the writing that the prophet, having received an
oracle, ordered that the tent and the ark should follow with him, and
that he went out to the mountain where Moses had gone up and had seen
the inheritance of God.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Jeremiah came and found a cave, and he brought there the tent
and the ark and the altar of incense, and he sealed up the entrance.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Some of those who followed him came up to mark the way, but could
not find it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Jeremiah learned of it, he rebuked them and declared: "The
place shall be unknown until God gathers his people together again and
shows his mercy.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And then the Lord will disclose these things, and the glory of the
Lord and the cloud will appear, as they were shown in the case of
Moses, and as Solomon asked that the place should be specially
consecrated."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` It was also made clear that being possessed of wisdom Solomon
offered sacrifice for the dedication and completion of the temple.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Just as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven
and devoured the sacrifices, so also Solomon prayed, and the fire came
down and consumed the whole burnt offerings.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Moses said, "They were consumed because the sin offering had
not been eaten."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Likewise Solomon also kept the eight days.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The same things are reported in the records and in the memoirs of
Nehemiah, and also that he founded a library and collected the books
about the kings and prophets, and the writings of David, and letters of
kings about votive offerings.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` In the same way Judas also collected all the books that had been
lost on account of the war which had come upon us, and they are in our
possession.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So if you have need of them, send people to get them for you.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Since, therefore, we are about to celebrate the purification, we
write to you. Will you therefore please keep the days?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` It is God who has saved all his people, and has returned the
inheritance to all, and the kingship and priesthood and consecration,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` as he promised through the law. For we have hope in God that he
will soon have mercy upon us and will gather us from everywhere under
heaven into his holy place, for he has rescued us from great evils and
has purified the place.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The story of Judas Maccabeus and his brothers, and the purification
of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and further the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes and his son
Eupator,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and the appearances which came from heaven to those who strove
zealously on behalf of Judaism, so that though few in number they
seized the whole land and pursued the barbarian hordes,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and recovered the temple famous throughout the world and freed the
city and restored the laws that were about to be abolished, while the
Lord with great kindness became gracious to them --
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` all this, which has been set forth by Jason of Cyrene in five
volumes, we shall attempt to condense into a single book.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For considering the flood of numbers involved and the difficulty
there is for those who wish to enter upon the narratives of history
because of the mass of material,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` we have aimed to please those who wish to read, to make it easy for
those who are inclined to memorize, and to profit all readers.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For us who have undertaken the toil of abbreviating, it is no light
matter but calls for sweat and loss of sleep,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` just as it is not easy for one who prepares a banquet and seeks the
benefit of others. However, to secure the gratitude of many we will
gladly endure the uncomfortable toil,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` leaving the responsibility for exact details to the compiler, while
devoting our effort to arriving at the outlines of the condensation.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For as the master builder of a new house must be concerned with the
whole construction, while the one who undertakes its painting and
decoration has to consider only what is suitable for its adornment,
such in my judgment is the case with us.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It is the duty of the original historian to occupy the ground and
to discuss matters from every side and to take trouble with details,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` but the one who recasts the narrative should be allowed to strive
for brevity of expression and to forego exhaustive treatment.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` At this point therefore let us begin our narrative, adding only so
much to what has already been said; for it is foolish to lengthen the
preface while cutting short the history itself.
