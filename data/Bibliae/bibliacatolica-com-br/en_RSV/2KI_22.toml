LORD, saying,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` "Go up to Hilki'ah the high priest, that he may reckon the amount of
the money which has been brought into the house of the LORD, which the
keepers of the threshold have collected from the people;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the

'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And Hilki'ah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have

Asai'ah the king's servant, saying,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all
Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great
is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our
fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all
that is written concerning us."

upon its inhabitants, all the words of the book which the king of Judah
has read.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other
gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their
hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it
will not be quenched.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But as to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD,
thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel:
Regarding the words which you have heard,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before
the LORD, when you heard how I spoke against this place, and against
its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and
you have rent your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you,
says the LORD.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall
be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the
evil which I will bring upon this place.'" And they brought back word
to the king.
