Nebuchadnez'zar, your father, made him chief of the magicians,
enchanters, Chalde'ans, and astrologers,

"12" = ''':sup:`12` because an excellent spirit, knowledge, and understanding to

the Most High God rules the kingdom of men, and sets over it whom he
will.

and stone, which do not see or hear or know, but the God in whose hand
is your breath, and whose are all your ways, you have not honored.
