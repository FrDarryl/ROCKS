"1" = ''':sup:`1` The book of the acts of Tobit the son of Tobiel, son of Ananiel, son
of Aduel, son of Gabael, of the descendants of Asiel and the tribe of
Naphtali,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` who in the days of Shalmaneser, king of the Assyrians, was taken
into captivity from Thisbe, which is to the south of Kedesh Naphtali in
Galilee above Asher.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I, Tobit, walked in the ways of truth and righteousness all the days
of my life, and I performed many acts of charity to my brethren and
countrymen who went with me into the land of the Assyrians, to Nineveh.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now when I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, while I was
still a young man, the whole tribe of Naphtali my forefather deserted
the house of Jerusalem. This was the place which had been chosen from
among all the tribes of Israel, where all the tribes should sacrifice
and where the temple of the dwelling of the Most High was consecrated
and established for all generations for ever.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All the tribes that joined in apostasy used to sacrifice to the calf
Baal, and so did the house of Naphtali my forefather.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But I alone went often to Jerusalem for the feasts, as it is
ordained for all Israel by an everlasting decree. Taking the first
fruits and the tithes of my produce and the first shearings, I would
give these to the priests, the sons of Aaron, at the altar.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Of all my produce I would give a tenth to the sons of Levi who
ministered at Jerusalem; a second tenth I would sell, and I would go
and spend the proceeds each year at Jerusalem;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` the third tenth I would give to those to whom it was my duty, as
Deborah my father's mother had commanded me, for I was left an orphan
by my father.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When I became a man I married Anna, a member of our family, and by
her I became the father of Tobias.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now when I was carried away captive to Nineveh, all my brethren and
my relatives ate the food of the Gentiles;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but I kept myself from eating it,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` because I remembered God with all my heart.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the Most High gave me favor and good appearance in the sight
of Shalmaneser, and I was his buyer of provisions.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So I used to go into Media, and once at Rages in Media I left ten
talents of silver in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when Shalmaneser died, Sennacherib his son reigned in his
place; and under him the highways were unsafe, so that I could no
longer go into Media.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` In the days of Shalmaneser I performed many acts of charity to my
brethren.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` I would give my bread to the hungry and my clothing to the naked;
and if I saw any one of my people dead and thrown out behind the wall
of Nineveh, I would bury him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And if Sennacherib the king put to death any who came fleeing from
Judea, I buried them secretly. For in his anger he put many to death.
When the bodies were sought by the king, they were not found.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then one of the men of Nineveh went and informed the king about me,
that I was burying them; so I hid myself. When I learned that I was
being searched for, to be put to death, I left home in fear.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then all my property was confiscated and nothing was left to me
except my wife Anna and my son Tobias.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But not fifty days passed before two of Sennacherib's sons killed
him, and they fled to the mountains of Ararat. Then Esarhaddon, his
son, reigned in his place; and he appointed Ahikar, the son of my
brother Anael, over all the accounts of his kingdom and over the entire
administration.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Ahikar interceded for me, and I returned to Nineveh. Now Ahikar was
cupbearer, keeper of the signet, and in charge of administration of the
accounts, for Esarhaddon had appointed him second to himself. He was my
nephew.
