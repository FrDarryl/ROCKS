though they do not obey the word, may be won without a word by the
behavior of their wives,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` when they see your reverent and chaste behavior.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Let not yours be the outward adorning with braiding of hair,
decoration of gold, and wearing of fine clothing,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable
jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very
precious.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` So once the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves and
were submissive to their husbands,

"6" = ''':sup:`6` as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are now her
children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing
honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the
grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Finally, all of you, have unity of spirit, sympathy, love of the
brethren, a tender heart and a humble mind.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` But even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be
blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to
make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is
in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence;

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are abused, those
who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's
