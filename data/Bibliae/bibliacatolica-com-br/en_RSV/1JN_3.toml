children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know
us is that it did not know him.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Beloved, we are God's children now; it does not yet appear what we
shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we
shall see him as he is.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Every one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is
lawlessness.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no
sin.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him
or known him.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is
righteous, as he is righteous.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He who commits sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from
the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the
works of the devil.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` No one born of God commits sin; for God's nature abides in him, and

'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Any one who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no
murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us; and we
ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But if any one has the world's goods and sees his brother in need,
yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Little children, let us not love in word or speech but in deed and
in truth.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and reassure our
hearts before him

commandments and do what pleases him.
