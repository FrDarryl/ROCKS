"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now Maccabeus and his followers, the Lord leading them on, recovered
the temple and the city;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and they tore down the altars which had been built in the public
square by the foreigners, and also destroyed the sacred precincts.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They purified the sanctuary, and made another altar of sacrifice;
then, striking fire out of flint, they offered sacrifices, after a
lapse of two years, and they burned incense and lighted lamps and set
out the bread of the Presence.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And when they had done this, they fell prostrate and besought the
Lord that they might never again fall into such misfortunes, but that,
if they should ever sin, they might be disciplined by him with
forbearance and not be handed over to blasphemous and barbarous
nations.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` It happened that on the same day on which the sanctuary had been
profaned by the foreigners, the purification of the sanctuary took
place, that is, on the twenty-fifth day of the same month, which was
Chislev.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And they celebrated it for eight days with rejoicing, in the manner
of the feast of booths, remembering how not long before, during the
feast of booths, they had been wandering in the mountains and caves
like wild animals.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore bearing ivy-wreathed wands and beautiful branches and also
fronds of palm, they offered hymns of thanksgiving to him who had given
success to the purifying of his own holy place.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They decreed by public ordinance and vote that the whole nation of
the Jews should observe these days every year.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Such then was the end of Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now we will tell what took place under Antiochus Eupator, who was
the son of that ungodly man, and will give a brief summary of the
principal calamities of the wars.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` This man, when he succeeded to the kingdom, appointed one Lysias to
have charge of the government and to be chief governor of Coelesyria
and Phoenicia.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Ptolemy, who was called Macron, took the lead in showing justice to
the Jews because of the wrong that had been done to them, and attempted
to maintain peaceful relations with them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` As a result he was accused before Eupator by the king's friends. He
heard himself called a traitor at every turn, because he had abandoned
Cyprus, which Philometor had entrusted to him, and had gone over to
Antiochus Epiphanes. Unable to command the respect due his office, he
took poison and ended his life.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Gorgias became governor of the region, he maintained a force
of mercenaries, and at every turn kept on warring against the Jews.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Besides this, the Idumeans, who had control of important
strongholds, were harassing the Jews; they received those who were
banished from Jerusalem, and endeavored to keep up the war.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Maccabeus and his men, after making solemn supplication and
beseeching God to fight on their side, rushed to the strongholds of the
Idumeans.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Attacking them vigorously, they gained possession of the places,
and beat off all who fought upon the wall, and slew those whom they
encountered, killing no fewer than twenty thousand.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When no less than nine thousand took refuge in two very strong
towers well equipped to withstand a siege,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and also Zacchaeus and his men, a
force sufficient to besiege them; and he himself set off for places
where he was more urgently needed.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But the men with Simon, who were money-hungry, were bribed by some
of those who were in the towers, and on receiving seventy thousand
drachmas let some of them slip away.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When word of what had happened came to Maccabeus, he gathered the
leaders of the people, and accused these men of having sold their
brethren for money by setting their enemies free to fight against them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he slew these men who had turned traitor, and immediately
captured the two towers.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Having success at arms in everything he undertook, he destroyed
more than twenty thousand in the two strongholds.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Now Timothy, who had been defeated by the Jews before, gathered a
tremendous force of mercenaries and collected the cavalry from Asia in
no small number. He came on, intending to take Judea by storm.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` As he drew near, Maccabeus and his men sprinkled dust upon their
heads and girded their loins with sackcloth, in supplication to God.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Falling upon the steps before the altar, they besought him to be
gracious to them and to be an enemy to their enemies and an adversary
to their adversaries, as the law declares.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And rising from their prayer they took up their arms and advanced a
considerable distance from the city; and when they came near to the
enemy they halted.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Just as dawn was breaking, the two armies joined battle, the one
having as pledge of success and victory not only their valor but their
reliance upon the Lord, while the other made rage their leader in the
fight.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` When the battle became fierce, there appeared to the enemy from
heaven five resplendent men on horses with golden bridles, and they
were leading the Jews.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Surrounding Maccabeus and protecting him with their own armor and
weapons, they kept him from being wounded. And they showered arrows and
thunderbolts upon the enemy, so that, confused and blinded, they were
thrown into disorder and cut to pieces.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Twenty thousand five hundred were slaughtered, besides six hundred
horsemen.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Timothy himself fled to a stronghold called Gazara, especially well
garrisoned, where Chaereas was commander.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then Maccabeus and his men were glad, and they besieged the fort
for four days.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The men within, relying on the strength of the place, blasphemed
terribly and hurled out wicked words.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But at dawn of the fifth day, twenty young men in the army of
Maccabeus, fired with anger because of the blasphemies, bravely stormed
the wall and with savage fury cut down every one they met.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Others who came up in the same way wheeled around against the
defenders and set fire to the towers; they kindled fires and burned the
blasphemers alive. Others broke open the gates and let in the rest of
the force, and they occupied the city.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` They killed Timothy, who was hidden in a cistern, and his brother
Chaereas, and Apollophanes.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` When they had accomplished these things, with hymns and
thanksgivings they blessed the Lord who shows great kindness to Israel
and gives them the victory.
