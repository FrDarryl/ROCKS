"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
half-tribe of Manas'seh,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the
LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I have
commanded you;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` you have not forsaken your brethren these many days, down to this
day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the LORD your God.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brethren, as he
promised them; therefore turn and go to your home in the land where
your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on
the other side of the Jordan.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Take good care to observe the commandment and the law which Moses
the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and
to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to
him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their
homes.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now to the one half of the tribe of Manas'seh Moses had given a
possession in Bashan; but to the other half Joshua had given a
possession beside their brethren in the land west of the Jordan. And
when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` he said to them, "Go back to your homes with much wealth, and with
very many cattle, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much
clothing; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh
returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in
the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of
which they had possessed themselves by command of the LORD through
Moses.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when they came to the region about the Jordan, that lies in the
land of Canaan, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of
Manas'seh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of great size.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the people of Israel heard say, "Behold, the Reubenites and the
Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh have built an altar at the
frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the
side that belongs to the people of Israel."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of
the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh, to make war against them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the people of Israel sent to the Reubenites and the Gadites
and the half-tribe of Manas'seh, in the land of Gilead, Phin'ehas the
son of Elea'zar the priest,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of
Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of
Israel.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they came to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of
Manas'seh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, `What is this
treachery which you have committed against the God of Israel in turning
away this day from following the LORD, by building yourselves an altar
this day in rebellion against the LORD?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Have we not had enough of the sin at Pe'or from which even yet we
have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the
congregation of the LORD,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? And if
you rebel against the LORD today he will be angry with the whole
congregation of Israel tomorrow.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But now, if your land is unclean, pass over into the LORD's land
where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a
possession among us; only do not rebel against the LORD, or make us as
rebels by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD
our God.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the
devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And
he did not perish alone for his iniquity.'"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manas'seh
said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` "The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He
knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach
of faith toward the LORD, spare us not today
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD; or if
we did so to offer burnt offerings or cereal offerings or peace
offerings on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Nay, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children
might say to our children, `What have you to do with the LORD, the God
of Israel?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you
Reubenites and Gadites; you have no portion in the LORD.' So your
children might make our children cease to worship the LORD.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Therefore we said, `Let us now build an altar, not for burnt
offering, nor for sacrifice,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` but to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations
after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence
with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings; lest your
children say to our children in time to come, "You have no portion in
the LORD."'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And we thought, If this should be said to us or to our descendants
in time to come, we should say, `Behold the copy of the altar of the
LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for
sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn
away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt
offering, cereal offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the
LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!"
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When Phin'ehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the
heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that
the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manas'sites spoke, it pleased
them well.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest said to the Reubenites
and the Gadites and the Manas'sites, "Today we know that the LORD is in
the midst of us, because you have not committed this treachery against
the LORD; now you have saved the people of Israel from the hand of the
LORD."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest, and the chiefs,
returned from the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead to
the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to
them.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And the report pleased the people of Israel; and the people of
Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them, to
destroy the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites were settled.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The Reubenites and the Gadites called the altar Witness; "For,"
said they, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."
