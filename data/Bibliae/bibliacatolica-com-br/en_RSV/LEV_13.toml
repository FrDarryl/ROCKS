Notas de rodapé:
13:1-3 - The laws regarding skin diseases, such as leprosy, demonstrate
God's concern for the purity and holiness of His people. The priest's
role was to examine and determine whether someone was unclean,
highlighting the importance of spiritual intercession (see also
13:4-8 - Quarantining people with suspicious spots reflects the
principle of precaution and community protection. The physical and
spiritual health of the people of Israel were inseparable from their
13:9-17 - The declaration of impurity for those with chronic illnesses
shows how persistent and devastating sin and corruption can be in the
spiritual life. Only God can completely restore purity (see also
13:18-23 - Skin diseases following wounds were carefully examined to
ensure there was no contamination. This highlights the importance of
13:45-46 - Those declared unclean were to live in isolation,
symbolizing separation from sin. Temporary exclusion from the camp
represents the separation that sin causes between God and His people
