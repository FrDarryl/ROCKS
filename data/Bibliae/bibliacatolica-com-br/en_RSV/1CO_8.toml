"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that "all of us
possess knowledge." "Knowledge" puffs up, but love builds up.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` If any one imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as
he ought to know.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But if one loves God, one is known by him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "an
idol has no real existence," and that "there is no God but one."

"5" = ''':sup:`5` For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth -- as
indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords" --

"6" = ''':sup:`6` yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things
and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all
things and through whom we exist.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through being
hitherto accustomed to idols, eat food as really offered to an idol;
and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not
eat, and no better off if we do.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Only take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling
block to the weak.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For if any one sees you, a man of knowledge, at table in an idol's
temple, might he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat
food offered to idols?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother
for whom Christ died.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience
when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Therefore, if food is a cause of my brother's falling, I will never
eat meat, lest I cause my brother to fall.
