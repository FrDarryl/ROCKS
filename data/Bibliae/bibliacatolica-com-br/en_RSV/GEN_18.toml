[18]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the
door of his tent in the heat of the day.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men stood in
front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them,
and bowed himself to the earth,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and said, "My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass
by your servant.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest
yourselves under the tree,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` while I fetch a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves,
and after that you may pass on -- since you have come to your servant."
So they said, "Do as you have said."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Make ready
quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and
gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then he took curds, and milk, and the calf which he had prepared,
and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they
ate.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` They said to him, "Where is Sarah your wife?" And he said, "She is
in the tent."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The LORD said, "I will surely return to you in the spring, and
Sarah your wife shall have a son." And Sarah was listening at the tent
door behind him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; it had ceased to
be with Sarah after the manner of women.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have grown old, and
my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, and say, `Shall I
indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will
return to you, in the spring, and Sarah shall have a son."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But Sarah denied, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. He
said, "No, but you did laugh."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward Sodom; and
Abraham went with them to set them on their way.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` seeing that Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all
the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by him?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his
household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness
and justice; so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised
him."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then the LORD said, "Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomor'rah
is great and their sin is very grave,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according
to the outcry which has come to me; and if not, I will know."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham
still stood before the LORD.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then Abraham drew near, and said, "Wilt thou indeed destroy the
righteous with the wicked?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then
destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in
it?
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Far be it from thee to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with
the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from
thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And the LORD said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city,
I will spare the whole place for their sake."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Abraham answered, "Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the
Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Wilt thou destroy
the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it
if I find forty-five there."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Again he spoke to him, and said, "Suppose forty are found there."
He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak.
Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I
find thirty there."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He said, "Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord.
Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I
will not destroy it."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again
but this once. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake
of ten I will not destroy it."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to
Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.
