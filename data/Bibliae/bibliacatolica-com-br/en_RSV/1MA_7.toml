"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the one hundred and fifty-first year Demetrius the son of
Seleucus set forth from Rome, sailed with a few men to a city by the
sea, and there began to reign.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` As he was entering the royal palace of his fathers, the army seized
Antiochus and Lysias to bring them to him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But when this act became known to him, he said, "Do not let me see
their faces!"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So the army killed them, and Demetrius took his seat upon the throne
of his kingdom.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then there came to him all the lawless and ungodly men of Israel;
they were led by Alcimus, who wanted to be high priest.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And they brought to the king this accusation against the people:
"Judas and his brothers have destroyed all your friends, and have
driven us out of our land.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now then send a man whom you trust; let him go and see all the ruin
which Judas has brought upon us and upon the land of the king, and let
him punish them and all who help them."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So the king chose Bacchides, one of the king's friends, governor of
the province Beyond the River; he was a great man in the kingdom and
was faithful to the king.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he sent him, and with him the ungodly Alcimus, whom he made high
priest; and he commanded him to take vengeance on the sons of Israel.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So they marched away and came with a large force into the land of
Judah; and he sent messengers to Judas and his brothers with peaceable
but treacherous words.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But they paid no attention to their words, for they saw that they
had come with a large force.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then a group of scribes appeared in a body before Alcimus and
Bacchides to ask for just terms.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The Hasideans were first among the sons of Israel to seek peace
from them,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` for they said, "A priest of the line of Aaron has come with the
army, and he will not harm us."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he spoke peaceable words to them and swore this oath to them,
"We will not seek to injure you or your friends."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So they trusted him; but he seized sixty of them and killed them in
one day, in accordance with the word which was written,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` "The flesh of thy saints and their blood they poured out round
about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, for they
said, "There is no truth or justice in them, for they have violated the
agreement and the oath which they swore."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Bacchides departed from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-zaith.
And he sent and seized many of the men who had deserted to him, and
some of the people, and killed them and threw them into a great pit.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He placed Alcimus in charge of the country and left with him a
force to help him; then Bacchides went back to the king.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Alcimus strove for the high priesthood,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and all who were troubling their people joined him. They gained
control of the land of Judah and did great damage in Israel.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Judas saw all the evil that Alcimus and those with him had done
among the sons of Israel; it was more than the Gentiles had done.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So Judas went out into all the surrounding parts of Judea, and took
vengeance on the men who had deserted, and he prevented those in the
city from going out into the country.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When Alcimus saw that Judas and those with him had grown strong,
and realized that he could not withstand them, he returned to the king
and brought wicked charges against them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honored princes, who hated
and detested Israel, and he commanded him to destroy the people.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a large force, and treacherously
sent to Judas and his brothers this peaceable message,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` "Let there be no fighting between me and you; I shall come with a
few men to see you face to face in peace."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` So he came to Judas, and they greeted one another peaceably. But
the enemy were ready to seize Judas.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` It became known to Judas that Nicanor had come to him with
treacherous intent, and he was afraid of him and would not meet him
again.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When Nicanor learned that his plan had been disclosed, he went out
to meet Judas in battle near Caphar-salama.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` About five hundred men of the army of Nicanor fell, and the rest
fled into the city of David.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` After these events Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some of the
priests came out of the sanctuary, and some of the elders of the
people, to greet him peaceably and to show him the burnt offering that
was being offered for the king.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But he mocked them and derided them and defiled them and spoke
arrogantly,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` and in anger he swore this oath, "Unless Judas and his army are
delivered into my hands this time, then if I return safely I will burn
up this house." And he went out in great anger.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then the priests went in and stood before the altar and the temple,
and they wept and said,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` "Thou didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be
for thy people a house of prayer and supplication.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Take vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by
the sword; remember their blasphemies, and let them live no longer."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Now Nicanor went out from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-horon, and
the Syrian army joined him.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And Judas encamped in Adasa with three thousand men. Then Judas
prayed and said,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` "When the messengers from the king spoke blasphemy, thy angel went
forth and struck down one hundred and eighty-five thousand of the
Assyrians.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` So also crush this army before us today; let the rest learn that
Nicanor has spoken wickedly against the sanctuary, and judge him
according to this wickedness."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` So the armies met in battle on the thirteenth day of the month of
Adar. The army of Nicanor was crushed, and he himself was the first to
fall in the battle.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` When his army saw that Nicanor had fallen, they threw down their
arms and fled.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` The Jews pursued them a day's journey, from Adasa as far as Gazara,
and as they followed kept sounding the battle call on the trumpets.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And men came out of all the villages of Judea round about, and they
out-flanked the enemy and drove them back to their pursuers, so that
they all fell by the sword; not even one of them was left.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Then the Jews seized the spoils and the plunder, and they cut off
Nicanor's head and the right hand which he so arrogantly stretched out,
and brought them and displayed them just outside Jerusalem.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` The people rejoiced greatly and celebrated that day as a day of
great gladness.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And they decreed that this day should be celebrated each year on
the thirteenth day of Adar.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` So the land of Judah had rest for a few days.
