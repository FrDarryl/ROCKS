11:8-12 - Moses emphasizes that the promised land is directly cared for
by God. Unlike Egypt, where irrigation depended on the Nile, the new
land is watered by rain, demonstrating Israel's dependence on God's
11:13-15 - Obedience will bring blessings, such as the rain needed for

11:18-21 - Moses instructs Israel to keep the commandments in their
hearts, teach them to their children, and share them in every aspect of
their lives. This reinforces the need for a daily and ongoing
relationship with God's Word (see also Deuteronomy 6:6-9 and
11:26-28 - Moses presents the people with a choice between blessing and
cursing, depending on their obedience or disobedience. This pattern of

24:15).
