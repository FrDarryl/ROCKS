"1" = ''':sup:`1` While the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he was
standing by the lake of Gennes'aret.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he saw two boats by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of
them and were washing their nets.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to
put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people
from the boat.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And when he had ceased speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into the
deep and let down your nets for a catch."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Simon answered, "Master, we toiled all night and took nothing!
But at your word I will let down the nets."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And when they had done this, they enclosed a great shoal of fish;
and as their nets were breaking,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` they beckoned to their partners in the other boat to come and help
them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to
sink.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
"Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the catch of
fish which they had taken;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and so also were James and John, sons of Zeb'edee, who were
partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not be afraid;
henceforth you will be catching men."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything
and followed him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of
leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and besought him,
"Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I will; be
clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he charged him to tell no one; but "go and show yourself to the
priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded,
for a proof to the people."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But so much the more the report went abroad concerning him; and
great multitudes gathered to hear and to be healed of their
infirmities.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But he withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` On one of those days, as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and
teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of
Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was
with him to heal.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and
they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` but finding no way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went
up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the
midst before Jesus.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And when he saw their faith he said, "Man, your sins are forgiven
you."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, saying, "Who
is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, "Why do
you question in your hearts?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Which is easier, to say, `Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say,
`Rise and walk'?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to
forgive sins" -- he said to the man who was paralyzed -- "I say to you,
rise, take up your bed and go home."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And immediately he rose before them, and took up that on which he
lay, and went home, glorifying God.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were
filled with awe, saying, "We have seen strange things today."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi,
sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, "Follow me."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he left everything, and rose and followed him.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there was a large
company of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples,
saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And Jesus answered them, "Those who are well have no need of a
physician, but those who are sick;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And they said to him, "The disciples of John fast often and offer
prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and
drink."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And Jesus said to them, "Can you make wedding guests fast while the
bridegroom is with them?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them,
and then they will fast in those days."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He told them a parable also: "No one tears a piece from a new
garment and puts it upon an old garment; if he does, he will tear the
new, and the piece from the new will not match the old.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new
wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be
destroyed.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And no one after drinking old wine desires new; for he says, `The
old is good.'"
