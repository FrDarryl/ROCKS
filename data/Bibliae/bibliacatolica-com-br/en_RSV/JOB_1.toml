"1" = ''':sup:`1` There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man
was blameless and upright, one who feared God, and turned away from
evil.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred
yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; so
that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each on his
day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and
drink with them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send
and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer
burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, "It
may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." Thus
Job did continually.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The LORD said to Satan, "Whence have you come?" Satan answered the
LORD, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down
on it."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man,
who fears God and turns away from evil?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nought?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Hast thou not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he
has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his
possessions have increased in the land.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will
curse thee to thy face."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your
power; only upon himself do not put forth your hand." So Satan went
forth from the presence of the LORD.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and
drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen were plowing
and the asses feeding beside them;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and the Sabe'ans fell upon them and took them, and slew the
servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell
you."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "The fire
of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and
consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "The
Chalde'ans formed three companies, and made a raid upon the camels and
took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I
alone have escaped to tell you."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "Your sons
and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's
house;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness, and struck the
four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they
are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell
upon the ground, and worshiped.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I
return; the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name
of the LORD."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.
