"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the
thirteenth day of the same, when the king's command and edict were
about to be executed, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews
hoped to get the mastery over them, but which had been changed to a day
when the Jews should get the mastery over their foes,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` the Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of
King Ahasu-e'rus to lay hands on such as sought their hurt. And no one
could make a stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen upon
all peoples.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors
and the royal officials also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mor'decai
had fallen upon them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For Mor'decai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread
throughout all the provinces; for the man Mor'decai grew more and more
powerful.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So the Jews smote all their enemies with the sword, slaughtering,
and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In Susa the capital itself the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and also slew Par-shan-da'tha and Dalphon and Aspa'tha
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and Pora'tha and Ada'lia and Arida'tha
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and Parmash'ta and Ar'isai and Ar'idai and Vaiza'tha,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of the
Jews; but they laid no hand on the plunder.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` That very day the number of those slain in Susa the capital was
reported to the king.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the king said to Queen Esther, "In Susa the capital the Jews
have slain five hundred men and also the ten sons of Haman. What then
have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your
petition? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It
shall be fulfilled."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And Esther said, "If it please the king, let the Jews who are in
Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict. And
let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So the king commanded this to be done; a decree was issued in Susa,
and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of
the month of Adar and they slew three hundred men in Susa; but they
laid no hands on the plunder.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now the other Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered
to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies, and slew
seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they laid no hands
on the plunder.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the
fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and
gladness.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on
the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of
feasting and gladness.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the open towns,
hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and
feasting and holiday-making, and a day on which they send choice
portions to one another.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Mor'decai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the
Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasu-e'rus, both near and
far,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the
month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as
the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and
from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of
feasting and gladness, days for sending choice portions to one another
and gifts to the poor.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mor'decai had
written to them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For Haman the Ag'agite, the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of all
the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast
Pur, that is the lot, to crush and destroy them;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` but when Esther came before the king, he gave orders in writing
that his wicked plot which he had devised against the Jews should come
upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the
gallows.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur. And
therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what
they had faced in this matter, and of what had befallen them,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` the Jews ordained and took it upon themselves and their descendants
and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two
days according to what was written and at the time appointed every
year,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every
generation, in every family, province, and city, and that these days of
Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the
commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Ab'ihail, and Mor'decai the Jew
gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven
provinces of the kingdom of Ahasu-e'rus, in words of peace and truth,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed
seasons, as Mor'decai the Jew and Queen Esther enjoined upon the Jews,
and as they had laid down for themselves and for their descendants,
with regard to their fasts and their lamenting.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The command of Queen Esther fixed these practices of Purim, and it
was recorded in writing.
