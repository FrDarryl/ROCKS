"1" = ''':sup:`1` "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by
the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a
robber;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To him the gatekeeper opens; the sheep hear his voice, and he calls
his own sheep by name and leads them out.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the
sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for
they do not know the voice of strangers."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` This figure Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what
he was saying to them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So Jesus again said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the
door of the sheep.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` All who came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did
not heed them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved, and will
go in and out and find pasture.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that
they may have life, and have it abundantly.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for
the sheep.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are
not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf
snatches them and scatters them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my
life for the sheep.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring
them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock,
one shepherd.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life,
that I may take it again.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this charge I
have received from my Father."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Many of them said, "He has a demon, and he is mad; why listen to
him?"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Others said, "These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can
a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` It was the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico
of Solomon.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, "How long will you
keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works
that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness to me;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no
one shall snatch them out of my hand.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no
one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` I and the Father are one."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The Jews took up stones again to stone him.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the
Father; for which of these do you stone me?"
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we stone you
but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, `I said, you
are gods'?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and scripture
cannot be broken),
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the
world, `You are blaspheming,' because I said, `I am the Son of God'?
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the
works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I
am in the Father."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Again they tried to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John at
first baptized, and there he remained.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And many came to him; and they said, "John did no sign, but
everything that John said about this man was true."
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And many believed in him there.
