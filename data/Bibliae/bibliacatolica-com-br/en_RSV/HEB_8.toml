"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high
priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in heaven,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by
man but by the Lord.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices;
hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since
there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when
Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying,
"See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown
you on the mountain."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry which is as much more
excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it
is enacted on better promises.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been
no occasion for a second.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For he finds fault with them when he says: "The days will come, says
the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel
and with the house of Judah;

"9" = ''':sup:`9` not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when
I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they
did not continue in my covenant, and so I paid no heed to them, says
the Lord.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds,
and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall
be my people.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And they shall not teach every one his fellow or every one his
brother, saying, `Know the Lord,' for all shall know me, from the least
of them to the greatest.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember
their sins no more."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In speaking of a new covenant he treats the first as obsolete. And
what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
