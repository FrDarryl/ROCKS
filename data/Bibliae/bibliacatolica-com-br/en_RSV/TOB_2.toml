to me, at the feast of Pentecost, which is the sacred festival of the
seven weeks, a good dinner was prepared for me and I sat down to eat.

whatever poor man of our brethren you may find who is mindful of the
Lord, and I will wait for you."

"3" = ''':sup:`3` But he came back and said, "Father, one of our people has been
strangled and thrown into the market place."

"4" = ''':sup:`4` So before I tasted anything I sprang up and removed the body to a
place of shelter until sunset.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then I remembered the prophecy of Amos, how he said, "Your feasts
shall be turned into mourning, and all your festivities into
lamentation." And I wept.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` When the sun had set I went and dug a grave and buried the body.

that he will be put to death for doing this; he once ran away, and here

care of me until he went to Elymais.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then my wife Anna earned money at women's work.

"Where did you get the kid? It is not stolen, is it? Return it to the
owners; for it is not right to eat what is stolen."

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And she said, "It was given to me as a gift in addition to my
wages." But I did not believe her, and told her to return it to the
owners; and I blushed for her. Then she replied to me, "Where are your
charities and your righteous deeds? You seem to know everything!"
