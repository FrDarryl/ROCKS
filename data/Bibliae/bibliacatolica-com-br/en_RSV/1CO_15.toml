[15]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now I would remind you, brethren, in what terms I preached to you
the gospel, which you received, in which you stand,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` by which you are saved, if you hold it fast -- unless you believed
in vain.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,
that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in
accordance with the scriptures,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time,
most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the church of God.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was
not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though
it was not I, but the grace of God which is with me.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of
you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not
been raised;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and
your faith is in vain.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified
of God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that
the dead are not raised.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are
still in your sins.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men
most to be pitied.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits
of those who have fallen asleep.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection
of the dead.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his
coming those who belong to Christ.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father
after destroying every rule and every authority and power.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` "For God has put all things in subjection under his feet." But when
it says, "All things are put in subjection under him," it is plain that
he is excepted who put all things under him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will
also be subjected to him who put all things under him, that God may be
everything to every one.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the
dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on
their behalf?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Why am I in peril every hour?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ
Jesus our Lord, I die every day!
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at
Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for
tomorrow we die."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Come to your right mind, and sin no more. For some have no
knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But some one will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of
body do they come?"
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And what you sow is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel,
perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed
its own body.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` For not all flesh is alike, but there is one kind for men, another
for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` There are celestial bodies and there are terrestrial bodies; but
the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is
another.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is
perishable, what is raised is imperishable.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in
weakness, it is raised in power.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there
is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the
last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` But it is not the spiritual which is first but the physical, and
then the spiritual.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is
from heaven.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is
the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also
bear the image of the man of heaven.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` I tell you this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Lo! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
be changed,
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For
the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and
we shall be changed.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` For this perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this
mortal nature must put on immortality.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts
on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:
"Death is swallowed up in victory."
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?"
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor
is not in vain.
