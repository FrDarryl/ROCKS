[23]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` The word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their
youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms
handled.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Oho'lah was the name of the elder and Ohol'ibah the name of her
sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for
their names, Oho'lah is Sama'ria, and Ohol'ibah is Jerusalem.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` "Oho'lah played the harlot while she was mine; and she doted on her
lovers the Assyrians,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` warriors clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them
desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` She bestowed her harlotries upon them, the choicest men of Assyria
all of them; and she defiled herself with all the idols of every one on
whom she doted.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` She did not give up her harlotry which she had practiced since her
days in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her
virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the
hands of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her
daughters; and her they slew with the sword; and she became a byword
among women, when judgment had been executed upon her.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "Her sister Ohol'ibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt than she
in her doting and in her harlotry, which was worse than that of her
sister.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors
clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable
young men.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But she carried her harlotry further; she saw men portrayed upon
the wall, the images of the Chalde'ans portrayed in vermilion,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their
heads, all of them looking like officers, a picture of Babylonians
whose native land was Chalde'a.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them
in Chalde'a.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
defiled her with their lust; and after she was polluted by them, she
turned from them in disgust.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When she carried on her harlotry so openly and flaunted her
nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned from her
sister.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Yet she increased her harlotry, remembering the days of her youth,
when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and doted upon her paramours there, whose members were like those
of asses, and whose issue was like that of horses.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians
handled your bosom and pressed your young breasts."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Therefore, O Ohol'ibah, thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will
rouse against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I
will bring them against you from every side:
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` the Babylonians and all the Chalde'ans, Pekod and Sho'a and Ko'a,
and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and
commanders all of them, officers and warriors, all of them riding on
horses.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and
wagons and a host of peoples; they shall set themselves against you on
every side with buckler, shield, and helmet, and I will commit the
judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their
judgments.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And I will direct my indignation against you, that they may deal
with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your
survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your
daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine
jewels.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your harlotry brought
from the land of Egypt; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to the
Egyptians or remember them any more.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will deliver you into the
hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you
turned in disgust;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and they shall deal with you in hatred, and take away all the fruit
of your labor, and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your
harlotry shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your harlotry
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` have brought this upon you, because you played the harlot with the
nations, and polluted yourself with their idols.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup
into your hand.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Thus says the Lord GOD: "You shall drink your sister's cup which is
deep and large; you shall be laughed at and held in derision, for it
contains much;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` you will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and
desolation, is the cup of your sister Sama'ria;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` you shall drink it and drain it out, and pluck out your hair, and
tear your breasts; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and
cast me behind your back, therefore bear the consequences of your
lewdness and harlotry."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oho'lah and
Ohol'ibah? Then declare to them their abominable deeds.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For they have committed adultery, and blood is upon their hands;
with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have even
offered up to them for food the sons whom they had borne to me.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary
on the same day and profaned my sabbaths.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their
idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And
lo, this is what they did in my house.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` They even sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger was
sent, and lo, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your
eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` you sat upon a stately couch, with a table spread before it on
which you had placed my incense and my oil.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the
common sort drunkards were brought from the wilderness; and they put
bracelets upon the hands of the women, and beautiful crowns upon their
heads.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` "Then I said, Do not men now commit adultery when they practice
harlotry with her?
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a harlot. Thus they
went in to Oho'lah and to Ohol'ibah to commit lewdness.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of
adulteresses, and with the sentence of women that shed blood; because
they are adulteresses, and blood is upon their hands."
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` For thus says the Lord GOD: "Bring up a host against them, and make
them an object of terror and a spoil.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And the host shall stone them and dispatch them with their swords;
they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their
houses.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may
take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And your lewdness shall be requited upon you, and you shall bear
the penalty for your sinful idolatry; and you shall know that I am the
Lord GOD."

Oholibah, who represent the cities of Samaria and Jerusalem,
respectively. This metaphor illustrates the spiritual unfaithfulness
