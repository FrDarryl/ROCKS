Ka'desh-bar'nea.

Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the LORD had
given him in commandment to them,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in
Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ash'taroth and in
Ed're-i.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain
this law, saying,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "The LORD our God said to us in Horeb, `You have stayed long enough
at this mountain;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the
Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country
and in the lowland, and in the Negeb, and by the seacoast, the land of
the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river

'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day
as the stars of heaven for multitude.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` May the LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as
many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` How can I bear alone the weight and burden of you and your strife?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Choose wise, understanding, and experienced men, according to your
tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And you answered me, `The thing that you have spoken is good for us
to do.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and
set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of
hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers,
throughout your tribes.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And I charged your judges at that time, `Hear the cases between
your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or
the alien that is with him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` You shall not be partial in judgment; you shall hear the small and
the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the
judgment is God's; and the case that is too hard for you, you shall
bring to me, and I will hear it.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "And we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and
terrible wilderness which you saw, on the way to the hill country of
the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to
Ka'desh-bar'nea.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And I said to you, `You have come to the hill country of the
Amorites, which the LORD our God gives us.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you; go up, take
possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you; do not
fear or be dismayed.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then all of you came near me, and said, `Let us send men before us,
that they may explore the land for us, and bring us word again of the
way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men of you, one man
for each tribe;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the
Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and
brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, `It is a
good land which the LORD our God gives us.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` "Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the
LORD your God;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and you murmured in your tents, and said, `Because the LORD hated
us he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to give us into
the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Whither are we going up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt,
saying, "The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are
great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of
the Anakim there."'
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then I said to you, `Do not be in dread or afraid of them.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` The LORD your God who goes before you will himself fight for you,
just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the LORD your God
bore you, as a man bears his son, in all the way that you went until
you came to this place.'
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the LORD your God,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch
your tents, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go,
and in the cloud by day.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` "And the LORD heard your words, and was angered, and he swore,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` `Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good
land which I swore to give to your fathers,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` except Caleb the son of Jephun'neh; he shall see it, and to him and
to his children I will give the land upon which he has trodden, because
he has wholly followed the LORD!'
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` The LORD was angry with me also on your account, and said, `You
also shall not go in there;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter;
encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Moreover your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and
your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go
in there, and to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the
direction of the Red Sea.'
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` "Then you answered me, `We have sinned against the LORD; we will go
up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every man of
you girded on his weapons of war, and thought it easy to go up into the
hill country.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And the LORD said to me, `Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I
am not in the midst of you; lest you be defeated before your enemies.'
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` So I spoke to you, and you would not hearken; but you rebelled
against the command of the LORD, and were presumptuous and went up into
the hill country.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against
you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Se'ir as far as
Hormah.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not
hearken to your voice or give ear to you.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained
there.
