his disciples first, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is
hypocrisy.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the
light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed
upon the housetops.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` "I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and
after that have no more that they can do.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed,
has power to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear him!
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is
forgotten before God.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are
of more value than many sparrows.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` "And I tell you, every one who acknowledges me before men, the Son
of man also will acknowledge before the angels of God;

"9" = ''':sup:`9` but he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of
God.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` And every one who speaks a word against the Son of man will be
forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be
forgiven.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and
the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you are to answer or
what you are to say;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought
to say."

"13" = ''':sup:`13` One of the multitude said to him, "Teacher, bid my brother divide
the inheritance with me."

"14" = ''':sup:`14` But he said to him, "Man, who made me a judge or divider over you?"

"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he said to them, "Take heed, and beware of all covetousness;
for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man brought
forth plentifully;

"17" = ''':sup:`17` and he thought to himself, `What shall I do, for I have nowhere to
store my crops?'

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he said, `I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build
larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods.

anxious about your life, what you shall eat, nor about your body, what
you shall put on.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither
storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are
you than the birds!

"25" = ''':sup:`25` And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his span of
life?

"26" = ''':sup:`26` If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are
you anxious about the rest?

"27" = ''':sup:`27` Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet
I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` But if God so clothes the grass which is alive in the field today
and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you,
O men of little faith!
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor
be of anxious mind.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For all the nations of the world seek these things; and your Father
knows that you need them.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things shall be yours as well.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to
give you the kingdom.

"33" = ''':sup:`33` Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide yourselves with
purses that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does
not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.

the marriage feast, so that they may open to him at once when he comes

"37" = ''':sup:`37` Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he
comes; truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them sit at
table, and he will come and serve them.

"38" = ''':sup:`38` If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them
so, blessed are those servants!

"39" = ''':sup:`39` But know this, that if the householder had known at what hour the
thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into.

"40" = ''':sup:`40` You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an
unexpected hour."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"

"42" = ''':sup:`42` And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom
his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of
food at the proper time?

"43" = ''':sup:`43` Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so
doing.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.

"45" = ''':sup:`45` But if that servant says to himself, `My master is delayed in
coming,' and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and
to eat and drink and get drunk,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not
expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will punish him, and
put him with the unfaithful.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And that servant who knew his master's will, but did not make ready
or act according to his will, shall receive a severe beating.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` But he who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, shall
receive a light beating. Every one to whom much is given, of him will
much be required; and of him to whom men commit much they will demand
the more.

kindled!

until it is accomplished!

"51" = ''':sup:`51` Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell
you, but rather division;

"52" = ''':sup:`52` for henceforth in one house there will be five divided, three
against two and two against three;

"53" = ''':sup:`53` they will be divided, father against son and son against father,
mother against daughter and daughter against her mother, mother-in-law
against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her
mother-in-law."

"54" = ''':sup:`54` He also said to the multitudes, "When you see a cloud rising in the
west, you say at once, `A shower is coming'; and so it happens.

"55" = ''':sup:`55` And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, `There will be
scorching heat'; and it happens.

"56" = ''':sup:`56` You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth
and sky; but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?

"57" = ''':sup:`57` "And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` As you go with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort
to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the
judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer put you in prison.

copper."
