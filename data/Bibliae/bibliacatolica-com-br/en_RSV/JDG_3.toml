them, that is, all in Israel who had no experience of any war in
Canaan;

the Amorites, the Per'izzites, the Hivites, and the Jeb'usites;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and they took their daughters to themselves for wives, and their own
daughters they gave to their sons; and they served their gods.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD,
forgetting the LORD their God, and serving the Ba'als and the
Ashe'roth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
sold them into the hand of Cu'shan-rishatha'im king of Mesopota'mia;
and the people of Israel served Cu'shan-rishatha'im eight years.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` But when the people of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of

Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amal'ekites, and went
and defeated Israel; and they took possession of the city of palms.

years.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when the people of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up
for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a
left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the
king of Moab.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in
length; and he girded it on his right thigh under his clothes.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a
very fat man.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the
people that carried the tribute.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal,
and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he commanded,
"Silence." And all his attendants went out from his presence.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Ehud came to him, as he was sitting alone in his cool roof
chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he
arose from his seat.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right
thigh, and thrust it into his belly;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over
the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the dirt
came out.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then Ehud went out into the vestibule, and closed the doors of the
roof chamber upon him, and locked them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When he had gone, the servants came; and when they saw that the
doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "He is only
relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And they waited till they were utterly at a loss; but when he still
did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and
opened them; and there lay their lord dead on the floor.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the sculptured
stones, and escaped to Se-i'rah.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of
E'phraim; and the people of Israel went down with him from the hill
country, having him at their head.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he said to them, "Follow after me; for the LORD has given your
enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him, and
seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and allowed not a
man to pass over.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And they killed at that time about ten thousand of the Moabites,
all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.
