"1" = ''':sup:`1` On that day they read from the book of Moses in the hearing of the
people; and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should
ever enter the assembly of God;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` for they did not meet the children of Israel with bread and water,
but hired Balaam against them to curse them -- yet our God turned the
curse into a blessing.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When the people heard the law, they separated from Israel all those
of foreign descent.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now before this, Eli'ashib the priest, who was appointed over the
chambers of the house of our God, and who was connected with Tobi'ah,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` prepared for Tobi'ah a large chamber where they had previously put
the cereal offering, the frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of
grain, wine, and oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites,
singers, and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` While this was taking place I was not in Jerusalem, for in the
thirty-second year of Ar-ta-xerx'es king of Babylon I went to the king.
And after some time I asked leave of the king
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and came to Jerusalem, and I then discovered the evil that Eli'ashib
had done for Tobi'ah, preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the
house of God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And I was very angry, and I threw all the household furniture of
Tobi'ah out of the chamber.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then I gave orders and they cleansed the chambers; and I brought
back thither the vessels of the house of God, with the cereal offering
and the frankincense.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been
given to them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work,
had fled each to his field.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So I remonstrated with the officials and said, "Why is the house of
God forsaken?" And I gathered them together and set them in their
stations.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into
the storehouses.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemi'ah the
priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedai'ah of the Levites, and as their
assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattani'ah, for they were
counted faithful; and their duty was to distribute to their brethren.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` In those days I saw in Judah men treading wine presses on the
sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on asses; and
also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought
into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them on the day when
they sold food.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Men of Tyre also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all
kinds of wares and sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah, and
in Jerusalem.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then I remonstrated with the nobles of Judah and said to them,
"What is this evil thing which you are doing, profaning the sabbath
day?
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all
this evil on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath upon Israel
by profaning the sabbath."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When it began to be dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the
sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that
they should not be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my
servants over the gates, that no burden might be brought in on the
sabbath day.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside
Jerusalem once or twice.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But I warned them and said to them, "Why do you lodge before the
wall? If you do so again I will lay hands on you." From that time on
they did not come on the sabbath.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and
come and guard the gates, to keep the sabbath day holy. Remember this
also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of
thy steadfast love.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod,
Ammon, and Moab;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they
could not speak the language of Judah, but the language of each people.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And I contended with them and cursed them and beat some of them and
pulled out their hair; and I made them take oath in the name of God,
saying, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their
daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among
the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his
God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless foreign women
made even him to sin.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act
treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And one of the sons of Jehoi'ada, the son of Eli'ashib the high
priest, was the son-in-law of Sanbal'lat the Hor'onite; therefore I
chased him from me.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood
and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the
duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and I provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for
the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-3 - The reading from the Book of Moses reveals that the Ammonites
and Moabites were not to be among Israel. The people separated
themselves from foreigners, in obedience to the Law, to preserve the
holiness and identity of God's people (see also Deuteronomy 23:3-5 and
13:4-9 - Nehemiah discovers that Eliashib the priest has allowed
Tobiah, a foreigner, to occupy a chamber in the Temple. Nehemiah
cleanses the Temple and expels Tobiah, reaffirming his zeal for the
2:14-17).
13:10-12 - Nehemiah restores the neglected payment of tithes to the
Levites, ensuring that Temple service is maintained. Faithfulness in
supporting ministers is crucial for continued worship (see also
13:15-18 - Nehemiah rebukes those who were violating the Sabbath by
buying and selling. He takes drastic measures to ensure that the
13:23-27 - Nehemiah confronts the Israelites who had married foreign
women, reminding them of Solomon's negative example. He reinforces the
importance of maintaining the religious and cultural purity of God's
