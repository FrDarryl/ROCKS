in vain.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` "But you, Achior, you Ammonite hireling, who have said these words

ran out of the city to the top of the hill, and all the slingers kept
them from coming up by casting stones at them.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` However, they got under the shelter of the hill and they bound
Achior and left him lying at the foot of the hill, and returned to
their master.

Holofernes, and all that he had said in the presence of the Assyrian
leaders, and all that Holofernes had said so boastfully against the
house of Israel.

and said,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` "O Lord God of heaven, behold their arrogance, and have pity on the
humiliation of our people, and look this day upon the faces of those
who are consecrated to thee."

banquet for the elders; and all that night they called on the God of
Israel for help.
