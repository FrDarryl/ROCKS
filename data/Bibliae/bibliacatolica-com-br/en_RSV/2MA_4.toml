"1" = ''':sup:`1` The previously mentioned Simon, who had informed about the money
against his own country, slandered Onias, saying that it was he who had
incited Heliodorus and had been the real cause of the misfortune.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He dared to designate as a plotter against the government the man
who was the benefactor of the city, the protector of his fellow
countrymen, and a zealot for the laws.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` When his hatred progressed to such a degree that even murders were
committed by one of Simon's approved agents,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Onias recognized that the rivalry was serious and that Apollonius,
the son of Menestheus and governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, was
intensifying the malice of Simon.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he betook himself to the king, not accusing his fellow citizens
but having in view the welfare, both public and private, of all the
people.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For he saw that without the king's attention public affairs could
not again reach a peaceful settlement, and that Simon would not stop
his folly.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Seleucus died and Antiochus who was called Epiphanes succeeded
to the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias obtained the high priesthood
by corruption,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` promising the king at an interview three hundred and sixty talents
of silver and, from another source of revenue, eighty talents.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` In addition to this he promised to pay one hundred and fifty more if
permission were given to establish by his authority a gymnasium and a
body of youth for it, and to enrol the men of Jerusalem as citizens of
Antioch.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When the king assented and Jason came to office, he at once shifted
his countrymen over to the Greek way of life.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He set aside the existing royal concessions to the Jews, secured
through John the father of Eupolemus, who went on the mission to
establish friendship and alliance with the Romans; and he destroyed the
lawful ways of living and introduced new customs contrary to the law.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For with alacrity he founded a gymnasium right under the citadel,
and he induced the noblest of the young men to wear the Greek hat.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` There was such an extreme of Hellenization and increase in the
adoption of foreign ways because of the surpassing wickedness of Jason,
who was ungodly and no high priest,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` that the priests were no longer intent upon their service at the
altar. Despising the sanctuary and neglecting the sacrifices, they
hastened to take part in the unlawful proceedings in the wrestling
arena after the call to the discus,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` disdaining the honors prized by their fathers and putting the
highest value upon Greek forms of prestige.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For this reason heavy disaster overtook them, and those whose ways
of living they admired and wished to imitate completely became their
enemies and punished them.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For it is no light thing to show irreverence to the divine laws --
a fact which later events will make clear.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When the quadrennial games were being held at Tyre and the king was
present,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` the vile Jason sent envoys, chosen as being Antiochian citizens
from Jerusalem, to carry three hundred silver drachmas for the
sacrifice to Hercules. Those who carried the money, however, thought
best not to use it for sacrifice, because that was inappropriate, but
to expend it for another purpose.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So this money was intended by the sender for the sacrifice to
Hercules, but by the decision of its carriers it was applied to the
construction of triremes.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent to Egypt for the
coronation of Philometor as king, Antiochus learned that Philometor had
become hostile to his government, and he took measures for his own
security. Therefore upon arriving at Joppa he proceeded to Jerusalem.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He was welcomed magnificently by Jason and the city, and ushered in
with a blaze of torches and with shouts. Then he marched into
Phoenicia.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` After a period of three years Jason sent Menelaus, the brother of
the previously mentioned Simon, to carry the money to the king and to
complete the records of essential business.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But he, when presented to the king, extolled him with an air of
authority, and secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding
Jason by three hundred talents of silver.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` After receiving the king's orders he returned, possessing no
qualification for the high priesthood, but having the hot temper of a
cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage wild beast.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So Jason, who after supplanting his own brother was supplanted by
another man, was driven as a fugitive into the land of Ammon.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Menelaus held the office, but he did not pay regularly any of
the money promised to the king.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When Sostratus the captain of the citadel kept requesting payment,
for the collection of the revenue was his responsibility, the two of
them were summoned by the king on account of this issue.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Menelaus left his own brother Lysimachus as deputy in the high
priesthood, while Sostratus left Crates, the commander of the Cyprian
troops.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` While such was the state of affairs, it happened that the people of
Tarsus and of Mallus revolted because their cities had been given as a
present to Antiochis, the king's concubine.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So the king went hastily to settle the trouble, leaving Andronicus,
a man of high rank, to act as his deputy.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But Menelaus, thinking he had obtained a suitable opportunity,
stole some of the gold vessels of the temple and gave them to
Andronicus; other vessels, as it happened, he had sold to Tyre and the
neighboring cities.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` When Onias became fully aware of these acts he publicly exposed
them, having first withdrawn to a place of sanctuary at Daphne near
Antioch.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Therefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus aside, urged him to kill
Onias. Andronicus came to Onias, and resorting to treachery offered him
sworn pledges and gave him his right hand, and in spite of his
suspicion persuaded Onias to come out from the place of sanctuary;
then, with no regard for justice, he immediately put him out of the
way.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` For this reason not only Jews, but many also of other nations, were
grieved and displeased at the unjust murder of the man.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` When the king returned from the region of Cilicia, the Jews in the
city appealed to him with regard to the unreasonable murder of Onias,
and the Greeks shared their hatred of the crime.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Therefore Antiochus was grieved at heart and filled with pity, and
wept because of the moderation and good conduct of the deceased;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and inflamed with anger, he immediately stripped off the purple
robe from Andronicus, tore off his garments, and led him about the
whole city to that very place where he had committed the outrage
against Onias, and there he dispatched the bloodthirsty fellow. The
Lord thus repaid him with the punishment he deserved.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` When many acts of sacrilege had been committed in the city by
Lysimachus with the connivance of Menelaus, and when report of them had
spread abroad, the populace gathered against Lysimachus, because many
of the gold vessels had already been stolen.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And since the crowds were becoming aroused and filled with anger,
Lysimachus armed about three thousand men and launched an unjust
attack, under the leadership of a certain Auranus, a man advanced in
years and no less advanced in folly.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` But when the Jews became aware of Lysimachus' attack, some picked
up stones, some blocks of wood, and others took handfuls of the ashes
that were lying about, and threw them in wild confusion at Lysimachus
and his men.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` As a result, they wounded many of them, and killed some, and put
them all to flight; and the temple robber himself they killed close by
the treasury.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Charges were brought against Menelaus about this incident.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` When the king came to Tyre, three men sent by the senate presented
the case before him.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But Menelaus, already as good as beaten, promised a substantial
bribe to Ptolemy son of Dorymenes to win over the king.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Therefore Ptolemy, taking the king aside into a colonnade as if for
refreshment, induced the king to change his mind.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Menelaus, the cause of all the evil, he acquitted of the charges
against him, while he sentenced to death those unfortunate men, who
would have been freed uncondemned if they had pleaded even before
Scythians.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And so those who had spoken for the city and the villages and the
holy vessels quickly suffered the unjust penalty.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Therefore even the Tyrians, showing their hatred of the crime,
provided magnificently for their funeral.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` But Menelaus, because of the cupidity of those in power, remained
in office, growing in wickedness, having become the chief plotter
against his fellow citizens.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodap√©:
4:7-10 - Under the rule of Antiochus Epiphanes, Jason bribes the king
to become high priest, illustrating the corruption of religious
leadership. The exchange of spiritual values for political interests
4:11-13 - Jason promotes Hellenistic culture, leading the people away
from God's Law. The Jews' adoption of pagan practices demonstrates the
struggle between faithfulness to God and external cultural influence
4:14-17 - The neglect of the temple and worship by the priests reveals
internal apostasy. This reflects how religious corruption can lead to
the destruction of the faith and identity of God's people (see also
4:23-26 - Menelaus replaces Jason as high priest through further
bribery. This cycle of betrayal and corruption shows the fragility of
leadership without true reverence for God (see also 1 Kings 21:1-16 and
4:32-35 - Onias is murdered on Menelaus' orders, reflecting the
violence that arises when leadership is corrupted. Innocent blood cries
23:35).
