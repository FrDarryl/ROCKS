"1" = ''':sup:`1` And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that
they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in
David.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Jonathan told David, "Saul my father seeks to kill you;
therefore take heed to yourself in the morning, stay in a secret place
and hide yourself;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you
are, and I will speak to my father about you; and if I learn anything I
will tell you."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to
him, "Let not the king sin against his servant David; because he has
not sinned against you, and because his deeds have been of good service
to you;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` for he took his life in his hand and he slew the Philistine, and the
LORD wrought a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced;
why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without
cause?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan; Saul swore, "As the
LORD lives, he shall not be put to death."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all these things.
And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as
before.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the
Philistines, and made a great slaughter among them, so that they fled
before him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul, as he sat in his
house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing the lyre.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he
eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled,
and escaped.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` That night Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, that
he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him,
"If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So Michal let David down through the window; and he fled away and
escaped.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of
goats' hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is
sick."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up
to me in the bed, that I may kill him."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when the messengers came in, behold, the image was in the bed,
with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me thus, and let my
enemy go, so that he has escaped?" And Michal answered Saul, "He said
to me, `Let me go; why should I kill you?'"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah, and
told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and
dwelt at Nai'oth.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And it was told Saul, "Behold, David is at Nai'oth in Ramah."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the
company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over
them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also
prophesied.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also
prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they
also prophesied.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is
in Secu; and he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" And one said,
"Behold, they are at Nai'oth in Ramah."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And he went from there to Nai'oth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God
came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied, until he came to
Nai'oth in Ramah.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before
Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Hence it is
said, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"

Notas de rodap√©:
19:1-7 - Jonathan intercedes for David, convincing Saul not to kill
him. Jonathan's loyalty, even before his father, is an example of true
friendship and fidelity to God's plan. This relationship illustrates
how God can use human alliances to protect His servants (see also
19:8-10 - Despite his promise to Jonathan, Saul again tries to kill
David. Saul's continued pursuit reveals the depth of his rebellion and
the growing paranoia that consumes him. David, however, continues to
22:1).
19:11-12 - Michal helps David escape Saul's assassination attempt. She
deceives the king's messengers, demonstrating that God can use even
those close to the enemy to protect his chosen ones (see also
19:18-20 - David flees to Ramah and takes refuge with the prophet
Samuel. Samuel's protection symbolizes God's prophetic intervention in
David's life, highlighting the role of prophets as guardians of the
divine covenant (see also 1 Kings 19:9-10 and 2 Kings 6:8-12).
19:21-24 - When Saul attempts to capture David, God's Spirit causes him
and his messengers to prophesy, thwarting their evil plans. This shows
that God can disarm even the greatest enemies and use situations to
4:28-30).
