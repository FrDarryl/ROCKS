"1" = ''':sup:`1` Josi'ah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in the
ways of David his father; and he did not turn aside to the right or to
the left.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a boy, he
began to seek the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he
began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Ashe'rim,
and the graven and the molten images.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And they broke down the altars of the Ba'als in his presence; and he
hewed down the incense altars which stood above them; and he broke in
pieces the Ashe'rim and the graven and the molten images, and he made
dust of them and strewed it over the graves of those who had sacrificed
to them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged
Judah and Jerusalem.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And in the cities of Manas'seh, E'phraim, and Simeon, and as far as
Naph'tali, in their ruins round about,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` he broke down the altars, and beat the Ashe'rim and the images into
powder, and hewed down all the incense altars throughout all the land
of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land
and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azali'ah, and Ma-asei'ah the
governor of the city, and Jo'ah the son of Jo'ahaz, the recorder, to
repair the house of the LORD his God.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` They came to Hilki'ah the high priest and delivered the money that
had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers
of the threshold, had collected from Manas'seh and E'phraim and from
all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` They delivered it to the workmen who had the oversight of the house
of the LORD; and the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD
gave it for repairing and restoring the house.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried
stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings which the
kings of Judah had let go to ruin.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and
Obadi'ah the Levites, of the sons of Merar'i, and Zechari'ah and
Meshul'lam, of the sons of the Ko'hathites, to have oversight. The
Levites, all who were skilful with instruments of music,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` were over the burden bearers and directed all who did work in every
kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes, and officials,
and gatekeepers.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into
the house of the LORD, Hilki'ah the priest found the book of the law of
the LORD given through Moses.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Hilki'ah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the book
of the law in the house of the LORD"; and Hilki'ah gave the book to
Shaphan.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the
king, "All that was committed to your servants they are doing.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the
LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the
workmen."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilki'ah the priest has
given me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` When the king heard the words of the law he rent his clothes.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the king commanded Hilki'ah, Ahi'kam the son of Shaphan, Abdon
the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asai'ah the king's
servant, saying,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in
Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been
found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us,
because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according
to all that is written in this book."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Hilki'ah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the
prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah,
keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second
Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: `Tell
the man who sent you to me,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and
upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which
was read before the king of Judah.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other
gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their
hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out upon this place and will
not be quenched.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus
shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding
the words which you have heard,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` because your heart was penitent and you humbled yourself before God
when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and
you have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes and
wept before me, I also have heard you, says the LORD.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be
gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the
evil which I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.'" And they
brought back word to the king.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah
and Jerusalem.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And the king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites,
all the people both great and small; and he read in their hearing all
the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house
of the LORD.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the
LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to
perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin
stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the
covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Josi'ah took away all the abominations from all the territory
that belonged to the people of Israel, and made all who were in Israel
serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not turn away from
following the LORD the God of their fathers.
