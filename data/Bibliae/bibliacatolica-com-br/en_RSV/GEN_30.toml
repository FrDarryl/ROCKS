'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to
meet him, and said, "You must come in to me; for I have hired you with

that I may go to my own home and country.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and
let me go; for you know the service which I have given you."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But Laban said to him, "If you will allow me to say so, I have
learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` name your wages, and I will give it."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jacob said to him, "You yourself know how I have served you, and
how your cattle have fared with me.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For you had little before I came, and it has increased abundantly;
and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I
provide for my own household also?"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He said, "What shall I give you?" Jacob said, "You shall not give
me anything; if you will do this for me, I will again feed your flock
and keep it:
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every
speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb, and the spotted and
speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to look into
my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the
goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be counted
stolen."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Laban said, "Good! Let it be as you have said."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But that day Laban removed the he-goats that were striped and
spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every
one that had white on it, and every lamb that was black, and put them
in charge of his sons;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and he set a distance of three days' journey between himself and
Jacob; and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flock.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane, and
peeled white streaks in them, exposing the white of the rods.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the
runnels, that is, the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink.
And since they bred when they came to drink,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` the flocks bred in front of the rods and so the flocks brought
forth striped, speckled, and spotted.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks
toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put
his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock.
'''

rods in the runnels before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed
among the rods,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` but for the feebler of the flock he did not lay them there; so the
