"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the first year of Belshaz'zar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream
and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the
dream, and told the sum of the matter.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Daniel said, "I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four
winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one
another.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked
its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and
made to stand upon two feet like a man; and the mind of a man was given
to it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised
up on one side; it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and
it was told, `Arise, devour much flesh.'
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` After this I looked, and lo, another, like a leopard, with four
wings of a bird on its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion
was given to it.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast,
terrible and dreadful and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron
teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with
its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it; and
it had ten horns.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another
horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked
up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a
man, and a mouth speaking great things.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` As I looked, thrones were placed and one that was ancient of days
took his seat; his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head
like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, its wheels were burning
fire.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; a thousand
thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him; the court sat in judgment, and the books were opened.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I looked then because of the sound of the great words which the
horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was slain, and its body
destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but
their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven
there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days
and was presented before him.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And to him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, that all
peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an
everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one
that shall not be destroyed.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "As for me, Daniel, my spirit within me was anxious and the visions
of my head alarmed me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth
concerning all this. So he told me, and made known to me the
interpretation of the things.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` `These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the
earth.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and
possess the kingdom for ever, for ever and ever.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast,
which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrible, with its
teeth of iron and claws of bronze; and which devoured and broke in
pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other
horn which came up and before which three of them fell, the horn which
had eyes and a mouth that spoke great things, and which seemed greater
than its fellows.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` As I looked, this horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over
them,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the
saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints received the
kingdom.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "Thus he said: `As for the fourth beast, there shall be a fourth
kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and
it shall devour the whole earth, and trample it down, and break it to
pieces.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings shall arise,
and another shall arise after them; he shall be different from the
former ones, and shall put down three kings.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the
saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the
law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, two times, and
half a time.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be
taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms
under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of
the Most High; their kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all
dominions shall serve and obey them.'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` "Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts
greatly alarmed me, and my color changed; but I kept the matter in my
mind."
