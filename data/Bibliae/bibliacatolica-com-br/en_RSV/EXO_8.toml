country with frogs;

"3" = ''':sup:`3` the Nile shall swarm with frogs which shall come up into your house,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` And the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, `Stretch out your hand
with your rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and
cause frogs to come upon the land of Egypt!'"

"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the magicians did the same by their secret arts, and brought
frogs upon the land of Egypt.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat the LORD to
take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the
people go to sacrifice to the LORD."

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Moses said to Pharaoh, "Be pleased to command me when I am to

"11" = ''':sup:`11` The frogs shall depart from you and your houses and your servants

"12" = ''':sup:`12` So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried to the
LORD concerning the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; the frogs died out
of the houses and courtyards and out of the fields.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his
heart, and would not listen to them; as the LORD had said.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to Aaron, `Stretch out your rod
and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout
all the land of Egypt.'"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
struck the dust of the earth, and there came gnats on man and beast;
all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of
Egypt.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The magicians tried by their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but
they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But
Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the
LORD had said.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then the LORD said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning and wait

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
of flies on you and your servants and your people, and into your
houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with swarms of
flies, and also the ground on which they stand.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my
people dwell, so that no swarms of flies shall be there; that you may
know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thus I will put a division between my people and your people. By
tomorrow shall this sign be."'"
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And the LORD did so; there came great swarms of flies into the
house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses, and in all the land of
Egypt the land was ruined by reason of the flies.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to
your God within the land."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But Moses said, "It would not be right to do so; for we shall
sacrifice to the LORD our God offerings abominable to the Egyptians. If
we sacrifice offerings abominable to the Egyptians before their eyes,
will they not stone us?

"27" = ''':sup:`27` We must go three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to
the LORD our God as he will command us."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, to sacrifice to the LORD your
God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make
entreaty for me."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then Moses said, "Behold, I am going out from you and I will pray
to the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his
servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal
falsely again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And the LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of flies
from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and did not let the
people go.
