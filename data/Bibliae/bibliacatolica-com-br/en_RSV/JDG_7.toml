"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Jerubba'al (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with
him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of
Mid'ian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` The LORD said to Gideon, "The people with you are too many for me to
give the Mid'ianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves
against me, saying, `My own hand has delivered me.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, `Whoever
is fearful and trembling, let him return home.'" And Gideon tested
them; twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many; take
them down to the water and I will test them for you there; and he of
whom I say to you, `This man shall go with you,' shall go with you; and
any of whom I say to you, `This man shall not go with you,' shall not
go."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he brought the people down to the water; and the LORD said to
Gideon, "Every one that laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps,
you shall set by himself; likewise every one that kneels down to
drink."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the number of those that lapped, putting their hands to their
mouths, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people knelt
down to drink water.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And the LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped
I will deliver you, and give the Mid'ianites into your hand; and let
all the others go every man to his home."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So he took the jars of the people from their hands, and their
trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but
retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Mid'ian was below him
in the valley.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` That same night the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the
camp; for I have given it into your hand.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But if you fear to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your
servant;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be
strengthened to go down against the camp." Then he went down with Purah
his servant to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the Mid'ianites and the Amal'ekites and all the people of the
East lay along the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels
were without number, as the sand which is upon the seashore for
multitude.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade;
and he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream; and lo, a cake of barley bread
tumbled into the camp of Mid'ian, and came to the tent, and struck it
so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of
Gideon the son of Jo'ash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has given
Mid'ian and all the host."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation,
he worshiped; and he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, "Arise;
for the LORD has given the host of Mid'ian into your hand."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put
trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches
inside the jars.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise; when I come to
the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the
trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, `For the LORD
and for Gideon.'"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the
outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they
had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars
that were in their hands.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars,
holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the
trumpets to blow; and they cried, "A sword for the LORD and for
Gideon!"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They stood every man in his place round about the camp, and all the
army ran; they cried out and fled.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When they blew the three hundred trumpets, the LORD set every man's
sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as
far as Beth-shit'tah toward Zer'erah, as far as the border of
A'bel-meho'lah, by Tabbath.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the men of Israel were called out from Naph'tali and from Asher
and from all Manas'seh, and they pursued after Mid'ian.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of
E'phraim, saying, "Come down against the Mid'ianites and seize the
waters against them, as far as Beth-bar'ah, and also the Jordan." So
all the men of E'phraim were called out, and they seized the waters as
far as Beth-bar'ah, and also the Jordan.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And they took the two princes of Mid'ian, Oreb and Zeeb; they
killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press
of Zeeb, as they pursued Mid'ian; and they brought the heads of Oreb
and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
