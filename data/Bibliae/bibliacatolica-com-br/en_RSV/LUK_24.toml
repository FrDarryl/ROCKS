[24]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the
tomb, taking the spices which they had prepared.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` but when they went in they did not find the body.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them
in dazzling apparel;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the
men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men,
and be crucified, and on the third day rise."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And they remembered his words,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and returning from the tomb they told all this to the eleven and to
all the rest.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now it was Mary Mag'dalene and Jo-an'na and Mary the mother of
James and the other women with them who told this to the apostles;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not
believe them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` That very day two of them were going to a village named Emma'us,
about seven miles from Jerusalem,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and talking with each other about all these things that had
happened.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew
near and went with them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he said to them, "What is this conversation which you are
holding with each other as you walk?" And they stood still, looking
sad.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then one of them, named Cle'opas, answered him, "Are you the only
visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened
there in these days?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he said to them, "What things?" And they said to him,
"Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and
word before God and all the people,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be
condemned to death, and crucified him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and
besides all this, it is now the third day since this happened.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the
tomb early in the morning
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and did not find his body; and they came back saying that they had
even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just
as the women had said; but him they did not see."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And he said to them, "O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe
all that the prophets have spoken!
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and
enter into his glory?"
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to
them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He
appeared to be going further,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` but they constrained him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward
evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed, and
broke it, and gave it to them.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished
out of their sight.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while
he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?"
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem; and they
found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them,
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` who said, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known
to them in the breaking of the bread.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a
spirit.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And he said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do questionings
rise in your hearts?
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see;
for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to
them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` and he took it and ate before them.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Then he said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to you,
while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law
of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ should
suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in
his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` You are witnesses of these things.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in
the city, until you are clothed with power from on high."
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he
blessed them.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into
heaven.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` And they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` and were continually in the temple blessing God.
