"1" = ''':sup:`1` These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with
Jacob, each with his household:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Is'sachar, Zeb'ulun, and Benjamin,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Dan and Naph'tali, Gad and Asher.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already
in Egypt.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the descendants of Israel were fruitful and increased greatly;
they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong; so that the land was
filled with them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he said to his people, "Behold, the people of Israel are too
many and too mighty for us.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if
war befall us, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape
from the land."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy
burdens; and they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Ra-am'ses.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the
more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people
of Israel.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So they made the people of Israel serve with rigor,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick,
and in all kinds of work in the field; in all their work they made them
serve with rigor.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was
named Shiph'rah and the other Pu'ah,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon
the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a
daughter, she shall live."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt
commanded them, but let the male children live.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So the king of Egypt called the midwives, and said to them, "Why
have you done this, and let the male children live?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women are not
like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and are delivered before
the midwife comes to them."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and
grew very strong.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And because the midwives feared God he gave them families.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, "Every son that is born to
the Hebrews you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every
daughter live."
