men.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I gathered them to the river that runs to Aha'va, and there we
encamped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found
there none of the sons of Levi.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then I sent for Elie'zer, Ar'i-el, Shemai'ah, Elna'than, Jarib,
Elna'than, Nathan, Zechari'ah, and Meshul'lam, leading men, and for
Joi'arib and Elna'than, who were men of insight,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphi'a,
telling them what to say to Iddo and his brethren the temple servants
at the place Casiphi'a, namely, to send us ministers for the house of
our God.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of
discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely
Sherebi'ah with his sons and kinsmen, eighteen;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` also Hashabi'ah and with him Jeshai'ah of the sons of Merar'i, with
his kinsmen and their sons, twenty;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` besides two hundred and twenty of the temple servants, whom David
and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all
mentioned by name.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Aha'va, that we might
humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for
ourselves, our children, and all our goods.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and
horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way; since we had told
the king, "The hand of our God is for good upon all that seek him, and
the power of his wrath is against all that forsake him."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he listened to our
entreaty.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebi'ah,
Hashabi'ah, and ten of their kinsmen with them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels,
the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors
and his lords and all Israel there present had offered;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of
silver, and silver vessels worth a hundred talents, and a hundred
talents of gold,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` twenty bowls of gold worth a thousand darics, and two vessels of
fine bright bronze as precious as gold.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are
holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD,
the God of your fathers.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief
priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at
Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver
and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house
of our God.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then we departed from the river Aha'va on the twelfth day of the
first month, to go to Jerusalem; the hand of our God was upon us, and
he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the
way.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the
gold and the vessels were weighed into the hands of Mer'emoth the
priest, son of Uri'ah, and with him was Elea'zar the son of Phin'ehas,
and with them were the Levites, Jo'zabad the son of Jeshua and
No-adi'ah the son of Bin'nui.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was
recorded.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned
exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for
all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering
twelve he-goats; all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps
and to the governors of the province Beyond the River; and they aided
the people and the house of God.
