Notas de rodap√©:
35:1-9 - God declares judgment against Edom, which rejoiced at Israel's
destruction. Edom represents God's enemies, and Edom's fall symbolizes
35:10-15 - God promises to completely destroy Edom, showing that He
repays according to the actions of the nations. God's justice is
impartial, and those who harm His people will experience His judgment
