"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Eli'sha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and
said to him, "Gird up your loins, and take this flask of oil in your
hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And when you arrive, look there for Jehu the son of Jehosh'aphat,
son of Nimshi; and go in and bid him rise from among his fellows, and
lead him to an inner chamber.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, `Thus
says the LORD, I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and
flee; do not tarry."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when he came, behold, the commanders of the army were in
council; and he said, "I have an errand to you, O commander." And Jehu
said, "To which of us all?" And he said, "To you, O commander."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So he arose, and went into the house; and the young man poured the
oil on his head, saying to him, "Thus says the LORD the God of Israel,
I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may
avenge on Jez'ebel the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood
of all the servants of the LORD.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from
Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jerobo'am the
son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba'asha the son of Ahi'jah.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the dogs shall eat Jez'ebel in the territory of Jezreel, and
none shall bury her." Then he opened the door, and fled.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, they said to him,
"Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?" And he said to
them, "You know the fellow and his talk."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And they said, "That is not true; tell us now." And he said, "Thus
and so he spoke to me, saying, `Thus says the LORD, I anoint you king
over Israel.'"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then in haste every man of them took his garment, and put it under
him on the bare steps, and they blew the trumpet, and proclaimed, "Jehu
is king."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thus Jehu the son of Jehosh'aphat the son of Nimshi conspired
against Joram. (Now Joram with all Israel had been on guard at
Ramoth-gilead against Haz'ael king of Syria;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Haz'ael king of
Syria.) So Jehu said, "If this is your mind, then let no one slip out
of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Jehu mounted his chariot, and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay
there. And Ahazi'ah king of Judah had come down to visit Joram.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
the company of Jehu as he came, and said, "I see a company." And Joram
said, "Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, `Is it
peace?'"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So a man on horseback went to meet him, and said, "Thus says the
king, `Is it peace?'" And Jehu said, "What have you to do with peace?
Turn round and ride behind me." And the watchman reported, saying, "The
messenger reached them, but he is not coming back."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them, and said,
"Thus the king has said, `Is it peace?'" And Jehu answered, "What have
you to do with peace? Turn round and ride behind me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Again the watchman reported, "He reached them, but he is not coming
back. And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi;
for he drives furiously."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Joram said, "Make ready." And they made ready his chariot. Then
Joram king of Israel and Ahazi'ah king of Judah set out, each in his
chariot, and went to meet Jehu, and met him at the property of Naboth
the Jezreelite.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" He answered,
"What peace can there be, so long as the harlotries and the sorceries
of your mother Jez'ebel are so many?"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then Joram reined about and fled, saying to Ahazi'ah, "Treachery, O
Ahazi'ah!"
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Jehu drew his bow with his full strength, and shot Joram
between the shoulders, so that the arrow pierced his heart, and he sank
in his chariot.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, "Take him up, and cast him on the
plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when
you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father, how the LORD
uttered this oracle against him:
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` `As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of
his sons -- says the LORD -- I will requite you on this plot of
ground.' Now therefore take him up and cast him on the plot of ground,
in accordance with the word of the LORD."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When Ahazi'ah the king of Judah saw this, he fled in the direction
of Beth-haggan. And Jehu pursued him, and said, "Shoot him also"; and
they shot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam.
And he fled to Megid'do, and died there.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him
in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahazi'ah began to
reign over Judah.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jez'ebel heard of it; and she painted
her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out of the window.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it peace, you Zimri,
murderer of your master?"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, "Who is on my
side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` He said, "Throw her down." So they threw her down; and some of her
blood spattered on the wall and on the horses, and they trampled on
her.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then he went in and ate and drank; and he said, "See now to this
cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the
skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` When they came back and told him, he said, "This is the word of the
LORD, which he spoke by his servant Eli'jah the Tishbite, `In the
territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jez'ebel;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and the corpse of Jez'ebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
field in the territory of Jezreel, so that no one can say, This is
Jez'ebel.'"
