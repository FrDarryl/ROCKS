"1" = ''':sup:`1` At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist, he has been
raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison, for
the sake of Hero'di-as, his brother Philip's wife;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` because John said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people,
because they held him to be a prophet.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Hero'di-as danced
before the company, and pleased Herod,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the
Baptist here on a platter."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he
commanded it to be given;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` he sent and had John beheaded in the prison,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and
she brought it to her mother.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they
went and told Jesus.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a
lonely place apart. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on
foot from the towns.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` As he went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on
them, and healed their sick.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a
lonely place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into
the villages and buy food for themselves."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Jesus said, "They need not go away; you give them something to
eat."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They said to him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he said, "Bring them here to me."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass; and taking the
five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and
broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them
to the crowds.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve
baskets full of the broken pieces left over.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and
children.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to
the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain
by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land,
beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on
the sea.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
terrified, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But immediately he spoke to them, saying, "Take heart, it is I;
have no fear."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on
the water."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the
water and came to Jesus;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` but when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he
cried out, "Lord, save me."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to
him, "O man of little faith, why did you doubt?"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son
of God."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent round to
all that region and brought to him all that were sick,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his
garment; and as many as touched it were made well.
