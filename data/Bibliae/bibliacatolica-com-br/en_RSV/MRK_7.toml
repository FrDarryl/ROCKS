"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now when the Pharisees gathered together to him, with some of the
scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands defiled, that is,
unwashed.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash
their hands, observing the tradition of the elders;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless
they purify themselves; and there are many other traditions which they
observe, the washing of cups and pots and vessels of bronze.)
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples
not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with hands
defiled?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as
it is written, `This people honors me with their lips, but their heart
is far from me;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of
men.'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` You leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of
men."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he said to them, "You have a fine way of rejecting the
commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition!
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother'; and, `He who
speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die';
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` but you say, `If a man tells his father or his mother, What you
would have gained from me is Corban' (that is, given to God) --
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or
mother,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you
hand on. And many such things you do."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he called the people to him again, and said to them, "Hear me,
all of you, and understand:
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile
him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And when he had entered the house, and left the people, his
disciples asked him about the parable.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he said to them, "Then are you also without understanding? Do
you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile
him,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` since it enters, not his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?"
(Thus he declared all foods clean.)
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he said, "What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts,
fornication, theft, murder, adultery,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride,
foolishness.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and
Sidon. And he entered a house, and would not have any one know it; yet
he could not be hid.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But immediately a woman, whose little daughter was possessed by an
unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell down at his feet.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoeni'cian by birth. And she
begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And he said to her, "Let the children first be fed, for it is not
right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But she answered him, "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table
eat the children's crumbs."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And he said to her, "For this saying you may go your way; the demon
has left your daughter."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And she went home, and found the child lying in bed, and the demon
gone.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to
the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decap'olis.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in
his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put his
fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue;
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Eph'phatha,"
that is, "Be opened."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke
plainly.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them,
the more zealously they proclaimed it.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all
things well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."

Notas de rodap√©:
7:1-13 - Jesus confronts the Pharisees about human tradition and true
purity. He teaches that it is not outward actions, but the heart that
counts with God. True worship comes from a sincere and purified heart
7:14-23 - Jesus teaches that what defiles a person is not what goes
into them, but what comes out of their hearts. This statement goes
against the dietary laws and shows that moral impurity comes from human

7:24-30 - The healing of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter
demonstrates the expansion of Jesus' mission beyond Israel. Jesus

genuine faith regardless of background or social status (see also
