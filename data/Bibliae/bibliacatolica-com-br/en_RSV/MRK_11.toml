the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

"2" = ''':sup:`2` and said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately
as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever
sat; untie it and bring it.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` If any one says to you, `Why are you doing this?' say, `The Lord has
need of it and will send it back here immediately.'"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door out in the
open street; and they untied it.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And those who stood there said to them, "What are you doing, untying
the colt?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And they told them what Jesus had said; and they let them go.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it;
and he sat upon it.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy
branches which they had cut from the fields.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And those who went before and those who followed cried out,
"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming! Hosanna
in the highest!"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And he entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple; and when he had
looked round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to
Bethany with the twelve.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he
could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but
leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And
his disciples heard it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to
drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he
overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who
sold pigeons;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and he would not allow any one to carry anything through the
temple.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he taught, and said to them, "Is it not written, `My house
shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have
made it a den of robbers."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to
destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was
astonished at his teaching.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And when evening came they went out of the city.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered
away to its roots.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And Peter remembered and said to him, "Master, look! The fig tree
which you cursed has withered."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, `Be taken up
and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes
that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you
have received it, and it will be yours.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything
against any one; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive
you your trespasses."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the
temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and they said to him, "By what authority are you doing these
things, or who gave you this authority to do them?"
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jesus said to them, "I will ask you a question; answer me, and I
will tell you by what authority I do these things.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men? Answer me."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And they argued with one another, "If we say, `From heaven,' he
will say, `Why then did you not believe him?'
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But shall we say, `From men'?" -- they were afraid of the people,
for all held that John was a real prophet.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them,
"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
