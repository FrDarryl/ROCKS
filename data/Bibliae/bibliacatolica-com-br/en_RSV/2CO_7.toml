"1" = ''':sup:`1` Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from
every defilement of body and spirit, and make holiness perfect in the
fear of God.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Open your hearts to us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no
one, we have taken advantage of no one.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in
our hearts, to die together and to live together.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I have great confidence in you; I have great pride in you; I am
filled with comfort. With all our affliction, I am overjoyed.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For even when we came into Macedo'nia, our bodies had no rest but we
were afflicted at every turn -- fighting without and fear within.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of
Titus,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was
comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your
zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it
(though I did regret it), for I see that that letter grieved you,
though only for a while.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you
were grieved into repenting; for you felt a godly grief, so that you
suffered no loss through us.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation and
brings no regret, but worldly grief produces death.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, what
eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what
longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved
yourselves guiltless in the matter.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who
did the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in
order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of
God.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Therefore we are comforted. And besides our own comfort we rejoiced
still more at the joy of Titus, because his mind has been set at rest
by you all.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For if I have expressed to him some pride in you, I was not put to
shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting
before Titus has proved true.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And his heart goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the
obedience of you all, and the fear and trembling with which you
received him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you.
