"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then the whole company of them arose, and brought him before Pilate.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting
our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying
that he himself is Christ a king."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he
answered him, "You have said so."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no
crime in this man."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But they were urgent, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching
throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he
sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to
see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some
sign done by him.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing
him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked
him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to
Pilate.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day,
for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and
the people,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was
perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I
did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing
deserving death has been done by him;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` I will therefore chastise him and release him."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But they all cried out together, "Away with this man, and release
to us Barab'bas" --
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started
in the city, and for murder.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` but they shouted out, "Crucify, crucify him!"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` A third time he said to them, "Why, what evil has he done? I have
found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him
and release him."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be
crucified. And their voices prevailed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He released the man who had been thrown into prison for
insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up
to their will.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyre'ne, who was
coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it
behind Jesus.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of
women who bewailed and lamented him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But Jesus turning to them said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not
weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For behold, the days are coming when they will say, `Blessed are
the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never
gave suck!'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then they will begin to say to the mountains, `Fall on us'; and to
the hills, `Cover us.'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when
it is dry?"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to
death with him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there
they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the
left.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do." And they cast lots to divide his garments.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him,
saying, "He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of
God, his Chosen One!"
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the
Jews."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, "Are
you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you
are under the same sentence of condemnation?
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our
deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong."
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me
in Paradise."
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` while the sun's light failed; and the curtain of the temple was
torn in two.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into thy hands
I commit my spirit!" And having said this he breathed his last.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God,
and said, "Certainly this man was innocent!"
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they
saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from
Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of
Arimathe'a. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking
for the kingdom of God.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him
in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the
tomb, and how his body was laid;
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the
sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

Notas de rodap√©:
23:1-5 - Jesus is brought before Pilate, and the false charges against
Him are presented. This moment illustrates the injustice Jesus suffered
and His willingness to submit to God's plan of redemption (see also
23:13-25 - Pilate tries to release Jesus, but gives in to pressure from
the crowd and condemns Him to crucifixion. The people's choice of
Barabbas over Jesus reflects human sin and rejection of the Savior (see
23:26-31 - Jesus is taken to be crucified, and He meets the women of
Jerusalem, warning them of Jerusalem's future suffering. He shows
compassion even in the face of His suffering, revealing His love for

help, and Jesus promises him paradise. This demonstrates God's grace,
which offers forgiveness even in the final moments (see also
23:44-49 - Jesus' death is accompanied by cosmic signs and the
centurion's reaction, who recognizes Jesus as the Son of God. Christ's
death, though painful, is a moment of victory over sin and death (see
