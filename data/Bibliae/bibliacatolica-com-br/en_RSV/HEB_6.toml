"1" = ''':sup:`1` Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on
to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead
works and of faith toward God,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` with instruction about ablutions, the laying on of hands, the
resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And this we will do if God permits.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have
once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have
become partakers of the Holy Spirit,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of
the age to come,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` if they then commit apostasy, since they crucify the Son of God on
their own account and hold him up to contempt.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and
brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is
cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to
being cursed; its end is to be burned.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of
better things that belong to salvation.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love
which you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in
realizing the full assurance of hope until the end,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through
faith and patience inherit the promises.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater
by whom to swear, he swore by himself,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Men indeed swear by a greater than themselves, and in all their
disputes an oath is final for confirmation.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the
promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with
an oath,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible
that God should prove false, we who have fled for refuge might have
strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope
that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain,

"20" = ''':sup:`20` where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a
high priest for ever after the order of Melchiz'edek.

"Notes" = '''
Notas de rodapé:
6:1-3 - The author exhorts Christians to advance toward spiritual
maturity by leaving behind elementary principles and seeking the full
knowledge of Christ. Maturity is necessary for a solid Christian life
6:4-6 - The author warns of the danger of apostasy, describing those
who fall away as those who reject God's grace after experiencing it.
6:9-12 - Despite the warning, the author expresses confidence in the
perseverance of his readers and exhorts them to imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit God’s promises (see also
6:13-20 - God's promise to Abraham is used as an example of a sure and
steadfast hope. The hope we have in Christ is an anchor for the soul,
1:2).
